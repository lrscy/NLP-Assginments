To this day, data are being passed on, as if there was nothing wrong, within the SWIFT dossier.
The conclusions of the reports from both the Belgian privacy committee and the European Committee are clear and unanimous: the Belgian and European rules on data protection have clearly been flouted.
In view of the fact that the Belgian courts have now decided not to prosecute SWIFT, and the Belgian Government cannot see any point in continuing those illegal practices, I should like to ask what Europe's response to this is.
Will the Commission now start an infringement procedure against Belgium?
If so, when will this be decided?
If not, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure that the European privacy rules are respected hic et nunc in all Member States, including Belgium?
Finally, at the Council of 15 December, the SWIFT case was also raised by the Belgian Prime Minister who argued in favour of a European approach.
Although I understand from the presidency that the inquiry is still underway, I have a very straightforward question: are the Council, and hence all the Member States, behind the idea of regulating this issue by means of a European instrument?
Mr President, I do not doubt Commissioner Frattini's own personal good faith and commitment to data protection.
But I think the Commission, as well as the Council, are being as feeble about SWIFT privacy abuses as they have been over PNR over the last four years.
This is European data, belonging to European citizens, made available for commercial purposes in Europe under the protection of European data protection law.
But despite the persistent and insistent demands of MEPs, the EU, in the less than robust hands of the Council and Commission, has allowed a large degree of US extra-territorial jurisdiction.
In any global framework for exchange of mass commercial data for security purposes, the EU must forcefully project its own laws and principles.
Commissioner, you say that it is 'unlikely' that SWIFT data have been used in the automated targeting system, which is a profiling exercise assigning a risk score to each individual based on assumptions - and no doubt stereotypes - deriving from their behaviour and characteristics.
But why do you not know categorically, yes or no, whether SWIFT data has been used in ATS?
In relation to PNR, you accept the Department of Homeland Security's assurance that the use of PNR data for profiling complies with the undertakings of the PNR agreement.
But do you agree with the DHS assessment? Yes or no?
The lack of clear answers is undermining trust, and I think that we are owed those clear answers as to the Commission's legal evaluation.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, you did not beat about the bush when you made your commitment to the negotiations known.
Full compliance with the fundamental rights, including privacy, there is no room for any misunderstanding here, and we will keep you to this pledge.
There is, then, little point in 780 MEPs sitting where the negotiators should be; it would not work.
That does, however, mean that the Council must be ambitious in its negotiations, instead of - as I now hear them doing - mainly weighing up the hazards it might meet with along the way.
We assume, however, that your commitment to the negotiations is as firm as Commissioner Frattini's, because we will hold you to that as well.
This is about SWIFT now, and SWIFT not being a bank should not be a licence not to take privacy rules seriously or not to comply with them.
The inquiry you mounted, Commissioner Frattini, is to be welcomed, but you will need to take legal measures promptly in order to fill the vacuum, because data exchange at SWIFT should also be able to stand the test of European privacy rules.
The fight against terror must also be able to look into financial transactions in this framework, because this may well lead to terrorist organisations.
Something that has struck me is that many citizens have much sympathy for the difficult dilemmas we face in this context.
We cannot resolve this overnight.
I am, for example, quite shocked by the fact that there has not been more of a fuss made about the rules on liquids in aircraft.
We should not seize this as an excuse, though.
Tough negotiations are needed.
The suggestion mooted by Mr Radwan to place this in a wider G7 context is something I am happy to endorse.
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none us in this House disputes the fact that there needs to be enhanced prevention of terrorism in the future.
However, the issue inevitably arises of the means to be used in this connection, as well as the issue of the strategies to be adopted.
Undoubtedly, international cooperation and the exchange of data are just as much a part of the process as, on the other hand, legal certainty and the necessary data protection.
As all of us do in this House, I support transatlantic cooperation in this connection.
We must, however, attach importance to seeing a balance maintained between security and the combating of terrorism, on the one hand, and data protection, on the other.
If, moreover, it is now a question of negotiating a new agreement, then this new agreement needs to fulfil certain basic preconditions.
Firstly, personal data needs to be given the same level of protection as has already been achieved in the interim agreement.
Secondly, the airlines must be afforded legal certainty so that the promise to switch over to a push system, enabling us to control which data is delivered to whom and at which juncture, is kept.
The purpose for which the data can be used must also, of course, be laid down so that the data can only, and is only allowed to, be used for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism.
There should also in future be a duty to provide travellers with information in this connection.
I would make one last point, which I do think is important.
In negotiating the new agreement, added value should also be created.
As soon as an act of terrorism is suspected, the US authorities should be obliged to notify the corresponding judicial and police authorities in the Member States, as well as the corresponding EU institutions, namely Europol or Eurojust.
If all this is guaranteed, we shall have available to us a further instrument designed to make EU citizens more secure.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank you most sincerely for the many comments, ideas and of course - whether one likes them or not - the critical remarks.
In a debate, they serve to indicate whether or not one is on the right track and whether it is possible to prevent some state of affairs that was not perhaps right in the past from arising again.
Not only legal protection and legal certainty but also the issue of how we are to combat specific forms of international terrorism are, it is true, unanimously deemed to be important, but we must not in any circumstances play these off against each other.
Where the two areas of PNR and SWIFT are concerned, we face different situations.
In the statement by the Presidency, I again made a point of clearly emphasising cooperation and interchange with the Commission, on the basis of which we wish together to arrive at a legally certain regulation.
This raises many issues to which you have also referred today, including those of how extensive the information is, what access there is to it and what controls need to be exercised by the other party.
Similar issues arise too where the subject of SWIFT is concerned, and in this connection I am again happy to take up Mr Radwan's idea.
Irrespective of whether or not it is at present on the agendas of the G7 or G8 or comes within the area of relations between the European Union and the United States, it is important to address this issue.
There would certainly be no benefit in just moving constantly from one aspect to the next, as what is at issue here is essentially the same.
We are concerned with data protection, with legal certainty and, furthermore, with the form to be taken by the transatlantic partnership, in connection with which we are of the view that partnership is not a one-way street.
It is a question of working with, rather than against, each other.
We need the information concerned, and relations between the European Union and the United States should be such that, in the forthcoming meetings between the two countries, it should be possible to address the issues very clearly, above all with a view to confronting the danger that some of you have described.
I can do no more than say how absolutely right it is to address these issues openly.
When are we to be confronted with the next case in which data is perhaps unsafely accessed?
That is a point that we should like to take up.
Without now going into technical details, I also say that with, specifically, SWIFT in mind.
Where is the data?
Is it here, and would we have the opportunity to put it in order and limit its extent without its being passed on?
Or is the data possibly already available in the USA where, because of the nature of data protection there, it is very easy to access?
The implication in that case, however, is that we have no influence at all.
The question is, however, that of what influence the European Union has on data that is transferred and that is, as it were, ready to be called up elsewhere?
Specifically where SWIFT is concerned, this is certainly a complicated procedure.
All this should, however, give us the opportunity for discussing these matters in depth and for arguing how important it is for us in the European Union to stand for certain values and also to act in defence of those values.
It should also give us the opportunity for arguing how essential it is to maintain the existing balance.
That does not mean that we are always in agreement about the fight against international terrorism. It is just that all these matters have to be balanced out.
Commissioner Frattini did in fact make this very clear in giving precedence not only to people's safety but also to legal protection and to the very high level of data protection such as we do in fact have in the European Union.
I can only assure you that these many facets that you have discussed are also to be included for discussion in the forthcoming negotiations, and in relation not only to PNR but also, of course, to SWIFT.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session.
Since it is time to resume the sitting, there will be no suspension.
I would like to thank the interpreters for their generosity and professionalism; this Parliament could not function without them.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
(PT) There have been months and months of condemnation of the unacceptable transfer of passenger name records by airlines and of personal data by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system to the security and information services of the United States.
Yet, in response to the questions asked here in Parliament, the German Presidency of the Council and the Commission have offered nothing that would result in complete clarification of these matters and an end to this blatant violation of the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees.
Their responses do not contain a single word on the practical measures needed to put an end to these unacceptable, illegal practices, or on demanding full clarification from the US Administration.
Such behaviour is ultimately indicative of the Council's submissive, passive attitude to the USA's blackmail and demands.
I must also mention the attempts by those whose only goal is to benefit from these situations by further applying qualified majority voting in the Council on issues of justice and home affairs.
All measures that, under the guise of the so-called 'war on terror', undermine the citizens' fundamental rights must be rejected outright.
(EL) Both the Commission and the Council have confirmed in their statements that they will continue to satisfy US demands by holding files on all European citizens and handing over their personal data to the US secret security services.
The representatives of the German Presidency and the Commission have not only accepted that the new agreement with the USA on the transmission of the personal data of passengers flying there will not differ from the present agreement; they have also cynically admitted that they are prepared to legalise the SWIFT scandal by laying down so-called principles for the provision of information on financial transactions by European citizens in the USA, so that this will now be legal.
As they clearly stated, they will not commit the cardinal sin of disrupting relations between the EU and the USA.
As far as the protection of fundamental rights, personal data and privacy are concerned, they will try to persuade our 'American friends' to respect them, obviously just as they respect them in Iraq and Afghanistan.
It is crystal clear that the policies of the EU and the USA are identical, are equally reactionary and anti-democratic and are equally dangerous to democratic rights and grass-roots freedoms, using as they do the 'fight against terrorism' as the necessary pretext to limit fundamental rights.
Limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving personal injuries and fatal accidents (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents.
rapporteur. - Mr President, in opening this discussion I would like us to imagine ourselves as one of those people we represent, perhaps off on holiday to another European country or a young person off to study somewhere else, or somebody off to a business meeting in another European capital, or even to work on a building site.
All of these are simple everyday scenarios that sadly contain the potential for mishaps, for accidents involving personal injury or even death in another country.
Let me also give you some figures by way of example: in 2004 alone in Germany, just one of our 27 Member States, there were 50 000 road traffic accidents involving personal injury and a foreign national from another European country.
In the UK last year, one firm of lawyers alone reported opening some 6000 files on cross-border personal injury accidents in Europe.
Well, you might say, let the lawyers get on with it.
But the lawyers have come to us with a problem.
All legal actions are subject to a period of time within which they have to be commenced, a so-called limitation period.
All good lawyers are training in their national system to observe and watch these time limits very carefully. Otherwise the whole claim is dead, finished, struck out.
It is one of the nightmares of every young lawyer to miss a limitation period deadline.
Of course, they all know their own, but can they be expected to know the intricacies of 27 national systems?
And there are intricacies, sometimes involving differing definitions of what is a civil or criminal claim.
More importantly, the time limit itself varies tremendously, between one and thirty years across the European Union.
It is bad enough to be an accident victim in another Member State.
But then to fall a secondary victim to a technical difficulty over limitation periods which then stop any claim being made is, as we say in English, really a case of adding insult to injury.
This is a real, practical and growing problem as we encourage free movement of persons.
I hope that the very limited numbers I have been able to quote give an idea of the problem which in reality must be multiplied many times across the Member States of the Union.
As I have stated above, legal practitioners, insurers and victims alike have come to us with this problem asking that we approach you, Commissioner, to look at a range of possibilities.
We know the issue is sensitive.
It concerns national procedural law, so any intervention at European level should be strictly limited to the cross-border cases only.
It may be that for these cases a harmonised limitation period of say four years might be considered, or maybe we should adopt clear conflict of laws rules.
Whatever the shape of the ultimate solution, practitioners and claimants alike need certainty if valuable and personally critical claims are not to be in danger of being lost because of differing procedural rules that can really cause individual and family misery if things go awry.
This is a practical problem arising out of the use by our citizens of free movement and all that the internal market offers.
On our side we should be prepared to respond with a system of European civil justice which does not, as I have said earlier, just add insult to injury.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will feel able to respond to this initiative which has been the subject of a good deal of positive lobbying from citizens and others towards Members during the weeks leading up to this debate.
Vice-President of the Commission. I think this report is a very interesting attempt to deal with a very difficult subject.
Mrs Wallis is to be congratulated on trying to see a way into a general European solution to the differences in limitation periods as they relate, as she just said, to actions for damages for personal injury and death.
This is of particular concern to citizens who have the misfortune to suffer road traffic accidents in countries other than those in which they live.
But it could also apply in other matters, such as medical claims and product liability.
Having said that, the area of limitation is a complex matter, as the rapporteur also acknowledged.
It is very closely linked to prescription, which is not dealt with in the report.
Any further work on the subject would need to deal with prescription, since the majority of European legal systems solve the problem of time limits through the use of prescription rather than limitation periods.
The UK system uses both.
I am ready, I am open to examining this question in the future, taking into account the different legal nature of limitation and prescription, and the fact that the Treaty base proposed excludes harmonisation of internal law, which, in large measure, is what is implied by the report.
I have to be very frank in pointing out that we will also have to take into account the priorities established in our current work programme, which will also have to be integrated in line with the human resources available in the European Commission.
That said, I can see that this very new point put by the rapporteur should be left open for further discussions.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur has done excellent work with this report. There is much to applaud in this initiative.
This, like our rapporteur said, is a practical solution to a practical problem.
For one, it concerns one of the unfinished areas of the single market: how people's rights travel with them when they exercise their four freedoms inside the Union.
The European Parliament must point out any anomalies and invoke its Treaty rights to prompt the Commission into action.
Secondly, it concerns justice and home affairs.
People need as much certainty as possible about their rights and obligations in order to engage in any society.
Engaging across borders in always going to be more uncertain than doing so at home but we have a duty as EU legislators to address these concerns.
The mere fact that the disparate national laws do not allow for a quick uniform solution is no excuse for inaction.
The European Parliament is doing its part by opening the debate today.
The Commission should follow with a proposal and the Member States should assume their sovereign responsibility and enact the necessary changes, employing the passerelle clause of the Nice Treaty if needed.
However, we have to be careful how we approach this.
While my group strongly supports the report of Mrs Wallis, we cannot support her amendments to it.
We believe it is too early in this report to point towards overly-harmonised and specific definitions of, for example, date of knowledge, interrupted proceedings, and special rights of minors.
We do not believe them to be fully consistent at this stage with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Let us first hear about the Commission's inquiry as to what kinds of cross-border problems exist in the domain of limitation periods in cases of personal injury and then move on to the concrete definitions.
For example, if the inquiry were to show that there is not such a huge discrepancy between Member States' rules, the country of origin approach, as the report suggests, might show the way.
Personally I would support this approach.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) I shall speak in Spanish, and this is the first speech in Spanish, but I believe that the Commissioner understands my language perfectly.
I would like to point out that the Castilian version of the report says 'recomendaciones destinadas a la ComisiÃ³n sobre la prescripciÃ³n en conflictos transfronterizos'.
In other words, it does not use the phrase 'estatuto de limitaciones', because, according to my knowledge of Anglo-Saxon law, the expression 'statute of limitations', at least in Spanish, is translated as 'prescripciÃ³n'.
I know that the Italians are very sharp and precise lawyers, and this issue probably deserves to be discussed in greater depth, although I agree that the origins of the two institutions differ.
In any event, I believe that Mrs Wallis's report reflects the European Parliament's desire to push the Commission in a certain direction.
Neither we nor the report are asking the Commission to present a legislative proposal quickly, but I believe that certain stages such as the one indicated in paragraph1, which states that an investigation into what is happening is needed should be carried out.
As Mrs Wallis has said, there are currently thousands of people, or hundreds of thousands of people, crossing national borders, and I believe that Mr Frattini was right on another issue, and that is that we should not just focus on cross-border accidents or incidents, but on all of those cases in which, as a result of a series of situations - such as medical treatment or accommodation - a person suffers damages in one country and the problem of limitations arises in another country.
I believe that we should extend the possibilities as far as possible and that for the moment - and perhaps Mrs Kauppi is right - it is probably not yet time to go into details, but the Commission should at least be aware that we elected representatives of the peoples of the European Union believe that it should adopt certain kinds of initiative in relation to this issue.
As the rapporteur proposes, this kind of initiative should begin with acquiring proper knowledge of the situation, so that we have a true picture of that situation and of the possibilities available to us for legislating in this field.
When the House comes to vote on this, it may perhaps be worth noting the problems arising from the various language versions.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for taking this initiative aimed at harmonising the rules on commencement of running time and limitation periods for claims relating to property and personal injury in cross-border disputes.
Road travel has increased significantly of late, partly due to the various enlargements of the European Union, and also to people becoming more affluent and being able to travel freely.
Unfortunately, this has resulted in more people being involved in road accidents.
At present, under national civil systems, limitation periods vary from the very short, such as one year, to the very long, such as 30 years.
This is not helpful for the protection of the injured parties, who are often unaware of the variations in limitation periods in various countries and submit claims for damages to foreign courts after the expiry of the relevant period.
What happens then is that the court rejects the application and the individuals, whose health or property has been affected, are unable to assert their rights.
Harmonisation would help with the introduction of reliable and transparent principles, which would allow claims to be asserted by both the injured parties and by their legal representatives.
As a lawyer myself, I am well aware of the situation the latter can find themselves in.
That is why I fully support this initiative.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis very much for the work she has undertaken.
In particular, I recall the special meetings she arranged for the Committee on Legal Affairs, enabling us to fully understand the task before us, which is of great significance for all European Union citizens.
I cannot agree with the Commissioner that the simple explanation for the delay and postponement of this legislative initiative lies in the formal inability to interfere in national legal systems.
Whenever I take the floor in this House, and the opportunity arises, I stress that the fundamental duty of every parliament and every institution with legislative power is to create simple legislation that is readily understandable and serves the citizens' interests.
In other words, it is incumbent on us to create legislation that makes the citizens' lives easier.
At present, there are 27 different legal systems to deal with with regard to limitation periods for pecuniary claims related to different types of accident.
It is therefore the duty of the European Parliament, the European Commission and also of the Council to find a way of rectifying the situation and creating new legislation that would make life easier.
It is difficult to explain to a claimant or to a deceased person's family that, formally, the case has long since been closed, and that all we can do is to commiserate with them because all claims submitted after the expiry of the limitation period have to be rejected.
I therefore appeal to the European Commission and ask it to use all the means at its disposal and all its legislative competence to find a legal solution to this problem.
I am firmly convinced that the individual Member States believe that this matter, which affects hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of European citizens, must be resolved quickly and appropriately.
If it is our intention that European Union citizens should pursue activities that involve moving between countries, we must come up with solutions that make it easier for them to do so.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis for all the work she has put into this European Parliament draft resolution.
At present, there are significant discrepancies across the territory of the European Union with regard to the time periods applicable in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents.
We must acknowledge that this is the case.
As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the problem is a complex one.
It encompasses both the limitation periods and the commencement of running time.
Limitations, the time period for presenting information concerning the event, the possibility of suspending or halting the course of the period, as well as the examination of evidence and the process for lodging objections concerning limitations are also involved.
Major discrepancies can have undesirable consequences for accident victims, making it difficult for them to assert their rights in court.
Priority must be given to guaranteeing legal certainty for all European Union citizens and making it easier for them to enjoy the freedoms laid down in the Treaties.
I therefore urge the Commission to submit a draft legislative proposal to the European Parliament.
The proposal should take account of the wise recommendations appended to this draft resolution.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for an excellent and much-needed report which responds to the needs of the victims of various types of accidents.
Mrs Wallis rightly highlighted that the Union is open to its citizens, who may travel and relocate without any restrictions.
Unfortunately, this is associated with an increased probability of accidents.
Accident victims often suffer twice over, first as a result of the accident itself and then because they are unfamiliar with the law of the country where the accident took place.
Limitation periods are therefore often exceeded and it becomes impossible to assert legitimate claims.
Accordingly, we should endorse the proposal before us, so that a minimum limitation period for cross-border disputes involving accidents can be established across the Union.
The proposal protects the victims' interests, and provides them with better opportunities to exercise their rights.
It therefore truly deserves our support.
I trust that, further to this report, the Commission will very soon table specific proposals to protect the interests of people to whom fate has been unkind.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
The recommendation is not intended to substitute national legislation but to take into account when proceedings involve parties who reside or are domiciled in different countries of the European Union, or a party residing or domiciled in a non-community state, or a choice between the laws of different countries.
It is becoming essential for principles governing limitation periods to be laid down clearly in an appropriate form for claims to damages.
The general limitation period which is being proposed is four years, except where the proper law of the claim provides for a longer period.
This general principle may cause problems, since the national legislation may cater for a shorter period, in which case there would be a discriminatory scenario when claims for damages arise between nationals or persons domiciled in the same state and when the issue relates to parties residing or domiciled in different states.
The same may be said for interruption, suspension and methods of calculating when the period limitation initiates.
Having stated the above it is better to have clear regulations for cross-border disputes which at the same time differ from national legislations.
Perhaps the dilemma can start to be solved if national legislation is harmonised with the proposed regulations.
Strategy for a strengthened partnership with the Pacific Islands (debate)
The next item is the report by Nirj Deva, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on EU relations with the Pacific Islands A strategy for a strengthened partnership.
rapporteur. - Mr President, it is so hugely flattering to speak to an almost empty Chamber!
The Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu - exotic places, fantastic places, so distant, so far away, so romantic and so on, but actually they are in need.
All these countries are part of the Pacific Islands.
Historically, Europe has had the strongest influence in the Pacific region through colonial rule.
The end of the Second World War hastened the end of European colonialism, but the relationship continued.
Through the LomÃ© Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, the Pacific region is now linked to us and our daily lives through the ACP.
Even if the population of the Pacific Islands is small, we have to bear in mind that the Pacific Ocean itself covers nearly 30% of the planet's surface.
Their location, while bringing huge benefits to the region through fisheries and tourism, means they find themselves isolated through a tyranny of distance.
However, advances in technology, air travel and infrastructure have helped to alleviate their economic circumstances.
Another thing they should consider - and I am very pleased to see the Commission in full strength here - is that the English-speaking digital economy may provide another way forward for them to provide business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing services to the United States and Australasia.
The region shows an economic contrast, with annual GDP per capita ranging from EUR 500 to EUR 8000.
This is like comparing Somalia to Bulgaria.
Therefore, the strategy for the region must have a certain flexibility in order to ensure that the development assistance is channelled according to national and regional parities and to achieve maximum benefit in both the richer and poorer islands.
For many Pacific islanders, agricultural products are their primary exports to international markets, supplying commodities such as sugar, copra, bananas, coconuts and palm oil.
However, they face challenges such as global warming, which is a huge challenge for them.
We have also given them another interesting problem: economic partnership agreements - EPAs - which they have to contend with.
They tell me that they are losing revenue through their intra-regional customs union.
What are they to do?
Do we help them, support them?
Do we create infrastructure so that they can come out of this problem?
We need to think about this.
One of the major challenges faced by the region is the sustainable management of fisheries.
Tuna is especially abundant in the Pacific, with a third of the world's catch caught in the Pacific Islands, valued at EUR 2 billion.
Are we protecting their catch?
Are we making sure that the benefits of their catches go back to their people?
I do not know.
Maybe the Commission should look at this.
I do not know exactly where their catch is going.
They should not be as poor as they are if they are getting EUR 2 billion for those catches.
My report stresses that any encouragement of tourism in the region must go hand-in-hand with increased local ownership of the tourist sector.
I stress that in the majority of cases only the richer countries, with more developed infrastructure and more frequent air connections, attract significant numbers of tourists each year.
In these cases, for the poorer countries, development assistance must continue to be used to finance infrastructure and to encourage sustainable tourism.
In this regard, why have we not looked at creating a Pacific hub, a regional hub?
We could create a hub, like Dubai.
After all, what was Dubai?
Dubai was full of sand 20 years ago!
Today it is a hub for regional air transport.
Sheik Maktoum and those intelligent Arabs have created something quite extraordinary.
Why do we not that in the Pacific for these islanders?
My report recommends that the more developed Pacific island countries should continue to deliver local processing, thereby creating more employment.
They should explore the possibility of the European Investment Bank giving soft loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, to add value to their exports.
Many of the islands are politically fragile, as we have seen through the many military coups in Fiji.
I am sick of hearing about military coups in Fiji, but they need to be able to feel that they are going to have a future as two communities together, and we need to help them with that.
They must stop or we should stop the aid.
That is a threat, but we need to have some sort of quid pro quo on this issue.
Provision of good governance throughout the Pacific is vital, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals we must also achieve a certain measure of mutuality.
In Papua New Guinea, for example, and the Solomon Islands, they have problems with regard to AIDS.
The EU, as a major donor to the region, has an opportunity to create a strategy that will support the island countries of the Pacific in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and bringing their people to realise their full potential.
Our report is just the start.
Mr President, I welcome the report on EU relations with the Pacific Islands, and I especially want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Deva, on his results.
When my colleague, Commissioner Michel, took the initiative to have the first ever EU strategy for our relations with the Pacific ACP States prepared, he did so because these countries are becoming increasingly important and because they are facing difficult challenges.
We can benefit from closer contacts with the Pacific, as the region is of global significance and we can contribute significantly to its development.
Parliament's report clearly reflects this and it points out important avenues forward.
These countries are mostly remote, relatively poor, small and have become independent fairly recently.
Most have strong population growth.
They have a difficult balancing act to perform between tradition and the pressures of modernity.
Globalisation is an opportunity for them, but also carries risks for their cultural heritage.
In many countries in the Pacific, democracy has difficult growth conditions and, at the same time, the Pacific needs high-quality governance to move forward.
For this reason, your commitment to their democracies, international exposure and contacts is very important.
They have significant natural resources, such as oil, gas, fish and tropical wood, as well as fantastic biodiversity.
The Pacific Ocean is so important that it must be considered as a global public good.
This gives the Pacific Island countries opportunities on the international scene and prospects for the future.
However, climate change threatens many of the islands, even whole countries.
The overseas countries and territories serve as bridges between Europe and the Pacific and between our cultures.
Where the Pacific countries have needs and we have comparative advantages, there we propose to assist.
We have identified the 'blue-green' theme as the cornerstone of the focus on the sustainable management of the region's natural resources.
In addition, we have committed ourselves to a strengthened political relationship, more focused development action and more efficient aid delivery.
In our communication we foresaw that the Pacific countries would face more problems in the future if a number of significant trends were not reversed.
Last year alone there were serious security problems and political crises in the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga and Fiji.
The problems are so difficult and severe than many of the Pacific ACP countries cannot handle them alone.
For this reason we are working with our Australian and New Zealand friends and, as Mr Deva said, with stable conditions we can develop tourism further in the Pacific.
Parliament has, of course, noticed the Council conclusions regarding the Pacific strategy, which confirmed that the EU will strengthen its partnership with this region.
A number of Member States follow the Pacific closely.
The EU has an important role to play in the Pacific.
Your report demonstrates this very clearly and we count on your continued support and solidarity for these really extraordinary countries.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we are debating the report by Mr Deva on the European Union's relations with the Pacific Islands - Strategy for a strengthened partnership.
I was rapporteur for the opinion issued and approved by the Committee on Fisheries.
I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on the work he has done and I am delighted that the Committee on Fisheries' proposals are going to be included in the text of the resolution, at least in part.
The Pacific is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, and the European tuna fleet has been fishing in those waters for some time thanks to the bilateral agreements signed with the countries of the region.
According to the scientific studies, the level of stocks is entirely satisfactory, and European Union financial aid represents an important source of income for the countries of the region.
We must therefore strengthen our relations with those countries.
We have a mutual interest.
We can contribute to promoting measures in those waters for the sustainable management of fisheries resources, and for EU fishermen fishing tuna it would be a very positive thing to make more progress towards creating a network of tuna agreements similar to the one already in place in the Indian Ocean, as requested by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion.
When it comes to strengthening the partnership with that region of the world, therefore, we must not overlook fisheries.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work.
A strategy to strengthen partnerships with the Pacific Islands sounds good at first encounter and inert enough not to cause any measure of suspicion or discontent.
After all, the projected aim is to improve relations, mainly trade, for the mutual benefit of EU citizens and the Pacific islanders.
This might be the case for the majority of the Pacific Island countries. But for a significant number there is a hidden truth in the fact that many of the Pacific Islands are not countries at all: they are 21st century colonies, and two of the colonising nations happen to be members of the EU, namely France and Britain.
Take for example New Caledonia.
It has an area of about 18 500 km2 and its approximately 250 000 inhabitants are recorded as being merely a 'sui generis community'.
New Caledonia is not a country but an overseas Department of France.
On a much smaller scale, the Pitcairn Islands are an overseas territory of Britain administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England.
So colleagues, apart from the despicably shameful ethics of accepting that France and Britain should continue to have colonies, we seem to be content with going on to form relations with such colonies as though nothing wrong is going on.
In fact, nothing about colonisation and consequent democracy deprivation is mentioned in this report.
In conclusion, let me pose the following question. Since some of the islands are in essence parts of the aforementioned EU Member States, then in reality are France and Britain going to form relationships with themselves through this strategy partnership?
Perhaps the Commissioner could enlighten us on this exciting but strange prospect.
(PL) Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Deva for this very important report on a strategy for a strengthened partnership between the European Union and the Pacific Islands.
The European Parliament supports the European Commission's view that a more intensive political dialogue with the Pacific Islands Forum is required.
Indeed, the Forum's leaders have adopted a new agreement establishing the Forum as an intergovernmental organisation under international law.
At the same time, we wish to emphasise that strengthening dialogue at regional level must also take account of the needs of the poorest countries in the region.
The exploitation of natural resources must help to generate income for all the citizens of these island nations in the Pacific.
In particular, it must help to reduce poverty.
The European Parliament wishes to highlight the importance of tourism in the region, bearing in mind that the natural beauty of the Pacific islands is one of their main assets.
Support for tourism in the region must go hand in hand with an increased involvement of the islanders themselves in the provision of tourist services, in order to secure the future of the tourist sector and maximise its benefits for the local economy.
I would also like to point out that the report emphasises the need to support technical education and training systems in the countries of the region, within the framework of the 10th European Development Fund.
The European Parliament shares the European Commission's view that political instability and conflicts can have a destructive impact on the region's economic development, particularly as regards the loss of income from tourism and damage to economic infrastructure.
We wish to draw attention to the situation in East Timor, where an outbreak of violence took place in May and June of 2006.
It is to be hoped that, working in close cooperation with the international community, the Commission will be able to assist the leaders of East Timor to solve the problems underlying the crisis, taking account of the need for political stability, alleviation of poverty, social development and reconciliation between the various social groups.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(FR) The European Parliament is being consulted this week about the first formal strategy for 30 years on relations between the European Union and the Pacific.
This strategy is aimed at strengthening political dialogue, improving cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of development aid, more than a quarter of which is supplied by the European Union.
In the case of a number of vital sectors, the strategy emphasises sustainable development from both an ecological and an economic point of view.
These sectors include tourism, transportation, mining, agriculture and fisheries.
In the Committee on Fisheries, I had an amendment adopted to the effect that the European Union should support regional cooperation projects on the evaluation, monitoring and management of fisheries resources, conducted with third countries in the area and with the overseas countries and territories associated with the European Union: French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Pitcairn.
I am delighted that the European Union is willing to get more constructively involved in the Pacific by emphasising economic development, political stability and the sound management of resources in the immediate neighbourhood of our overseas countries and territories.
Let us hope that the financial resources will match the declared ambitions.
(PL) I would like to record my support for the content of Mr Deva's report on EU relations with the Pacific Islands entitled 'A strategy for strengthened partnership with the Pacific Islands'.
I hope this much-needed document will herald a new era in contacts between the EU and the Pacific Islands.
European countries have now been involved in the Pacific region for thirty years, and are major donors to the area.
It is therefore particularly important to develop a long-term strategy.
This is actually the only part of the world for which the Union has not yet developed a overarching, integrated strategy.
The adoption of the document under consideration represents an excellent opportunity to create a new relationship with this region.
This relationship should be both economic and political.
The Pacific Islands play a very important role in stabilising the climate, and they also possess a great wealth of natural resources such as mineral deposits and fish.
It would be a partnership with a region that is a world leader in tuna fishing and which accounts for one third of global catches.
My support for the aforementioned document also relates to the need to promote democracy and stability in the Pacific region and to prevent extremist ideologies from taking root there.
The European Union has historical ties with these islands, and should support them in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Adopting the Strategy for a strengthened partnership will provide us with an opportunity to set higher economic and social targets.
The European Union's involvement in these efforts could go beyond simply providing support to former colonies.
EC-Gabon Fisheries Partnership (debate)
The next item is the report by Stavros Arnaoutakis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic - C6-0303/2006 -.
Mr President, the Community and the Republic of Gabon have negotiated and initialled, on 28 October 2005, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement for a period of six years.
The new Protocol has been in provisional application since December 2005 under a decision of the Council.
On the date of its entry into force, this Agreement will repeal and replace the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Gabon on fishing off the coast of Gabon, which entered into force in December 1998.
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 860 000 per year. Of this financial contribution, 60% will allow annual financial support for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Gabon, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing.
This new Protocol provides fishing possibilities for 24 tuna seiners and 16 surface long-liners, with an annual reference tonnage of 11 000 tonnes.
The Agreement is part of an important network of EC Tuna Agreements in the Atlantic Ocean off the Western African coast.
The Commission considers that the Agreement will give the Community and Gabon an appropriate legal and political framework for monitoring and controlling the activities of the EU fleet in the Gabonese fishing area.
It also allows the Community to support the development of the sector in this country, for the mutual benefit of the parties.
Mr President, the European Union and the Gabonese Republic negotiated and signed on 28 October 2005 a multiannual fisheries partnership agreement which will cover relations between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic in the fisheries sector.
The partnership agreement, which is accompanied by a protocol, has been concluded for a period of six years, while the technical and financial terms governing fisheries activities entered into force back on 3 December 2005.
The main objective of the partnership agreement, which goes beyond the narrow commercial framework of the previous bilateral agreement, is to develop a sustainable fisheries policy with responsible exploitation of fisheries resources, support for coastal populations and the creation of small local freezing and processing industries through general economic and scientific cooperation.
One important innovative step is the monitoring of fishing vessels by satellite in order to stamp out illegal, undeclared and uncontrolled fishing.
As emphasised by the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, Mr Borg, this new agreement opens up a new chapter in cooperation between the European Union and the Gabonese Republic, given that it will step up its efforts to safeguard the future of fisheries in its waters.
We should emphasise that agreements such as this are particularly important, because they promote economic development and cooperation with third countries.
This agreement with Gabon in the fisheries sector is another development tool being used by the European Union in order to emphasise its solidarity and intention to cooperate further with developing third countries.
I therefore consider it necessary for the European Parliament, as the institution directly elected by the citizens, to be kept informed well in advance and not to be called on a year later purely and simply to ratify the decisions.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to protest once again at the fact that fisheries is always dealt with in a secretive nocturnal manner; that is what is happening today once again.
I would like to thank Mr Arnaoutakis for his wonderful report.
Since it is so late, I shall be concise and stress three aspects relating to Gabon and fisheries agreements in general that I believe to be important.
I must once again point to the Commission's delay in presenting this issue to the European Parliament and point out that the European Union is going to be paying the first portion of the financial payments to Gabon at least six months late.
This is unacceptable and the European Union must not cause this kind of delay, especially when it comes to third countries whose economies are so weak.
I believe that we have reached an agreement with Commissioner Borg and I hope that there will be no more such delays in future.
Secondly, I would also like to stress the financial aspects of fisheries agreements in general, this specific case being one very infamous example.
There are many people here - and I regret that they are not actually the people who are most critical of the fisheries agreements - who complain that the fisheries sector does not cooperate in, or hardly contribute to, the funding of these agreements.
In fact, in this case, in the Gabon agreement, the fisheries sector is going to pay almost 20% more than the European Union pays from the Community budget.
That should reassure those who say that the fisheries sector does not contribute to the funding of the agreements.
Finally, Mr President, I would also like to put a request to the Commission relating to the agreements that we in the Committee on Fisheries have been making repeatedly: that, in the name of greater transparency, Members of this Parliament should be able to participate as observers in the joint committees that control the implementation of fisheries agreements.
We have already achieved that for the regional fisheries organisations and it would be good if we could take part in the joint committees in the future.
We put this request the other day to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and I hope that Commissioner Figel' will communicate this request to the European Commission, so that, amongst the three institutions, we can obtain greater participation by Members of this Parliament.
If only because of the time of night we have to work, I believe that we deserve to be in those committees as observers.
Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, I agree with your assessment and I shall pass on to the Bureau your concerns about discrimination regarding the topics for debate.
Perhaps a rota system would be fairer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies (debate)
The next item is the report by DanutBudreikaitÄ, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all who have found the time at this late hour to discuss here in the plenary session the important question of integrating sustainability into development cooperation policy.
The most important EU documents - the European Community Treaty and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy - define sustainable development as development which allows the present needs of society to be satisfied without reducing the chances of future generations to meet their needs.
Sustainable development is an all-embracing EU rights principle which should have an influence on all spheres of EU policy, including the development cooperation policy.
One of the most important aims of our community is to fight poverty in the world, to pay back some old debts to developing countries, to help them climb out of the status of least-developed nations and to reach the status of developing nations, and ultimately - the level of developed nations.
Developed nations know what the cost of progress and modern life is.
I have in mind the environmental impact of human activity - the development of various fields of economy, especially industry.
It is a huge cost that is being borne by the whole world, even though not all countries have or use the technology that contributes to the greenhouse effect, CO2 or other pollution.
We are all paying, and we all would like to see the amount of pollution reduced.
We direct our attention not only to our own economies, adopting appropriate solutions, but we also want developing countries to use non-polluting renewable types of energy and non-polluting technology.
However, this is not so simple.
The report raised some of the problems of sustainable development and offered some directions for possible solutions for developing countries - and not only for them, but also for the EU itself.
Sustainable development comprises three fundamental aspects: stable economic growth, protection of the environment, and social justice and cohesion.
This means that economic issues, environmental protection issues and social issues are interrelated and reinforce each other, and their interconnection should already be in evidence at the policy formation stage.
Economic issues are linked with management, human rights, democracy, regional integration and other aspects of economics and life.
The financial support of the EU and other countries is necessary for their solution, as are the strengthening of developing countries' institutional competence, the fight against corruption, new methods of helping businesses and markets to implement sustainable development, the attraction of direct foreign investment, and so on.
The environment is affected by unlawful destruction of forests, which encourages corruption and the possibility of armed conflicts; lack of access to potable water and shortcomings in sanitary conditions; pollution, especially the greenhouse effect; and the use and depletion of natural resources, which are also precursors to conflict situations.
In the social sphere environmental issues are also important, such as access to potable water and sanitary conditions, access to education and health care systems, and the fight against poverty.
In implementing three fundamental aspects of sustainable development, it is evident that the stimulation of economic growth and the elimination of poverty, together with ensuring the protection of the environment, are the greatest challenges to the EU development cooperation policy.
Therefore, in this policy the EU must also encourage other large economic actors, such as the United States, China and India, to contribute to the implementation of global sustainable development.
When stimulating economic growth, it is essential to implement sustainable development in all sectors, to invest in non-polluting technologies, to introduce alternative energy technologies, and, most importantly, to apply entrepreneurial behaviour standards.
Talking about the environment, it is important to highlight that international corporations operating in developing countries must respect the environment.
A start should be made to implement a code of corporate social responsibility for European firms.
Seeking to fight the deterioration of environmental protection in developing countries, the EU should cooperate more actively with small and medium-sized firms to shape their respect for the environment.
The protection of biological diversity, monitoring of the ecological state of the environment and the appropriate measures to support it are our collective debt to coming generations.
In the social sphere we must try to achieve the defined millennial development goals, to encourage a sustainable consumption model, to combat diseases, and to direct more official development aid to education about health and environmental issues.
In addition, it is essential to involve the civil society, NGOs and women in finding solutions for the problems of sustainable development, and in invigorating social dialogue.
As well as these three fields of sustainable development, I would also like to mention the strengthening of institutional competence as a priority side issue for all sectors.
In assisting institutional, administrative and legal reforms, expansion of infrastructure systems and national financial management, the environmental, economic and social impact needs to be evaluated.
These are long-term action programmes to achieve sustainability in development cooperation policy.
Already, however, the EU can take action to achieve sustainability, to solve the agricultural export subsidy issue, and to encourage the importation of products that have been produced with respect for sustainability and without contravening international agreements, invoking a migration policy to stop the brain drain from developing countries, as well as stimulating investment in developing countries, and faithfully applying 0.7% of GDP to development assistance.
Mr President, I shall aim to comply with my allotted speaking time so that we can finish before midnight!
Of course we welcome this report which is so focused on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies.
I am pleased to know that this report is well in tune with our own analysis of this subject.
The Commission is fully committed to improving the mainstreaming of sustainability in our development cooperation.
The overarching objective of this cooperation is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development.
We are working in the direction of most of the recommendations which are made in the report, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs BudreikaitÄ.
I shall illustrate this only with a few examples.
Firstly, we are improving the mainstreaming of environmental concerns in development policies in a variety of ways, for example by staff training, by setting up an environmental helpdesk, by systematic preparation of country and regional environmental profiles and, whenever relevant, strategic environmental assessments and environmental impact assessments.
Secondly, we are stepping up assistance to developing countries to adapt to climate change.
We are working to enhance our alliance-building with the developing countries in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation.
Because the most immediate effect of climate change on developing countries is the incidence of extreme weather phenomena, we are also preparing a new disaster risk reduction strategy.
Thirdly, we are promoting clean and renewable energy through specific projects.
Another new initiative that has been well received by the international community is the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund.
Fourthly, we are working hard towards preventing the import of illegally sourced wood via the negotiation of voluntary partnership agreements under the forest law enforcement governance and trade initiative.
Negotiations have recently started with Malaysia, Ghana and Indonesia.
Lastly, we are programming resources for building capacity in developing countries to prevent illegal dumping of toxic waste and to clean stocks of solid pesticides.
The efforts needed to deal with these objectives and with others also raised in the report certainly remain considerable.
The European Parliament's support in relation to the development cooperation instrument and the environment and natural resources climatic strategy will be critical, and from this point of view I want to express gratitude for your engagement and support.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can do no other than extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs BudreikaitÄ, for a successful job of work, and for a very balanced report that does not give rise to contention.
The report contains the core of what the Committee on Development wanted to say about, firstly, the challenges presented by climate change; secondly, the protection of biodiversity; thirdly the discharge of the least developed countries from their debts; fourthly the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises for the sake of improved social, environmental and economic cooperation in the countries of the South, and, fifthly, more foreign direct investment and greater diversification in exports.
The report calls on the Commission to base all the Community's development programmes on transparency and accountability, since corruption damages sustainability in the developing countries, and this House therefore advocates the introduction of independent offices to combat it, together with an adequate allocation of funds to them, and I can do no other than ask all Members of this House to endorse this report when we come to vote on it.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, should like to join in congratulating the rapporteur.
The idea prevailed for a long time that protection of the environment and sustainable development were luxury items that could not be discussed, let alone achieved, until a society had developed to a certain level.
Sustainable development has since then become one of the millennium development goals, since the effects of poor environmental conditions impact poorer people far more directly.
Their living conditions are largely dependent on access to natural resources - for example, 90% of people living in absolute poverty are dependent on woods for a living.
It is also the case that the developing countries are harder hit by the consequences of climate change than the industrial nations that are largely responsible for it, and so the Commission's proposal for a Europe-wide reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars by 2012 is to be welcomed.
In this report, we are again calling on the United States, but also on India and China, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to join with the European Union in taking responsibility for sustainable development worldwide.
While the building of infrastructure can be an important factor in sustainable development, it is also important that social and environmental considerations be borne in mind, and so we urge the Commission to have an environmental impact assessment carried out on every project receiving financial support from the EU and made available to the public.
We are again and again shocked by reports of the inhuman conditions under which people in developing countries have to work, and the code of practice for European businesses operating in such countries really must be made more effective.
We must also play our part in ensuring that the International Labour Organisation's core labour standards are applied.
The debate is closed.

The European private company statute (debate)
The first item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on the European private company statute.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel particularly honoured to be able to see this topic discussed today, when you, Madam President, are chairing a sitting of this House for the first time.
The action plan on company law already envisaged examination of which additional forms of company might be considered as subjects for legislation within the European Union.
As a result of the studies carried out at that time, these questions were, in essence, left open.
Now, the Commission, a number of years ago, invited discussion of the company law action plan and subjected it to a wholesale revision.
This House made a full contribution to this debate, and, following on from it, decided to produce and discuss an own-initiative report on the European private company.
Such is the background to this item on today's agenda.
We have considered this question carefully and organised in this House a hearing on the subject, which drove home the fact that there is a real need for that sort of European private company and for the Commission to initiate legislation to create it.
Smaller industrial companies in particular - export-driven businesses that are at present obliged to set up subsidiaries and companies in other Member States and in accordance with those states' laws on companies - would welcome with great enthusiasm the creation of a European legal form whereby they could organise their subsidiaries throughout the European Union.
At present, they are in serious need of advice, which may well be good for the lawyers, but it does cost a lot of money, since there has to be, again and again, examination of individual cases to ascertain what rights and duties their directors and members of their supervisory boards actually have and what they have to do in order not to end up at odds with the law.
I think they will be able to avoid that if they can be offered a single European legal form that regulates a number of core matters, in particular directors' powers and questions of liability, in one way at the European level and thus offers something to businesses.
There is, then, absolutely no question of additional bureaucracy, for companies can decide for themselves whether they want this legal form or not; it is simply something of which they can avail themselves, something that plugs a real hole in the law left over after we created the European Limited Company for bigger firms.
Let me also say, by way of an aside, that the insufficient progress made in the past in the development of European company law is one explanation for the European Court of Justice's rulings in such cases as Inspire Art, and this is where we can help to provide and create an exemplary structure in the European Union.
I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs - which adopted this report by a large majority, or, indeed unanimously - has succeeded in finding a suitable compromise between the different approaches to the structure of such companies found in continental Europe on the one hand and in British legal thinking on the other, especially on the issue of equity, where we achieved a good compromise on the basis that equity ought, as a matter of principle, to exist, but without the obligation to make cash payments, which, as a means whereby registration may be made easier, is, in my view, a step in the right direction and also shows how it is possible for the Commission to submit a proposal with the Council then being able to find a rational compromise between the various legal traditions.
What we in the Committee on Legal Affairs - and I think, after today's vote, this House too - expect of the Commission is that it should, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, with our Rules of Procedure, and with the interinstitutional agreement, stir itself into action and, within the foreseeable future, take definite steps to put a definite proposal for legislation before this House and the Council.
As I draw to a close, I would like to mention another consideration that has had some input into the amendments, that being the debate on workers' participation in decision-making.
Let me make perfectly plain something that was not a bone of contention in our deliberations, namely that nobody is seeking to restrict workers' rights in any way whatever.
In so far as they are guaranteed at the national level, they are also to be guaranteed and maintained when this legislative project is put into effect.
This is something on which there have been a number of amendments, which I do not regard as crucial, for they all have the same end in mind, that of protecting workers' rights.
One final comment - and yes, I do mean final, for I will then have used up my five minutes: I note with pleasure that the German Presidency of the Council has declared the European Private Company to be one of its priorities, and so I assume that the Council, too, will be as supportive of this as - I hope - an overwhelming majority in this House is about to be.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the excellent work done in the preparation of the report on the European private company statute on which you will vote today.
My departments are already studying in detail the suggestions and recommendations proposed in this report.
We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business.
It is important to take action that will help small and medium firms to reap fully the benefits of the single market.
The growth of small businesses is crucial for the competitiveness of the European economy.
One means of facilitating the expansion of small businesses is to simplify the current legal framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burdens.
These burdens are particularly onerous for SMEs that do not have big legal departments at their disposal.
That is why I have decided to present a communication on the simplification of EU company law in the spring of this year.
This fits in with the broader programme of the Commission on simplification of the acquis communautaire which provides for a 25% reduction in administrative burdens by 2012.
I am all for initiatives that will give European firms, and in particular small and medium companies, a flexible regulatory framework.
The European private company statute could be a useful option for them in this respect.
The idea was supported by industry in the recent public consultation on future priorities for the action plan on company law and corporate governance.
Many respondents stressed that such an option would create more choice for companies and reduce compliance costs for firms which wish to operate in several Member States.
However, a number of our respondents also questioned the usefulness of such a measure and, as you know, in accordance with better regulation principles the Commission must carry out an impact assessment before any initiative is proposed.
Accordingly, my departments are now examining the costs and benefits of such a statute, as well as alternative measures to address the problems at stake.
I would only propose a European private company statute if the impact assessment clearly shows that this is the most appropriate instrument to tackle the problems SMEs face today and that the European private company form would be useful to them in expanding their activities and developing their businesses across borders.
Experience with the European company statute has shown that creating a new European corporate form can be a very long and complex process.
The end result may be legal instruments that are not always easy to use.
If a European private company statute is to be worthwhile, then agreement would need to be found swiftly.
The end result would have to be simple for SMEs to use, thereby bringing real added value.
I note that your report and associated resolution are based on Article 192 of the Treaty calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal.
Under the framework agreement, the Commission undertook to take account of any such request made pursuant to Article 192 of the Treaty.
I intend to live up to these commitments.
We will assess the practical suggestions set out in the report in detail.
I want my departments to take the time necessary to consider carefully all possible options in order to provide the best balanced solution for SMEs.
Upon conclusion of the impact assessment, I will report back to you on its results and the policy conclusions we draw from it.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I, too, as a former fellow-member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, wish you every success in the exercise of your functions.
If every President were to keep the Chamber as quiet as you have done this morning, our deliberations would indeed be much more constructive, and so I can only ask you to carry on the way you have begun.
I can tell the Commissioner that small and medium-sized enterprises are the driving force behind the European internal market.
That may well be reiterated time and time again, but the progress towards the achievement of this goal is often too slow.
I, too, therefore, am among those who believe that the creation of a European legal framework with the interests of the self-employed and smaller businesses particularly in mind is an extremely important matter, not least for the Committee on the Internal Market.
Mr Lehne's own-initiative report is much to be welcomed, not least on the grounds that it sends an important signal to the Commission - and, let me add, to the Presidency of the Council too - and I would like to thank him for the splendid work he has done in this regard.
It is cause for thanksgiving that many small and medium-sized businesses already work across borders, and you, Commissioner, were able to see that for yourself when you visited Offenburg, my own electoral district.
In many instances, though, their dedication and growth are hampered by bureaucratic restrictions and the lack of experience of the local legal situation, and small and medium-sized enterprises from the new Member States have hitherto been put at a considerable competitive disadvantage by this.
Offering in future a European legal form in parallel with the legal forms of the nation states therefore not only serves to further the completion of the European internal market, but also makes it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to set up subsidiaries in European countries other than their own, and hence to develop their activities beyond their own country's borders.
What is of the essence in this is that the consultancy and administrative costs involved in setting up and running a company can be reduced to a considerable degree and that cross-border business activity no longer involves the laws of more than one Member State being applicable.
A survey conducted by the German International Chamber of Commerce - I can refer only to German businesses - showed that enterprises were very keen that there should be a European legal form that met the needs of small and medium-sized businesses, and the businesses that responded said that they saw this as being a 'little sister' to the European Limited Company and believed that it needed to be slimline, practicable and - above all else - European.
I can therefore tell the Commissioner that what this House is saying by means of this report is that it wants to see the Commission presenting a legislative proposal on the basis of Article 308 before this year is out.
We are of course pleased to hear you advocating the impact assessment, but we have also seen, from the example of other directives relating to the internal market and consumer protection, that, where the political will is present, an impact assessment can either be carried out briskly or limited to specific individual questions, and so I would ask you to move the impact assessment forward with some speed in order to arrive at a legislative proposal as soon as possible.
I would also ask the German Presidency of the Council to process this dossier as soon as possible and with vigour.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I believe that this is the first time that I have had the opportunity to speak while you are presiding over the sitting and I would like to congratulate you on your appointment.
I am sure that you will do your duties in your characteristically independent manner.
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Lehne for his report.
I believe that he has done a good job, but I would like to point out a couple of problems that we have.
Firstly, I do not believe the Committee on Legal Affairs' current approach of presenting reports on an issue of legislative initiative with an annex which has not been sufficiently discussed to be the appropriate legislative technique.
We are talking about an initial phase of legislative proposals.
What we are doing is asking the Commission to look into the possibility of presenting a report, and I believe that at this stage we should restrict ourselves to the first part of the resolution.
I do not believe that the annex to the motion for a resolution has been sufficiently debated.
We cannot therefore take the view that these conclusions of the annex genuinely reflect the will of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Secondly, I believe that Mr McCreevy was absolutely right to point out that we should not be legislating for the sake of legislating - our failure in relation to the European Company should give us cause for concern in this regard - and the impact study is therefore clearly necessary.
Furthermore, it is clear that we in this House believe that it is necessary to draw up a statute to enable small businesses to operate and that we should work towards achieving that.
In doing so, we are faced with certain difficulties: for example, the problem of worker participation.
We have held discussions on the text of recital H. In my political group, there have been certain reservations about the way Mr Lehne had worded it.
I believe that the final formula proposed by Mr Lehne is satisfactory and I hope that we in my group can approve it.
In short, I believe that Mr Lehne's proposal is a good one.
We are not demanding that the Commission accept it, but we are asking it to look into this possibility.
I hope that Mr McCreevy will do everything he can to ensure that this Parliament's will in this regard is implemented.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first let me also extend my congratulations to you on your appointment and the conduct of your first debate.
I must also start with an apology to the rapporteur because, although I attended the hearing on this subject, I was unable to participate in the debate in committee and I know it is a bit irritating when somebody then pops up in Plenary.
I broadly welcome the underlying idea in the proposal, but I have some concerns that I hope the Commission will investigate further during future work on this matter.
Mr Lehne, you have said in your explanatory note to the report - and indeed the Commissioner has also said just now, and I agree - that the statute will need to focus on the needs of SMEs.
But that of course covers just about all companies except multinationals.
To me it is clear that if we follow all of the recommendations in the annex, those that are likely to benefit or choose this option are towards the medium rather than the small end of the spectrum of companies.
They certainly would not be start-up companies.
The suggested capital requirements ensure that is the case.
I do not want people to say 'here you are standing there as a Brit not wanting any capital requirement'.
I recognise that the capital does not necessarily have to be paid in and I welcome attempts to find a compromise on that, but it will still have an impact, especially on small businesses.
Smaller businesses, whether at the start-up or whether trying to expand, have enough cost and difficulty trying to give belt-and-braces guarantees to banks without there being an added tier of financial expectation.
And, make no mistake, the fact that shareholders could potentially lose EUR 10 000, even if not paid in at the start, does add an extra tier of financial expectation.
Now, that may not matter at all since it is optional, and if you do not like the statute, you do not have to use it, but I would prefer that if you propose something, it would be liked and used and accessible to all companies.
While I have said that there may be little incentive in some quarters to choose this, that does not mean it is because small companies do not conduct cross-border business or do not aspire to do so.
Many quite small companies do engage in significant cross-border business and European Court of Justice decisions make it clear that they can do so.
But, as it is optional, maybe that is no matter.
Or is that really the case?
I would not like to see the situation where the new statute introduced a factor of discrimination where consumers were concerned that if you were not big enough to consider it worth being a European private company, you are not big enough to do business in Europe.
That would run completely counter to the notion of a single market and the mutual importance of fostering and nurturing small businesses within that market.
In a single market, size must not matter.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I fully support the view that the European Private Company Statute should be based on Community legislation and dispense with references to national law.
The aim is to create a new legal form for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the driving force behind all European economies.
A new legal form will help to foster cross-border activity too.
We must also keep in mind joint activities when it comes to promoting the development of the internal market, and consequently economic growth.
If a single European legal form is created, consultancy costs will be cut.
In the many countries involved, the law will no longer apply to cross-border activities.
Instead, we shall have a single, uniform statute.
For this type of company to be competitive on the market, it must be flexible and able to adjust to market requirements.
This could be achieved by endowing such a company with a wide range of possibilities for transforming itself.
In this context, the issue of legal harmonisation arises, for instance, with regard to the cross-border transfer of registered offices.
For an undertaking of this nature to be able to operate with maximum efficiency on the market, however, it must focus primarily on the security of business transactions and on protecting the company's creditors.
We still need to give further consideration to these issues.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I find this absolutely fascinating!
Every time I come here I have to smile.
What this place knows about running small businesses is absolutely unbelievable.
When I look up the CVs of Members of this Parliament, I find that nobody has ever had any serious responsibility for a small company in their lives.
It is amazing what we all know about these things!
In 1992 I started a small business.
I thought about it and I bought some old-fashioned, second-hand furniture.
I sucked my pencil and thought, 'My goodness me, what have I done?
I have left a big corporation, where do I go from here?'.
That business now has branches in Hong Kong, Jersey, the Channel Islands and South Africa, as well as London and York, which is my constituency.
I really do not think I could do that again.
There are so many regulations, it is unbelievable.
If you really want to fire up small business in the European Union, and particularly the United Kingdom, I would suggest that these people here and the Commission get their blasted noses out of everybody else's business and stop trying to tell us how we should run our businesses!
Just let us get on with it, because if you do not, more and more businesses are going to go to Dubai, Bermuda and the Channel Islands - I am moving half my business to the Channel Islands as it is.
I would counsel you and the Commission to please keep your ill-informed noses out of small businesses!
on behalf of the ITS Group. - Madam President, this report is a contradiction in terms.
Governments cannot micro-manage enterprise.
Since when has the European Union initiated anything that improves trade, minimises costs, cuts red tape, generates new wealth, creates new jobs, frees up enterprise?
When ever?
Most governments can hope to contribute to economic growth only by clearing the decks of obstacles and creating an enterprise-free environment.
Government ought to be about enabling people and their initiative to thrive.
After that it should stand well back.
The UK has a huge, permanent and growing deficit with the EU.
Does anyone here seriously imagine that by seizing control over company law relating to SMEs, the European Union will change or improve that situation?
Do you really imagine that possible, especially as these proposals are based on German and French ideas of a social market?
I endorse what Mr Bloom has just said.
How many of you here have ever started a new business at your own risk?
Created jobs?
Funded it for yourselves and successfully run it for, let us say, 20 years?
How many of you have done that?
How many people on that committee have done that?
How many of you know what it takes to start a new business in the UK?
Well, I will tell you.
Less than a hundred pounds, ten minutes on the phone and you can do business anywhere.
Compare that with these proposals.
We have centuries of company law in the UK, thank you very much.
And it works just fine.
We also have SMEs trading all over the world and they do just fine.
Most of their nightmares come from past misguided attempts by the EU to 'help' with trade on the Continent.
Most of that 'help' merely interferes with their activities, and the idea of yet more 'help' will be greeted with horror.
Over the years we have seen masterpieces of unintended consequences from this place.
There is the Working Time Directive, which finally proved to a business friend of mine that the EU was clinically insane.
There is the drive for a level playing field, the very antithesis of wealth and job creation, which totally depends on finding differences.
And now we have got the licensing of authorised economic operators, which hugely benefits those who qualify and undermines everyone else with extra costs and bureaucracy.
Even the Socialist British Government has figured out that this proposal is expensive and dangerous nonsense and it belongs in the bin.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a very sound and detailed report.
In my view, it sends out an important message to small and medium-sized enterprises, indicating that their development and activity on the common European market will soon become much more straightforward.
It also sends out a further message to SMEs, namely that European legislators recognise the role of SMEs on the Union's market and are making an effort to improve their situation.
The main aim of our activities relating to the common market should be to create an optimum situation whereby European enterprises are not hindered by unnecessary red tape or commercial and technical obstacles when they move from one country to another, or set up branches in various Union countries.
It should be just as easy as if they were moving from one part of their own country to another.
All companies should be able to operate on the same principles across the length and breadth of the Union.
Only then will it really be possible to speak of a common European market with benefits for all.
Mr Lehne's report is a further step in developing legislation designed to enhance the efficiency of the SME sector's activities on the common market.
Its implications will certainly significantly contribute to increasing the economic activity of European companies, and consequently to improving all our lives and meeting one of the aims of the Lisbon Agenda.
I was actually a businesswoman myself in the past.
I ran my own business for 15 years, and employed some 100 people.
I am well aware of the problems entrepreneurs face and am convinced that the proposal to develop a European Private Company Statute represents an excellent and much-needed solution for undertakings conducting cross-border business.
It is important, however, to proceed with caution and learn from the mistakes made when developing the European Company Statute.
Companies of that type do not fully fulfil their role as European Companies because of the large number of references to national law.
That is why the European Private Company Statute must be based mainly on Community law, with minimum reference to national law.
Such an approach will result in a more uniform text and legal provisions.
In addition, it will provide legal certainty, which is crucial to entrepreneurs.
We must make every effort to ensure that the Statute is as uniform as possible, and that it makes minimal reference to individual legal systems whilst referring to Community law as much as possible.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, for all the work he has undertaken on a matter which is of such vital importance to the future of European integration and the development of economic cooperation within the framework of the internal market.
The current situation regarding the internal market is that we already have a European Company.
It is intended for large capital-based companies.
A legal form which will also make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to conduct cross-border business is therefore essential.
It is important to bear in mind that SMEs are the main driving force behind the European economy and the main source of employment for Union citizens.
That is why further efforts should be made to enhance the economic activities undertaken by these companies.
However, the new legal solutions we are proposing to our entrepreneurs do call for detailed consideration.
We should learn from the experience gained when introducing the legal form for the European Company on to the common market.
That statute took a long time to draw up and was the result of a compromise.
In fact, the final compromise has not proved entirely satisfactory.
We should therefore learn from our mistakes, as Mrs Handzlik suggested earlier.
As far as is possible, the European Private Company Statute should be a uniform European legal form.
It must provide for the simplification of the principles of establishment and organisation.
It will be important to retain a balance between protecting creditors, a flexible company structure, and ensuring the security of business transactions.
In the interests of protecting the flexibility of such undertakings, provision must be made for ensuring ease of transformations such as mergers or changing the registered office.
Therefore, there is every justification for the European Parliament's initiative containing recommendations to the Commission on the European Private Company Statute.
(PL) Madam President, there are several reasons why the development of a European Private Company Statute is such a crucial project for accelerating the economic growth of the European Union.
Firstly, measured in terms of GDP growth, the rate of economic growth of the United States is more than twice that of the European Union.
This has been the case for many years.
In addition, the rate of economic growth of the countries of South-East Asia is several times higher than that of the Union.
Secondly, many internal barriers still persist within the common market created by the free movement of capital, goods and services.
Thirdly, the draft European Private Company Statute is aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the cornerstone of the economies of all the Member States of the European Union.
Fourthly, a European Private Company would be a very useful instrument for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, which places great emphasis on eliminating obstacles to the development of European entrepreneurship.
These reasons alone justify supporting the development of a European Private Company Statute.
It is important, however, not to repeat the mistakes made when drawing up the European Company Statute.
The market has refused to accept the European Company as a company form, despite the long and difficult process involved in developing this statute.
An effort must therefore be made to ensure that the European Private Company Statute contains the minimum number of references to the national legislation of individual Member States, so that it is relatively flexible in nature and provides security for both owners and contractors.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislative proposal on the European private company statute is very important.
It is, in fact, crucial not only to remove barriers to trade but also to develop the factor of production at Community level.
To that end, there is undoubtedly a need to create unitary legal entities in order to overcome the current legal uncertainty.
It should not be forgotten, however, that, as well as trying to make markets transparent and to protect savers, the company law reform will also directly affect the future of the European social model.
Therefore, if allowing companies to move wherever they like in order to take advantage of the single market is a legitimate aim, it must be fulfilled by giving our workers the same transnational rights.
That was the thinking behind some of my amendments, certain of which were accepted, which were aimed at safeguarding the rights to codetermination, information and consultation that exist at the time of a company's turning into a European private company.
We are talking here about an important adjustment that will mean more careful attention being paid to aspects relating to the strengthening of social Europe, one of the fundamental elements of which must be worker participation.
We therefore endorse this important proposal and we thank Mr Lehne for his work.
We would point out to the Commission that, if allowing companies to move wherever they like in order to take advantage of the single market is a legitimate aim, it must be fulfilled without the demands of the market prejudicing those of social equality.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Members very much for their comments on this important topic.
The growth of small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial for the competitiveness of the European economy.
It is, therefore, necessary to facilitate the expansion of these small businesses.
Looking at the legal form of companies that operate across borders can make an important contribution to this.
I will take Mr Lehne's report into account.
As it is under Article 192 of the Treaty, we are bound to do it in a prompt manner.
But even if it was not under that article, I will still deal with it in as prompt a manner as possible.
I give you that commitment.
Commissioner, I should like to thank you for your participation in the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(FR) The creation of the European private company statute has the support of both the Member States and industry, and I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and his pragmatic recommendations.
I am very much in favour of the creation of this statute for at least two reasons.
Firstly, because the adoption of this statute will help remove one of the obstacles to SMEs' mobility.
All too often, company founders are reluctant to do business because they do not understand the legal environment very well, particularly when they establish themselves in another Member State.
Next, this statute will enable us significantly to enhance legal transparency and thus to build confidence among the various economic players.
The fact is that confidence is crucial in trade relations and forms the basis for a prosperous economy.
I am therefore in favour of Mr Lehne's report, with one exception: its recommendation 7.
Including legally reprehensible behaviour in the private company statute would mean amending Title VI of the Treaty and unnecessarily complicating the link between the statute and our national laws.
I therefore feel that this provision runs counter to the objectives of the European private company statute: to produce better legislation and to make European entrepreneurs' lives easier.
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) (debate)
The next item is oral question to the Commission on the renegotiation of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0450/2006).
author. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are putting this oral question on the renegotiation of the Government Procurement Agreement, which will end in March, because we are at a crucial moment.
Furthermore, in view of the importance of that agreement and its period in force, which will once again be ten or twelve years, it became necessary to raise the issue with the Commission here in Parliament.
The government procurement markets are becoming increasingly important in the world, in view of their volume, which may be up to 25% of world GDP and, furthermore, because they represent a comparative advantage for the European Union, since at the moment we can be competitive in this sector compared to the competition that we are facing from other countries in other sectors, such as agriculture and industry.
If we want to adapt to globalisation, therefore, it is important that the European Union develop the sectors in which it can be competitive internationally and thereby create fair and favourable conditions for European companies.
In most countries, these markets are reserved for national companies, which is one of the main non-tariff barriers to international trade.
There are two aspects in this renegotiation that I would stress in particular.
Firstly, the geographical extension of this agreement, with the entry of significant players, such as China and the developing countries, and, secondly, the need to ensure fair, balanced and reciprocal conditions for the companies of the different countries.
With regard to the first point, the greater the geographical area covered by this agreement on government procurement the more valid it is.
Parliament therefore wishes to know whether any new countries are interested in signing up to the agreement in the short term, and particularly whether we can expect substantial commitments from China in relation to the opening up of its public markets.
Let us not forget that China committed itself to opening up its government procurement market - which largely remains closed, or has requirements that are unacceptable to European companies - and to beginning negotiations in 2008 on accession to the Government Procurement Agreement, following its accession to the World Trade Organisation.
Secondly, with regard to fair and reciprocal conditions, we must remember that the European Union's public markets are already very much opened up to international competition.
This has considerable advantages for the public bodies awarding contracts, since this openness gives them greater choice and therefore makes it possible for them to find better quality goods and services at lower cost.
Let us not forget, however, that this may harm European companies in cases where foreign competitors are preferred.
The Union's trade policy is geared towards greater opening up of all aspects of the international markets.
The solution is not therefore to close the public markets to foreign companies.
For this reason, we have the legitimate right to demand that our companies enjoy similar conditions of access to the public markets of our main trading partners, whose companies currently enjoy access to our public markets.
That is not currently the case, however, since the commitments made by our trading partners are very limited compared to those made by the European Union.
Commissioner Mandelson also referred to this imbalance in his communication on a competitive Europe in a globalised economy.
In it, he suggests the possibility of introducing concrete restrictions to access to certain sections of the Union's public markets, with the aim of persuading our trading partners to open up their markets in a reciprocal manner.
Having said all of that, I consider this oral question on behalf of the Committee on International Trade to the European Commission, calling upon it to explain its strategy in this renegotiation of the agreement, to be timely - and hence more than appropriate.
I would repeat that we are at a crucial time, since we need to reach an agreement over the coming weeks.
How is the Commission going to defend the interests of European companies in the markets of sectors in which we are highly competitive, such as transport, energy and public works, within the context of the objective of continuing along the path towards greater commercial openness, and not the reverse?
Within this context, how are we going to deal with the situation of European SMEs, which are already at a disadvantage compared to large companies, compared to the situation of other SMEs in other countries whose governments reserve a proportion of their public contracts for them, as in the case of the United States?
In view of the lack of reciprocal arrangements, the disadvantages faced by European SMEs and their importance in terms of the main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, we would call upon the Commission to demand that the other parties in the negotiation remove their exceptions or, if that is not possible, to accept our application of an exception of this same kind in favour of European SMEs.
In any event, we need that kind of reciprocal arrangement since European companies are currently at a disadvantage.
I would therefore ask the Commission to tell us how the negotiations are progressing, particularly with regard to the issues that I have raised and those referred to in the text of our question.
I would also ask the Commission to take note of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament and to take them into account in its negotiations in Geneva.
Madam President, the issue of the renegotiation of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, known as the GPA, is important for Europe as it should provide our companies with future opportunities outside the Community.
Last December, after many years of long and difficult negotiations, the GPA parties reached a provisional understanding on a new revised text.
I consider this to be a major achievement in the current context of the Doha Round. It demonstrates that the political will to reach an understanding on sensitive issues remains alive.
The new text provides for more clarity and transparency, as well as better guarantees for equal treatment in the procurement procedures.
It includes, for the first time, provisions for conducting electronic procurement.
The European Community played an important role during the negotiations.
The existing agreement is unbalanced, both in terms of procedural guarantees and coverage.
Our main objectives were to fill the gaps and to eliminate ambiguities.
We wanted to obtain better legal guarantees for our suppliers, similar to those offered by our internal regime.
At the same time we sought to make the new agreement more attractive for developing countries via new specific measures.
The final agreement on the new text is subject to a satisfactory outcome of the market access negotiations which are ongoing.
Here as well, we need to rebalance the situation in favour of the Community.
Hence the coverage our partners currently offer should be extended to the level the Community has offered and it should be more uniform.
We all want to see improved access for our companies to foreign countries' procurement markets.
The Council emphasised in its recent conclusions on the Commission's communication 'Global Europe - Competing in the World' that we need to achieve additional improvements in market access with our future major trading partners, namely in public procurement.
The Community has submitted a comprehensive request and offer which will give the other GPA parties all the necessary incentives to offer significant additional procurement opportunities.
Should we fail to get a substantial improvement from other GPA parties, we will consider taking the necessary measures to adapt the Community commitments in the new GPA accordingly.
In the absence of improved access for the EU to third-country procurement markets, Commissioner Mandelson and I are reflecting on a market-opening instrument to enhance EU access.
The case of our SMEs certainly deserves particular attention.
It will specifically benefit from the new text, with the introduction of rules on electronic procurement and, if negotiations are completed successfully, the lowering of thresholds of some parties.
However, let me remind you that the agreement deals with rather large procurement contracts which are mainly undertaken by big companies.
SMEs certainly have an important role to play, but mostly as subcontractors.
This is why we have asked our GPA partners who currently maintain specific derogations for their domestic SMEs to abandon them.
On the prospects of extending the geographical scope of the agreement, eight WTO members are in the process of acceding to it.
Among those, Jordan is the most advanced.
China has indicated that it will start accession negotiations by December this year and, following my visit there last year, we are already preparing this important accession.
As already mentioned, the Community has pushed for better provisions on the special and differential treatment for developing countries.
I believe we have achieved a good result with tailor-made new rules that fully take their specific needs into account.
I am confident that if we succeed, this new agreement will constitute a milestone for international trade and create new opportunities for our companies.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start by congratulating my esteemed colleague, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, and by thanking him for having asked, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, this oral question on the negotiations under way at the World Trade Organisation regarding the rules on access to public contracts.
We need derogations for small and medium-sized enterprises, Commissioner.
The subject bringing us together today is a crucial issue as far as growth and employment in Europe are concerned.
The WTO rules on trade in goods and services do not apply to purchases made by a State for its own use, that is to say to public procurement.
That is why some countries, operating just outside the Marrakech agreements of April 1994, have voluntarily signed a special annex containing an agreement on public procurement.
With the exception of the European Union, all the major countries participating in this agreement - Canada, Korea, the United States and Japan - have excluded from their offer contracts that they reserve for their SMEs.
This imbalance is unacceptable, and the public contracts that have thus been excluded are precisely those that concern our small and medium-sized enterprises, while the SMEs from those countries have unrestricted access to all our public contracts.
Our SMEs are thus under-represented where public procurement is concerned, and we need to launch a broad debate on the reasons for this.
We need to put right this imbalance by obtaining a derogation on public procurement that favours European SMEs.
We cannot accept distortions of this kind.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over and above this negotiation, the issue at stake is the will of the European Union to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with the favourable environment that they need and to use access to public procurement as an extraordinary lever for growth and employment; also at stake is the need to provide legal certainty, within the European Union, between the international legal system, European law and national laws.
We are not talking here about protectionism; quite the contrary, we are talking about increasing the supply by having more businesses to meet the demand.
Commissioner, there are three areas on the planet today: Asia, excluding Japan, which has poor countries but strong growth; the United States, which is a rich country with strong growth; and Europe, which has rich countries but weak growth.
We need to reflect.
When we regulated the internal market by voting for the Services Directive, we built this market on the laws of competition, and the European Union took a great interest in consumers.
We now need to take an interest in our manufacturers.
The renegotiation of the multilateral agreement on public procurement that is currently under way at the WTO is, in our view, an extraordinary opportunity to act and to reflect on the place occupied by SMEs in terms of accessing public contracts.
We need, Commissioner, to give the internal market the gift of a European Small Business Act that includes social market economy considerations.
The debate is open, and I welcome that.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair.
What is interesting and fascinating about this debate is that we are talking about a plurilateral agreement that is very specific in character.
It is, of course, part of the multilateral framework but, as it is plurilateral in character, it allows much more flexibility for those Member States that are part of this agreement.
With regard to this, and as it is its tenth anniversary, could the Commissioner tell us a little bit about it: how it worked in the past, whether he is satisfied with it and thinks it is a worthwhile undertaking that is worth renegotiating.
It is not part of his portfolio, but does he consider that it is also worthwhile renegotiating the telecoms agreement, which is also ten years old this year?
With regard to the agreement on government procurement - which Mr Audy mentioned - we are very concerned about SMEs, because we know by experience that they are definitely having much more difficulty in accessing international markets.
What is the Commission going to do about it beyond what has been done in the past?
China is of great concern.
We are happy to have China as part of the global environment, but it puts a lot of pressure on some companies.
So once China becomes a member of the plurilateral agreement, what safeguards will the Commissioner put in place to safeguard the interests of European companies and workers?
How much is this exercise part of global Europe?
How much is it related to the new approach from the Commission agreeing on different bilateral agreements and what will be part of this connection?
With regard to services of general interest, how, again, will the Commissioner ensure that European interests will be safeguarded?
Can the Commissioner tell us more about that?
He has not touched on that.
Finally, can the Commissioner ensure that Parliament will be kept informed?
Can he promise that the Committee on International Trade, which has just elected its new chairman this morning, will also be kept informed?
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, it is entirely appropriate for the House to be dealing with the question of the greater liberalisation of public procurement markets today, and I believe it is regrettable that the same determination was lacking when we debated the liberalisation of services across our continent.
Essentially, the issues are the same.
It is right to consider extending the geographical scope of the GPA, and it is unfortunate that we did not seize the opportunity of significantly deepening our services market a few months ago.
Both cases involve more than just measures to help the operation of the larger European companies.
There is a particular emphasis on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I support contract negotiations that will allow us to participate in the Chinese public procurement market, but it is also important to bear in mind the actual opportunities for participation in the European market for the other side, as Mrs Mann just mentioned.
As far as our Chinese partners are concerned, there are two sides to this coin, and it seems to me that we should also take into account the specific challenges that exist for the European market in this area.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, congratulations!
It is very good to see you in the Chair.
Commissioner McCreevy, I too should like to start off by talking about how best we support small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am very pleased that there seems to be a concern right across the different political groups of this House.
I think we all share that.
I would like to ask first of all for some clarification of remarks made by the French Trade Minister, Christine Lagarde, when she came to Parliament's Committee on International Trade just last week.
She spoke very passionately and rightly, I believe, about the importance of defending small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe.
And yet you, Commissioner, seem to have a very different view of the role of SMEs and how best to support them.
Guaranteeing better access to public procurement contracts for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises is essential.
They represent 75 million jobs in the Union and 50% of Community GNI, and they are a vital component of thriving local and regional economies all around the EU.
But it seems that the Commission is voluntarily giving up the right to support its SMEs.
There are already five countries- Canada, the US, Israel, Japan and South Korea - that will introduce provisions into their legislation which give privileged access to SMEs for public procurement, and yet the EU, bizarrely, has decided it has no interest in standing up for its own SMEs.
So Commissioner, can you really justify this position?
For the EU to forego the right to a level playing field which would allow SMEs to have an equal opportunity to compete like the large multinationals seems both extraordinary and indeed unacceptable.
Surely we too should be using the renegotiation of the GPA in Geneva to break down the WTO barriers which prevent Member States from implementing a privileged access measure for SMEs should they so wish.
We too should be arguing for derogations as part of the revised GPA to allow us to bring in preferential measures, and by doing this we are simply restoring equality of treatment in order to prevent the large multinational corporations from having all of the advantages.
I very much regret as well that we have not had the opportunity for a prior debate really in Europe about whether it is appropriate to try to extend international trade rules to cover government procurement at all.
Many would argue that government procurement has little or nothing to do with traditional matters of trade, tariffs and quotas, and that it is an unacceptable area for negotiations at the WTO, because subjecting government procurement at the national, local or regional level to one-size-fits-all rules at a global level on how taxpayers' funds are spent I think destroys citizens' reasonable expectations that they should have a level of democratic accountability over how their money is spent.
Essentially, taxpayers' money is different from private, corporate money, and citizens rightly expect that they should have the right, for example, to lobby to cut off expenditure on companies that were doing business in South Africa when there was apartheid, or to disqualify companies with bad labour or environmental records.
I believe we have a really important role to play in defending local sourcing and procurement as a vital instrument of local employment and industrial policy.

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President - with my warm congratulations on your election, Commissioner, the Government Procurement Agreement has hitherto applied only to the OECD states, and their expenditure on public contracts in respect of supplies, services and building works make up something between 10% and 25% of their GDP.
China has now been giving consideration to the possibility of joining them.
The renewed negotiations currently in progress are, in general, aimed at extending the scope of the Agreement, and that would, of course, give it a vast amount of added significance in terms of the international exchange of goods and services.
While the Commission must certainly, in the revision process, seek to improve transparency and combat corruption in international public procurement, the urgent environmental challenges mean that ecological sustainability in the public sector must be given high priority, and that, as I understand it, means that regulation is needed to deal with it.
It must, for example, be lawful and legitimate, when awarding state contracts, for preference to be given to environmentally friendly goods and services, even if they are minimally more expensive.
One crucial question is how one deals with developing countries.
It needs to be ensured that public procurement, in the same way as the other Singapore issues, is dealt with absolutely independently of the current Doha development round negotiations, the need for which was expressed very clearly by the developing countries at CancÃºn.
The document that we are talking about - the one that is due to be renegotiated - can in fact only apply to partners of comparable strength, and so I see something problematic in the idea of non-discrimination or reciprocity, which seem to me once more to tend towards treating highly industrialised countries and developing countries in exactly the same way, which does not work.
The proposed provisions for developing countries, involving a transitional period of three years - or five for the least developed - are quite utterly inadequate when it comes to persuading them to sign up to the Agreement.
I think one regrettable consequence of this is that many of these countries will give this Agreement a wide berth, which I, in principle, regard as a disgrace when this is meant to be being handled plurilaterally.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the debate we are having about this oral question epitomises so much of what is wrong with the European Union.
Firstly, we have to deal with the WTO through one man who represents no less than 27 nations.
He has no popular mandate and in the light of his record in British politics would not have been chosen to run a village fÃªte.
I do not want an EU representative to speak for my country at the WTO.
I want a representative of Her Majesty's Government who not only knows my country but cares for it too.
Then there is the whole issue of competitive tendering.
China was mentioned as a potential provider in the oral question and it may well be highly competitive.
Whilst I condemn the suppression of individual freedoms and rights in China, the Chinese know a few things about running a successful economy.
Government spending is only some 20% of GDP, whereas in the eurozone it was 47.5% in 2005.
In China, business runs with a light regulatory touch.
In the European Union, we are regulating ourselves to death.
In 2005 Mr Blair promised that the British Presidency would cut red tape.
It did nothing of the sort.
How many thousands of pages did it add to the mountain of legislation?
My country was hoodwinked into joining the European Union in 1973 on the basis of it being just a free trade area.
This is all it should be: no Parliament, no Commission, no directives.
Instead it has become a bureaucratic monster which is wrecking our economy.
(EL) Mr President, provisional agreement has already been reached on the revised text of the Public Procurement Agreement and is expected to be reached on the final agreement.
I respect the need for negotiations to be carried out in secret, but do you not think, Commissioner, that you have been late informing the European Parliament about the priorities, demands and offers of the Union during the renegotiation of this important agreement?
I think that the Union's basic negotiating principle should be reciprocity and the achievement of a balanced result between the trading partners.
The balanced result should not be at the level of theoretical commitments between the trading partners on behalf of the other partners.
It must be evaluated at the level of the real facility to make full use of the volume of invitations to tender subject to cross-border competition.
Has the Commission prepared studies on the real access of European undertakings to the market of the other states from the application of the agreement so far?
The USA, Canada, South Korea and Japan - the parties to the agreement - have already safeguarded preferential access for small- and medium-sized enterprises to the public procurement market.
Paradoxically, however, the Union has not.
I believe the European Union should demand an exemption within the framework of the application of the Public Procurement Agreement for small and medium-sized enterprises.
This demand is reasonable, especially as our partners have already acted.
Small- and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and an important source of development and employment, as both Mr Varela, the author, and Mr Audy have emphasised.
They contribute to economic and social cohesion.
We have an obligation to take initiatives that will safeguard their dynamic role.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your appointment.
I am not going to speak about SMEs because many of my colleagues have already done so, but I want to emphasise and agree with them that this is an extremely important issue.
Government procurement accounts for 20% of GDP in developing countries and around 15% of GDP in developed countries.
I feel a little bit Janus-faced on this issue, because intuitively I am in favour of opening up public procurement to competition.
It should in theory reduce government costs and increase transparency in government procurement and therefore cut out corruption.
That should bring benefits both to the developed and the developing world and, in the developing world, would free up resources for health and education.
However, if you look at the list of those who have signed up for GPA, there is not a single African country among the 36.
It is clear that the African countries and other LDCs feel that the costs potentially outweigh the benefits of signing up to this agreement.
I would ask the Commission what support could it plan to give, firstly, African and other LDC countries to enable them to compete in the European market and the other developed markets on a fair footing and what assistance can they be given to develop their own industry so that they can sustain competition inside their own country if they sign up for opening of the government procurement contracts.
I also worry, as Mrs Lucas has indicated in a slightly different way, how non-trade issues will be taken into account in GPA and the application of GPA, how issues like the environment, human rights and labour rights will be taken into account.
I agree with Mrs Lucas that this is public money and that there is a danger, if we simply have GPA without any conditions, that labour and environmental standards could be driven down.
On the one hand I can see the advantage of opening up public procurement, but it is fraught with dangers and I hope the Commission will examine these issues.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate you once again, and to thank the Commissioner.
In Britain, SMEs are unfairly shut out of public procurement due to well-meaning requirements such as corporate social responsibility and environmental standards; quite often a requirement for three years of audited accounts, which many small businesses cannot meet; a lack of competitive tendering; the bundling of contracts that become too big for SMEs and favour the large companies; and secrecy and a lack of transparency.
We know that the EU directive requires transparency and competitive tendering, but most contracts that SMEs bid for are quite often below the threshold.
So when you speak to SMEs and ask them what they want to see, they say they want to see a cut in bureaucracy and paperwork.
They want to see authorities avoiding the one-size-fits-all requirement for certification.
They want to see contracts advertised on websites such as 'supply2.gov', and they also want to see unbundled contracts.
But we have to recognise that government departments are not commercial organisations and will often want to seek to avoid the extra work involved in multiple tenders, so we therefore need to provide incentives for governments and local government.
In America, targets have been provided as to whether fair competition actually does or does not exist.
SMEs do not require quotas, but they need a performance metric to see whether there is fair competition.
Also in America there are small SME advisers helping the government to enable SMEs to have fair access.
These requirements - benchmarks and competition advocates - would probably not be allowed under the WTO agreement, and I understand the reason, but it does unintentionally forbid measures which ensure fair competition.
The WTO agreement is actually generally positive, as it is anti-protectionist, but it forbids measures which are needed to help small businesses.
So while some Member States want an opt-out, others rightly fear that this would increase protectionism.
Therefore, let us call on the Commission to seek a compromise whereby an opt-out is secured, but a new agreement is drafted to allow SME-friendly measures and to greatly extend anti-protectionist measures.
If we allow SME-friendly measures, the agreement would remove America's reasons for its opt-out, which has been used to retain the Buy America Act.
It would also help British and European SMEs to compete globally.
(NL) Mr President, a Government Procurement Agreement could mean more transparency and thus less corruption.
It could also mean fair prices - which is not unimportant given that public service contracts involve taxpayers' money - with the right, though, to include social and environmental criteria at the tendering stage.
Developing countries could also benefit enormously from all these advantages.
Needless to say, their participation in the international Government Procurement Agreement in future cannot be ruled out, but the Commission should ensure that they can implement this method - and the same applies to fair competition rules - nationally or regionally at first, just as we did in Europe, and do not need, therefore, to allow in the entire world and the large monopolies straight away.
It would then have to be up to the developing countries to determine when they would feel sufficiently developed.
Something that, in fact, applies the world over, is that forced large-scale tenders, as a result of which the small and medium-sized enterprises are pushed out of the market, should be avoided at all costs.
Unfortunately, I have first-hand experience of exactly that at a train station in Amsterdam where the train station's security service was put out to tender.
The company that was previously responsible for the station's security was a small company and was doing an excellent job.
During tender, however, this company proved too small to compete for the total tender for many of those stations and was elbowed out of the market, therefore.
My fellow Members have undoubtedly come across similar examples, and that is why we would like to ask the Commission how the SMEs can be guaranteed better access to procurement contracts.
Finally, the forced break-up of the national and semi-public provisions for the sake of large foreign suppliers is fundamentally wrong.
Every country has the right to regulate publicly what the public would like to retain.
We are talking about basic provisions here, like education and water, provisions that are at the heart of society and that should not be messed with.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, it is because the question raised by the Committee on International Trade on the problem of procurement at WTO level directly affects the European internal market that I believe that we have to consider these more closely.
Of course, on the one hand, it is the WTO agreement that is at issue here, but, on the other, it must also be clear to us that these international treaties - as is the way of things with globalisation - have direct effects on the European internal market.
Mr Kamall pointed out that, in a number of WTO member states, the United States of America being one of them, certain quotas are to be adhered to even now in the award of national contracts to small and medium-sized enterprises, which means, at the end of the day, nothing other than that the scope of the procurement regulation laid down by the WTO is being restricted.
I would like to see an impact assessment indicating whether or not this is of any long-term benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises; that it is, in any case, not certain.
As long as we do not know that for certain, we do not need to worry about the limitation of scope, for it is of course the case that small and medium-sized enterprises live from markets that are as transparent as possible and that they find easiest to access, and if the WTO member states reduce the scope by a quarter, I do not know whether small and medium-sized businesses actually derive any benefit from that.
It would surely be a worthwhile exercise - and it is with this in mind that I, too, support this question - if the Commission were to be able to examine this closely and show us whether this does have positive effects on small and medium-sized businesses.
In the Council, of course - none of whose representatives are, alas, present - a balance must be found between those who would favour an approach like that of the USA and those who want to see the precise opposite of that, that is to say, the reduction of quotas to create a free and open market right across the WTO, giving small and medium-sized enterprises a chance everywhere.
It is for that reason that I believe that the crucial problem for small and medium-sized enterprises in this respect is much more that we have not yet really got a handle on the problem of sub-contractors, for it is in that capacity that small and medium-sized enterprises are often used, being in that way able to create jobs and have the chance to earn money, but they are, ultimately, managed from higher up and that often puts them in a difficult position, with their feet in two different camps.
What I think we should do is give this problem, in particular, closer attention, and so I would be glad if the Commission were to give some thought to this and keep us up to speed with what is going on.
In other words, it should start by addressing the problem to which this question refers and then we can make definite demands of the Commissioner.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and to thank him for having submitted his question, which gives us a means of addressing the issue at stake.
I was rapporteur in this House on the reform of contracts, supplies and services, in this case Directives 17 and 18.
Even though there is very little time, I think that it is worth pointing out the main aspects of the problem.
As I have heard some speakers say this morning, Parliament has very much focused Directive 18, or the general directive on contracts, on environmental issues, the updated system of electronic contracts, the social sphere and the issue of thresholds, and I therefore believe that we have legislation that is without doubt exceptional, but that does not actually concern this morning's subject matter.
The issue raised is completely different: a review is under way of an international agreement that places EU countries - and therefore EU businesses - at a disadvantage compared with others.
What is the problem?
In 1994 and in subsequent years, very different types of activity were planned worldwide through plurilateral agreements.
The United States, China and other countries in reality enjoy privileges that are not enjoyed by EU businesses.
This system is now being reviewed, but the methods of reviewing it need to be laid down, because, as my fellow Members and I myself should recall, the United States alone has an annual output of almost USD 200 billion, a sum that actually remains within the United States.
The point is that, while anyone can come and work in Europe, our small and medium-sized enterprises cannot go and set up business in the rest of the world.
The GPA agreements are, among other things, agreements that deny European businesses access to the international system.
What decisions can therefore be made today?
As I see it, the Commission believes that, by abolishing the privileges of others, we can compete once again on an equal footing.
That is not so.
I believe that we need instead to protect Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises, by guaranteeing them the same privileges within the European Union and thus with regard to the European Union that are enjoyed by small and medium-sized enterprises from the United States and from other countries in the world.
Therefore, not only am I grateful to Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, but I am also of the opinion that the argument being upheld by France at the moment within the Council should definitely be favoured and supported over the European Commission's position.
Mr President, I should like to thank all Members for their comments.
I attach the utmost importance to public procurement.
Proper, fair and transparent procedures are crucial not only for businesses that want to bid for projects but also for authorities that would be able to save themselves and taxpayers huge amounts of money if they applied the procedures properly.
Getting commitments from our trading partners to open their procurement market for European bidders is essential.
Our companies have something to offer.
They are competitive, but too often they are simply not allowed or invited to make a bid.
SMEs benefit from public procurement.
They already have a big share of the market, but I do not think that setting aside quotas or giving preferential treatment is the answer.
If we were to do that, so would more of our trading partners and the result would be that European companies would lose out.
I believe that all sides are best served by open markets.
Our SMEs are dynamic and strong.
They will benefit as well.
Mrs Mann asked to be kept informed.
I shall ask my officials to keep her committee closely informed.
They will attend meetings of the committee and will answer your questions about the details of the negotiations.
Various Members referred to special arrangements for SMEs and that this should be part of our negotiating stance.
As I have said, I do not agree.
I agree with a lot of what Mr Kamall said, and his observation that Member States themselves could do a lot to assist their SMEs in the area of public procurement without contravening any rules at all.
If they unbundled some of their contracts and cut out a lot of the bureaucracy, that would benefit SMEs substantially, and would not require the setting-aside of quotas.
Where I would disagree is with the conclusion drawn by some people that the way to do this better for SMEs is to set aside quotas.
Mr Kamall also raised the issue of the United States having a Small Business Act and an agency to deal with these matters.
However, the figures show that, either in volume or in quantity terms, SMEs in Europe get a far higher percentage of contracts than they do in the United States.
That should be of some interest to people.
Therefore, I say - and people are entitled to disagree with my views on this - that public procurement is all about competing: the best goods and services for the lowest amount.
That means value for money.
Reserving parts of the market underlines this.
We were also discussing SMEs in an earlier debate this morning.
Members said that SMEs need opportunities.
I certainly agree.
However, protectionism is not the answer.
But, of course, we will not be naive: we expect our trading partners to open their markets as well.
We shall suspend the sitting and resume at 11.00 a.m. for the formal sitting with the President of Bulgaria.

Human rights of the Dalits in India (vote)
(DE) Mr President, I would like to suggest that we avail ourselves of the option provided by Rule 168(2) of our Rules of Procedure and send this report back to the committee.
The reason I have for saying this is that I am familiar with the problem of Article 90 and that this report surely describes the situation of the Dalits, India's so-called untouchables, in accurate terms, it is no less apparent that nobody among us finds these conditions tolerable, and we are obliged to do whatever we can about them.
However, it also appears that India has raised serious objections to this report on the grounds that it discusses the caste system in India and hence something that is part and parcel of that country's traditions and culture.
I would, then, ask that consideration be given to whether it might be well-advised, in the interests of what we are trying to do, to discuss this again in the committee, even if what emerges from it later on differs from the present motion for a resolution in no respect whatever.
We would, however, be well advised to talk to the Indian authorities again, since it is all too often we Europeans who wag the finger at others and tell them what to do, which tends to hinder us from achieving the objectives we seek, so I put it to the House that this would be a wiser course of action.
(DE) Mr President, unless my ears deceive me, you said that this act, under Rule 90, is adopted, in the absence of any objection to it.
Secondly, embassies keep on interfering in what we do; in this instance it is the Indian embassy doing it, but we speak for a people rather than for any embassy, and so we should stick with the resolution as it stands.
Mr President, I have an altogether different point to make.
I was the Vice-President of the Human Rights Sub-Committee and the deputy coordinator in the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the time when this report went through the Development Committee.
It is primarily a human rights report.
The opinion of neither Foreign Affairs nor Human Rights was sought on this.
We have had no opportunity to amend it.
It is a human rights report going through Development.
It is not within that committee's remit.
It is not just a question of the Government of India, it is a question of procedure.
How can we have a report going through Plenary without a vote or an opportunity to amend it when the committees with the main responsibilities for the issue have never seen the report, have never had an opportunity to correct factual inaccuracies?
It is not factually correct!
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, as Mr Swoboda has said, it has already been adopted, so the debate is over, and all other deliberations are superfluous.
If Mr Nassauer and Mr Tannock want to produce another report, they will have to start from the very beginning, and we will vote on it five years from now.
Mr President, as a negotiator on this report in the Development Committee, I recognise the point made by my colleague Mr Tannock, because if we have a Human Rights Sub-Committee, this report should have gone to that committee for comment.
It only went through the Development Committee, but it should have gone to the Human Rights Sub-Committee because this is fundamentally a human rights report.
Therefore I recommend that we send the report back to committee and ask the Sub-Committee on Human Rights of the Foreign Affairs Committee to give an opinion on it.
(Applause)
Mr President, speaking as chair of the SAARC Delegation, I recognise that this is a very delicate report.
However, we also have to recognise that there are factual inaccuracies in here.
For procedural reasons, this report was approved in the Committee on Development on 19 December 2006 and the deadline was 15 January 2007.
Most of the intervening period was taken up by the Christmas break.
We have looked into the issues; we have had several meetings; we have opinions; and I would ask, as a delegation chair, that we have an opportunity to make our view heard.
I would support referral back to committee.
You cannot have a report without any debate or any vote.
It is short-circuiting the democratic scrutiny process and I think it is important that we do credit to this House.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply saddened by the example we are setting regarding a resolution that we have debated thoroughly within the Committee on Development and on which we have had time to table amendments.
This is an issue that does not interfere - certainly no more so than many other far more forceful resolutions adopted by this House - in China's internal affairs.
We know perfectly well that the caste issue is an extremely sensitive one, but we have listened to the Dalits, who do not just live in India, but in many other countries too: we are talking about millions of people who live in degrading and inhuman conditions.
I am sorry but I really think that our Parliament is setting a very bad example and, as with all the other resolutions that are being voted on, I believe that this resolution, being, as it is, a resolution voted on by the Committee on Development, should be voted on in Parliament, since it concerns a problem of human dignity and of the right of millions of people to live, and to have their lives and their dignity respected.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, we must do as the law says.
I shall now read out to you Rule 90(4), and I ask you to listen carefully, for this is pretty difficult legalese, but this is the Rule to which the President has to keep, for the President must be guided by the law as it stands.
Rule 90 (4) states that: 'Recommendations drawn up in this way shall be included on the agenda for the next part-session.
In urgent cases decided upon by the President, recommendations may be included on the agenda of a current part-session.
Recommendations shall be deemed adopted unless, before the beginning of the part-session, at least forty Members submit a written objection, in which case the committee's recommendations shall be included on the agenda of the same part-session for debate and voting.
A political group or at least 40 Members may table amendments.'
I have to say at this point - and I am keeping to the law, as I am required to do - that no written motion has been submitted by 40 Members prior to this sitting, and so my recommendation is that the relevant committee should continue to discuss this issue - which is a very delicate one - and, should they come up with another result at some other point in time, that is in order, but right now, I have to do as the House's rules require.
(Applause)
