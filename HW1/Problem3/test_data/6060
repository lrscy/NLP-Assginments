According to the available data, 70% of revenue comes from cross-border tourism in the European Union, in other words, from tourists from other EU Member States.
Secondly, we should not be focusing solely on the euro-dollar exchange rate.
Calculations of the effective euro exchange rate show that the overall trend is far less dramatic.
The euro's rise against the Chinese yuan, for example, was much less pronounced this year, and yet revenue from tourists from non-EU countries barely doubled in the years between 1995 and 2005, whereas the revenue attributable to tourists from China increased twelve-fold over the same period.
The Commission is aware that price is a key competition factor.
Nonetheless, the Commission's vision for European tourism in the future, as presented in its recently adopted communication, is based on high quality, not low cost.
We are convinced that even with a strong euro, Europe will still be the world's number one destination if Europe makes the best possible use of its advantages: its heritage, its beautiful natural environment, its geographical concentration of attractive sites and its reputation for a high level of service.
(ES) Madam President, the Commissioner's last statements are at odds with reality.
What is happening at this moment in time is that a large slice of intra-European tourism is heading for countries outside the European zone - the Caribbean, the developing world, the Far East, Africa - largely due to this increase in the value of our European currency.
Moreover, there are plans to introduce new measures that will also work against European tourism, such as compensation to businesses arising from CO2 emissions.
In other words, it would appear that there are many factors jeopardising European tourism, and there does not currently seem to be any indication of a European policy concerning tourism.
This is apparently still an issue for national governments, and I wish to ask the Commissioner whether he feels that the Commission can encourage some kind of European policy to counteract this obvious trend towards a decrease in the competitiveness of European tourism.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) I am afraid that the honourable Member and I may have to agree to disagree.
As you know, just a few days ago a major European tourism conference was held in Portugal and all these issues were discussed in detail there.
The conference brought together 500 leading specialists from all over Europe and I did not have the impression from that conference that the European tourism industry or, indeed, the Member States are worried about Europe losing its lustre as a tourist destination.
The figures we have available do not bear out what the honourable Member has said, namely that we are facing a particularly serious situation.
Let me say again: of course exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on price, but what Europe offers visitors from other countries is not determined primarily by price.
The decision to travel to Europe is not a decision which is influenced mainly by price but by the quality of what Europe has to offer.
Nonetheless, I agree with the honourable Member that we must pay very close attention to the burdens placed on the European tourism industry and ensure that framework conditions are put in place that allow this industry to capitalise in real terms on the massive growth and employment potential that it has to offer.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Thank you very much for your question, which gives me an opportunity to highlight the situation in the Maldives.
As President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom stressed at the recent United Nations Summit, the Maldives, which are no more than 1.5 metres above sea level, are threatened by the continuous rise in the level of the oceans as a result of climate warming.
This has forced more than 300 000 refugees to leave the islands.
Therefore, as the honourable Member has quite rightly pointed out, inviting the President of the Maldives gives us an opportunity to highlight the danger that now threatens the people of those islands.
Moreover, the Maldives have always played an active role in international conferences on less-developed countries and small island developing countries.
This diligence was confirmed when the Maldives attended the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which was hosted by the European Parliament in 2001, and again when the Maldives took on the important role of chairing the group of experts at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
As far as the political situation in the Maldives is concerned, and in line with the statement by the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Commission welcomes the recent political developments in the Maldives and is pleased with the reforms that have been introduced to date.
The publication of the roadmap for the reform programme in 2006 was indeed good news.
The elections due to be held next year, in 2008, will be an important step towards greater democracy.
The Commission is ready to lend its support to the reform process, including the provision of special assistance for the 2008 elections.
Of course we remain vigilant when it comes to the issue of human rights.
The Commission has been satisfied with the recent improvements, including the release last year of two important activists: Jennifer Latheef and Mohammed Nasheed.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your reply.
I have heard from the NGOs that attended the European Development Days that they were very satisfied with the initiative, and the resolutions that followed it, so congratulations as far as that goes.
However, I am still not entirely satisfied.
You say that the political situation in the Maldives is improving and that there is a roadmap there, but on the other hand is it not a bit too early - after all, we can describe the President as at least a semi-dictator - to offer him a place at such a forum, at such an important meeting?
I think that we must be very careful in that respect and must not offer him a platform unless it is absolutely necessary.
As for the other points, I do not of course underestimate the problems facing the Maldives.
I think that they merit a great deal of attention, but once again we must be politically wise.
I would like first of all to thank the Commissioner and remark that, although his answer was long, it is not the longest we have received in Question Time, but it has the merit of having provoked several requests for supplementary questions.
What I would like to do is put the three that first came to my attention together, so that would be Ms McGuinness, Mr Mitchell, who asked the original question, and Ms BudreikaitÄ.
Madam President, with all due respect to Ms McGuinness, I think it is extraordinary that somebody places a question and must wait for somebody else.
I am very sorry.
We started late, so one could have expected that you would have been here earlier.
Madam President, you started late on the screen and then you skipped questions.
Then you allow a seven-minute reply and you go to someone else to ask a supplementary before the original questioner.
It is an absurd procedure, and I protest.
I am very sorry, if Members are not in the Chamber we are obliged to skip their questions.
We will follow the order I suggested.
Madam President, I apologise for the difficulties.
I did take the question for Mr Mitchell because I knew he was on his way down.
Commissioner, in that lengthy answer, I am not sure I heard you once mention the words 'rural', 'agriculture' or 'the need for investment', because the problem with slums is that 900 million people are rushing to them for a better life, because there is nothing better in the rural areas.
I think you need to address the issue of investing in agriculture and rural development in the developing world so that we do not create even greater slums.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) You are probably right, but I just had the opportunity to deal with this issue of rural development only recently.
You will be aware of the fact that the tenth European Development Fund places greater emphasis on rural development and investment in agriculture than the ninth EDF, for example, where the budget allocated for projects on rural development and agriculture represented - if I remember correctly - 9% of the appropriations.
In the tenth European Development Fund this proportion has risen to just over 12%.
The EUR 666 million provided under the ninth European Development Fund has now been increased to EUR 1.1 billion in the tenth Fund.
It goes without saying that we are encouraging this development and I agree with you in stating that this is one of the best responses to the problem; the same goes for land use planning.
Developing agriculture is obviously an effective way to ease congestion in the town centres, to give the poor people who now inhabit the urban centres the chance of a better life and to attract them back to the land.
We also need to have infrastructures that provide improved access and interconnectivity and better social and sanitation services.
We are therefore working on all these issues and I share your viewpoint even though I have not touched on that particular question.
There are other solutions that may be put forward, but you are entirely right and rest assured that we will be placing it high on our list of priorities.
During the European Development Days this question was dealt with in some detail by Kofi Annan, who has set up a foundation to aid rural regions and develop agriculture.
Madam President, can I ask the Commissioner if he is aware that target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals seeks to significantly improve the lives of 100 million people living in slums by 2020?
And there are, in fact, something like 900 million people - at least the question said 900 million and I do not think the Commissioner questioned that - living in urban slums?
The Commissioner will be at the EU-ACP Assembly in Rwanda later this month.
Will he be in a position to give any indication to the Assembly there, or when will he be in a position to give an indication to the Assembly here, of precise statistics on the way to reaching this objective?
You said that you will come back with a plan, you will come back with a report, but will that report give us precise details on how this objective of taking 100 million people out of slum dwellings will be achieved?
There will be statistics but these are national figures, when we get them and when the data collection systems are reliable.
In any case, as things stand at present I am unable to guarantee that we will be in possession of the complete set of statistics on this particular subject; all the more because the definitions vary enormously from country to country.
We are therefore working on this.
Normally when we carry out an assessment and when I present an account of it we are already in possession - I hope - of a certain number of elements that enable us to shed some light on the information you requested.
However, I dare not promise you today that we will have reliable and precise figures in this case.
This is one of the factors that we are currently working on.
We have already trawled through the information held by other international organisations.
The data obtained are usually far from complete and often questionable, because the rudiments that we have and the methods used to quantify these statistics are not always reliable.
(LT) People have left villages for towns in search for work.
What measures will be taken, what projects are to be implemented in the countries to ensure that not only agricultural areas, not only rural areas would be getting support, so that new workplaces are created in other regions as well?
I happened to hear that, for example, in Mozambique just 5% of aid funds are allocated for the development of infrastructure and workplaces.
Do you consider this sufficient?
Firstly, the action programmes are funded as a rule by the development programmes, not through humanitarian aid.
They are therefore not humanitarian aid programmes.
In some regions we are funding employment-intensive work programmes, especially in post-conflict countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and the DRC.
We are providing finance for a whole series of labour-intensive programmes, including road construction and upgrading, small-scale maintenance projects and so on, that will provide people with work.
This is a starting point.
Secondly, I shall take advantage of your question to point out again - you may like it or you may not, you may have an opinion or not, but as this is an open debate I am going to say it anyway - that what the Commission is trying to do at present by way of the economic partnership agreements that we are currently attempting to conclude with various regions in the developing world is essentially aimed at generating a certain dynamic process and developing a private sector that will be capable of supporting employment, creating wealth and prosperity and, especially, ensuring that the developing countries are gradually able to open up their markets in order to take advantage of the most positive effects - and I know only too well that there are not just positive effects - of globalisation.
Moreover, I am always very surprised to note that in this House, too, there are many who are opposed to the signing of economic partnership agreements.
When you realise that a 1% increase in trade in Africa is equivalent to two and a half times the entire amount of public aid allocated to development in that continent then you will understand that there will never be sustainable development in the poorest nations unless their economy is more prosperous.
In reply to your question I can assure you that we do have emergency response measures, including those for post-conflict periods, and that we are trying to implement them.
We are in fact funding employment schemes and labour-intensive projects.
These are immediate responses.
These are emergency situations.
Apart from that, the 'aid for trade' policies are the only ones that can eventually create employment and lasting employment at that.
There is no other miracle cure.
It is not realistic to suggest that we should be financing job creation schemes, for example, and indeed I have already heard such a proposal.
In some countries 60% or 70% of the population are below the age of 25.
You cannot create public works jobs for such a huge mass of people.
The only response to this problem must be economic in nature.
There are therefore two aspects to this question.
The first is agriculture, which is an important element because it creates lasting employment and provides food for the entire family.
It is perhaps true to say that we have not invested enough in the agricultural sector in recent years.
The second element, clearly, is the economy.
It is essential to establish and consolidate integrated regional markets in order to create the conditions in which the local population can take advantage of globalisation and economic growth.
Madam President, I understand Mr Mitchell's frustration, which is the frustration of many MEPs - that, every month, Commission Question Time is squeezed and begins late.
I had a question on Darfur, and I want to ask you whether, Question Time having started late, at 18.15, five questions went by in ten minutes, because I arrived in the Chamber just after 18.20.
If that is the case, is it fair to Members to create a situation where they are running around doing meetings and trying to predict when their question will be raised?
Can something be done about it, particularly the late starting of Commission Question Time almost every month in Strasbourg?
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Helping the governments of developing countries and improving transport safety, and that includes road safety, is one of the Commission's priorities for cooperation on development in the transport sector.
This is reflected in the Commission's policies.
The need for policies aimed at promoting transport safety is a key aspect of our ongoing sectoral dialogue with partner governments and internal directives now recommend that certain safety measures should be incorporated when drawing up road projects funded by the Commission.
An assessment of Commission interventions in the transport sector of developing countries, which was completed in 2004, notes that the majority of road projects did take account of safety aspects.
To give some concrete examples, most road construction schemes included road-signs and markings and designated speed limits, and many of the projects also proposed widening the roadside verges so as to permit the safe passage of non-motorised vehicles and pedestrians.
In certain countries the Commission has also funded actions aimed specifically at road safety, such as the drafting of a highway code and the equipping of vehicle test centres, notably in Albania, and the introduction of rules for vehicle safety testing in Mali.
A project currently under way in Cameroon is helping to fund various construction schemes, including the installation of crash barriers to improve safety on the main Douala-YaoundÃ© road, as well as a road safety awareness campaign.
Clearly we can do more.
Progress depends first and foremost on the commitment displayed by the partner government in highlighting road safety issues, collecting and analysing accident figures, introducing rules and regulations, defining standards and setting-up and strengthening the organisations responsible for the general implementation of road safety policy.
Madam President, as the Commissioner will be aware, the European Transport Safety Council publishes on a regular basis very useful reports in relation to road safety standards statistics and the general performance of various countries.
It shows quite clearly that the countries of Eastern Europe, and, unfortunately, my own country Ireland, lag way down at the bottom of the list.
Would the Commissioner agree that the major problem is that accidents which are designated as accidents are not accidents at all?
They are, in fact, a result of excessive speed, a result of poor road standards, and a result, in many cases, of excessive alcohol.
We know that there is a common European driving licence coming in 2013, so I would like to ask the Commissioner whether there is any prospect that this common European driving licence could in fact be front-loaded and be brought on more quickly.
Secondly, would the Commissioner agree that when somebody goes from one Member State to another Member State as a driver and they have a valid driving licence, should they not be obliged to take a theory test in relation to the rules of the road, signage and various other elements within the particular country that they are now residing in?
Member of the Commission. - (FR) I do not know if this question was directed at me.
Are you referring to development or is this a more general question, because I do not feel that it was put specifically to me in my capacity as Commissioner for Development?
As regards the question from Mr Higgins, I thought that I had already replied to it, but it is clear, especially in the context of the road infrastructure projects that we are funding, that there are usually maintenance conditions built-in, but there are other conditions too.
We have funded a highway code, for example, and it goes without saying that what we are doing in Europe can be a source of inspiration for some of the countries we are discussing.
Concerning the question that was addressed more directly to me, I do not feel that I am competent to answer it, but I am happy to pass it on to my colleague, Mr Barrot, if you wish.
That is what I shall do: I shall pass this question on to my colleague.
Like the Commissioner, I had understood that the question was to do with road safety in developing countries, not EU Member States.
Has the Commissioner travelled by road in South Asia where, with deep respect, his reference to the highway code could, in many cases, be considered laughable, because traffic goes very quickly on either side of the road and in both directions at the same time, which obviously leads to road accidents, certainly when there are lorries going around and people driving in rickshaws as well?
In his discussions with the countries of South Asia, has the Commissioner suggested that the European Union - with all the advice that, perhaps, Mr Higgins could give from the Republic of Ireland and other countries - could assist them in improving their road safety, improving, perhaps, a reference to a highway code that does not exist, and help to reduce mortality on their roads?
Member of the Commission. - (FR) I am not opposed to the European Union making a contribution and providing aid.
I have cited as an example the very case you mentioned, namely the highway code.
It is clear that this might be part of a project that the Commission could finance in the context of good governance, strengthening the rule of law and consolidating the capacity of the state authorities, for example.
This is something we are doing.
As far as roads are concerned, it is true that in certain locations, especially where we know that there is a lot of pedestrian traffic, we also try to upgrade the roadside verges and include accident prevention in our road safety projects.
In global terms, and as part of the political dialogue, we include all these questions, but the message that we occasionally send to our partners should state that they too need to address these political issues.
When I hear this type of question I always wonder: 'Are we going to be asked to do everything for them?'.
We cannot be called upon to do everything.
We can inspire and suggest, we can provide funding and aid, but we cannot govern in the place of those whose job it is to govern.
It is like picking presents off a Christmas tree.
People expect development cooperation to be able to do anything and everything.
You must also understand that with the budget resources available to me I must focus on the main priorities.
Mr Mitchell quite rightly highlighted the Millennium Development Goals.
They are the main priorities.
We are ready to help and we are providing funding, but the partner countries have to ask for it.
This is one of the conditions.
During the dialogue process we sometimes try to suggest this kind of thing.
Mr Bowis is not here, but I can tell you, for example, that in implementing our development policies I try to instil in our partners an ever greater awareness for the situation of the disabled.
The problems affecting disabled persons are not generally taken into account by the partner countries or by the partner governments.
We therefore have a whole series of parallel initiatives and policies that we are trying to put forward and implement, but do not forget that we can only fund these projects if the partner country makes an approach or places a request.
Given that the European Union funds a large number of road building and road infrastructure projects, this particular aspect - and certainly the issue of road safety - obviously crops up frequently in such debates and discussions.
(LT) Statistics show that the losses incurred because of accidents and their consequences in EU countries constitute about 2% of the GDP of the European Union, which means these losses are huge.
Do we have similar figures for the Third World and developing countries?
Is the percentage higher or lower?
Apparently, they have fewer cars in these countries, so maybe that percentage is lower.
While fully realising that the Commission cannot do everything for the countries in question, I would like to know if these countries draw from the experience of the European Union, where, during the last five years, the number of accidents has fallen by 50 percent.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission welcomes the meeting of the two leaders on 5 September this year and the agreement on the need for the earliest start of the process leading to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Our aim is that serious negotiations on a comprehensive settlement under the auspices of the United Nations should begin without unnecessary delay.
The agreement of 8 July 2006 between the leaders of the two communities on the island should prepare the ground for such talks as a means of facilitating the full resumption of these talks for a comprehensive settlement.
On the question of financial aid used by the end of September this year, the total amount contracted under the aid programme for the Turkish Cypriot community came to EUR 24 million - that is, 9% of the total - and the amount tendered came to EUR 44 million.
A great share of the programme is devoted to infrastructure investments, which require more time to prepare and for which the bulk of payments will take place in the latter part of the programming period, which is due to last until December 2012.
Notwithstanding the challenges that are posed by the unique political, diplomatic and legal status, the Commission considers that the implementation of the aid programme is broadly on track for the moment.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner and stress that the Commission must urge the parties to negotiate at ministerial level, that is, at the highest level, so as to break the stalemate.
Obviously the elections scheduled for February in Nicosia, on the Greek side, may make it difficult to accelerate matters at the moment, but it is a good idea to begin investing as of now in the post-election period.
Member of the Commission. - I want to thank the honourable Member for this proposal.
In fact, we tried this at the end of 2006, during the Finnish Presidency of the European Union.
There was a serious diplomatic effort to unblock economic and trade relations in and around Cyprus, which culminated in some meetings in Helsinki, which, however, did not lead to results.
Therefore, I think the lesson we have to learn is that we have to aim for a comprehensive settlement, and we need the United Nations to provide its good services.
From our point of view, the sooner the better and, at the latest, after the presidential elections, so that the year 2008 should be the year of serious negotiations and results concerning a comprehensive settlement for the reunification of Cyprus.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, we have been told that only a small percentage of Union funding is being made available for the northern part of Cyprus.
What is the situation with regard to the obligations which must be fulfilled by the northern part of Cyprus itself?
Are delays not occurring here as well?
I also have a supplementary question for our fellow Member here.
The terminology which he has used is not the terminology of bicommunality but that of two separate states, given that reference has been made to ministerial level, presidents and colleagues.
Is this helpful for the debate?
Member of the Commission. - I think that in fact this question was partly directed to Mr Cappato.
It is clear that the European Commission does not refer to any sort of government concerning the northern part of Cyprus, but at the same time, of course, there are two communities on the island. There is the Greek Cypriot community and there is the Turkish Cypriot community.
We encourage, and we expect, that the leaders of the two communities will continue their efforts in order to resume negotiations for a comprehensive settlement under the auspices of the United Nations.
Member of the Commission. - The European Union is preparing to assume a greater role in post-status Kosovo.
Ongoing status negotiations notwithstanding, significant preparations are being made for the future International Civilian Office and an ESDP mission of rule of law for Kosovo.
The Commission is financing CSFP joint actions establishing planning teams in Pristina.
These teams have developed the blueprints for the future missions on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan.
However, the final shape of the future international missions will depend on the exact outcome of status negotiations.
The Commission has worked in close cooperation with the two teams in order to ensure a coherent overall EU presence in a post-status Kosovo.
I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation in facilitating the financing of these very important missions.
The Commission fully supports the work of the international Troika which is currently leading the negotiations and there is the deadline of 10 December for the Troika activities as confirmed by the contact group ministerial in New York in September.
At this point in time it is too early to speculate when exactly Kosovo's status will be resolved but it is clear that prolonging the agony will not serve anybody's purpose.
On our behalf, we are ready to turn every stone and even more in order to achieve a negotiated solution which would be best for everybody.
We ask that from both sides and from our partners in the international community, while at the same time, of course, we are preparing ourselves for better or worse scenarios as regards Kosovo's status.
(DE) Many thanks for your good answer, Commissioner.
There are two points which I would like to make.
Firstly, as you know, this House voted by a 75% majority in favour of internationally monitored independence for Kosovo on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan.
We voted against plans for the division of Kosovo and against any reversion to rule by Belgrade.
I would like to know whether the Commission endorses this position.
Secondly, like you, I was in Belgrade last week, and as you have said, the longer the decision-making process takes, the more destabilising the effect on Serbia will be.
Serbia too needs a swift decision in order to be able to pursue its course towards a future in Europe.
Member of the Commission. - Indeed, as Mr Posselt said, Serbia is a key country and that is the reason why we initialled the stabilisation and association agreement last week with Deputy Prime Minister ÄeliÄ, in the presence of President TadiÄ.
That is the first concrete step of Serbia towards the European Union.
On the condition that Serbia will achieve full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, then we and the Member States can sign the agreement which will then become the gateway for candidate status for Serbia.
Thus we are ready, once Serbia is ready, to move ahead, and indeed this helps Serbia to leave the nationalist past behind and approach its European future.
(DE) Commissioner, we all hope that the status issue will indeed be resolved on 10 December.
However, the question is this: what if there is no resolution?
What are the risks then for the region as a whole, in your view?
Do we have any way out of that situation or any alternative strategies if there is in fact no agreement on 10 December?
Member of the Commission. - Accession negotiations with Croatia are at cruising speed for the moment.
As you may recall, the talks began on 3 October 2005 or, to be precise, 4 October, because it was late at night or early in the morning, depending on the definition in Luxembourg.
The screening process was completed one year later, in October 2006, and all 33 screening reports have been submitted to the Council.
The current state of play is that negotiations have been opened on 14 chapters out of 35, and closed on two chapters.
We are moving forward at a steady pace.
I would like to add that, on 10 chapters, we have agreed opening benchmarks - or they have been agreed by the Council, to be more precise - which have been communicated to Croatia.
For the moment, we consider only the opening benchmark on justice, freedom and security to be met.
However, we hope that the work being done by Croatia to meet opening benchmarks will allow us to recommend opening negotiations on a further one or two chapters rather soon.
To conclude, what is most important in terms of the next steps is more progress on the most difficult chapters.
This mainly concerns those chapters where opening benchmarks have been set.
Ultimately, the pace of Croatia's progress towards the European Union will be determined by its own ability to meet all the necessary conditions on the basis of its own merits.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner for the clarification given.
In my opinion, the progress made is certainly satisfactory, but more could still be done.
As far as I am concerned - and I am a member of the European Union-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee - it is the Croatians who are pushing, but they are not getting a positive response from the European Commission.
I would therefore ask the Commission to redouble its efforts in favour of Croatia so that it can join the EU in 2009.
Member of the Commission. - I agree that there is a need for further action in the first place by Croatia.
Just to illustrate the challenges: the technical negotiations form the superstructure of the negotiations on the acquis communautaire, while the reforms on the ground form the substructure - the foundation - of the negotiations.
In many areas, for Croatia or for Turkey or for any other future candidate country, it is clear that, in order to meet certain opening benchmarks for technical negotiations, we have to first make progress on the reforms on the ground.
The concrete example that I have in mind is shipbuilding and steel.
We will be able to recommend opening a chapter on competition policy and state aid, which is one of the core chapters of EU legislation, once we see that Croatia has convincingly started to implement and achieved results in the structural reforms related to the shipbuilding and steel sectors.
Therefore it is, in the first place, in the hands of the Croatian Government and Parliament to make progress on these reforms and thus facilitate progress in the technical negotiations.
(DE) It is very likely that on 21 December the Schengen border of Italy and Austria will be extended to include another country, namely Slovenia.
Does this have any relation to the opening of a chapter - on the common area of freedom, security and justice - in accession negotiations?
Does it really make sense to build major new external borders here which will have to be dismantled only a few years later?
Member of the Commission. - I think that using common sense, which is also allowed for a Commissioner, your question makes plenty of sense.
At the same time, Slovenia has, after substantial efforts, achieved a situation where it will be part of the Schengen arrangement for the free movement of people and it is a fact of life that Slovenia is a member of the European Union.
Croatia will be a member of the European Union in a few years and, therefore, for this period up to the time when Croatia is able to join the Schengen arrangement, as a member of the European Union, we will have the arrangement to which the honourable Member referred.
But, of course, in the medium to long term, we should have a situation where all the countries of the Western Balkans will be part of the European Union and, one day, also part of the Schengen arrangement for the free movement of people.
That is very important for the Europeanisation of civil society in the Western Balkans in the longer term.
(DE) Commissioner, I believe that the Sanader Government and the chief negotiator, Mr Drobnjak, are doing first-class work but in my view, there are two problems.
Firstly, I hear, for example, from the Slovakian side that conditions are being set for Croatia which were not set, in this form, for Slovakia.
The second question is this: what is the situation with regard to the Commission's own capacities to deal with this dossier?
I have heard that a great many matters are being left to lie because there is not sufficient capacity to process the Croatian dossier.
Is that correct?
Vice-President of the Commission. - It is true that, very often, children, because of the illegality of their stay, have no possibility to attend a school and are thus deprived of their chances from the start.
As stated in our communication on a European strategy on the rights of the child, a basis in the Treaties is required for action in a specific policy area to safeguard children's rights, and in the immigration field no such specific base exists.
However, as regards substance, a common standard already exists - at least a minimum standard - as all Member States are bound by international human rights conventions.
In particular, in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Member States have to grant certain rights regardless of a person's immigration status, such as emergency medical care or resources to ensure subsistence.
As concerns the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it must be recalled that, besides the specific provisions, it foresees the obligation for the Member States to always take into account the best interests of the child.
At Community level, the Commission proposal for a return directive foresees that, where Member States are subject to obligations derived from international fundamental rights, such as, for example, the right to education or the right to a family unit, no return decision shall be issued.
- (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your brief answer.
My additional question is this: are the obligations of the Member States being observed, and are you bearing in mind that we have not only illegal child immigrants, but also illegal child human traffickers?
On my island, Chios, which is situated opposite the Asia Minor coast, a 14-year-old human trafficker has been arrested.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue you have raised is naturally one of the most sensitive of all. It does of course deserve European action.
That is why a few months ago, with reference to undeclared work by immigrants on the one hand and, on the other, people who enter the EU and then overstay the residence period, I proposed a directive aimed at penalising employers.
In cases where undeclared employment affects the most vulnerable groups - the case you have brought up - such as children who are recruited illegally and then exploited, I have proposed prison sentences.
Black market exploitation of particularly vulnerable groups, which is the case of children, is the most serious case of all in my opinion.
Not all EU Member States currently have very rigorous penalties for employers who illegally exploit the labour of children or women, and I believe that we need such legislation at European level.
(DE) Commissioner, where education or training for illegal child immigrants is concerned, we are talking about a highly sensitive issue.
We also know that there is no method which is off limits to human trafficking organisations.
Do you not see a certain risk that children may be sent on ahead so that parents are then able to join them through the process of family reunification, thus simply accelerating illegal immigration?
As much as I welcome efforts to cushion the effects on children, I do see a risk that this could give further impetus to illegal immigration.
Vice-President of the Commission. - As the honourable Member knows, the Portuguese Presidency included the topic of new technologies and integrated border management for discussion at the informal Council of Interior Ministers on 1 October.
The Presidency presented ideas in relation to increasing security as well as in relation to facilitating travel.
I participated, obviously, in the Council's discussion.
Europe will need to make effective use of the great opportunities new technologies provide in the area of border control.
Advancements made in biometric technologies will allow for speedier and more reliable identification of travellers.
As a concrete example of steps taken by the Union so far, the introduction of biometric passports and the development of the Visa Information System (VIS) and Schengen Information System II (SIS II) will pave the way for increased use of biometrics at borders.
We have, of course, been cooperating very closely with Parliament on both these issues.
Transforming border processes cannot happen overnight.
A step-by-step approach is needed, therefore.
It is important to first implement what is already planned before embarking on even more ambitious projects.
But it is necessary to develop and maintain a long-term strategy and vision, accompanied by a thorough cost-benefit analysis.
At the beginning of next year, I will present a communication, not a legislative proposal, outlining how an entry-exit system and a registered travellers programme might look.
The communication will evaluate the different options and their impact, including with regard to data protection and other fundamental rights.
An entry-exit system and a registered travellers programme should be seen together as part of the same package of measures.
Simplifying checks for bona fide travellers allows us to focus resources on high-risk travellers.
Faster border checks for bona fide travellers can offset the impact on border crossing times resulting from an entry-exit system.
When implementing such automated system synergies with the business processes and the equipment for SIS II and VIS, we need to examine carefully whether we are using our existing infrastructure as efficiently as possible.
This communication on the entry-exit system, which I will present in February, will be part of a borders package, which will also include the evaluation report on Frontex, as requested by the Hague Programme, and a communication on a European surveillance system (EUROSUR).
On this basis, I look forward to a truly strategic discussion with Member States and Parliament on the future directions of the Union's border policy, where new technologies will play a decisive role.
In other words, it will be, in my view, an initial basis for a comprehensive strategic approach and discussion.
Well, I also look forward to such a strategic discussion and I did not have any problems with the first part of your response, Commissioner.
But what worries me is that, at that informal JHA Council in October, you were reported as calling for this entry-exit register which you said was extremely necessary, but you had not done a feasibility study.
The 2005 communication said that it would be a huge organisational step and might therefore be risky and costly to implement.
Are you not pre-empting it?
The second part of your response was a sales pitch for entry-exit.
We have no idea what the implications are going to be - including for data protection as well as organisation - are they proportional?
Yet you are already saying that it is extremely necessary.
This seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse, as we say.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Parliament, in the person of the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, is of course invited to participate - and does participate - in informal Council meetings.
As far as I am concerned, however, what I said on that occasion was exactly the same as what I am saying to you today.
I specifically said that the impact assessment will be presented and published on the Commission's website along with the proposal for a communication.
Everyone will be able to see the impact assessment, its various implications and our proposal.
Then a debate will of course be opened up, for the reason that I have given: we are talking about a communication setting out possible ways of working and not a legislative proposal.
I would ask the Commissioner to comment on an EU entry-exit issue: the possibility of Ireland, with the agreement perhaps of Northern Ireland, joining the Schengen area, given what is happening with the UK on its e-Borders initiative.
Perhaps you would just answer that particular issue as there is much comment about it.
Vice-President of the Commission. - The new Treaty, already agreed but not yet signed, does not include any general provision authorising the transmission of personal data of European citizens to third countries.
In fact, Article 15a of the new Treaty guarantees the right, the general right, to the protection of personal data.
Article 24 refers to the application of this general right and the processing of data in the common foreign and security policy area.
This means that the transfer of personal data to third countries is based on the general principles or relevant provisions of Directive 95/46/EC on personal data, particularly Articles 25 and 26.
This Personal Data Directive remains in force.
According to Article 25 of this particular directive, transfer of personal data is permitted only if the third country ensures an adequate level of protection.
Article 26 of the same directive provides for the strict and explicit conditions under which it is possible to transfer personal data to third countries in other cases.
The framework decision on data protection in the field of judicial and police cooperation will also be another very helpful instrument.
We made a promise.
The promise is to adopt, in agreement with Parliament, a framework decision on personal data protection by December.
I am very confident that we will be able to get this very important political result.
Why?
Because the Portuguese Presidency seems very determined to reach this goal and there seems to be an overall consensus among Member States.
You perhaps know that we discussed the framework decision on data protection at the last formal Justice and Home Affairs Council.
On this, of course, I warmly wish close cooperation with Parliament, even closer than in the past, during the coming weeks.
I think we have the common goal of getting it adopted before the end of December.
- (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, you have slalomed your way around the articles of the Treaties with consummate legal skill.
Kindly give me a clearer answer to my question.
Does the Commission agree that the Council decisions in question ignore the clear position of the European Parliament and the relevant resolution?
Does this not weaken the protection of citizens' personal data, and is it not an attempt to bypass the control of the European Court of Justice?
My question is simple.
Does the European Court of Justice, on the basis of the Council's decisions, have the option of reversing this Council decision, adopted under Article 24?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you are well aware, the overall intention is to guarantee the right to personal data protection.
Article 24 is a derogation, in other words it establishes that a special rule pertains in a given area and for certain types of information and data.
This certainly does not mean, in my opinion, that once the general principle is infringed none of the safeguards apply any longer, because obviously the general principle has not been set aside; a derogation from normal processing is justified by the fact that we are in the common foreign and security policy area.
However, I repeat that in my view - and at this stage it is solely my personal interpretation, since the Treaty has not yet been signed or ratified - if there are one-off derogations to a general rule, those derogations cannot annul the right; they can regulate the ways of enjoying that right, which is obviously a different matter.
Commissioner Frattini, you are of course well aware that Members of this Parliament, and especially members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, are getting more, not less, unhappy about developments in data transfer without adequate data protection and without any codecision or real parliamentary scrutiny, including by national parliaments.
Also, I am afraid there is a little bit of loss of trust, because we are feeling that the Commission and Member States are almost benefiting from loose and lax agreements reached on the transatlantic dimension.
What can you do to reassure us that we are not on a slippery slope, where data transferred for security purposes is really just going to be used for profiling and never really going to benefit from privacy guarantees?
Vice-President of the Commission. - As you know perfectly well, I have tried to undertake in the past personal initiatives under a political point of view, even though in some cases I was not formally authorised by the Council to do that.
I am talking about putting at your disposal some documents, elements or information, without previous formal consultation with the Council.
I understand perfectly your concerns.
But I cannot act alone.
I had to get authorisation in some cases and consensus in some other cases.
I can repeat to you what I said once to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I am ready to engage with Parliament in a political process of close consultation, although the Treaty is not yet signed or ratified.
I am talking about a political consultation in the sense that we can think about moving ahead as if the Treaty were in force.
That is, frankly speaking, my political and personal position because I am not so sure, and I do not know, whether the Council would be in agreement with such a position.
This principle could apply, for example, to the adoption of a framework decision on data protection which should be adopted, in my view, before December, after close consultation, not only by getting just an opinion by Parliament but by taking into full account amendments, proposals and formal and substantial integration.
Are you sure that the Council will agree on such a position?
I am not so sure, but I will be insisting on trying to persuade the Council to move ahead in this direction.
We have now gone over by more than the amount of time we were late by when we started.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Complaint by Boeing (US) against Airbus (EU) before the WTO (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the complaint by Boeing (US) against Airbus (EU) before the WTO.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking also on behalf of Mrs Tokia SaÃ¯fi, who is a member of the Committee on International Trade.
Boeing's complaint against Airbus in the WTO is making it look like a bad loser.
This is an industrial group that for decades dominated the market; now, since the start of this decade, since 2003 and 2004, Airbus has overtaken Boeing.
Who would have imagined that 20 years ago?
Then at precisely the same time Boeing's complaint to the WTO appears.
The complaint is nonsensical since the American manufacturer has always benefited from significant military research and development programmes from the Pentagon or NASA.
Many of the technologies were first used in military aircraft and Boeing benefits from free transfer of technology from the military to the civil sector, just as it also benefits from various tax breaks from the US Government.
What does Airbus, the European manufacturer, receive?
Instead of subsidies, it gets repayable loans, which, as their name suggests, have to be repaid.
Not only are they repayable but, as you said, Commissioner, the sums repaid are far in excess of the original loan since they depend on the number of planes sold, and practically all of Airbus's aircraft have been successful.
That will surely be the case in the future, too, with orders for the A380 and A350 piling up recently.
In addition, this system operates openly and publicly, with complete transparency.
Airbus does not benefit from any hidden aid.
Commissioner, on my behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the European Parliament's aeronautical intergroup, I must tell you that we will be monitoring this issue carefully, very carefully in fact.
We expect you - and you have given us assurances in this respect, Commissioner - to defence vigorously the European manufacturer's economic interests.
The role of the European Union, like that of the United States, is not to try to go one better in the WTO, but to bring the partners together in bilateral negotiations to resolve their differences.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - As you know, the European Union is currently defending Airbus in a case before the WTO brought by the United States on behalf of Boeing.
I believe it is important at this stage of the dispute for this body to build support for the European Union's position and against that of the United States.
I should state at the outset that this entire dispute arose because Boeing no longer wished to participate in a mutually-agreed international agreement between the United States and the European Union - an agreement that allowed certain forms of government support to both Airbus and Boeing, the only two producers of large civil aircraft in the world.
As my colleagues know, such agreements are the best foundation upon which relations among nations are based.
It is incumbent on nations to abide by their obligations under these treaties.
Airbus has.
The European Union has.
Unfortunately, the United States has not.
Airbus and the European Union have constantly abided by the spirit and intent of the 1992 Bilateral Aircraft Agreement.
For 11 years, competition between Airbus and Boeing flourished, resulting in important breakthroughs in commercial aviation technology and design that have led to safer, more efficient and more environmentally-sensitive air travel.
But Boeing decided it no longer wanted to abide by the obligations of this agreement.
Instead, with the assistance of the United States, they attacked Airbus for exacting so-called 'illegal subsidies' - the very government assistance that Boeing had originally agreed to in the 1992 agreement.
As many of my colleagues are aware, Airbus's government loan funding is a targeted and non-trade-distorting use of a government's limited research resources.
It offers governments a fair return and brings to the market innovative products, which benefit everyone.
Simply stated, European government research and development funding is limited, repayable and has no impact on Boeing's ability to compete.
Meanwhile, because Boeing produces both civil and military aircraft for the United States, technology used in its commercial aircraft today benefits greatly from US government awards to Boeing military research and development contracts.
For example, Boeing's current knowledge about composites, which is being used extensively in its new 787 Dreamliner, stems - by its own admission - from its work on developing the V-22, the F-22, the B-2 and the Joint Strike Fighter.
This federal assistance is supplanted by US state and local government support to Boeing in the form of tax breaks, favourable real estate and local infrastructure improvements intended to secure the company's presence and job base in selected US cities.
While Boeing opposes the Airbus repayable assistance programme, it has no problem with identical programmes benefiting Boeing in Japan.
I highlight these points not to imply that the assistance received by Boeing (repayable in Japan but not in the US) is somehow worse than the repayable European loans received by Airbus.
I mention this assistance that Boeing receives to illustrate the reality that both sides benefit from some form of government assistance, from nations wishing to retain their global leadership roles in aviation.
While Boeing has benefited from government support, it seeks to deny Europe similar benefits.
I believe we should urge the Commission to direct Airbus and Boeing to develop a forward-looking arrangement that provides a stable environment for both sides to compete and develop state-of-the-art aircraft well into the future.
Maybe a six-month moratorium on the WTO case would allow the two companies time to complete a new discipline.
This is the opportunity that is now before us.
We can dwell on the past or look forward to the future.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, to many observers, the WTO dispute between Airbus and Boeing is starting to sound like a never-ending saga.
I am happy that you have at least shown us a light at the end of the tunnel.
In my view, in order to be able to evaluate the current situation and provide a policy recommendation on how we should go forward, it is worth reviewing the background to the dispute once again, together with the economic development of these two aviation giants.
The origins of the current situation lie primarily in the massive increase in international aviation, accompanied by strong competition between aviation companies, since the early 1990s.
May I, at this juncture, expressly pay tribute to the Commission once again for what it has achieved here.
Without the establishment of the common market for the aviation industry in the 1990s and the Europeanisation of agreements with overseas countries, the competitiveness - and thus the success - of Europe's aircraft companies would have been impossible to achieve.
The competition was tough, however, and some aircraft companies went to the wall.
The demand for ever more economical, safer, larger, faster and more modern aircraft assumed dimensions in the 1990s which ultimately left only two well-performing companies in the running: Airbus and Boeing.
Real alternatives to them now only exist in the regional and business aviation sector.
I am proud that Airbus has managed to reinvent itself as a European company.
For the European economies, aviation is an immensely important factor, without which economic life as a whole would quickly fall apart.
Against this background alone, the developed economies have a massive interest in ensuring that well-performing air transport options are available to them.
The aviation industry was compelled to recognise this, but was unable to keep pace.
Above all, it lacked capital and it lacked the safeguards that would enable it to take on the enormous risks and massive expenditure associated with the development process.
As the dualism between Airbus and Boeing intensified in the industry, competition between the two inevitably increased as well.
During periods of weak demand on the world economy, the price war between Airbus and Boeing has been, and remains, intense.
To ensure that this contest did not spill over into a competition to secure the largest share of State aid, a groundbreaking agreement was forged early on, in 1992.
In 2004, when times were hard for Boeing, the US broke that agreement and appealed to the WTO.
The EU did not hesitate for long and sought the same remedy.
Boeing also brought the case before the WTO.
The WTO rules are very simple; we are familiar with them and they have been debated here in this Chamber.
In my view, both sides now need to get back around the negotiating table. Both sides need to admit that their aircraft industry needs subsidies.
That is especially true if we want to master the emerging problems of CO2 avoidance, protection against noise pollution and the increase in air traffic.
We are moving into new technological territory here, and the risks for capital providers are immense.
I would like to caution the EU's representatives against taking Airbus's current strength as a pretext for tightening the screws on Boeing and the US too zealously.
Less than a year ago, we would have had to hold a very different debate.
That is why both sides now need a viable strategy.
Years of dispute and games of hide-and-seek will not take our technology sites forward.
However, moving forward is essential.
The key word - CO2 - has already been mentioned.
I would ask the Commission not to misunderstand what I am saying.
It is not about letting the US pull the wool over our eyes about hidden military subsidies and ensuing cross-subsidisation.
Let us encourage the Americans to play an honest game.
I am confident that we can then reach a mutually acceptable solution.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in the case before the World Trade Organisation regarding the complaint by Boeing against Airbus, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the bitter rivalry between the two economic and political power bases located on either side of the Atlantic has been ongoing for many years.
I refer of course to the United States and to the European Union.
It should not come as a surprise to anyone that the debate is moving into ever more modern areas of the economy.
The aeronautical sector is an example of just such an area.
It is in that sector that new materials are developed and tested, along with new technologies for manufacturing them, new building solutions and also new automation, measurement and communication systems.
New techniques for accelerated testing of the devices developed and reliability assessments are being devised too.
It stands to reason that the governments of individual countries and also the European Union should endeavour to support these areas of manufacture, in the hope that it might be possible to exploit the cutting edge solutions discovered across the economy as a whole.
Since both parties to the dispute are therefore directly or indirectly providing financial support for their industries, there can only be one sensible outcome. The latter has to involve bilateral negotiations and establishing a gradual reduction of the subsidies provided to both parties.
Cases dealt with through arbitration within the WTO framework can last for years and prove very costly.
Indeed, in this instance the final settlement could threaten the very survival of both Boeing and Airbus.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) The explanations provided by the Commission confirm that, as far as the United States is concerned, liberalism is above all a commodity for export.
It is clear that in this area, as in many others, we are often ready to give ourselves enough rope to hang ourselves.
The US and Japanese Governments assist Boeing massively through military orders and public and public-private research.
Thus, as already mentioned here, the Boeing 787 will be the most subsidised civil aircraft in history.
The Commission must unfailingly defend Airbus in the WTO.
That is its duty and the citizens will judge it on the results.
Airbus benefits from the system of repayable loans: it is an appropriate, effective system.
It ensures that Airbus does not fall prey to the dictates of the financial markets.
It ensures that the states do not lose out on the money they invest in the aviation sector.
This system must be complemented by a stronger aviation research sector, which would raise the European effort to the same level as the United States.
This is crucial for our ability to compete both today and tomorrow.
In fact, there would be no aerospace industry without massive public intervention and support.
The incompetence and weakness demonstrated by EADS' two main private shareholders are proof of this.
The Galileo problems illustrate this clearly, too.
I firmly believe that the only way of guaranteeing the future of Airbus is to make EADS the first European majority public company.
This future proposal was also put forward by numerous trade union activists at the hearing on Airbus organised by my group on 28 March.
We believe that the Airbus management must urgently withdraw the Power 8 plan, whose only purpose is to ensure that Airbus's industrial model is identical to that of Boeing.
However, that model is causing problems for Boeing, as illustrated by the very serious difficulties it is experiencing with the industrialisation of its 787 Dreamliner.
Europe needs an aerospace industry that is powerful and that generates employment.
To achieve this, it must ensure that the workers have strong powers to intervene in their company's strategy.
- (EL) Madam President, the dispute between Boeing and Airbus brings to light a major difference in commercial policy and has grave economic implications.
Let us, however, not overdramatise the situation.
The dispute is in any case a far cry from the bilateral commercial battles of the past.
What makes it problematic, ladies and gentlemen, is that it arose after the United States had unilaterally taken away the bilateral contractual framework.
This, in turn, provoked a justifiable outcry from the EU about the subsidies of the United States, which was reneging on WTO rules.
Regardless of the validity of the arguments on either side, it is true that the realignment of market shares in favour of Airbus and the consequent loss of Boeing's competitive advantage were highly politicised.
This caused a defensive knee-jerk reaction from the US administration, which turned to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism.
The EU has rightly sought an agreed solution to prevent the dispute from escalating beyond the limits of negotiation.
However, there has been no response.
I hope there will be, as the gravity of the dispute and its intense politicisation will undoubtedly put the jurisdictional robustness of the WTO system to the test.
In that case, the settlement of the dispute could well be expected to further strengthen the credibility and international leadership qualities of the WTO, which does more than simply balance powers and weigh up interests.
The outcome of the case is expected to have wider repercussions on the economies of the two partners, affecting terms of employment, trade balance and technological development.
We have high hopes of a settlement to this dispute.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this debate and the Commission's presence here to discuss the legal dispute between Europe and the United States, which has been running since 2004, when Washington took a case in the WTO against the European aid granted to Airbus.
Faced with this attack, Europe, and the European Commission in particular, must show determination and conviction in order to defend a sector of undoubted economic importance.
Indeed, the civil aviation sector in Europe, of which Airbus is the jewel in the crown, is the global showcase for European collaboration and European technological expertise.
Now that the US Congress has pledged its full support for Boeing, it is the duty of the European Commission and Europe as a whole to make a political commitment to the Airbus cause.
Just a few weeks before the WTO's dispute settlement body takes its decision, I believe that it is vital for the European Union to reiterate its support for Airbus.
This issue is much more than a simple conflict between two aviation giants.
It affects our capacity to defend a certain vision of the European commitment to our major projects and our industries.
Our industrial policy must not be limited solely to the Union's competition policy.
The US complaint in the WTO against the European mechanism of repayable loans for the aviation sector is, in my view, unfounded and surprising.
It is unfounded because, by definition, the repayable loans are repaid.
They are repaid to the extent that the European states have been able to get a return on their investment, and since 1992 Airbus has repaid 40% more than the sums loaned to it.
The US criticism is also unfounded because the bilateral agreement signed between the European Union and the United States - broken unilaterally by the US in 2004, as the Commissioner said - authorised direct and indirect public aid to the civil aviation industry.
This complaint is surprising because the United States is accusing Airbus of having been subsidised even though Boeing benefits from a quasi-monopoly of extensive equipment programmes of the US army and NASA and public support for military development programmes.
Therefore, unlike the indirect US aid that is not repaid and is incompatible with the provisions of the SMC Agreement and 1994 GATT, the system of repayable loans could not be considered to be an infringement of WTO rules.
I thus hope that the European Commission defends resolutely this legitimate position.
In this respect, and having regard to the extreme importance of this matter for the future of the European aviation sector, what specific arguments does the Commission intend to put forward to defend Airbus in the WTO?
I would also like to point out that both the United States and the European Union risk seeing all or part of their public aviation support mechanisms condemned by the WTO.
To avoid this, the parties had raised the possibility of an amicable solution.
Can the European Commission tell us whether it plans to go down that path as mentioned?
It is crucial to explore all possible solutions because the future of thousands of people, companies and regions throughout Europe depends on this sector and a positive outcome to this conflict.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Airbus is a European success story and a model of European cooperation.
Airbus provides jobs at six European locations and employs a total of 58 000 workers.
In Hamburg, where I come from, there are 12 000 people working for Airbus.
In the past, Airbus has shown that EU industry, given the right strategy, can compete successfully in the toughest markets with top technology.
In the dispute between the US company Boeing and the European Airbus, each side is accusing the other of paying billions in subsidies and brought complaints before the WTO in 2004.
This could have negative consequences for transatlantic trade relations, which I would warn against, but it is very important, nonetheless, that the EU makes it clear that the financial support provided for Airbus was in conformity with WTO rules.
Both sides have declared their willingness to find a solution outside the WTO and reach an agreement on a bilateral basis.
Our goal, as politicians, should be to avoid a dispute over subsidies in the aircraft industry.
The economic performance of the two companies must not be jeopardised, and financial support should focus primarily on research.
This must include an increasingly strong emphasis on environmental, social and indeed employment policy aspects.
It is important, for the competitiveness of European industry, to ensure that Airbus also remains competitive.
In the European Parliament, we must stand up for fair competition.
The Commission must act on this, for we all have an interest in ensuring that by 2010, the EU is the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
Economic and employment policy, combined with innovative technology policy, will play an extremely important role in achieving that goal.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, first of all I think I can speak on behalf of Commissioner Mandelson when I say that we are grateful for your unanimous support for the vigorous and just defence of the European interests in this matter.
Two people asked whether we should try to relaunch amicable negotiations.
I naturally cannot speak for Commissioner Mandelson, but I can say that it takes two to have amicable negotiations in this case.
The European Commission is certainly prepared to negotiate amicably, as long as the negotiations are transparent and we are on an equal footing, because the case introduced and put forward by Commissioner Mandelson is extremely convincing in my opinion.
Several speakers have said the same.
I think I can say that we are in a strong position.
As regards the call for vigilance, the way in which the Commission has spoken and the way in which my colleague Commissioner Mandelson is dealing with the matter clearly indicate that we are extremely vigilant about this issue, for the legitimate reasons that have been expressed with great conviction during this debate.
You can therefore count on the Commission.
I will obviously pass on to Commissioner Mandelson your strong support and your requests for great vigilance and commitment to a topic that directly affects Europe's economic interests.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) Boeing and Airbus have been accusing one another of receiving illegal government subsidies for years.
This game of reciprocal complaints being examined by the WTO's dispute settlement body continues to fuel the row between the two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world.
If confirmed and acknowledged, these accusations of direct subsidies represent serious obstacles to the global economic system and distort the free market with serious damage to the competitive regime laid down by the WTO.
At a time when we are defending a global system free of any obstacles, this trade war is a glitch in global competition, which is supposed to be fair and just.
Only the WTO's competent body will be able to offer impartial conclusions.
Nonetheless, we know that Boeing wants to position itself as the world leader and this complaint must not turn into an attempt to destabilise Airbus.
This trade dispute is delicate but should not damage trans-Atlantic cooperation at a time when the Doha Round is at a standstill and a favourable outcome is hoped for by the end of the year.
Report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2006 (debate)
The next item is the report by Carlos JosÃ© Iturgaiz Angulo, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2006.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the work of the Committee on Petitions is an admirable resource enabling us to gain an in-depth understanding of the problems and complaints of citizens regarding European affairs.
While these cover a wide range of policy areas, they frequently touch up on land-planning and environmental issues.
They essentially involve all Member States and encompass broad sections of civil society, from individual citizens to multinational NGOs.
Your rapporteur rightly, I think, underlines the importance of the work entailed in the 1 000 or more petitions you receive each year.
There are three aspects of the report and the resolution that I should like to mention.
The first of these is a recent development: the visits the Commission makes to places where a particular problem has arisen.
These visits may have considerable media impact and will undoubtedly give your work a higher profile.
In addition to being covered by the press and the media generally, these missions engender very detailed reports which, in my opinion, are of high quality.
I believe these are important records of your activity and certainly deserve wide publicity.
Those of you who managed to hear the radio programmes last week about the activity of the Committee on Petitions will have understood how important it is that you should give those submitting petitions a personal hearing in the presence of all the necessary experts.
This represents a large investment in time and resources, but I am sure it would be worthwhile.
The second point I should like to emphasise has always been a favourite in these debates: the coexistence or even duplication of a petition and complaint, possibly giving rise to a contravention procedure.
The report indicates that in 2006 at least, the Commission once again did not keep Parliament as well informed as the latter would have liked.
You must surely have foreseen that at this point I would answer by referring to our recent communication on the enforcement of Community law, entitled 'A Europe of Results'.
This communication contains commitments on transparency, the setting of priorities, modernisation, better cooperation with the national authorities and everything you could wish for in these cases of duplication.
That is not all, however.
We have already started work on a document outlining the policy.
The document will put all this to use in the environment sector, which, as I understand from your report, is one of the sectors you are most concerned with.
The third and final point I should like to mention applies more to the future.
Let me assure you once again that we intend there to be the best possible cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.
Such cooperation is mutually beneficial.
Systematic cooperation leads to a better exchange of information and hence an improvement in the level of service offered to our citizens in all sectors.
This is what we all want, so let us try to ensure that the examination of petitions is exemplary.
Once again, I congratulate the rapporteur for raising this issue.
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I firstly wish to thank Commissioner Dimas for his comments and reflections, and I would of course also like to thank all those who made this report possible, including the secretariat staff, all my colleagues who took part in the committee's debates and those who have enhanced this report by tabling amendments to improve it.
I thank you all.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am tabling this report pursuant to Rule 192 of the Rules of Procedure on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2006.
The current report provides an overview of the main elements that characterised the activity of the Committee on Petitions last year. It points out its achievements, and also indicates certain areas where further progress is needed, since obviously we must continue to improve.
Of all Parliament's committees, it is the Committee on Petitions that is in closest proximity to the citizens.
Citizens can approach it on either an individual or group basis, and the committee attempts to provide them with the best solutions, ensuring that the petitions are managed in a transparent and effective way and that the citizens obtain comprehensive answers to the issues they raise.
The right of petition, enshrined in the EC Treaty in Articles 21 and 194, is a significant feature of European citizenship as it enables any European Union citizen and any natural or legal person residing or having a registered office in a Member State to address the European Parliament on matters falling within the EU's remit.
I therefore wish to point out with some enthusiasm that the statistics once more show a steady flow of petitions.
For example, 1 032 petitions were submitted in 2005 and 1 016 in 2006.
Approximately one third were declared inadmissible.
It should be pointed out that the main areas of concern for petitioners generally continue to be the environment and the free movement of goods, persons and capital.
The petitions reflect an important image of the application of European legislation and the impact it has on individuals.
Through their petitions, European citizens highlight the shortcomings and difficulties of the transposition and application process: they are in an ideal position to monitor the implementation of EU legislation at national level.
The proportion of inadmissible petitions also indicates a continuous need to raise public awareness and inform European citizens more successfully about EU legislation and policies, and about their legitimate right to petition the European Parliament.
In order to achieve this, a concerted effort is required by this European institution, but it must be accompanied by the efforts on the part of the various national institutions in each Member State.
I also wish to state, in relation to the European Commission, that the Committee on Petitions relies on the Commission's expertise in investigating the possible infringements of Community legislation that are brought to light in the petitions.
The Commission's recommendations remain instrumental in defining the most appropriate answer to petitioners' problems.
Nevertheless, the committee encouraged and continues to encourage the European Commission to avoid standard, occasionally rather general answers based on a strict interpretation of its competences and the information provided by the Member States.
The Committee on Petitions continued to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the assessments of the petitions should put greater emphasis on citizens' real problems, and to ask the European Commission to carry out independent investigations that could provide for a more coherent approach to specific issues.
I also want to point out that in its dialogue with the European Commission the committee has constantly underlined the important role petitions play in achieving the common goal of bringing Europe closer to the citizens.
It should also be said that the committee and the European Ombudsman had a constructive relationship based on constant dialogue and mutual respect for each other's competences and prerogatives, and two reports were presented.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, firstly, I would like to complain once again about the fact that this report in particular is being dealt with at such an inconvenient hour in terms of its public resonance.
I have five comments to make in all.
My second point is that we need decisions about Treaty infringement proceedings from the Commission.
It is not enough, Commissioner, to produce a document that is simply designed to record one's own determination, which is what the interpretation has just said; rather, it is essential to bring about real improvements.
Your job is to facilitate decisions about Treaty infringement proceedings which you then publish, if necessary with the ensuing judicial decisions or legal rulings.
Thirdly, the Council is becoming more political.
With more qualified majority voting, the Council is taking on more overall responsibility, as co-legislator, for its legislation and thus for the execution of these laws.
We wish to emphasise once again that we would therefore very much welcome much more involvement by the Council in the activities of the Committee on Petitions and, for example, the designation of a senior official to coordinate petition-related matters.
My fifth and final point is this: we do not just want to criticise others.
With this report, we want to send out the message that we ourselves, as the European Parliament, need to improve.
You can read about this in paragraphs 25 and 26.
We need a better process in the European Parliament.
We need appropriate human resources, we need appropriate response times, we need better workflows, we need a more transparent procedure for citizens, and we need a better method of sifting out unimportant and inadmissible petitions at an early stage so that we can focus on those that are admissible and important.
Parliament has taken a significant step forward here by setting up a committee of inquiry, so we are well on track.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I do not support Amendment 1 to paragraph 15, and I am surprised that Mr Atkins has put his name to it.
I believe that it undermines the Committee on Petitions and the work of the Ombudsman, and I would urge Members to oppose it.
The committee plays an important role in bringing the Union closer to the citizen.
Indeed, we have succeeded on many occasions in gaining recompense and fair play, both for individual complainants and for entire communities.
The European Parliament is increasingly seen by citizens as an important platform from which to defend their environment, the quality of their drinking water and their archaeological heritage.
There are weaknesses, however, which have to be addressed in the mechanisms available to the committee and to the Commission in terms of seeking redress and to enforce decisions on governments and local authorities for negligence and, in some cases, deliberate avoidance of the implementation of European law.
There are examples: the M30 motorway project in Madrid, which I, myself, visited on behalf of the committee, where the authorities are still not implementing the agreed actions to remedy their breaches of EU law; a similar case regarding lettori in Italy, who have been frustrated in their search for fair play for over 20 years; and the inadequate laws and procedures to protect drinking water and archaeological heritage in Ireland.
I believe that, as a Petitions Committee and as a Union, we owe petitioners at least the implementation of decisions that have been made against governments and local authorities.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m today pointed out in this Parliament that the law is only as good as its implementation.
Clearly, there are lots of laws at European level not being properly implemented at national level, and citizens will not have confidence in the European Union until they are.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.
I myself became a member of the Committee on Petitions just over one year ago and during that time I have had first-hand experience of the very valuable work that is done by the committee.
But how often do we as politicians hear of the democratic deficit, and how often are we therefore urged to engage with citizens?
Well, the Committee on Petitions is a tangible, hands-on, practical way of engaging with European citizens.
There is an essential element of truth in the statement that all politics is local, and while individuals throughout the EU-27 are concerned with the big issues of globalisation, EU enlargement, emigration, energy supply etc., they are most often concerned with how these issues affect their lives, their families and their communities.
Equally, with European legislation, citizens are concerned with how this impacts on their lives and their communities.
And where they perceive misapplication or unfair application of European legislation, they want a relatively simple, easy and effective way of dealing with that situation.
That is what they look for in the Committee on Petitions.
If their petition is declared admissible, they want it dealt with in an efficient and timely way, and in this I particularly support the rapporteur on paragraphs 9, 10 and 12, where he calls on both the Commission and the committee to improve their timeliness.
I also agree with the rapporteur on paragraphs 25 and 26, where he calls for the need to strengthen the committee secretariat and the need to find the necessary financial resources to continue the development of the e-petition software system.
In my opinion, the Petitions Committee is very much part of the public face of the European institutions: citizens can access the committee and have their case heard, and it is a crucial part of EU citizenship.
But the system must work efficiently.
If it does not, it is the worst of all possible outcomes, because not only do citizens consider that the misapplication or non-application of EU legislation negatively impacts on their lives, but the very system that is there to support them in fact lets them down.
That is why a well-functioning, properly resourced Committee on Petitions, working in good cooperation with the Commission and the Council, is core to supporting and validating the rights of EU citizens.
I fully support the suggestion to enhance the visibility of the Citizens' Portal in relation to the right to petition.
If citizens know that they have the right to petition and they have the expectation of a fair and timely response, then we are strengthening EU legislation, we are giving it greater legitimacy and transparency and we are strengthening the European Union.
Finally, I would like to say to the Commissioner that we must improve the functioning of the committee, as outlined in this report, and that wonderful phrase 'connecting with citizens' can become a reality rather than just an aspiration.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I should like to thank sincerely the rapporteur, Mr Iturgaiz, the members of the Committee on Petitions and also its secretariat, headed by Mr Lowe, for the trend-setting work they have undertaken during the past three years of this parliamentary term.
The Committee on Petitions has dealt with all manner of issues that were distressing the citizens of the European Union and were important to them.
These issues included the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty with the reference to God and to Christianity, the bankruptcy of individuals involved with Lloyds and Equitable Life, and the Catholic broadcaster Radio Cope in Barcelona.
The Committee on Petitions also dealt with land use plans for Valencia, excise duty on motor vehicles, the Rospuda Valley by-pass in Poland, infringement of European Union Directives affecting Ireland (Tara), and the OrlÃ©ans by-pass in France.
In addition, the committee considered the activities of the so-called Jugendamt, the German authorities dealing with young people; many complaints were lodged against the Jugendamt.
As Mr Iturgaiz stated, the Committee on Petitions is very important to the people of Europe.
It brings the EU institutions closer to the citizens and is crucial in terms of making societies aware of the real nature of these institutions.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Mr Iturgaiz, I would like to thank you for this excellent report.
I wish to start by asking the President to pass on the serious concern of all members of the Committee on Petitions about the committee secretariat's total lack of human resources.
I would also like her to pass on this concern to the EP's Bureau, which is responsible for providing sufficient resources for this extremely important task of maintaining fluid communication with the EU citizens.
Secondly, I wish to take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Dimas here.
Since many of the petitions relate to the environment and many of them are from Spain, I would like to discuss how they could be better handled.
Firstly, as guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission is obviously not fulfilling its role when it fails to act with sufficient speed in relation to many petitions.
On numerous occasions we are faced with situations where we act in articulo mortis: in other words, by the time we get around to considering infringement proceedings, it is too late.
Then, as some of my colleagues said, we must take a look at the information supplied by the petitioners.
There are far too many cases, notably in Spain, where there has been no clear response to the petition and not even an attempt to take a serious look at the information provided, for example the petitions on opencast mines or ski resorts in the middle of Natura 2000 areas.
On the other hand, the European Commission has taken exemplary action on other petitions, and here we could cite the case of the Rospuda valley in Poland.
Nevertheless, we are concerned, as I have already mentioned, that in many cases the Commission arrives on the scene too late after a flagrant breach of environmental laws.
We have, for example, the case of the 501 highway in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, where infringement proceedings were initiated when the work had already finished.
We are also concerned about the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.
These are not being applied properly in many countries, especially Spain, where the projects are chopped up so that the Directive does not have to be applied.
Lastly, application of the Water Framework Directive remains extremely patchy, and in some cases relating to large properties in Spain where mandatory reports have been issued against the Spanish Government itself, the European Commission refuses to take precautionary action.
Thank you, David.
I assure you that I will convey to the Bureau your request concerning additional human resources for the work of the petitions secretariat.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Madam President, it is true that one of the Directives most frequently infringed is the Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment, which is compulsory for all building and planning.
Our problem is simply that we arrive on the scene too long after the petitions have been submitted by citizens, when the irreversible damage has already been done.
In Spain we have seen some extremely negative effects along our entire coastline as a result of very aggressive building projects.
Currently a regasification plant is being built right in the middle of El Ferrol estuary, which is of great Community interest and part of the Natura 2000 network, and no environmental impact assessment has been carried out.
This is the only regasification plant in Spain that will not have an environmental impact assessment, thereby creating a lack of security and infringing clear Directives.
We will each of us have to strive to speed up our responses so that the citizens see that their rights are not being violated.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I consider the Committee on Petitions one of the most valuable committees in Parliament, if not the most valuable.
It is the form in which the citizens tell us how the many laws we tinker with in other committees affect them or do not affect them.
Without this feedback we are doomed to work in a vacuum.
But, in terms of doing our work properly, there is something missing in the procedure: the Council and the Permanent Representation of the Member States.
How can we get results for a citizen in dispute with their country without that country being represented in the Petitions Committee?
The second thing I want to mention is a particular petition.
The people of Ireland came to the Petitions Committee, with three petitions in all, in connection with our most important sensitive archaeological site: Tara, the home of the High Kings and of St Patrick.
The Petitions Committee has responded and has asked for the destruction to stop.
The Commission has brought a case against the Irish authorities and yet, by the time anything happens, there will be a motorway, probably there for already three or four years, and all the destruction will have happened.
The Irish people will not get over their disillusionment.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, on his excellent report.
Having been a member of the Committee on Petitions myself since the beginning of this year, I too have to admit that I am becoming a keen supporter of this committee and the importance of its role.
I dare say, however, that many Members in this House are not giving this committee the importance that it deserves, and this should change.
If EU citizenship means anything, surely it must mean that citizens of Europe can stand up for their rights and make their voices heard, regardless of whether they stand up against companies, local or regional authorities, public agencies or even their own national governments.
This right can best be exercised through the use of the petition to the European Parliament - a right that is recognised as a basic right in the Treaty.
Provided that their complaint concerns rights under EU law, people can rely on Europe and on us, as representatives of Europeans, to support them.
The petition is a great tribute, I would say, to Europe and what it stands for, but it is also a great credit to Member States, because Member States themselves signed a Treaty which gave the right to petition, even if the petition can often be used as a tool against Member State authorities themselves.
So I strongly urge EU citizens to stand up for their rights, to use the petition as a tool to defend themselves on EU rights.
Those who will do so will surely find us standing right there behind them.
(PL) Madam President, the European Parliament received 1 016 petitions in 2006.
As in 2005, approximately one third of these petitions were not within the sphere of competence of the European Union and were therefore deemed inadmissible.
This is indicative of the need to ensure that the citizens are properly informed about the remit of the Union and its institutions.
In this connection, I should like to emphasise the enormous contribution made by the Committee on Petitions to the work of the European Parliament in terms of communicating with the citizens and promoting transparency and responsibility in the Union's decision-making process.
The close cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman is also to be commended.
Nonetheless, greater commitment from the Council is urgently needed.
In particular, a senior official should be appointed to coordinate petitions, as many of the latter involve sensitive political issues relating to the transposition of Community provisions into the national legislation of the Member States.
The only way to meet the citizens' expectations in terms of swift and effective responses to their complaints is by speeding up the process of examining petitions and ensuring cooperation between the various institutions.
In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a very well prepared document.
Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.
At the same time I wish to congratulate the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, its members and secretariat for the splendid work they are carrying out.
The Committee on Petitions, despite the fact that on occasion its attendance by MEPs is rather slim, is, I believe, one of the most important committees which links the ordinary citizen of Europe with the EU institutional order.
It provides the mechanism through which our constituents can feel closer to the EU, and it greatly facilitates a feeling among citizens that the EU institutions are not faceless and blameless bureaucrats, but that they also can be held to account, and responsibilities can be asked for and criticisms directed at those that do not do their job as well as they should.
Importantly, this report shows that the continued dialogue of the Committee on Petitions with the Ombudsman and the Commission has been a most useful exercise, but, sadly, the cooperation with the Member States and the Council leaves a lot to be desired, and this is an area where significant improvement is needed urgently.
(PL) Madam President, the contribution made by the Committee on Petitions to communication between the European Parliament and the citizens of the Member States is invaluable and responds to society's expectations.
It is a fact that every year approximately 1 000 petitions are received, some 2 500 documents, and that as many documents again are sent out annually.
Clearly, therefore, such direct contact with the European Parliament is necessary for the citizens of our countries and encourages them to hope that their problems can be resolved.
Of course, this does not mean that the authors of these petitions are always right.
They encompass differences of opinions and interests.
Nonetheless, the very fact that the Committee on Petitions examines the petitions makes it possible to appreciate the problems that are of concern to society.
It also provides an opportunity to improve legislation that is not always unambiguous or transparent, to eliminate legal loopholes and to prevent infringement or incorrect transposition of Community legislation.
I would like to thank the Committee on Petitions for the outcome of its useful work.
Madam President, I am here and am delighted to be so, because I think that the work that the Committee on Petitions does - and I want to congratulate the rapporteur on the work in terms of his report - is very different to any other committee and, indeed, any other report you will find.
We are, I suppose, as members of the committee, and to use that well-worn phrase which I do not like, 'close to the citizen'.
I think that is very important.
They ring our office, they know our assistants, they ask for help, and we do that.
We give them help and bring their petitions to Parliament.
We also deal with a wide range of issues, and that requires Members to educate themselves on all of those issues that come before us, from environment matters to financial services to whatever it is.
We are the committee that most frequently meets, greets and deals with 'real people' - and, again, that is a phrase I do not like to use, but it is a very important one when we speak here in this Chamber so late in the evening.
But the truth is that we rely greatly on the Commission to come back to us with answers, and sometimes the quality, and indeed quantity, of the responses at meetings is poor, I have to say; not always, but in some cases it is not timely and we could do our business a little bit better.
I would support all of the efforts and the mentions made in the report that we do just that.
I believe, though, that it takes a particular individual to come to the Committee on Petitions of Parliament.
There are many citizens who would like to do it, but would not be able to, so we are dealing with people with great determination and obviously people who are angry as well about what is happening in their Member State and they want action.
I will give you an example of a landfill dump called Whiteriver in my own country, in Co. Louth.
It is on our agenda at some time in the future, but even the threat of the Committee on Petitions dealing with this issue has resulted in positive action on the ground.
So, sometimes, we have an effect and we may not even know about it before the petition comes to Parliament.
I want to mention particularly last year's Equitable Life, which was a child, if you like, of the committee's work.
Again, in relation to Equitable Life, it was very important for us not to promise more to people than we could actually deliver.
What the people wanted from us was obviously some measure of redress in terms of compensation for their losses.
We could not do that and we were very strict in saying that, but I think it was important that we pointed out where the responsibility lay - and it lay with the UK Government.
I think it is also important that we keep the pressure on those with the responsibility, again the UK authorities, in relation to Equitable Life, to get them to take action.
A lot of our work is political and it is about pressure points and we have to be determined in order to get results.
I would say this and I have said it to my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group: I think we need a quality-control measure on the work of the committee so that we can do our work better, that we ask petitioners after we have gone through the process what they thought of us in terms of the work we did.
I think we should not be afraid of that.
Lastly can I say, because I say it every time I get a chance, European City Guides needs to be addressed, and I hope it will be.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers in this very interesting debate for their positive contributions.
I agree with most of the speakers, especially Ms McGuinness, Mr Tomaszewska and Mr Matsakis, who said that this committee is one of the most important committees and that it connects European citizens with the European Union's institutions.
I fully agree and I am willing to cooperate as much as possible in order to respond to the concerns of European citizens.
I would like to answer two main questions: how to conciliate the precautionary principle with the need to have evidence before attacking a Member State.
I am aware of the issues raised by Mr Hammerstein and I would like to say that legal enforcement action can only challenge decisions formally taken by Member States in breach of European Union law.
The Commission cannot initiate legal proceedings on a judgment of intent.
Therefore, until a decision is formally taken, there is no room for legal action.
Regarding the issue of the speed of action, the Commission needs to respect the procedural requirements of the Treaty and to make sure that it has developed the right arguments and compiled the necessary evidence where court action is needed.
This can take time.
Nevertheless, in December 2006, the Commission - myself, actually - for the first time obtained an interim order from the European Court of Justice in the environment domain, suspending illegal hunting rules in Italy before the main legal action was heard.
On 18 April 2007, we obtained our first interim order in relation to an infrastructural project.
Each case needs to be evaluated on its own merits, even if recent initiatives from the Commission, supported by the European Parliament, such as those relating to illegal hunting in Italy, which I have previously referred to, or to the Rospuda Valley, illustrate the interest of using this procedure in order to protect the environment.
It should not be used as a routine mechanism.
This mechanism should only be used for high-profile cases where the adoption of interim measures can have a pedagogical effect.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his very informative report, which I sincerely hope will contribute to raising the visibility of the work of the Committee on Petitions, and I assure you, once again, of the Commission's firm commitment to collaboration with you all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The regional impact of earthquakes (debate)
The next item is the report by Nikolaos Vakalis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the regional impact of earthquakes.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I requested this report after I made the following discovery: although earthquakes in the 20th century have killed 1.5 million people worldwide and injured many more; although earthquakes are the second most deadly natural disaster in the world; and although in 2002-2007, earthquakes were the fourth most frequent natural disaster in the Member States and the candidate countries, we in the EU responded to the problem only occasionally and peripherally, and only in the context of other natural disasters.
I now feel vindicated and satisfied that my report has been approved by the Committee on Regional Development and enjoys the support of all the political groups.
The European Parliament's message is clear: in future we, the EU, must not and cannot deal with the problem of earthquakes intermittently and peripherally; we must focus on it as a distinct, separate problem and examine all of its individual aspects and components.
In particular, the report asks the Commission to waste no time in preparing a communication containing an earthquake risk assessment and an examination of prevention, management, relief and restoration measures.
In other words, the communication has to be equivalent to that on floods.
The European Parliament expects the Commission to examine, at least within the scope of such a communication, a number of proposals contained in the report.
Firstly, the adoption of earthquake protection measures should in future be an essential requirement for the funding of infrastructure from the Structural Funds, especially in view of the fact that earthquakes threaten the overall economic and social cohesion of the regions affected.
Earthquakes are, above all, a threat to life and limb, infrastructure, employment, the environment, cultural heritage and tourism.
Secondly, we should promote the construction of new buildings, as well as the conservation and upgrading of old buildings and structures, which include monuments that are not compliant with earthquake specifications.
Thirdly, the European Commission should ensure that more funds are allocated to public information and the training of professionals dealing with earthquakes.
Fourthly, a European strategy for earthquake research should be developed.
Account should be taken of not only the social but also the economic benefits that such action entails.
Fifthly, a technical protocol should be drawn up on joint action by the EU in the event of serious seismic disasters, with particular emphasis on the crucial infrastructures of transport, energy, telecommunications and health.
Lastly, the Barnier proposal should be revived. There should also be a follow-up to the Sarkozy-Karamanlis proposal for a European civil protection force, through a legislative - I stress the word, legislative - proposal by the Commission.
Madam President, Commissioner, the report to be approved tomorrow by this Parliament makes specific proposals.
We - both the Commission and the Member States - wish to respond to them immediately and take action in accordance with each party's responsibilities.
Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, and also my fellow Members in all political groups who have improved my original proposal through their interventions and amendments.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, and I personally, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, for this extremely informative and valuable report.
Earthquakes are not easy to deal with.
There needs to be adequate preparation and sufficient measures must be taken in advance so that we can cope with the most serious effects.
2007 was an important year for developing ways of dealing with natural disasters at EU level.
Not only did we have the largest single mobilisation of the EU civil protection mechanism to fight the Greek forest fires, but two new legislative measures on civil protection were adopted: the financial instrument for civil protection, and a revised European civil protection mechanism.
In addition, as announced in September and following the European Parliament's resolution on forest fires and floods, the Commission is to launch a special initiative to strengthen the EU's capacity to deal with disasters.
A rapid and effective response to emergencies is obviously of crucial importance, particularly for risks such as earthquakes, which are practically impossible to foresee.
However, even when unforeseen events occur, an effective response can and must be supplemented by suitable preventive measures, such as early warning, to limit potential damage and enable the situation to be brought under control.
For these reasons, in 2008 the Commission will develop a complete initiative to improve disaster prevention generally.
After response and prevention, the third stage in the management of disasters such as earthquakes is restoration.
In this context, I welcome Parliament's call for the Council to promote the proposal on the Solidarity Fund.
The financial instrument for civil protection provides a long-term funding framework for civil protection such as earthquake response operations.
The new regulation has almost doubled the funds available.
The Commission also has special plans for dealing with earthquake-related issues and, thanks to the capital allocated by the European Parliament to the EU budget in 2006, the Commission is already supporting the STEP project. This project is being implemented through a partnership between Italy, Portugal and Germany and aims to develop a mobile assessment and administration unit for earthquake management.
The Commission endorses the appeal by the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, for better coordination.
The events of last summer have shown that although the EU civil protection response was impressive, there is still room for improvement.
On the basis of the recommendations of the Barnier report, the Commission is now developing ready-formed civil protection units composed of disaster response experts that can be mobilised instantly.
Lastly, the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, underlines the importance of cooperation with third countries.
The civil protection mechanism allows cooperation with third countries and with the Euromed programme in the prevention, mitigation and management of natural and man-made disasters and is another good example of cooperation in this sector.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Vakalis on his report.
As a Greek, he has tackled a subject that also affects his own region and citizens.
He completed his own-initiative report in a very short time and I give it my full support.
I would very much like to look at disaster control and disaster prevention in a broader context, namely climate change.
Rainfall, serious rainfall, floods, rising sea levels, etc. are going to become more and more prevalent.
In that respect, people naturally look to the European Union.
From 31 October to 2 November I participated in a debate in the United Nations in New York with representatives of many continents and regions.
They also look to Europe and ask us to do our best as regards prevention, prevention programmes and disaster prevention, and want us to bring our expertise into play.
I think that we do indeed need to offer this, alongside innovation and solidarity, on a global scale.
My country, the Netherlands, also partially lies below sea level and has special expertise that we can use in this area.
I am therefore pleased that we can set a good example with the various funds in the European Union.
I would like to reiterate my support for what was said in the debate with the Commission this morning: our Solidarity Fund must be more flexible.
We have a very good Fund, a very good example, but the European Council still has reservations about it.
Finally, Madam President, Mr Vakalis' report has a specifically European dimension.
Disasters are frequently multinational, they do not stop at borders, and I would thus call on the Commission to put forward initiatives with a view to protecting and supporting our citizens.
on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) Madam President, Mr. Rapporteur, dear colleagues, the report on the regional impact of earthquakes was not an easy undertaking, especially because it came as earthquakes do: very quickly and unexpectedly.
For this reason, I would like to congratulate our colleague Mr. Vakalis for the way in which he managed to be a captain on this ship.
Since earthquakes have no ideological connotations, we have had no clashes of opinions among groups.
Our only mission was to find pragmatic formulas to fill a gap in legislation and to create efficient response mechanisms at a European level.
I would like to say that, according to Mr. Vakalis' initial intuition, during the research period for this report we discovered that, at the level of the European Union, we have serious gaps regarding earthquake protection.
We have no unitary mechanism for intervention in case of an earthquake.
Hazard maps are lacking in many European countries and regions. We have no relevant national laws in many countries.
We invest very little in research. We have no European research agenda in the field of seismic risk.
Seismic risk protection in insurance policies, for instance, is lacking or is insignificant.
We have no education campaign for the population, although we have a Eurocod 8, which contains instructions for earthquake protection.
Nevertheless, it does not apply to urban planning regulations for new constructions.
In a word, we also proposed other things. Mr. Vakalis has mentioned some of them.
Those of us who come from the Party of European Socialists reiterated the support for establishing a European civil protection force, inviting the Commission to make a proposal for this purpose.
We proposed a European centralized instrument for preventing and managing earthquake crises. We insisted on advanced research and a programme financed at the European level.
To all this, Mr. Vakalis operated like a perfect catalyst, he prepared excellent syntheses for compromise amendments when we threatened to draw up a report the size of a dictionary.
For this reason, I believe the report is a result of excellent team work and I congratulate Mr. Vakalis and all the colleagues who participated in this report.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, congratulations to Mr Vakalis for his excellent work.
This report highlights the fact that, although earthquakes can have a devastating economic and social impact in seismic-stricken regions, not enough attention has been paid to them by the EU.
The rapporteur advocates - and rightly so - that a series of regulatory and financial measures are urgently needed in order to remedy this unhappy state of affairs.
Such measures should aim at minimalisation of damage caused as well as facilitating speedy and effective response and compensation to affected individuals and communities.
Mr Vakalis states that an area which should be given special attention is that of research.
I agree.
Not necessarily of course research in predicting earthquakes, a practice which has been proven to have limitations, but research in the way we construct our buildings.
Attention to more stable, robust and lightweight materials is an example.
Safety features to prevent electrocution and electric fires being caused after a tremor are another area where research can help prevent loss of life.
Research into telecommunications systems that do not get so easily jumped in the panic that follows an earthquake and research into specialised equipment for detecting and extracting victims from collapsed buildings are other areas where research can be most helpful and very rewarding.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the motion for a resolution on the regional impact of earthquakes addresses for the first time, in a logical and coherent fashion, the issue of seismic vulnerability in parts of the Union and consequently the remit of civil protection services.
I therefore say to the rapporteur: praise where praise is due!
I am fascinated by, and directly involved in, this matter, living as I do in the European region at greatest risk of seismic and volcanic activity: Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.
I had the honour of serving as the Italian Government's commissioner for emergencies recently during a serious eruption of that volcano.
I am therefore familiar with the problem at close quarters, and I also know how behind the times Italy is when it comes to risk forecasting and prevention, and not just seismic risk of course.
Europe, too, lags a long way behind on this front, however.
I have, for example, been calling on Parliament and the Commission for years to establish a European Civil Protection Agency responsible for coordinating the Member States' emergency management services and drawing up a uniform policy on prevention, forecasting and training for staff and volunteers.
Today's resolution appears to go in that direction at long last.
If the truth be told, the European Union as a whole still lacks a culture of civil protection, which often remains nothing more than the subject of round tables and electoral promises, even though what is at stake is the right of each and every one of us to safety.
Before asking local actors, provinces, municipalities and regions for concrete examples, Europe should demonstrate that it wishes to turn the page at last, and I believe that this resolution could constitute the first proper step in that direction.
Mr President, earthquakes are inevitable, but protective shielding measures can be taken to minimise death and destruction and to allow people to enjoy greater safety.
The rapporteur proposes a number of valid measures, which I shall not reiterate.
However, I must in addition emphasise the need for pre-earthquake inspection and the reinforcement of structures where there is a problem, in both public and private buildings such as factories, colleges, recreation centres: I mean places where people gather in large numbers.
At the same time, we must protect and extend open spaces to accommodate the population after a catastrophic earthquake because the profitability of land has encouraged building development.
As regards new construction, the quality of materials and the reliability of builders' must be verified, as human lives are sometimes disregarded in the interests of greater profit, as we know from earthquakes in Greece.
Special protection measures must first be applied in areas of higher seismic risk.
These are essentially densely built-up areas that are deprived socially, economically and in terms of housing.
It is right that there should be Community aid for restoration.
This is the people's money.
The government will also have to adhere to procedures adapted to the soil and housing conditions of the area in order to provide the greatest possible earthquake protection and improvement of residential buildings.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Vakalis, and thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, for the hope he is giving us for the future.
You can escape from fire, Mr President, and if you can swim, you can get away from floods.
In an earthquake, you can only hope to have God on your side.
Since this concerns our metaphysical aims and hopes, it would be good to have the EU on our side.
Sometimes, unfortunately, we do not, because we have seen the Solidarity Fund activated for only one earthquake incident, whereas in cases of flood and fire, it showed great willingness.
We understand, of course, that according to regulations, the damage should exceed 3 billion, but the houses that fall are not those of Onassis or Bill Gates; they are the homes of the poor.
We can therefore bypass the regulations.
Since the Mediterranean region has often suffered intolerable ordeals verging on unfair physical punishment, we are calling, if possible, for the activation of the Structural Development Fund, the Solidarity Fund (provided its strict rules can be moderated), the European Regional Development Fund and also the Civil Protection Fund.
This will permit the funding of vital research programmes and also allow the repair of damage, wherever this can humanly and fairly be achieved.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report by our colleague Mr Vakalis links in seamlessly to the three reports on natural disasters adopted by Parliament last year and is an important addition to them, for these previous reports did not deal with the issue of earthquakes.
We know, however, that many countries and regions - especially in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region - have a high risk of earthquakes.
I therefore endorse the rapporteur's call for the Commission to draw up a communication evaluating the hazards posed by earthquakes and proposing the counter- and follow-up measures necessary to address them, as it recently did in the case of floods.
The question of financing is key, of course, and as the rapporteur on the Solidarity Fund, I cannot understand why the Council is still dragging its feet on - indeed, has in effect shelved - the adaptation of the Solidarity Fund, which this House has endorsed.
Immediate action is required here to ensure that this solidarity and funding instrument is available in future so that the damage caused by natural disasters, including earthquakes, can be remedied quickly, efficiently and flexibly.
Without this flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetables and measures for funding, it has been shown in the past that the needs of earthquake victims have been virtually ignored.
We must consider - as the previous speaker has said - that the Solidarity Fund that is currently still in place has only been used once in relation to earthquake damage.
However, earthquakes are just as much natural disasters as floods, forest fires and storms.
There are other forms of financing, in addition to direct funding, which should be used as well, however, such as regional state subsidies or loans from the European Investment Fund.
This is the only way to ensure that appropriate resources are available to tackle earthquakes.
The report makes a good contribution to this process.
(DE) Mr President, the earthquake in Friaul 30 years ago killed more than 3 000 people and is something which I still remember very vividly.
The images of the destruction, caused within a matter of seconds, and the race against time to free the injured from the rubble are something I will never forget.
It is therefore especially welcome that the European Parliament is dealing with this important issue.
Without the unstinting commitment of rescue workers - including volunteers from neighbouring countries - this type of earthquake disaster is almost impossible to cope with, for only swift assistance is helpful.
Despite that fact, there is still very little cooperation in the EU on research regarding earthquake risks and no common mechanism at European level for crisis intervention.
Binding rules for cross-border cooperation are needed and the cooperation with emergency relief organisations must be stepped up.
I welcome the proposal to incorporate Eurocode 8 instructions in the planning regulations of vulnerable countries.
In most European countries at present there is no legal basis for the assessment of major building structures, but it is those public buildings of strategic importance for civil protection and other critical infrastructures which, in the event of a disaster, must remain undamaged and operational and which require special protection.
The assessment of important buildings must therefore be incorporated as a key element in the regional programmes.
Finally, may I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the reconstruction that has been carried out by the people affected by these disasters.
They are a good example of how, through their own efforts, there is hope of a better future even after total destruction.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur sincerely for his work.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by recalling Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's words that there is no point arguing with an earthquake.
Although 150 years old, these words still hold true today.
As described in the report by Mr Vakalis, we must learn to live with earthquakes and be completely prepared for them.
I would like to commend the rapporteur for his laying down practical instructions and showing us the way forward.
There is no doubt that an earthquake is a destructive phenomenon.
According to estimates by geo-physicians and historians, since the dawn of civilisation earthquakes have claimed the lives of 150 million people.
Fully half of the human population today live in areas with seismic activity.
In Europe, earthquakes might not always have catastrophic consequences; however, we still need to be protected from them.
An earthquake reaching just 5 on the Richter scale can be dangerous in that it causes loose objects to fall, roofing to cave in, buildings to be negatively affected and gas and water services to be damaged.
I personally believe that the steps taken recently to eliminate the negative impact of earthquakes are the correct ones.
They include: introduction of a single emergency phone number; construction of integrated emergency systems; promotion of international cooperation; and exchange of information between rescue forces.
We need to follow up on these steps by continuously strengthening the cooperation of rescue forces in neighbouring regions and countries, improving the qualifications and skills of civil protection experts, ensuring widespread use of information technologies and promoting training for, and simulation of, possible disasters.
We should not aim for the impossible, for example setting up common bodies or harmonising legislation. Rather we should focus on the flaws in the existing system.
Last but not least, we need to realise that earthquakes are just one form of natural disasters, like floods, fires or drought, and that the problem of natural disasters should be dealt with as a whole.
(SL) They say that a friend in need is a friend indeed.
A region where a powerful or even catastrophic earthquake has occurred naturally requires rapid and effective European Union assistance, particularly where the country concerned is itself unable to provide such assistance in full.
In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Europe, the number of victims and the material damage involved, it is highly unlikely that resources from a solidarity fund to assist the victims of earthquakes would be used only once.
The catastrophic fire in Greece demonstrated that the European Union is not sufficiently well organised to deal with such disasters.
I agree with the proposal that we should invest greater resources in research into improved seismic risk monitoring, and funds for that purpose have already been provided in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
It is also prudent to cooperate with countries which already have extensive knowledge and experience in this field.
A strategic plan for dealing with earthquakes, rapid response, coordinated rescue and cross-border assistance can save a large number of human lives.
Naturally, advanced measures can also prevent many problems.
Who could imagine Brussels without the Grand Place, Paris without the Eiffel Tower, or London without Buckingham Palace?
Every country and region has its jewels and cultural heritage which it must protect as much as possible against earthquakes.
Standards for earthquake-proof building must also be complied with consistently, in particular in areas with a high level of seismic activity.
Mr President, once again I should like to thank all the speakers in tonight's debate for their extremely positive contributions.
The Commission supports the approval of the report on the regional impact of earthquakes.
Citizens expect the Member States and institutional bodies to act effectively and in a spirit of solidarity when faced with disasters.
The prevention of environmental damage and damage caused by human activity entails the strengthening and development of civil protection resources and capabilities at local, national and European level.
The Commission is confident that Parliament will continue to endorse and support this aim in the future.
Lastly, let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that on 22 and 23 November, the Commission is holding its second civil protection forum in Brussels.
The forum will be attended by approximately 500 participants who work in the field of civil protection or have an interest in it.
It will enable participants to exchange ideas and will give them a chance to meet others who share their interest in civil protection and who work in the same field.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to take part in the forum and meet the civil protection community.
Once again let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, on his excellent report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) Tectonic movements are manifested not only by earthquakes but also by volcanic eruptions.
In addition, the effects of these natural hazards can be aggravated, notably by land movements and tsunamis.
The European Union's outermost regions, which often suffer this type of disaster, have developed key experience in observing, preventing and responding to these phenomena.
I hope that the Commission and the Member States encourage the setting-up of centres of excellence in scientific, technological and architectural innovation in the regions affected by these natural hazards, notably the outermost regions.
The dual objective of these structures would be to ensure public safety and to enable sustainable land development, through interregional cooperation and the networking of research establishments, SMEs and local authorities in the regions concerned.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for having approved my amendments to this end and I reassure him that I fully support his renewed request to the Commission to publish as soon as possible an ambitious proposal for a genuine European civil protection force.
Proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid - The European Union and Humanitarian Aid (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Commission statement on the proclamation of consensus on humanitarian aid, and
the report by Mr Cornillet, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the European Union and humanitarian aid.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Cornillet and congratulating him on his report, which identifies perfectly the challenges facing the humanitarian effort, and in particular on the fact that he also identifies perfectly the approaches to be taken in relation to European humanitarian action.
This report is a vital contribution to the joint work by Parliament, the Council and the Commission to put in place the future European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.
Our common objective is to formalise in a joint declaration by the three institutions our vision and our common approach to humanitarian aid policy.
There is no doubt in my mind that the active involvement of the European Parliament is essential for the success of this process to adopt the declaration.
Allow me to reiterate very briefly the reason for this political initiative: basically, the humanitarian context has changed in recent years and we need to adapt to it if we want our humanitarian action to continue to be coherent and effective.
What are the main changes and what are the main challenges?
In my opinion, they can be summed up as follows.
Firstly, there are more and more conflicts and natural disasters and their death toll is also rising.
In particular, the natural disasters are often caused by climate change: the recent floods in Mexico reflect the reality and extent of this worrying trend.
Secondly, we are also witnessing an increase in complex crises and significant changes in the nature of conflicts.
The methods and means used in armed conflicts, for example, make the work of humanitarian organisations more and more complicated.
The risks of attacks and pillaging of aid are also unfortunate daily realities, be they in Darfur or Somalia, Sri Lanka or Myanmar, Colombia or eastern DRC.
We are also increasingly the witnesses of systematic violations of international humanitarian law and, consequently, restrictions of humanitarian values.
There is a constant risk of confusion between the political and humanitarian agendas.
I firmly believe that the European Union, as the largest global donor - I think it is important to reiterate that together we account for 40% of global humanitarian aid - but also as a political pillar of international law and multilateralism has, as far as I am concerned, a particular responsibility to ensure effective and adequate humanitarian aid.
We can, and we must, act as a political catalyst and be a political benchmark and reference, too.
That is the context in which, almost a year ago, we decided to launch the initiative to reach an explicit consensus on humanitarian aid at EU level.
These concerns are clearly reflected in Mr Cornillet's report and I naturally support the key elements that the European Parliament wishes to underline and defend in the preparation of a European humanitarian consensus.
This consensus and appropriate monitoring involving all 27 EU Member States and the Community will for the first time provide a common political core of values, objectives and principles, supported by the Member States and the Commission, which will help to improve the complementarity and coordination of the work of the Member States and the Commission.
What are the main elements of the draft consensus?
The first is respect for humanitarian principles: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence.
You are of course well aware of what is entailed.
The second is the need to strengthen respect for, and application of, international humanitarian aid law at international level. Let me tell you a brief anecdote in this respect.
I will not mention the country but I remember, not too long ago, I was in a particularly dramatic theatre of operations from a humanitarian perspective. I was putting questions to one of the country's senior figures, who was responsible for what was happening there, and I said to him: 'You are not complying with international humanitarian law'.
He gave me a truly terrible response: 'That is true, but this is a time of war'.
It is evident that international humanitarian law is designed precisely for times of war.
You can therefore imagine the extent to which we are in fact moving further and further away from it, in some way without any reaction, or moving further and further away from the most basic standards in this respect.
Thirdly, we need to improve donors' practices and methods as well as the quality of the partnership with the humanitarian organisations in order to make the aid provided more efficient.
Fourthly, there must be a voluntary commitment from the Member States to strengthen the complementarity and coordination of our humanitarian actions, and this is of course all the more necessary with enlargement bringing us up to 27 Member States.
The future consensus will also have to provide a general framework to define the relationship between humanitarian aid and the EU's other external policies.
The ultimate goal is to make the EU's humanitarian action more consistent and more effective.
All of this will make a significant contribution to strengthening the international system under the aegis of the United Nations and this is a point that I would like to emphasise.
The move to promote a European approach is evidently not aimed at weakening or competing with the central role of the United Nations.
On the contrary: it will serve to reinforce this central role, and it is sad to see at times some reticence about this European consensus on the grounds that it would be in competition with the United Nations.
That is absolutely not the case.
The opposite is true: it aims to strengthen the European pillar within the framework of the United Nations, and this goes without saying.
The draft text of the declaration on the consensus clearly refers to the elements of the consensus that will to some extent form the European Union's humanitarian doctrine in the future.
I would like to thank Parliament and the Portuguese Presidency for their work during the negotiations on this text.
We are now reaching the final stages of this trilateral procedure, which should enable us to fulfil the ambition of having all three institutions sign a joint declaration on 18 December.
This declaration on the consensus is but the beginning of a process.
It not an end in itself, but the beginning of a process.
We know that this approach is going to require considerable efforts to ensure that our words become actions.
To this end, at the start of next year we are going to present an action plan for the implementation of the future humanitarian consensus.
Over these months of debate to prepare the consensus, the European Parliament has put forward some very specific suggestions, and we feel that it is entirely appropriate to incorporate them in the action plan, such as your proposal to draw up a humanitarian aid atlas based on the model of the development atlas.
Allow me to add a few comments on two subjects of particular interest to the Members of this House.
They relate to quasi-philosophical elements of humanitarian aid, which are today at the centre of certain debates and which are, moreover, elements of the goal of humanitarian aid itself.
The first is the issue of the 'responsibility to protect'.
Following Parliament's suggestion, we highlighted in the draft text of the consensus the commitments made in this respect by countries within the framework of the UN and the international community.
I should point out that humanitarian action and the responsibility to protect are based on two different approaches, even though they have an important point in common, namely stopping human suffering.
We must avoid any confusion between these two approaches because it could damage the image of the humanitarian actors as neutral and independent, something that is vital for us to be able to help people affected by humanitarian crises.
The concept of the responsibility to protect is still relatively ambiguous.
This concept, in the past and even today, is very closely linked to the idea of the right of interference and military intervention for humanitarian purposes in extreme circumstances, for example to prevent genocide.
However, that interpretation is precisely the reason why some regimes reject the concept of the responsibility to protect: they see it as a political cover for Westerners to justify their imperialism, to justify interventions founded not on humanitarian interests but on a desire for power.
At times there is confusion between this doctrine of the responsibility to protect and protective humanitarian action, which, inter alia, is traditionally part of the mandate of the ICRC.
We fully support the latter activity through our humanitarian aid.
Mr Cornillet's report also raises a very relevant question regarding the institutional framework for debating humanitarian policy.
Parliament has appointed a Permanent Rapporteur for Humanitarian Aid, and we congratulate it on that.
The report rightly raises the issue of such representatives in the Council.
On behalf of the Commission, we gratefully acknowledge the considerable efforts of the Portuguese Presidency to give the Council the time needed for the preparation of the consensus in the development working group.
The institutional decision to set up a Council group to focus on humanitarian policy is of course down to the Member States, but I agree entirely with Mr Cornillet that it is vital to establish an appropriate body to tackle systematically humanitarian issues on an equal footing with the Union's other external policies.
Humanitarian aid is neutral and independent of any political or other objectives but that does not mean that politics are not involved in any way.
On the contrary, the elements and actors that threaten humanitarian values are political in nature.
The Lisbon Treaty clearly recognises that humanitarian aid is a separate chapter of our international action and I feel that this should be reflected in an institutional structure.
In that regard, I must say that I feel that there is a growing trend - which I am not denouncing yet because there is no reason to denounce it when nothing dubious is going on - to believe, for example, that the logistical capacities of armies could quite easily, to some extent, be more closely involved in the humanitarian field.
I will not reject anything out of hand, but I will say, however, that we should reject any interference by a sector that does not have a humanitarian purpose.
I can understand that in certain specific cases military logistics are used to assist humanitarian actions. However, I will not deny that I, personally, would prefer such actions to be the political responsibility of foreign ministers, as is the case in certain countries, instead of them being carried out under the aegis of one or more defence ministers.
This debate will continue, but I feel that it is more and more common to see in the humanitarian field sectors or logistics - corpora - that can undeniably cause confusion.
In conclusion, Mr President, Mr Cornillet, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with the European Community's considerable contribution to the humanitarian effort and in particular I pay tribute to all the men and women who work on the ground in very difficult circumstances to provide humanitarian aid to those who need it.
I firmly believe that this consensus should allow for more systematic, coordinated action.
It is to some extent the basis of the doctrine, the founding principles and it genuinely offers a framework for permanent coordination at European level.
On the basis of this future consensus, we can become much more effective, which is after all the objective.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will try not to repeat the excellent points the Commissioner has just made.
We are evolving in a completely new landscape.
Insofar as the Constitution had provided for it and the simplified Treaty will incorporate it, we are going to put together a full Union policy, the humanitarian aid policy, and, as the Commissioner stated, we are the world's largest source of aid.
It in this landscape that this report must be examined. It is not just a response to a Commission communication; it is a working document on the consensus achieved with my colleagues.
For the first time the three institutions are going to publish a joint document.
It is the first time since the adoption of the Regulation on humanitarian aid in 1996.
It was time for a well thought-out text that provides a general political declaration on humanitarian aid for our three institutions.
I would like to emphasise the excellent collaboration involved in this discussion, both in the Committee on Development, where my report was unanimously adopted, and with the European Commission and the Portuguese Presidency.
I would also like to emphasise that the Members of this House supported 12 specific points, plus a budgetary point. I would like to outline them here in order to explain, first of all, the extent to which we support them and why, and in particular to say that these points were incorporated in the consensus and that the European Parliament was pleased with all of the points it requested.
As regards the first point, closely linked to the previous topic of natural disasters, we wanted to see a new definition of humanitarian action because of course there are armed conflicts that, by their very nature, cannot necessarily be predicted and there are disasters that, paradoxically, are starting to become predictable, as a result of climate change in particular.
We know that in some countries there are going to be disasters, even if we do not know when exactly: the floods in South-East Asia are one example.
We thus hope that the boundaries of humanitarian action can be put in place much earlier, with training of personnel and pre-positioning.
Then, at a later stage, we can clearly see the grey area that can exist between what is still part of the humanitarian effort but is already becoming reconstruction and will eventually become development assistance.
We were very firm in our belief that these boundaries should be extended, and this would have budgetary implications, which I will discuss later.
Another important element of these boundaries, as far as Parliament is concerned, are the forgotten crises, which are forgotten in the minds of the public, but not forgotten by those who live in the midst of them.
For example, in Colombia there are almost as many displaced people as there are in Darfur, and that is something that warrants our attention.
The second point is of course the definition of humanitarian aid and its principles, which were reiterated by the Commissioner: humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence.
The consensus defines these principles for action, on which our institution's humanitarian action is based.
Finally, we highlighted the most vulnerable groups, with specific reference to women, gender and the specific role women play in the field of humanitarian action.
We also wanted to emphasise the role of local actors and civil society.
I will come back to this topic when discussing food aid.
As regards the use of military resources - and the Commissioner was very clear on this - military resources, especially logistical resources - I am of course thinking of helicopters that that can be crucial in a front-line intervention in a natural disaster - can only be used as a last resort and within the framework of a mandate, so that their use is extremely clearly defined.
There is always the risk that they are party to the conflict or considered to be party to an armed conflict, and it is thus important to look at this in great detail.
The same applies to civil protection: here, too, we hope that the use of civil protection assets will always be an exception and take place within the boundaries of a clear framework to ensure that the humanitarian effort does not become blurred by the intervention of actors who are not directly front-line actors.
Here in the European Parliament we obviously support the reforms within the UN, with one stipulation, Commissioner.
We hope that the funds to be allocated to the CERF are additional funds.
There is no reason why our institutions should be deprived of the ability to be a driving force through the ECHO Directorate-General in particular.
If the Member States or other donors want to contribute to the United Nations funds for front-line intervention, that must not be to the detriment of what is already being done and should be over and above this.
Another aspect that is very important to us is food aid. It has naturally been incorporated in the humanitarian aid framework, but we wanted to emphasise that it can sometimes have a harmful impact by disrupting local markets.
When food aid is offered but not properly thought out, it can violate the primo non nocere principle: 'do not harm'.
It is important to learn from the example of other countries that are very well-known for this in their humanitarian actions so as not to make the same mistakes.
Finally, I want to talk about the responsibility to protect.
What the Commissioner said was extremely important and we fully support your comments on the right of interference and the need to stop and think, and on complete respect for the humanitarian effort, which should possibly result in consideration of sanctions at EU level.
We have at last secured our representative and thank you for pointing that out.
We simply want this consensus report to incorporate not just a set of principles but also a roadmap with which we will have - and this has been agreed - an annual meeting so that Parliament, too, can play a full role.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs supports Commissioner Michel's proposal for an interinstitutional declaration on the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, but the individual governments of the 27 Member States are still pursuing national policy goals on humanitarian aid, which sometimes differ substantially from Europe's goals.
The Council and the Member States must make humanitarian aid a moral and political imperative, inspired more by the effectiveness of that aid than by national or post-colonial interests.
We cannot confine ourselves to distributing rice and bread, however necessary that may be.
The EU's humanitarian aid must be accompanied by political and diplomatic activity that makes compliance with international law, especially international humanitarian law, a priority for the so-called recipient state.
