We need to bring closure to many of the issues of reform that have been before us for so long.
The complex Members' statute is difficult and the hard work led by Nicole Fontaine is testament to that.
But we must continue to try.
I tell this to Members: I will, in a hands-on way, try to achieve that reform, but never over the heads of the Members of this House.
It will be done in the fullest, most transparent and open shared consultation.
I have learned here how good we are at legislating on and talking about equal opportunity and gender equality, but how bad we are sometimes as an institution at putting it into practice.
I pledge today before this House that, should I have the privilege to lead at the end of the day, I will promote the equality of gender in various ways, but most visibly and at the outset by it being apparent in the construction of the Cabinet.
Since 1998 I have had the privilege to lead the Liberal Democrat Group and together, I believe, with my colleagues, we have established a capacity for doing politics, which is the business of this institution.
We are 626 Members, we are a Parliament.
I am not seeking, Mr Bonde or other colleagues who share your fears, to be the sixteenth president or prime minister of the sixteenth state.
I am proud to be a parliamentarian and we must bring our parliamentary and democratic vision to bear on the great issues of the day in Europe.
We must make Europe fit for a future on a continental scale and we must make the democracy in this House fit to offer a real leadership and act as a counterweight and check and balance against the excesses of technocracy or bureaucracy.
I want to say to Hans-Gert Poettering and to the PPE-DE Group how greatly I appreciate his and their unswerving commitment to be full and faithful partners to an agreement which we made.
But I want to say this also: I have had the privilege to visit many groups, many committees, many intergroups.
I want, if I can, to lead a Presidency which is a stakeholder Presidency, open to build on the talents of those who will contribute.
I ask you for your support.
Finally, Mr President, smaller groups in this House do not find themselves with the credible possibility that my Liberal Democrat Group finds it has today.
I do not know what the final result will be, but I know this much: I cannot see how those who say that they value more openness, a change in the system, who would like to see a fairer share for all, can reconcile this with voting for a large-group candidate, not because of any fault with the candidate, but because of the nature of the system we have.
If you wish to transform the system, today's vote will be the first mark of whether we are dedicated to transformation and change.
That is my appeal; I ask for your support.
I should love to have the privilege to lead; but the choice now rests with you.
Mr President, colleagues, I make no apology for beginning my contribution by thanking the outgoing President, Mrs Fontaine, for the work that she did as President.
She led the fight against terrorism long before 11 September.
It is to her credit that she took those initiatives at that time.
Before a vote is even cast in this election, we already know the winner.
The winner is the European Parliament because, as Pat Cox has rightly said, we have had an open election, keenly, but fairly contested.
That can only help to raise the profile and to improve the image of this institution - something which frankly is very necessary.
The 1999 European elections, Eurobarometer and other opinion polls all demonstrate that this institution has an image problem.
With the Convention, enlargement and the 2004 European elections, we face enormous challenges.
Every Member of this Parliament now has the opportunity, in a secret ballot, to vote for the person they believe can best guide us through this vital phase.
I have been a Member of this Parliament for 17 years.
I have had the honour of being its Vice-President for 12 of them.
In that time I proved my determination to work for Parliament and for all its Members.
As rapporteur on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, I negotiated with heads of government to secure codecision for this Parliament.
As one of Parliament's representatives on COSAC, I worked to convince national parliaments of the importance of the convention method for the next reform of the Treaties.
As Vice-President of Parliament I have sought to modernise and improve our working methods.
I am deeply conscious of the fact that everything I have achieved in this Parliament has been achieved through working with colleagues across the political spectrum.
I have fought for what I believe to be right, and I have done that, sometimes, against the interests of my own political group and sometimes even against the interests of my own country.
If elected President, I pledge to fight for what this Parliament needs.
That includes: firstly, a stronger role in electing the next President of the European Commission; second, codecision for all legislation; third, an end to the artificial distinction in the budget between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure; fourth, ensuring that we, in this House, are ready for enlargement.
We all know that the European Union faces many sensitive issues in the coming months and years.
My task as President would be to ensure that at this vital time Parliament's voice is not only heard but acted upon on these issues.
This plenary is Parliament's shop window to the world.
It should be the place where the outside world can identify the real points of controversy between ourselves, and between ourselves, the Commission and the Council.
Yet, frankly, because we deal with so many items - about 35 every four-day part-session - and because of the structure of our debates and the amount of time we spend voting, the relevance of what we do in this Chamber is sometimes obscured to the outside world.
We need, as a Parliament, to resolve more issues in committee and reform both the structure of our debates and the way we vote.
We need to provide our committees and rapporteurs with the necessary technical and legal resources to allow us to become a genuine equal to the Council as a co-legislator.
In short, I want this Parliament to become a real debating Chamber - a Parliament where the general public can hear lively debates over real political choices and one where every Member feels that they have the opportunity to participate.
I strongly believe that Members of this Parliament do an excellent job carrying out our legislative, budgetary and control functions.
But no parliament can work in the dark.
It is vital that we reconnect with the citizens so that we really can live up to our claim to be the voice of the people in EU decision-making.
Thirty months is a short time.
Reform will only be possible if the President has the support of all Members across the whole House.
We need a President for all of Parliament.
My record in this House, I hope you will agree, demonstrates that I would be an inclusive President.
I have already committed myself to having a cabinet that would be balanced in terms of gender, nationality and political party.
I would want a team of all the talents from right or left, big group or small group, medium-size or no group.
If elected I pledge to be a President for the whole Parliament and all its Members.
If you elect me today I would see this as the pinnacle of my political career.
All my energy, all my commitment and all my enthusiasm would be channelled into ensuring that this is a Parliament of which we can be proud.
(Loud applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have had a quality exchange of views during this campaign, which rarely happens in this House, and I think that it will now be difficult to backtrack and imagine an election with a pre-determined outcome, with our plenary session serving only to ratify the decision.
For that reason alone, I believe that this campaign was well worthwhile.
The most surprising thing is that the five candidates took up the same three themes.
Perhaps it is not surprising, because if we put our differences aside, we share the same view, namely that Parliament needs to reform its working practices, and that it must ensure pluralism, respect and equality for each Member of this House and be more accountable to our fellow citizens.
So, we say yes to reforms.
Let us use the plenary sessions to showcase our work.
I dream foolishly of having such stimulating sittings that there will be more Members present in the Chamber than interpreters in the booths.
I believe this dream to be a realistic one.
But although the reforms are essential, they must not be at the price of our diversity.
We have enough political experience between us to be able to determine, by consensus, what can technically be achieved in committee and what must necessarily be the subject of political debate in plenary.
The person with the strongest convictions must never simplify the debate to the point where that person is the only one expressing a point of view.
It is true that democracy is sometimes complex, but the complexity of debating is better than sterile monologue.
With regard to reform, I have tried to prove that when you really want something, you can achieve it.
You will recall the assistants' statute, for which I was responsible. After a 23-year long deadlock, 99.5% of Members submitted all the documents on the agreed date to prove that the assistants had a genuine contract and full social security cover.
So, as far as reforms are concerned, we can discuss them, we can take action, and this is what I have tried to do in a small way.
Let us now discuss pluralism and equality.
I remember when I had the honour of chairing our vote on an important issue for my group, which was that of GMOs.
Voting was suspended because of a formal sitting and, when it resumed, there were not enough Members to pass the legendary milestone of 314 votes.
Some of my friends in the Group of the Greens said to me 'GÃ©rard, perhaps you could have gone slightly more slowly to give our friends time to get back to their seats.'
But, what sort of president would slow down or increase the pace of the votes depending on how this could affect the outcome?
It seems that I conduct the votes at a swift, albeit regular pace, and this is the price of the respect that I owe you and the trust that you have placed in me.
I must also listen when a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left draws my attention to the fact that some of our employees are facing job insecurity or when a Member of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party asks me to intervene because some of our disabled Members need additional assistance.
And even when Mr Fatuzzo makes one of his wonderful speeches, I try to find an appropriate response, to value his talent as a speaker.
Being from a small group myself, I understand the great importance of respect owed to each Member.
As far as pluralism is concerned as well, we can discuss the subject, we can take action, and this is what I have tried to do in a small way.
I shall now turn to openness.
You will recall that not long ago our rooms were used exclusively for Parliament work. In other words, they stood empty most of the time, which is ridiculous when we are aware of the need for debates with the citizens in our countries.
I therefore spearheaded an amendment to our Rules of Procedure, so that, for example, the first world congress on the abolition of the death penalty could be held here.
Other debates with the citizens are also being prepared in Brussels and Strasbourg in which our committees are involved.
With regard to openness, once again, we can discuss it, we can take action and this is what I have tried to do in a small way.
In some ways, I have not been campaigning for two and a half months; I have in fact been trying to carry out reform and introduce more pluralism and openness into our Assembly for two and a half years now.
When you believe in what you say, you put it into practice, without even knowing whether you will ever have the honour of asking your fellow Members to vote for you.
Of course, it would be extremely presumptuous for me to say that I have done all this single-handedly.
As you know, everything here is achieved by working together and through dialogue.
On the assistants' statute, there was deadlock initially between the groups before we moved towards unanimity within the working group. Then we achieved unanimity at Quaestor level and finally we reached unanimity within the Parliament' s Bureau.
And I would like to congratulate the person who enabled us to carry out all these reforms and many others.
Although I did not play a part in electing her, whenever I encountered deadlock, she always gave me the necessary impetus to enable me to move forward. Thank you, Mrs Nicole Fontaine.
Although I utterly devote myself to Parliament - I think that I, like several other Members, have a 100% attendance record - it is due to a constant desire for dialogue, because I am a firm believer in seeking consensus, perhaps because I think that a victory where one' s opponent is crushed is a defeat in the sense that the victory always contains an element of the war in the offing.
Therefore, we have reform, pluralism, and openness, which is all very well, but I shall make a promise: if we achieve this objective, we will face even more work in the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, be aware that when we started our work, we were regulated by a Treaty and when we finish, we may be working within a Constitution, meaning this is an historic stage for us.
I am firmly convinced that, when faced with global instability, we as politicians can help roll back injustice, violence, pollution and poverty.
Parliament is the beating heart of the whole continent and because hundreds of millions of citizens elected us to fulfil this task, we have unparalleled legitimacy and we must use it well.
In conclusion, I will say that I found the campaign an incredibly valuable experience and I believe that the whole House found this as well.
I am sure that whoever becomes our next President will know how to continue to foster this attentive, working atmosphere of democratic debate.
I can therefore only end by saying one thing in all our working languages.
In spite of my terrible accent, I hope that you will understand what I say as I mean it sincerely - obrigado, gracias, grazie, tack, Ã¥ÃµÃ·Ã¡Ã±Ã©Ã³ÃŽÃŸ, thank you, dank u wel, danke, tak, kiitos, and merci!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my friends and colleagues of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left nominated me as a candidate as this is an extension of my work as the Group's chairman.
For two and a half years, I have tried, as chairman, to help to bring to life a specific type of politics for Europe.
It is this approach that my candidacy illustrates.
One of the main characteristics of my candidacy is its firmly left-wing stance.
In my view, European leaders are not drawing lessons from the worrying disaffection of the citizens towards the European institutions.
There is growing concern on the ground surrounding employment, social welfare, public services, and sustainable development, whereas the Council and Commission are focusing more attention on deregulation, commercialisation, and solely market-related issues.
I think that we must take a clear stand on this contradiction.
In the same way, one of the salient features of our time is the aspiration of social actors to be involved in the decisions that concern them.
However, within the institutions, undertaking consultation before drawing up policies and, more importantly, assessing their effects after implementation remain largely formal, even non-existent processes.
We cannot stand back and do nothing about this discrepancy which many believe manifests itself in the crisis of confidence that we are currently experiencing.
Lastly, the topical subject of globalisation is mobilising the public on an unprecedented scale.
We will see this once again in a few days' time at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.
But the Europe of today has neither the ambition nor the resources to meet the global expectations for alternatives.
We must take action.
A number of us here, in addition to my own Group, think that if we do not make sweeping changes, Europe will disappoint us greatly.
If nothing changes, the historic opportunity that enlargement presents could turn out to be a fearsome trap.
We must make ourselves heard and seize every opportunity to do so.
This particularly applies to the quintessential political day of reckoning that constitutes the first round of the ballot for the presidency of Parliament.
Another aspect of the political approach that I have tried to adopt since the beginning of the legislature, and which I hope my candidacy demonstrates, is the will to avoid dividing the progressive MEPs according to their political culture that is often assumed for reasons to do with history and the specific identity of each nation, each political culture being therefore equally worthy of respect.
Within my group, then, staunch federalist Members sit alongside and cooperate with Members who are deeply attached to the sovereignty of their country.
Both represent a part of the real Europe.
We must design and build the European Union of the future by working together and with mutual respect.
This is a difficult task but it is necessary and, in my experience, ultimately worthwhile.
That is another characteristic of my candidacy.
Last but not least, I will mention one last characteristic; namely that there is a specific set of ethics in politics.
I welcome frankness, transparency and honest relationships, even between opponents and, more importantly, between partners.
Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that I value my opponent, Mr Cox, on a personal level, and even that I welcome the courteous relationship I enjoy with a number of fellow MEPs on the right, including their main representative, Mr Poettering.
Thankfully, there are other things in life apart from politics.
Nonetheless, I must say, equally clearly, that the candidate common to all these political families cannot, in any circumstances, count on my vote or on my support, direct or indirect, in the following rounds of the ballot.
I should like to affirm this and I shall do so.
On this point, I would like to express my surprise and regret at the extremely disappointing attitude of those Members who did not waver in their campaign on progressive issues in the first round, yet, in the second round, offered their vote to the only candidate of the Right, who has been dubbed the candidate from a small group, especially for the occasion.
Each Member is entitled to his or her own principles and methods; these are most definitely not mine.
Mr President, the cards are now on the table and it is up to us to shoulder our responsibilities.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now announce the outcome of the vote.
Voters: 590.
Blank or spoilt ballots: 7.
Votes cast: 583.
Absolute majority: 292.
I shall now read out the number of votes obtained by each candidate:
Mr Bonde: 66 votes
Mr Cox: 254 votes
Mr David Martin: 184 votes
Mr Onesta: 37 votes
Mr Wurtz: 42 votes.
Since no candidate has obtained a majority of the votes cast, we shall proceed to a second round of voting.
Unless there are any objections, the nominations from the first round shall stand.
Mr President, as agreed with my group and in line with the approach that I outlined before the first ballot, I am withdrawing my candidacy and I urge all the Members who voted for me, whom I would like to thank, to now vote for Mr David Martin.
Ladies and gentlemen, as agreed with my group, I am withdrawing my candidacy.
My group has discussed at length the various qualities of the candidates.
I believe that, whatever the outcome, we will have a worthy President.
Mr President, I should like to say thank you for the 66 votes.
Those who voted for me can meet in room R31 at midday and decide when I am to withdraw.
The deadline for submitting nominations for the second round of voting is 12.15 p.m.
Nominations must be submitted to the Oldest Member through the offices of the Deputy Secretary-General.
Mr President, in accordance with the gentlemen' s agreement made at the Conference of Presidents, I would like to ask for an extra quarter of an hour, that is to say, I would be grateful if we could start at 12.45 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 p.m. and resumed at 12.45 p.m.)
I shall now read out the outcome of the vote that has just taken place.
Voters: 592.
Blank or spoilt ballot papers: 13.
Votes cast: 579.
Absolute majority: 290.
The number of votes obtained by the three candidates standing is as follows:
Mr Bonde: 76 votes
Mr Cox: 277 votes
Mr David Martin: 226 votes
Since no candidate has obtained an absolute majority, we shall proceed to a third round of voting.
We now need to know whether all the candidates wish to continue with their nominations.
Mr Cox wishes to do so.
So does Mr David Martin.
Does Mr Bonde wish to continue?
Mr President, I should like to request that the meeting be postponed so that the discussion among those who voted for myself can continue.
It is obvious that we are not asking for a single political concession.
Those who have voted for myself are independent Members from small and large groups who do not feel that they have had all their wishes met.
It is a mixed coalition with absolutely nothing political about it, but these people therefore have a need to talk with the two candidates who will be competing in the final round, Mr Martin and Mr Cox.
We met with them in room R31, and we should like to continue a little longer.
Otherwise, I shall have to maintain my candidature, although that is not what I wish to do.
Mr Bonde, I must consult the entire House as to whether or not it consents to suspending the sitting.
(Parliament voted in favour of suspending the sitting)
(The sitting was suspended at 3.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.40 p.m.)
I shall now read out the results of the vote that has just taken place.
Voters: 586.
Blank or spoilt ballot papers: 18.
Votes cast: 568.
Absolute majority: 285.
The results are as follows:
Mr Bonde: 33 votes
Mr Cox: 298 votes
Mr David Martin: 237 votes.
As you will all have realised, Mr Patrick Cox has obtained an absolute majority of votes cast.
I offer you my sincere congratulations, Mr Cox, on your election and my best wishes for the performance of your duties, for a term of office which is fruitful and beneficial to the European Parliament.
I call on Mr Cox to take the Chair.
(Loud applause)
It feels very different to be here.
Colleagues, today has been a good day for parliamentary democracy in the European Parliament.
I want to thank our colleague, Mr Soares, the doyen d'age, for the manner in which he has conducted our sitting so far today.
Our House has divided in votes in this election today on three occasions.
That is politics and democracy.
Our House has decided, and that now gives legitimacy.
I am bound to tell you that after the vigour of this democratic contest in these past months and the past hours today, I feel a deeper sense of the legitimacy of the mandate of this presidency.
I thank you for it.
I thank Mr David Martin for the manner in which he has conducted his campaign for the issues which he has articulated and brought forward, which are of common concern and on which we must act.
I thank Mr Bonde for what he has brought to this campaign, in particular an expression of the concerns felt my many in the House who feel more marginal than they ought to.
I thank Mr Onesta for bringing his typical panache to the reform agenda and I commit myself to that agenda.
I thank Mr Wurtz for his kind remarks earlier today.
I know that politics divides us because we have our convictions.
We owe our conviction to no person or group of persons.
Conviction, passion and reason are part of what we bring to our politics, but also an appreciation of being able to do business with each other.
He has brought that too.
I thank my colleagues in the ELDR Group.
I feel very proud that this is the first time in more than two decades that a representative of this group that has played an important part in the democratic life of this House.
Since the very first assembly of the Coal and Steel Community 50 years ago we have done so.
It is an honour to preside over the House today.
I say to my Liberal colleagues that this is a very bitter-sweet moment: sweet, as you may imagine for all those reasons and bitter-sweet because I have always done my politics week in, week out, day in, day out, in the bosom of that group.
I thank you for all the confidence you have shown in me over the years.
I hope I can repay a debt of gratitude and a debt of honour.
(Applause)
I thank Mr Poettering and the PPE-DE Group for their nomination, in addition to that of the ELDR, and for your unstinting support in terms of delivering on what you said.
To have a reliable partner in politics is always important.
It is a foundation on which we can build in an inclusive way in this House.
I thank all those who voted for me.
In acknowledging all those who voted for other candidates, now that the matter is settled I hope we can develop a genuine stakeholder presidency committed to building in this Parliament and in the Union a Union and a Parliament fit for Europe's future.
(FR) On my own behalf and on behalf of all Members, I would like to pay a very sincere tribute to Mrs Nicole Fontaine,
(Applause)... for her great courage, her dynamism and the tireless work she has done day in, day out to defend the interests of our Parliament.
Mrs Fontaine, your presidency of this institution has been outstanding and exceptional.
Nicole, speaking as your friend, I would like to thank you very deeply.
I said earlier today when we were all, as candidates, invited to speak for five minutes, that I felt we needed to do more politics in this House.
We took that very seriously, which is to say, more politics, yes, but I did not expect that we would have three ballots.
You are so enthusiastic for politics at this stage that we will have to see how to build on this for the future.
It reminded me, in a certain way, given my provenance as an Irish European, of the shamrock, which has three leaves and which represents so much to us.
This time it took three occasions before we had a result.
I should like to share a story with you, which is not classically parliamentary but nonetheless has a connection and meaning for me on this day of all days.
It is a story written by one of the celebrated architects of our European integration, Robert Schuman.
He once wrote, outside the political domain, that a certain saint of Irish extraction - Saint Columbanus - "is the patron saint of those who seek to construct a united Europe".
I do not say in Parliament that it is our function to deal with these saintly matters, nor to intrude in that domain.
But I recall the story because in the sixth and early part of the seventh century this abbot, poet, scholar and preacher - not the only Irish one to so do - co-founded western monasticism in early medieval Europe.
His remains today lie and are celebrated still in Bobbio in Italy.
One thousand three hundred years ago this early Irish European wrote that he came "from the edge of the world".
I come from the western seaboard of Europe, from the edge of our European world, and I have a deep pride about where I come from.
Although today I accept and acknowledge that I was not elected for my Irishness, I thank you nonetheless that I can also celebrate that fact and that nationality.
You have found at the heart of European democracy the capacity to take someone from one of the smallest groups and smallest states and say that, in contemporary European democracy, there is a place to include all, including those on the geographic or other margins.
It is a powerful message that you have given to a Europe about to enlarge.
I thank you and salute you for it.
(Applause)
I shall now speak briefly in Irish.
Why do I do this?
Irish is my native tongue.
It is an ancient language from an ancient European country.
It is an official but not a working language of the European Union.
I do it to underline my conviction that cultural pluralism and cultural diversity are the sine qua non of the Europe to which I am committed and which we seek to build.
(Applause)
TÃ¡imid ar imeall na heachtra is tÃ¡bhachtaÃ­ i nua-stair na hEorpa, forleathnÃº an Aontais Eorpaigh.
Is Ã© an tosaÃ­ocht pholaitiÃºil is prÃ¡innÃ­ ar fÃ¡d nÃ¡ go gcuirfÃ­ bailchrÃ­och rathÃºil ar na caibidlÃ­ faoin bhforleathnÃº.
As athaontÃº na hEorpa a leanfaidh sÃ© go dtabharfar Eoraip scoilte le chÃ©ile d'fhonn comhluachanna agus rath eacnamaÃ­och a bheith ag a muintir i bpÃ¡irt le chÃ©ile.
(We are on the brink of the most important event in recent European history, the enlargement of the European Union.
The successful completion of enlargement negotiations is the overarching political priority.
Reuniting Europe brings together a divided Europe to share common values and economic prosperity.)
We are building something by way of common values and future economic and social prosperity and we are doing work of historic dimensions.
The Convention which starts in March and on which we now need to work is another opportunity to define institutions and treaties fit for our common European future and for the challenges ahead.
The Barcelona Process of which we will speak tomorrow and in the weeks and months to come will be a message that we too must connect with and bring reform, bring employment and bring social capacity and economic capacity to the Europe in which we believe.
The common theme to which I would like to dedicate this presidency is a political commitment - through policy leadership, through stressing our public purpose, through insisting on the added value we bring on a continental scale - that we are building the democratic part of Europe's future and that we are the check and the balance and the counterweight and the source of accountability for the European technocracy.
We are therefore in our public purpose an indispensable tool to an enriched European future.
It is common, I understand, after an election for the President to claim the privilege to speak to the House on the morning after the vote, when he or she might be better prepared after the rigours of the vote to express a general view.
I have chosen this moment to say a few words.
I should like to claim the privilege to speak on our strategic purpose another day, but I would suggest not tomorrow, because tomorrow we will hear the public purpose of the Spanish Presidency.
If we wish to become a communicating Parliament, we must find our space, we must find our time, we must get our message across, have our story, tell our story, sell our story.
I want, with all of you, if you will do it with me, to ask you to reflect on this.
I have sat in the pit of this Chamber since we came here two years ago and before that, from 1989, across on the other side of the canal.
Right behind the President, you see the image of Europe with the twelve stars.
We are politicians so, of course, we must be pragmatic and keep our feet on the ground; but nothing says that we cannot look to those stars and dream our dreams about what future we wish to create.
I invite you for the next two and a half years, through a stakeholder presidency open to those who will contribute and who are willing to develop what we are as a Parliament, to engage with me in an act of European imagination, sometimes to elevate our gaze above introspection and look to the stars for some kind of European imagination and dream.
Because when we imagine today, we build the capacity for tomorrow.
My friends, thank you for this extraordinary privilege. I am excited by it and I am humbled by it.
So far as I can give any impulse to motivate or mobilise majorities in this House, I will dedicate my entire energy to doing so.
I want to work with you on committees; I want to work with you in the Conference of Presidents and in the Bureau to achieve together our full potential.
Thank you for bestowing on me today the honour to do so.
(Applause)
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 15 January 2002 is an important day in the history of the European Parliament.
We have elected a new President, and I should like, Mr President, to congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats.
I shall say something about the candidates in a moment, but I would ask the other groups to understand when I say that there have been many who doubted that it was possible to elect an MEP from a small country or the chairman of one of the smaller groups as President of the European Parliament.
I should like to say to you, Mr President, and to everyone else too, that I am very grateful for the fact that the opportunity was given - and to our own group, too - to raise the profile of our European culture, and for the fact that a small political group and a small country also have the chance to take over one of the most important tasks in the European Union.
(Applause)
Europe would be a poor continent if the practice were only to give the responsible positions to people from the 'larger' countries.
When everyone is given an opportunity and when a figure from Ireland, such as yourself, can become President of the European Parliament and our much-respected colleague, Mr Santer, from Luxembourg, can become President of the European Commission, then Europe is a continent that respects the dignity of all people and all Europeans.
This, I believe, is the message today. We are giving new expression to the fact that Europe is not governed by the few, but that everyone has a voice, an influence and a portion of responsibility.
In this task of yours, which you are now carrying out on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I wish you a lot of luck, Mr President, and much success when it comes to the common future of our ancient European continent that never ceases to renew itself.
I should like briefly to acknowledge your fellow candidates, Mr Onesta, Mr Wurtz, Mr Bonde and, in particular too, Mr Martin.
I well remember, Mr Martin, the discussion we had some years ago in Edinburgh, the capital of another small European nation, Scotland.
That was many years ago and, at a time when I had no special responsibility here in Parliament, I became very aware then of the fact that it is a source of great enrichment, and also very necessary, that the groups in the European Parliament, despite their various political orientations, should be agreed and united on one goal, namely a peaceful and democratic future for our continent, based on the principle of liberty.
I should therefore like, today too, to convey a sincere word of thanks and acknowledgement to all the candidates, in particular Mr Martin.
(Applause)
Allow me to say a final word.
Mr President, this continent was divided. When many people, in both my own and other groups, were elected to this Parliament in 1979, no one would have dared to dream that, in a few years' time, we should be able to welcome fellow MEPs from Central Europe here in the European Parliament.
I should like to propose that, on the day that the accession agreements are signed with the first accession countries, we invite observers here to the European Parliament so that they might begin preparing these countries for the democratic elections to be held there in 2004.
I wish you all the very best on behalf of our group.
No one will mind my saying this today on behalf of the group of which I have the honour of being chairman, and I am also rather proud that we have kept our word.
Trust too is important in politics.
As I would also say to the other groups, our group will always be an ally of yours while the peaceful and democratic future of a strong and progressively more united Europe is at stake.
I wish you much success in your work and God' s blessing upon it.
(Applause)
Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate you most heartily on your election.
But more than just congratulating you, I would like to wish you the best of luck, because you are taking on the presidency of this Parliament after a hard-fought electoral battle with ourselves.
Our group did not vote for you, but you are our President and we hope that you will carry out this task in the gentlemanly, impartial and graceful fashion which is typical of you.
We also believe that we have played an active role in demonstrating the principle of democracy to all European citizens.
Democracy means opposing each other politically while respecting each other and maintaining our common values, and, in this regard, we are at an absolutely crucial moment.
Why?
Because we have affirmed our common values.
I hope, Mr President, that you will defend the positions of the European Parliament in the Convention we are now starting on the future of Europe, and, above all, in the affirmation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights as an affirmation of this 'community of values' .
It is also true that we are the hosts of the Convention, because it is going to take place right here in this House.
Fortunately, Parliament can already be seen as an open house for all Europeans, which you can defend strongly.
And, in addition to supporting the views of the European Parliament, you should make it possible for our colleagues in the national parliaments to actively participate in this process, which is starting almost simultaneously with your presidency.
I am also thinking of those Europeans who want to share in this common adventure.
I think that it is important that we treat them as if they were our own from the month of March without waiting for the ratifications to take place.
They are going to be members of the Convention.
We have to develop our relationship with them.
We are now talking about an enlarged Union. But this is not the appropriate time to go into details.
I have a great deal of confidence and hope in your inaugural speech, which will demonstrate to us the contribution your presidency will make to this process.
If you would also allow me, Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have actively and loyally collaborated in this electoral process.
Firstly, to my Socialist colleague, David Martin, with whom I have had the opportunity to share responsibilities for quite a few years now, in the Parliamentary Bureau and in the presidency, to Francis Wurtz, who I think has been an open and noble candidate, to GÃ©rard Onesta and Jens-Peter Bonde, who has been able to completely polarise the electoral process and then was, with a great deal of grace, able to offer you a bouquet of flowers.
I had none prepared, Mr President.
In any event, I would like to express our congratulations as a group, our intention to offer you our loyal collaboration, in the hope that you will be the President of all Europeans for a Europe that is more progressive, with more social justice, sustainable development and, above all, a Europe in which we are able to lay the foundations for a Constitution for all Europeans.
Even if there is no bouquet of flowers, the words themselves are bouquet enough.
Departing from the normal order of precedence and because of the nature of today, I should like to invite my friend and colleague, Mr David Martin, to take the floor.
Mr President, before turning to congratulate you, I should firstly like to say that the whole House was honoured by having such a distinguished European and unflinching democrat as Mr Soares chairing our presidential elections.
It was delightful to see him here.
I offer you my warmest congratulations.
It is a victory that was well deserved.
You had to campaign hard for it. You did so.
You fought your corner robustly and you demonstrated throughout the campaign all the qualities you will need to be a first-class President of this House.
I look forward to working with you.
Given what you said, and your whole record in this House, I know you will work to defend every Member's rights and interests; that you will be fair across the political spectrum; that you will be articulate in defending the rights of this Parliament externally and robust with the other institutions, when necessary.
I offer you my unfailing support and my loyalty over your two-and-a-half years.
I look forward to working with you.
I would like to say thank you to my own political group, firstly for allowing me to stand and secondly for giving me so much support during the last three or four months.
Perhaps even more importantly I would like to thank those who did not vote for me.
I reckon I have spoken to between 300 and 400 Members.
I have spoken to every group in this House.
I have spoken to committees and intergroups.
Wherever I have gone I have met unfailing courtesy and politeness.
Even when people disagreed with me they were prepared to give me a hearing.
That is democracy in action.
I thank the whole House for behaving in that manner.
(Applause)
Again, in that spirit, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for what he said, which falls into that category.
This is not the time for long speeches, Mr President, but you deserve your victory.
I wish you well.
You said at some point during the campaign that whatever happened, a week or two after the election we would have a bloody good drink.
I am looking forward to it!
(Laughter and sustained applause)
With regard to that quote which has now slipped onto the record, and which I cannot deny, when we had a debate on 28 November 2001 in Brussels, I remember at some stage concluding my remarks by saying Ã  propos the suggestion that Mr David Martin has just put on the record, that one half of me, being Irish, wanted to have a drink but the other half, being Scottish, did not wish to pay for it.
So we still have not worked out the rules of engagement.
(Laughter)
I ask Mr Bonde, Mr Onesta and Mr Wurtz if they could join us.
Mr President, of course, like all my fellow Members, I can only welcome your victory, which is obviously well deserved, since it has been gained through lengthy consideration and debate.
I think that the greatest victories are those that are achieved gradually.
Your victory, given the pace at which it was achieved, is certainly a great one.
You have told us that your presidency will be neutral but not indifferent.
Well, from your first remarks, I believe that you are going to keep your word, because I think that neutral is something that you will be - your track record speaks in your favour and I think that you will listen to everyone.
But your presidency will not be indifferent, because you are a dedicated European.
You immediately made reference to the flag hanging opposite us and behind you, Mr President, and it is true that this flag unites us in spite of our differences.
And you emphasised these differences by speaking in a language which is not a working language but is an official language.
There are so many languages in Europe that could become official languages when Europe is closer to its people.
I think that you have illustrated this wonderfully.
I would like to conclude by saying that I hope that your presidency will be conducted in a manner that reflects the tone of your first speech, in other words, determined and pleasant.
I shall try.
Mr President, on behalf of my group and on my own behalf, I would like to sincerely congratulate you on your election.
Everyone knows that we did not support your candidacy but that we respect you as an individual.
And we are democrats.
You are now a President for everyone.
You are inheriting a responsibility successfully borne, during the first half of the legislature, by Mrs Nicole Fontaine, who, throughout her mandate, respected pluralism and cooperated loyally with every Member.
We hope that this cooperation will continue under your Presidency.
And, given your character, I have no reason to doubt this. I would therefore like, in this spirit, Mr President, to wish you good luck.
Mr President, in any election held by secret ballot in an Assembly, there is always an element of risk and there is always an aura of suspense.
I must say that at the end of a race that has enthralled us all, you have come first, you have crossed the finish line, and you have now been elected President.
We would like to congratulate you, of course.
And we think that you are the type of President that we want.
I have become familiar, at the Conference of Presidents meetings, with your sense of diplomacy and your witty, but firm, remarks.
That may be the case but, throughout today' s proceedings, Mr President, I felt your concern, I shared your nerves when faced with the uncertainty of the ballot and the final outcome was a great relief to both of us when it was announced.
When you were elected, the first thing you said was that you were President of the whole House, that you were President of all Members, of those who voted for you, and of those who had not.
You are now everyone' s President.
Of course, if you speak to each Member individually, you would discover that many more Members voted for you than the number credited to your name.
But that is how things stand at the end of the day.
The promises that you are making, Mr President, given your Irish nature, must not be directed to any one Member of this House.
Therefore, when you decide, at the beginning of your presidency, to buy a drink, I can understand the concern of the Irish half of your nature, which has to pay.
So, if I may, I would say to you that if you want to be honest and keep your promises, you will not buy just one drink for just one person, but you will have to buy 626 drinks - one for each Member who is here.
Yes, that is what it means, Mr President!
I would like to end on a slightly more serious note. The group that I chair, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, was struck by the first remarks that you made regarding the need to protect the diversity of our cultures, because Europe will become stronger by adding the characteristics of each nation and not by trying to get rid of these differences which is what some are seeking to do.
We have taken note of this as well.
We are counting on you to do this.
You can count on us to support you but you can also count on us, if it is necessary, to keep a close eye on the decisions that are being taken.
Thank you Mr Pasqua. I will keep you in suspense no longer: tomorrow, at 1 p.m., all the Members are invited to come for a drink with me beyond the confines of Parliament.
You too, Mr Pasqua.
President Cox, you have been elected by a majority.
There are different voices at the bottom of the ballot box, and I would remind you of something.
I know that, when a person belongs to a minority group - you belonged to a minority group for a long time, yourself - he gets used to offering advice to all and sundry.
Well then, I remain faithful to your custom and am going to offer some advice to the President of this House, whose status far surpasses that of the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of a tiny little group.
Therefore, I would draw your attention to the wisdom of an old rabbi.
In difficult situations, when he was told that he had two options, he used to reply: 'In that case, I choose the third.'
Mr President, today, you must forget who voted for you and who voted against you.
You represent the institution that must work in the interests of the Community as a whole.
You represent the European ideal, and it is this ideal that is being attacked by a politician from one of the families of those who voted against you: as chance would have it, coincidentally, Mr Haider, and, quite coincidentally again, of course, Mr Berlusconi.
Your role is to act not in the interests of those who elected you but in the interests of Europe as a whole, irrespective of who voted for you or why.
This is what we expected from Mrs Fontaine and she almost always delivered.
Moreover, I know that no-one will ever totally live up to the institution' s expectations.
However, Mr Cox, there is a moral challenge before you, and that challenge is to free yourself from the enormous power of those who supported and voted for you.
It will not be easy, and if you ever need independence or allies to defend the pluralist approach, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, both those Members who voted for you and those who did not, is at your disposal.
Do not let yourself be pinned down by one or the other: uphold the freedom that comes from pluralism. That is your task as President.
Mr President, you did it!
It was wonderful.
You had a dream and you succeeded.
Fortunately you have more dreams, more visions.
I am sure you will succeed again.
On behalf of the Liberal Group, we congratulate you.
We are so proud of you.
We will miss you.
We will miss your engagement, your visions and your good sense of humour.
But fortunately you will stay among us.
We will do the utmost to cooperate with you and to make sure that your dreams, our dreams, will come true.
All the best.
I miss you desperately!
Mr President, 29 years ago I visited MÃ¡rio Soares in his exile apartment in Paris.
At that time I did not know I would be thanking you today for the good leadership of this meeting.
I have signed the letter of withdrawal and prepared the speech of withdrawal and regret that the last vote started with my name.
May I thank the 76 colleagues who lent me their votes in the second round to support the fair chair platform.
It was clear from the beginning that the battle would be between Mr Cox and Mr David Martin.
We have had good discussions in the groups and a splendid televised debate arranged by European Voice and the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform.
The final debate before the vote today was the result of a common initiative from the five candidates.
Our friendships have not been weakened but been strengthened.
Dear Mr Cox, congratulations on your victory.
You gained the majority in a secret vote.
You are no longer the result of a deal. You have a clear mandate from the House.
The election campaign made you aware of the problems we need to solve.
Voting must be reformed; speaking time should allow for lively debate, all Members should have access to all documents from the legislative process; small groups and independent Members should have their fair share of posts; backbenchers should be able to speak at least three times a year; newcomers should be invited as observers and have their languages accepted.
The Convention must appropriately represent the different views of both the federalist majority and the minorities.
A democracy must always be fair in how it treats its minorities and you will be fair in how you serve the many minorities in this House.
I wish you 30 months of hard work for the equal benefit of all of us.
Congratulations.
On behalf of the quite large Non-attached Group of thirty-plus Members, some of them refugees from other places, I congratulate you on taking office.
This is a wide and diverse group with a lot of political philosophies, which stretch across the whole range, but they have in common the fact that they all have a political mandate, they have all been supported by thousands, indeed often millions of people in various ballot boxes in different countries.
Winston Churchill once said that democracy can be inconvenient, but it is the best system we know.
You also, in your introduction, made a point about people who feel marginal.
Often, people within this group have felt marginal; indeed some of them used to be in a group that was dissolved and they felt very unhappy about the way that was done.
I do not wish to make any political points because it would be very difficult to find a common political point in this group; but I do want to point out what unites all the members of the Non-attached Group, which is that we look to you for fairness, we look to you for reasonable treatment, we look to you to recognise people in this part of the House when they speak and we look to you to recognise that although many of us may be awkward, we are nonetheless democrats and we nonetheless wish to play a part in the workings of this House.
You come from a small country and a small group; indeed we know that you come from a very small group because you were a group of one when you came from Ireland.
I am now a group of one so that gives us something in common.
So, from one member of a group of one to another member of a group of one, let me say: congratulations.
We look forward to working with you and I know all my colleagues on these new benches look forward to you treating them fairly and, I hope, giving them the democratic respect which I know they all deserve.
Mr Balfe, as a group of one, I am sure you are unanimous on that sentiment.
We have now conducted our parliamentary business but we are joined also by colleagues from the European Commission, whose presence I acknowledge with gratitude because this is an important moment in our democratic life in Parliament.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the European Parliament.
This appointment represents the pinnacle of the political career of a loyal, convinced Europeanist, and I am therefore looking forward with great enthusiasm to building a relationship of cooperation with you that I hope will be close and fruitful, just as our relationship of cooperation with Mrs Fontaine was close and fruitful and enabled us to develop a relationship between Commission and Parliament that I feel was truly exemplary.
Indeed, close, constructive cooperation between our institutions is the key to the smooth running of the entire Community system, and I am sure that, with you at the helm, this cooperation will be guaranteed.
Ladies and gentlemen, your role of monitoring and supervising the Commission' s performance of its executive duties is vital to the smooth running and transparency of the Community system.
This principle of transparency must underlie the major processes on which our institutions are working at this great, historic time: enlargement and the process of developing a Constitution, the debate on which was opened for the first time just a few weeks ago at Laeken and will continue here in a few months' time.
This House directly represents the European citizens, and it is clear that it has the primary task of building the new Europe.
Working together, Parliament and the Commission can and must show that it is possible to build a new relationship between the citizens and the European institutions.
Once again, Mr President, congratulations on your election.
I and my fellow Commissioners look forward to working with you towards this goal.
Mr President, I too would like to thank and congratulate you, although I do not have much to add to what Mr Wurtz has said.
I have just one comment to make.
We are often told that the composition of Parliament does not accurately reflect our societies, our schools or even our football grounds.
It is true that we still lack women and that there are not enough second-generation immigrants.
On the other hand, there is a sector, and I would draw your attention to this, where these two categories are more than amply represented, and that is the cleaning staff, the people whose job is to look after our comfort.
When one thinks about it - and since you are the President of everybody, I would be grateful if you would take some notice of them as well - one realises that many of the cleaning staff are second generation immigrants.
The second thing I would like to say, and I am not entirely joking, is this: you surprised us all by speaking in your native tongue.
My own language - I come from Senegal and am a French MEP - is Bambara.
I can therefore only hope that I will have just one opportunity before the end of this Parliamentary term to express myself in my capacity as a Member of Parliament in my mother tongue, for that is what we mean by diversity and is also a way of giving each person recognition, for, despite all our differences, we have a future to build together.
Colleagues, I thank everyone for the good wishes and advice and reiterate that tomorrow, at lunchtime, I invite all Members to join me in a moment of brief celebration.
That brings us to the next order of business.
We now must elect the Vice-Presidents of Parliament.
It is 5.30 p.m.
If there are amendments I will take them, but I propose to set a deadline of 6 p.m. for candidacies.
They should be lodged with the Deputy Secretary-General in R 00.101 in the Louise Weiss building.
I hope you are in agreement.
Mr President, for obvious reasons, we have to choose between one of the two scenarios and we would ask that we respect the agenda as previously set, that is to say, that the deadline for nominations be extended until 6.30 p.m.
There may be special circumstances in the case of this request.
If this is agreeable to the House - we have had a long day of voting and people need to be able to connect and consult - and we accept that suggestion, the nominations will have to be in by 6.30 p.m., which means we vote at 7 p.m.
The sitting is suspended.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.35 p.m. and resumed at 7.05 p.m.)
First, Mr President, warmest congratulations on your election.
I just want to make a technical announcement before we start voting.
There has been a general breakdown in the computer network and it lasted five minutes due to defective hardware.
The problem has been identified and is being solved and the good news is that the system is now working.
Do not panic: the right people are on the job and hopefully we will have no more problems.
Election of Vice-Presidents of Parliament
The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament.
I wish to inform you of the list of candidates that has been received.
I have received the following candidates: CederschiÃ¶ld, Colom i Naval, Dimitrakopoulos, Friedrich, Imbeni, LalumiÃšre, David Martin, ...
(Loud applause)
...
Onesta, Pacheco Pereira, PodestÃ , Provan, Puerta, Gerhard Schmid, Vidal-Quadras Roca.
The candidates have confirmed to me their consent to their candidacies.
The number of candidates does not exceed the number of seats to be filled.
Therefore I propose that they be elected by acclamation, in accordance with Rule 13 (1).
(Loud applause)
The applause is the acclamation that confirms that the 14 are now elected as Vice-Presidents.
However, we must now vote to determine the order of precedence.
I therefore proclaim these candidates elected as Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament. I congratulate each and every one of them on their election.
We shall now vote to decide on the order of precedence.
As we are voting only to decide on precedence, no qualified majority is necessary.
The ballot papers to establish this order of precedence will now be distributed.
The tellers are the same as for the election of the President.
I would therefore ask the tellers to take up position by the ballot boxes.
Mr President, I have a question.
We have up until now been told that we must put crosses against the names of at least seven candidates if the ballot paper is to be valid.
Does this requirement to put crosses against the names of at least seven candidates now still apply?
It is my information, Mr Friedrich, that you may put your mark against any number of candidates, as large or as small as you wish that to be.
It is your preference.
There is no rule on the matter.
Please use only the official ballot papers and mark the boxes corresponding to the candidates you wish to vote for.
If you want to change your vote, ask the usher for a new ballot paper and surrender the old one.
We now proceed to the vote.
The result will be announced tomorrow.
For the election of Quaestors, the deadline for candidacies is 10 p.m. tonight.
Candidacies should be lodged with the Deputy Secretary-General in office R00.101 in the Louise Weiss building.
(The sitting was closed at 7.28 p.m.)
Election of Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament
I should like to take this opportunity to give you the results of our vote yesterday for the Vice-Presidents.
As you know, we elected the Vice-Presidents by acclaim and then held a vote to establish the order of precedence.
The number of Members voting was 554, the number of blank or void votes 9, the votes cast 545.
The votes were cast as follows:
Mr Martin: 300 votes.
Congratulations, David.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos: 240 votes.
(Applause)
Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld: 230 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Imbeni: 226 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca: 215 votes.
(Applause)
Mr PodestÃ : 203 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Friedrich: 200 votes.
(Applause)
Mrs LalumiÃšre: 191 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Colom i Naval: 168 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Pacheco Pereira: 164 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Provan: 162 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Schmid, Gerhard: 151 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Onesta: 148 votes.
(Applause)
Mr Puerta: 120 votes.
I congratulate all those colleagues and, in accordance with Rule 15(2), the Vice-Presidents will take precedence in accordance with the number of votes they have obtained.
The composition of the new Bureau will be notified to the presidents of the institutions of the European Communities.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The next item of business is the approval of the Minutes of the sittings of Monday, 17 December 2001, Monday, 14 January 2002 and Tuesday, 15 January 2002.
The Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I think there is a translation error in the Danish text in that, under point 7, 'Closure of sitting' , the words 'The oldest Member closed the sitting at 7.30 p.m.' appear.
I think it was you, Mr President, who closed the sitting, and that is also what the French version states.
Thank you, Mr Rovsing, for looking after my interests so soon.
Douze points!
We will have that corrected in the Minutes.
Are there any further comments?
(Parliament approved the minutes of the previous sittings)
Mr President, there is a matter I should like to raise.
On 19 December, just before Christmas, I was the victim of a robbery in the immediate vicinity of our Parliament in Brussels.
I was in my car waiting at the traffic lights when my windscreens were smashed and everything was taken out of the car.
I will spare you the details, but I have heard that raids of the same kind have occurred several times since then involving other cars, even last week.
My question is: could the newly elected Quaestors catalogue the type of robberies that have taken place in the last year near the European Parliament building in Brussels and take tough action with the police so that the latter take measures, for I can assure you, to have to endure something like that is no laughing matter.
Mrs Maij-Weggen, that evidently meets with the approval of the House and we will do that.
Order of business
The final draft agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday, 10 January, under Rule 110, has been distributed.
I have received no proposals to change the agenda for this session.
(Parliament adopted the agenda for the current part-session).
Mr President, on a point of order.
In light of the amendment tabled by Mr Davies and myself at the end of last year to the common foreign and security policy report and adopted by Parliament, calling on the EU to act as an honest broker between India and Pakistan over the dispute in Kashmir, could we have a Council declaration or an oral question on this matter at the next part-session?
This dispute dates back more than 50 years; UN resolutions have not been acted upon and, as both countries are now nuclear powers, it is very important that we resolve this dispute.
I ask the EU to be proactive and to offer its services as a mediator, as no other body seems to be doing so.
Mrs Lynne, that is a more unusual point of order but I note the point you make.
I would ask you to have the item raised by the chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents, which is the appropriate means of seeking to put it on the agenda.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The House will be aware that last week in Nigeria a young woman was condemned to death for adultery.
She was to be stoned to death, having been buried in the ground.
After a letter from Mrs Fontaine, a number of Members of this House and from myself, as ACP Co-President, that death sentence was not carried out, and an appeal can be made within two months.
However, I am appalled to tell you that a further case has now arisen; an 18-year-old is to be taken to court on Monday for the same offence of adultery and will be condemned to death, again by stoning.
I sincerely hope that this House, and every Member in it, will support you in writing to Nigeria in the hope that such sentences will be stopped in the future, so that this barbaric method of killing someone under Sharia law is taken up with the Nigerian Government and the latter urged to ensure that it never happens again.
Mr Corrie, the follow-up required is clear and I shall do so.
I shall communicate that to you and to colleagues.
Mr President, yesterday you showed you have a sense of history, and that prompts me to ask a question about the European School Portal supported by the European Commission.
Last week, a web site of this kind was opened that refers to a Soviet history book from 1982, according to which Finland supposedly initiated the Winter War.
We all know that the Winter War began with the 'Mainila shots' staged by Stalin, and it is outrageous that the European School Portal should contain this type of error.
It offends my national sentiment and feeling for history.
The Commission has promised to investigate the matter, but I would ask that Parliament' s authorities too look into the issue.
It is outrageous that European schools should allow such poor quality on its web sites accessible via the School Portal.
Thank you, Mr Thors.
We will look into that and we will communicate with you.
Mr President, I should like to inform both you and the House of the tremendous damage caused by the horrendous weather which hit Greece in December and which has still not subsided in certain areas, where temperatures have plummeted to below -24 degrees Celsius.
Several million trees have been destroyed, the olive and citrus crops have been ruined; in some cases they have been completely wiped out.
The chairman of our group, Mr Wurtz, has written to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.
First, may I congratulate you on your appointment; then may I ask you to start your term of office by intervening to obtain compensation for Greek farmers who, as you know, are the worst paid in the European Union; compensation for the damage caused and your help in restoring it.
The situation is desperate and we must all intervene at once and do something about it.
Mr President, from his palace in Carthage, President Ben Ali continues to repress and dismiss judges and to subject his Tunisian political opponents to intimidation in a number of ways.
I think that Parliament must urgently adopt a position and the Council must issue a statement on this matter this week.
I also think that this situation is absolutely intolerable.
Parliament' s watchword should be 'Carthago delenda est' or 'Carthage must be destroyed' , as we can no longer tolerate this regime.
Thank you, Mr Dupuis.
There is no proposal along those lines on the agenda at the moment and this week we do not have a topical and urgent debate either; but I take note of what you said and we will see what we can do.
Decision on urgent procedure
The next item is the request for urgent procedure on the proposal, on behalf of the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs, for a Council Directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco (COM(2001) 133 - C5-0139/2001 - 2001/0063(CNS)).
I should like to ask Mrs Randzio-Plath if she is in a position to advise us on whether or not we should grant urgency.
Mr President, I would like to point out, in addition to this, that we want to submit a second report.
We hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that there should be a compromise with the position taken by Parliament, whose Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well known to have voted the first proposal down, but which is now prepared to draw up a new proposal in the Katiforis report, one which we are keen to present to the whole House in February.
In February, the Council of Finance Ministers will still have enough time to come to a decision about it.
Accordingly, I have also written to the Spanish Presidency of the Council on the Committee's behalf, and have also informed the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rato of it during last week's meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That being so, I do not think that the request for urgent procedure should be agreed to.
If they are offering to take one speaker for, and one speaker against, the advice from the committee is not to grant urgency.
Do we have a speaker for or against that proposal?
Mr von Wogau, it is not necessary but it is possible.
Mr President, I get the impression that there will be speakers only against the urgent procedure, something I consider a very important step.
There is the danger that the Council will decide on its position before Parliament's has been produced.
I consider it a matter of urgent necessity that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs should deliver its opinion first, and that only then should the Council come to a decision.
It is for that reason that we should reject this request for urgent procedure.
On the basis of the two contributions we have a consensus.
(The request for urgency was rejected)
Election of Quaestors of Parliament
The next item is the election of Quaestors of Parliament.
I have received notification of the following candidacies: Balfe, Banotti, Maes, Marinho, Poos, Quisthoudt-Rowohl, Smet.
The candidates have confirmed to me their consent to their candidacies.
As the number of candidates exceeds the number of seats to be filled, we will hold a secret ballot in accordance with Rule 13(1).
In view of all the voting we had yesterday and as the election of Quaestors runs parallel to our normal business today, I propose under Rule 135 that we vote using the electronic voting system.
Mr President, I would like very quickly to make a genuine point of order.
Mr President, I do not believe that the procedure you are proposing will fully guarantee the secrecy of the ballot.
It is obvious that the neighbours of the Member voting, and who belong to the same group as that Member, can see the screen on the voting machine.
Given the circumstances, I think this is regrettable.
The procedure is consistent with the Rules of Procedure of the House.
My impression from the reaction is that colleagues would prefer to proceed on that basis.
That being so, I will not press the matter of a vote on the procedure but we should then proceed to the vote on the Quaestors.
We shall first hold a test to ensure that everybody is familiar with the electronic voting system.
Do not press me too much on this - I learn as I go along.
This is like multilateral surveillance in stage 1 of Economic and Monetary Union - it is learning by doing.
Mr President, I am as in favour of progress as you are and I support the Lisbon strategy for joining the computerised era, but I very much fear that this vote, under these circumstances, where the Members have not had the opportunity to take lessons, raises many problems.
I would recommend...
(Mixed reactions)
Excuse me, but this is a right of every Member under the Rules of Procedure.
I would recommend that the vote be carried out by means of secret ballot papers.
I take note of that.
Mr President, my machine is not working.
Even my neighbouring colleagues who have tried to help me cannot resolve the problem.
Let us sort out Mr Berthu's machine.
The Chairman of the Socialist Group has made the point that perhaps we should use the secret ballot system.
My impression from the test is that colleagues appear to have mastered the intricacies of the system.
Mr President, that is not the problem.
If the leader of the second largest grouping deems it necessary to use the other system, we should not discuss the matter and do so.
If that is their wish and they feel more comfortable doing so, we should give them that possibility.
You are quite correct that it is not my impression that counts, no more than it is your impression that counts, but I will take you as a speaker in favour of having a secret ballot.
Do we have a speaker against having a secret ballot of the traditional, rather than the electronic, type?
Mr newly-elected President of this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, are we, then, more stupid than our children?
Are we not in a position, in this technological day and age, to press two keys?
We have had the OECD's PISA survey, we have had appraisals, we have a new President, we have paid a lot of money for this system, for which we have had criticism for a long time, and now we want to vote as if this were the Stone Age!
(Loud applause)
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Socialist Party, I formally request that the vote take place in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which states that we should vote by means of secret ballot papers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am no expert on the Rules of Procedure.
It goes without saying that I am always ready to accept the convictions of others when it comes to procedural issues.
When I hear though, as I do now, our esteemed Chairman of the Socialist group demanding a paper vote and claiming that to be the only correct form of secret ballot, I would like to refer, Mr President, to your initial statement to the effect that an electronic ballot is a secret ballot and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
If we now want to decide whether we are to vote electronically or with ballot papers - and I approach the issue very even-handedly, readily conceding that one can take one view or the other - then you must let us decide by show of hands, a simple Yes or No, on how we are to vote.
That is the only way to resolve this procedural issue.
I would recommend that we now decide in that way, and democratically, how we want to cast our votes.
We know the essential point at issue.
Under Rule 135, "The President may at any time decide that the voting operations indicated in Rules 133, 134 and 136 shall be carried out by means of an electronic voting system."
So the procedure to vote electronically is perfectly consistent with the Rules.
However, it is clear that there is a division of opinion in the House as to which is the best method to choose on this occasion.
Therefore I put to the vote whether we should proceed with an electronic vote.
(Parliament agreed to vote electronically) President.
The next item is the election of the Quaestors.
There are five Quaestors so each Member has a maximum of five votes.
If you vote for more than five candidates your vote will be void.
The tellers are the same as those for the election of the President and Vice-Presidents.
I would ask them to vote first and then come to the President's bench so that they can confirm the results.
Mr President, you are quite right; the Rules of Procedure do say that you can use electronic voting.
However, because of the way it works, it is impossible to hold a secret ballot.
I know how Mrs Ainardi voted, I know how Mrs Frahm voted, I know how this fellow member voted and I know how that fellow member voted.
Why can we not vote electronically, but without the asterisk?
Otherwise we all know how everyone else has voted and it is impossible to hold a secret ballot.
Mr President, on a point of order.
With all due respect I appreciate the decision the House has taken but this has not been a secret ballot.
I know how all of my neighbouring colleagues have voted.
I appreciate that if we want to have an open ballot we can do so, but then we should not pretend that we have been voting secretly.
We should vote openly by a show of hands.
That is my first point.
Secondly, I should like to say to our colleagues in the PPE-DE Group that with all due respect, we could have used ballot papers in the same time as we have taken now.
Perhaps we can now proceed in a way that is really secret.
In my view, we have taken a decision on this system and whether right or wrong, it is a decision nonetheless.
In future, I think that we should properly verify the validity of a secret system that does not guarantee secrecy.
That said, we have an agenda in which the debate on the Spanish Presidency is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.
We still have 20 minutes thanks to the so-called secret ballot.
We are going quickly, so let us hold a second round immediately.
I think that this is what everyone wants.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I do not wish to delay matters.
What Mr Dell'Alba has said is absolutely right.
We have proved that 99.9% of Members of the European Parliament are capable of keeping up with the technological skills of their children.
It would be quite absurd now not to proceed with the concluding votes on the Quaestors.
As to the last point made by my colleague on the other side of the House about secrecy, I have not a single clue as to how my colleagues on this side of the House voted, because I did not choose to peer over their shoulders.
Mr President, I have a simple proposal to make to colleagues which is non-technological.
We should use our time to complete the vote for Quaestors.
We have spent far too long voting this week.
Mr Onesta gave us a very useful piece of paper yesterday.
I do not know whether it is symbolic, but it is blank!
This is a non-technological item, so the socialists should not be frightened of it.
Having voted, Members should put a piece of paper - or Mr Onesta's block - over their screen.
It is quite simple.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I agree with those who say we should use the electronic system, as it is much quicker.
However, I would suggest that the technicians and those responsible for this wonderful piece of equipment should modify it in such a way that would allow us to vote on all the candidates, plus and minus, which means that every single one of them will have a neutral symbol beside it.
In that way, if people look at the screen to see how we voted, they will not know.
That would make it much easier, because otherwise it is easy for people to see how each Member voted.
I am taking two more speakers and then we will conclude this matter.
Mr President, my request does not concern the electronic voting system.
Speaking on behalf of my group, what I am, in fact, interested in is being able to vote at 12.30 p.m. and to have the opportunity to reach political agreements later.
Mr President, you have taken a decision: we must continue with the same method of voting, despite the fact that we do not agree.
I would now ask, for the purposes of political assessment, that this vote be postponed until 12.30 p.m.
I want to be clear on this.
The agenda had foreseen that the second round would be at 12.30 p.m.
I appreciate that there are political choices to be made and, while in terms of efficiency we could now complete the matter electronically, it is equally clear that there are political considerations.
We will take the vote at the earliest moment but not before 12.30 p.m.
In the meanwhile, the groups have the opportunity to consult with each other.
We should proceed electronically as we began.
(The sitting was suspended at 9.48 a.m. and resumed at 10 a.m.)
Spanish Presidency programme
The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the Spanish Presidency programme.
This is a very important moment in terms of European politics.
After the launch of the euro, in a difficult economic climate, there is still the need to complete the economic and social reforms and sustainable development as targeted at Lisbon and Stockholm; the need to use the time this year to create the basis for an enlarged Union; the need to launch the Convention to make a Europe fit for the future.
So I am sure this is a very full and ambitious programme.
It gives me great pleasure to give the floor to Mr Aznar, President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr President, honourable Members, distinguished members of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to appear here for the first time as Spanish Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council to explain to you the priorities of the Spanish Presidency.
The Spanish Presidency coincides with the change of President of this Parliament.
Yesterday, we attended the election of a new President in this House and the farewell to a President who has carried out her work very effectively.
Mr Cox' s personality and political and institutional career guarantee that this House and the Presidency will enjoy fruitful political and institutional relations, which will be aimed at strengthening the European Union and creating a more prominent role for the European Parliament.
The European Parliament has made a considerable contribution to today' s European Union through its work and its proposals, which represent a constant and innovative quest for greater efficiency in the functioning of the European Union.
This House has also been able to adapt its diverse European parliamentary traditions, and try out new formulas in relations between civil society and its political representatives, increasing democratic control and the legitimacy of the European project.
Nothing embodies this idea better than the codecision procedure which nevertheless needs to be improved for the sake of transparency and efficiency.
The Spanish Presidency will therefore work to ensure that the eight conciliations scheduled for this six-month period are completed quickly.
Spain wishes to increase the Union' s institutional cooperation and democratic control; I would therefore like to guarantee the Presidency' s presence in plenary sessions, as has become customary during the previous Presidency.
For my part, I am committed to informing the House following the Barcelona European Council, and carrying out a final assessment of this Presidency after the Seville European Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, the current political landscape obliges the Union to be ambitious in three areas.
The first consists of producing a response to terrorism, from the point of view of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The second involves creating an area of greater economic prosperity which safeguards the European social model.
And the third is to make a success of the historic opportunity of enlargement and laying the foundations for the future enlarged Union.
In order to successfully reach these goals, we need to work for a greater deepening of Europe.
By creating 'more Europe' we will strengthen the fight against terrorism and ensure that the introduction of the euro is successful and, only if we are ambitious, we will achieve enlargement, we will make progress with the creation of an area of greater prosperity, we will strengthen the Union' s external role and we will carry out the next Intergovernmental Conference successfully.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to acknowledge, and express my gratitude for, the responsibility that this House and the European Commission have demonstrated in the fight against terrorism.
Days before the tragic events of 11 September, Parliament adopted a resolution which urged the European Commission to present various initiatives aimed at greater effectiveness in the fight against terrorism in the European Union.
We must continue to work in the direction which you and the European Commission indicated at that time.
Accordingly, on the basis of the rule of law, we need to press ahead with the Plan of Action against terrorism in the European Union to ensure that there can be no sanctuary for terror within our borders.
In December 2001 we achieved great progress in this area.
All the Institutions of the Union, and especially the Presidency and Parliament, now need to work to ensure that the instruments approved on that occasion come into effect as quickly as possible.
However, those instruments will not prove effective unless we also achieve closer cooperation between the institutions and the security forces of the EU Member States.
The Presidency therefore considers it a priority that joint investigation teams be set up rapidly, that Europol' s work be made more effective and that action be taken to prevent the funding of terrorists and of those who shelter or support them.
(Applause)As you well know, terrorist organisations establish cooperative links amongst themselves so that they can operate in a manner which exceeds the limits set by our borders.
Spain wants the Union to play a more active role in the international sphere in the fight against terrorism.
A first step towards this will be to develop close cooperation on criminal and legal matters with the United States, in accordance with the principles which underpin the legal system of the European Union, as emphasised by this House.
The fight against terrorism needs to be waged within the context of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The Presidency therefore attaches priority to pressing ahead to formulate a common policy on asylum and immigration, improve the management of the Union' s external frontiers, intensify our action against drugs trafficking and establish mutual recognition of court rulings both in civil matters, through the European enforcement order, and in the criminal field.
These initiatives will require close institutional cooperation if we are to meet the deadlines set for creating the area of freedom, security and justice.
Ladies and gentlemen, the euro has been introduced, if I may say so, brilliantly, to say the least.
By the end of the month few people in the Eurozone will still be using the old national currencies.
This is good proof that Union policies are accepted when they are implemented properly and effectively.
The solidity of our currency also calls for closer coordination of economic policies. This will mean enhancing the role of the Eurogroup, tightening the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and ensuring strict compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.
The euro will also raise the profile of the Eurozone, and this will force the Presidency to ensure that the Union' s views are taken into account in international forums.
We should recall that over the last decade Europe has fallen back six points in its per capita income compared with the United States of America.
We therefore need to press ahead with modernising our economies in order to achieve stronger growth.
Accordingly, another focus of the Presidency' s work will be the creation of an area of greater economic and social prosperity.
It is Spain' s intention that the Barcelona European Council should examine five specific areas with a view to achieving 'More Europe' .
Firstly, we will promote the connection and opening up of European transport and communications systems.
The Presidency will concentrate on the review of the trans-European transport networks, on making the Single European Sky a reality and on pressing ahead with the liberalisation of rail transport.
The second area of work in Barcelona will be to design a European energy market based on opening-up, liberalisation, competition, transparency and interconnection.
With these criteria in mind, the Presidency will examine the opening-up of the gas and electricity markets for companies and for consumers, the rules on third-party access to networks and the creation of infrastructure and interconnections between national energy markets.
The integration of the financial markets is an absolute precondition for the proper functioning of the single currency and a basic prerequisite for European growth.
Spain will work to meet the deadlines of the Financial Services Action Plan and to see that the new approach based on the Lamfalussy report, which includes the necessary respect for institutional balance, is applied as soon as possible.
We are all aware that employment is the best way of achieving social integration.
As a fourth focus therefore, and on the basis of the Luxembourg Process in its current framework, the Barcelona European Council will seek a greater emphasis on the Employment Strategy in the analysis of the structural inflexibilities of our labour markets, in our tax and social protection systems and in the institutions of the labour market.
To get a good job, you undoubtedly first need access to a sound education which facilitates student mobility.
Accordingly, the fifth point at Barcelona will be the Work Programme on education systems for the year 2010.
We need to step up the quality of Europe' s education systems and open them up further to the rest of the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, in Barcelona, the candidate countries will take part in a working session of the European Council for the first time.
In my opinion, integrating the candidates into our work on economic and social modernisation will be the best political signal of our support for the enlargement process upon which the Union has embarked.
There is no doubt that enlargement will turn the page on a bitter episode in our continent' s past. It will bring in countries that belong to the European family, countries which share our values and which have been treated badly by the vicissitudes of history.
The Spanish Presidency' s political will is to help ensure that all those countries that are ready can conclude their negotiations by the end of this year, 2002.
On the basis of the current acquis communautaire and the Financial Perspective, we will, during the Spanish Presidency, be negotiating the chapters relating to agriculture, regional policy and social cohesion policy, financial and budgetary provisions and institutional issues.
Spain will also be seeking the closure of all those chapters that have not yet been concluded.
For the negotiations to be rounded off definitively, all the Members of the Union will need to demonstrate their ability to compromise, the Commission will need to present its proposals on time and, above all, an effort will be required from each of the candidate countries.
Progress will be assessed at the Seville European Council in June.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also know, and it is our wish, that the European Union is destined to fulfil an important and growing political function on the international stage.
The success of European integration and Europe' s economic and commercial weight are forcing an ever greater and more important external political profile on the Union.
The current international context requires us to step up the Union' s presence in areas where peace and security are directly threatened.
The Spanish Presidency therefore hopes to help develop an ambitious comprehensive regional strategy in Central Asia and Afghanistan to prevent the emergence of new areas of conflict.
But there will be no point in providing a European presence if we lack the capacity for effective crisis management and, specifically, military forces for limited operations requiring a rapid response.
This objective should be achieved in the near future, when the European Security and Defence Policy effectively comes into operation and when the definitive pattern is established for a relationship of consultation and cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance.
In this same area, Spain also proposes to launch a discussion on making the fight against terrorism an objective of the European Security and Defence Policy.
The credibility of the Union' s foreign policy will rest not only on its international presence, but also on effective instruments for implementing that policy and, above all, on a high degree of mutual consultation.
On this last point, Spain attaches priority to developing the European Union' s relations with North America and with Russia.
With North America we need to reinforce the trans-Atlantic dialogue, giving it greater and renewed strategic content.
With Russia, Spain believes the European Union needs to support the strategy that country is currently implementing.
Accordingly, one of the Presidency' s objectives will be to consolidate EU relations with Russia, relations based on specific points and tangible progress.
Ladies and gentlemen, next May in Madrid, the European Union will be holding its Second Summit with Latin America and the Caribbean with a view to renewing and promoting the strategic association between the two geographical regions.
One objective of the Summit will be to work with Chile in order to make progress on the Association and Free Trade Agreement and push forward the Union' s negotiations with Mercosur.
In addition, the European Union will be holding specific meetings with the Andean Community and Central America.
At this point, I am bound to refer to our interest in and concern regarding the developing situation in Argentina.
The European Union will work with the Argentine authorities to find realistic solutions based on dialogue, solutions which will restore confidence and enable the Argentine economy to achieve new growth and competitiveness.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will also play an important role in achieving stability in the Middle East.
For this we will need to step up our coordination with the United States and the other sponsors of the Peace Process.
I hope that the recent European Union Declaration and the contacts established in the last few days on the initiative of the Spanish Presidency will help resolve a situation of instability which is affecting the countries of the region and the Mediterranean in general.
The Middle East conflict is a major factor influencing the progress of the Barcelona Process, the only forum for dialogue which brings together all those involved in the Peace Process, who are due to meet at the forthcoming Ministerial Summit in Valencia.
Spain will also push for the conclusion of the outstanding Association Agreements between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean, and will work for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean internal market and the development of the regional strategies on infrastructure.
To help achieve this objective, the Laeken European Council, acting on a Spanish initiative, took up the idea of creating a bank specialising in operations in the Mediterranean countries, an idea we will be working on over the next few months in collaboration with the European Investment Bank and the monetary authorities.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that it is only by encouraging balanced development that we will be able to tackle illegal immigration effectively.
Aware of the enormous importance of this phenomenon, Spain, with the backing of China and Vietnam, has been working for some time to ensure the success of the ministerial meeting on immigration to be held between the European Union and the Asian members of ASEM.
We know that illegal immigration is the result of poverty and underdevelopment.
This is why the Spanish Presidency attaches particular importance to the Monterrey Summit on Financing Development, which we are preparing in close cooperation with the United States and Mexico.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is safe to say that few people could have imagined that 45 years after the signing of the Treaties of Rome, 300 million Europeans would be using the same currency.
We need to pursue this successful course, in what is a key period for the Union. This will require greater involvement of the people of Europe in shaping the future of the Union.
The Laeken European Council decided to set up a Convention on the future of Europe.
That Convention will be holding its first session on 28 February in the European Parliament in Brussels.
What place could better reflect both the importance of the new phase the European Union is going through and the recognition the Presidency wishes to give to the European Parliament' s work on the future of Europe.
The Spanish Presidency is firmly set on contributing to the success of the Convention.
That success will be the key to consolidating the process of gradual constitutionalisation of the Treaties we are currently engaged in, and to ensuring that such Conventions are in future perceived as a good method of preparing intergovernmental conferences.
I hope that the President of the Convention will be able, as agreed, to present an initial report on the Convention' s work to the Seville European Council in June.
Ladies and gentlemen, I came here today to set out the priorities of the Spanish Presidency.
Those priorities should translate into greater de facto solidarity, a solidarity which will enable us, on the basis of balance and of mutual respect for diverse interests, to continue consolidating the greatest period of peace, prosperity and freedom Europe has ever known.
We know this will be a complex and arduous task, on account both of the number of issues we will need to apply ourselves to and of the ambitious nature of our goals.
But it is only by virtue of that ambition, and on the basis of close collaboration between the institutions, that we will be able, as I am sure we will, to make this project a reality, a project whose ultimate purpose is to improve the lives of all the people of Europe.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, this past New Year' s Eve, all of Europe celebrated the launch of the euro with great joy.
Barely two weeks have gone by since then, but those two weeks have been enough to see us complete almost the entire transition to the new notes and coins.
In the twelve Euro-zone countries, 90% of payments are now being made in the single currency: the changeover to the euro has been both a huge task and a huge success.
We can all feel proud of that success because we have all contributed to it: the European Parliament and national parliaments, governments, the European Central Bank and the Member States' central banks, the Commission, commercial banks, post offices, retailers, businesses, the media and every one of our citizens who have helped to bring about this historic changeover.
For millions of European citizens, the euro notes and coins in their pockets are a tangible sign of the great political project of building a united Europe.
As a symbol of that unity, the euro is having an even greater psychological impact than the abolition of passport controls at Europe' s internal borders.
The euro is thus becoming a key element in people' s sense of a shared European identity and a common destiny, just as it is tangible evidence that European integration is now irreversible.
The changeover to the euro shows that the Europeans are willing to embrace change enthusiastically and resolutely if that change is for the sake of a better future, and if all the issues involved are discussed thoroughly and openly.
The changeover to the euro shows the scale of what Europe can achieve when it can muster the necessary political will.
We must take this as a valuable lesson and apply it in the preparations for all the stages in the process of integration.
Mr President, Prime Minister, Spain has chosen the motto "More Europe" for its six-month presidency of the Union.
I think we can say, just after the launch of the euro, that Spain could not have chosen better.
Prime Minister, your government has also devised a broad but balanced and ambitious programme, and I am very pleased to see that the priorities it sets out match the priorities that the Commission has set itself for 2002.
I can therefore assure you that you can count on the Commission' s full support.
Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the same ambition that has led to the success of the launch of the new European currency must now be shown and exploited again to accomplish the Union' s Economic and Social Agenda.
We have achieved monetary union.
The time has now come to focus on economic union, and to make it a tangible reality.
We need the economic growth that will generate jobs and a better quality of life.
Almost two years have passed since the European Council in Lisbon set the goal of making the Union the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economic area by the end of this decade, an area which would also enjoy full employment and increased economic and social cohesion.
Since that time, the Spring Councils have provided the opportunity to discuss economic, social and environmental issues as part of a wide-ranging strategy for sustainable development.
The Barcelona Council will, therefore, be called upon to assess the progress we have made so far and to set priorities for the coming years.
In preparation for the Council, yesterday, the Commission adopted its Spring Report, which will provide the basis for the Council' s work and which, this year, bears the title 'The Lisbon strategy - making change happen' .
Yesterday' s Commission communication has a central message: the time has come to stick to our commitments and to speed up reform.
We have no choice: the strategy adopted at Lisbon is the key to developing and consolidating our European economic and social model.
Indeed, we are reforming a society that already has its own shared values, values that distinguish Europe from the rest of the world and on which the European Union is founded.
It is precisely these values that we have in mind when we speak of the 'European social model' .
On this basis, we have to continue to update the kind of model of society we want and can achieve in Europe: the kind of free, fair, democratic society that our fellow-citizens hold so dear.
This is not about devaluing or getting rid of our social heritage: it is about adapting it and modernising it so as to ensure that it lasts.
We have a duty to history, a duty to protect future generations and a duty to respond to globalisation, and all the more so at this time of great uncertainty and risk when genuine, practical solidarity - not just superficial, partial solidarity - has become very important for our citizens, especially the weakest among them.
The Commission' s report looks at the progress made so far in implementing the Lisbon strategy and concludes that all the prerequisites for success are there.
On the macroeconomic front, the efforts made over the last ten years towards introducing the euro have enabled the Union to achieve economic stability and have protected it from the worst of the international economic and financial crises.
Even at this time of economic slowdown, the bases of Europe' s economy have remained sound.
Encouraging progress has also been made in implementing the strategy adopted at Lisbon.
Significant results have been achieved in a number of areas such as the environment, telecommunications, education, pension reform and research, but progress has not been as good in other areas, with Commission proposals stalled and the deadlines set by the European Council itself in jeopardy.
Among these areas are some that are essential to the integration of financial, transport and energy services, the Community patent and the Galileo project.
I am pleased to see, Mr President, that you have made these areas a priority for your action in the coming months.
We need to catch up, and catch up fast.
Our credibility and, more importantly, our chances of making real progress depend on it.
If there is no change, we will end up with less growth and less jobs.
The Commission report sets three priorities for 2002: employment, reform and knowledge.
First, employment.
Europe needs an active employment policy.
More needs to be done to remove the obstacles that still prevent people from finding employment or which make it difficult for them to keep their jobs.
Member States must cut the cost of labour by reducing taxation that affects wages and salaries - especially low wages. They must also review those aspects of their unemployment benefit systems that dissuade people from returning to the labour market and they must make it less easy for them to take early retirement.
We need better childcare, in order to improve women' s presence in the workforce. We need incentives for those who decide to stay in work longer.
Employment rates can also be maintained by improving skills, education and individuals' mobility within Europe and between production sectors.
In other words, we need an active, not a passive approach to change.
Second, reform, and completing the internal market.
We need to connect Europe and its markets.
Much greater effort must be made to achieve an interconnection of national markets and to speed up the integration of financial markets, concluding the reforms already underway.
We need to open up and connect the energy and transport markets and develop Europe' s broadband networks.
These industries are the backbone of our economy.
We need greater competition to bring prices down and stimulate growth while maintaining a sufficient standard of basic services for everyone.
Third, education, training and research.
Education, training and research really are the keys to economic renewal, sustainable growth and job creation.
There can be no 'knowledge-based society' without knowledge.
Therefore, we need to invest much more heavily in these areas.
We need an integrated strategy for Community-level education and research, based on networking and mobility and giving priority to the technologies of the future, to biotechnology and clean technologies, for example.
Finally, our report states the need, after Barcelona, to introduce measures to strengthen coordination of our overall economic strategy.
This means building a consensus on principles and rules of economic policy that take account of economic interdependence within the euro zone.
Accordingly, we need to synchronise the three current processes - the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines and the process of economic reform launched at Cardiff - so that, each year, the Spring Council can review economic and social policy as a whole and make sure it is sustainable.
Only a more coherent approach will enable us to make full, effective use of the various instruments at our disposal.
It is time to give up the old, sectorally-fragmented methods.
Prime Minister, the President of the Commission has to play a sometimes rather uncomfortable role at European Councils - that of being the one who reminds those he is working with of the need to honour undertakings made collectively.
However, I remain confident that you will support me at Barcelona when I urge the Member States to push ahead resolutely with the agenda of reforms agreed at Lisbon, in line with the report' s recommendations.
We are responsible for making sure that the Barcelona Council achieves total success.
If the process grinds to a halt, the cost of 'non-reform' would become unbearable both in economic terms and in terms of the Union' s political credibility.
Ladies and gentlemen, 2002 will be a crucial year for the enlargement process, and we know that - as we have heard - the Spanish Presidency will be making every effort to keep up the momentum, so that we can conclude negotiations this year with those countries that have shown that they meet the criteria for accession.
Vital though it is to the Union' s future, eastward enlargement is not the only external issue requiring the Union' s attention.
Relations with the countries of the Mediterranean are, of necessity, a priority for the Union in its external activities.
I look forward to seeing Euro-Mediterranean dialogue move decisively forwards under the Spanish Presidency - after all, it was in Barcelona that the dialogue was launched.
To this end, we must adopt a more flexible approach, setting up, together with some groups of countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, new forms of sub-regional cooperation.
Secondly, we have to put into practice the idea, formed jointly by the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, of a 'Mediterranean Development Bank' .
Irrespective of whether it is an independent bank or part of the European Investment Bank, it is to be a forum dedicated to development, in which European and Southern Mediterranean operators work side by side.
In addition, it is vital to promote mutual understanding and knowledge between peoples and cultures, through specific actions on various fronts.
Indeed, I feel that it is precisely by exporting our experience of peacemaking and our commitment to promoting democracy that we will be able to take "More Europe" to the rest of the world.
Prime Minister, you have pointed out that Latin America, though very distant from us geographically, is very close to Europe' s culture and origins, having shared a long period of history with many European countries.
This is a time when the Union must show particularly strong solidarity with Argentina and all of Mercosur, as they experience serious crisis.
Argentina needs to return to the path of economic growth, the only way for it to improve its present difficult social situation.
There is only one recipe for achieving this goal: restoring confidence.
Confidence in political institutions, confidence in the stability of the rule of law and confidence in a credible, coherent economic programme.
Our experience of financial reform and economic development driven by trade and integration could be of valuable help to Latin America as it endeavours to recover, with advantages for all involved.
Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to finish by saying a few words on the Convention that will be beginning its work under the Spanish Presidency.
The Convention' s great significance will give it the chance to write an exciting chapter in Europe' s history.
We all have a duty to do all we can to ensure that this does indeed happen.
I have already assured its Chairman, Mr Giscard d' Estaing, that he will have the full support of the Commission and the Commission' s representatives to the Convention.
The Commission expects to work just as closely with the European Parliament, as the legitimate representative of the hopes of the people of Europe.
We must ensure that the debate is full and fruitful and, most importantly, that it delivers a vision for the future with which the majority of our citizens can identify.
The Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference must complete the construction of an open, accountable, democratic and fair Europe.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have arrived in Parliament at a time when we are engaged in organising our work for the second half of this term.
Our attainment of the great objectives of which you have spoken is dependent on technical on behalf of Europe.
Our group warmly welcomes you to Parliament.
You have yourself observed that you are here for the first time.
We emphatically welcome the fact that you will be here in Parliament on three occasions as President-in-Office of the Council and as Prime Minister of Spain to give an account of the decisions reached under your Presidency.
We are grateful to you for that, and we hope that all following Presidencies will learn from your example.
We also, though, expect greater transparency in the Council of Ministers and ask of you that the report the Council is now drafting should also lead to real results, making an important step forward towards greater transparency in the Council of Ministers possible under your Presidency.
You have spoken, too, about terrorism, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with you.
There is no such thing as good and bad terrorism.
There is only terrorism, and we must say loud and clear that wherever people are deliberately being killed, whether by ETA in Spain, whether on 11 September, whether in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world, it must be countered by decisive protest from us, and we must combat terrorism with the utmost determination and make democracy and the rule of law the foundation of relations between peoples and people.
I very much welcomed your reference to Russia, Mr President-in-Office.
Whilst needing good relations with Russia, we are aware that there are at present the gravest abuses of human rights taking place in Chechnya.
As Christian and European democrats, we declare that the life of a peaceful Muslim in Chechnya or anywhere else in the world is of the same value as the life of a Christian or a non-Christian in the West.
We must defend human dignity throughout the world.
(Applause)
You have also spoken about the euro, and we support what you have said.
Let us, in this hour of joy over the euro, which the President of the Commission has described as a gigantic project, let us remember - for the euro has many parents, indeed only too many fathers - that it was people such as Helmut Kohl, the Honorary Citizen of Europe, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and Jacques Delors, who, with the support of others, advanced this great project in those days.
I would like also to invoke the name of ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, the chairman of the Convention, who, with Helmut Schmidt and others in the Seventies, prepared the way for the European Monetary System.
I congratulate you on your choice of him.
What now matters is that we pursue a policy of stability, for things are changing.
I recall how friends in my party looked at Italy before the introduction of the euro, doubted whether Italy should join the common currency and wondered whether policies of stability were really pursued there.
I do not want to single out any one country, but all of what we hear today from Italy indicates that the countries in which Italy was formerly criticised could rightly have the same criticism levelled at them today, as they have not been doing what is needed for the stability of the European currency.
So let there be restructuring of the budget!
We must consolidate Europe as an economic base, which means that it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that we must promote by means of a sensible and moderate fiscal policy, something we strongly support.
In order that we might go in the same direction, we need coordination in economic policy and in stability policy - coordination rather than harmonisation.
Mr President-in-Office, I very much welcome what you had to say about the Convention.
We will quite happily offer the use of our group's meeting room - another great group has met there before, so they may well agree to the offer - but the spirit of our meeting room is today particularly well suited to working on the European project.
I have something to ask of you, Mr President-in-Office. It is with great joy that we have heard that our colleague, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and one-time President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, has been appointed by the government of Luxembourg, that is, by Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, as Luxembourg's representative to the Convention.
(Applause) We ask you most sincerely to exert your influence as President-in-Office of the Council so that all governments send personalities to this Convention whose words carry weight in the national capitals and governments, so that what is decided in the Convention may also have something of a cohesive effect on the national governments in the countries of the European Union.
Let me turn to a final aspect, namely enlargement and the Mediterranean dialogue.
We are right alongside you as far as the timing for 2002 and the conclusion of the first accession treaties is concerned.
Our Group has decided that observers should be sent as soon as possible to the European Parliament from the countries with which the treaties are to be signed - observers who would pass on information to these countries until the European elections, when representatives from these countries will sit as equals in the European Parliament.
We strongly support you in the Mediterranean dialogue.
We must ensure that people in the countries along the Mediterranean that do not belong to the European Union have a chance and prospects in their own country - in Morocco, in Algeria, everywhere, even in the Arab countries - and do not all come to us.
We must help them in this, and I very much welcome the initiatives of the Spanish Presidency.
We wish you every success on your way. There will always be a warm welcome for you from us in Parliament.
If you meet with success, then it is a success for us all, for the Council Presidency, for Parliament, for the Commission and for the European Union that we share.
Great success for you personally, but also for your presidency.
(Applause)
Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Santer on his appointment by Luxembourg to the Convention.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Spanish Presidency for appearing here so quickly, in accordance with what has now become the custom, and I would point out that we have passed the mid-point of the legislature with a clear conservative shift in the Council, which, Mr President, is confirmed by your position as President of the CDI - the Centre Democratic International for you and the Christian Democratic International for Mr Poettering; in any event, conservative.
Your presidency' s programme follows the normal tendency for the Council' s six-month approach of aiming for as many successes as possible.
But, of course, it is not sufficient to reap the harvest, but we must also sow seeds and tend the crop.
Mr President, please allow me to analyse the six objectives of the Spanish Presidency, which you have summed up in three categories, in the light of this approach.
I shall mention firstly the area of freedom, justice and security, with the fight against terrorism as a priority.
You have rightly acknowledged that the European Parliament acted as a pioneer by stating that there was a need for a Community anti-terrorist policy.
It did so before 11 September.
We worked very hard on the Commission' s proposals and would have this policy by now were it not for the inefficiency of the Council, which sent us the consultations in December.
My political family is entirely in favour of this objective.
It is your family which has the problems, but we intend to help you.
Secondly, I will mention the euro.
We owe the success of the euro above all to our fellow citizens.
We must acknowledge this, because we also criticise the fact that we are distant from the citizens, but on this occasion, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January, they have moved ahead of us.
For once we can say that it has also been a success for the Commission, which has been responsible for the operation, for President Prodi, who, when he was President of Ecofin, made it possible for Italy to join the euro together with the current President of the Republic, while the current government of that country partly chose, on I January, to denigrate the single currency.
It has also been a success for Commissioner Pedro Solbes, who was the Spanish Minister for the Economy in December 1995.
(Mixed reactions) Because, ladies and gentlemen, both the euro and Economic and Monetary Union were born in Madrid.
Mr President, I imagine that all this commotion will not be counted as part of my speaking time.
Let us hope that this Spanish Presidency can match up to previous presidencies.
The euro is also a success for the European Central Bank, for the financial institutions, for the hundreds of thousands of anonymous citizens who went to work on 1 January, and we must recognise that it has also been a success for Pierre Werner, for ValÃ©ry Giscard d' Estaing, for Helmut Schmidt, for FranÃ§ois Mitterrand, for Helmut Kohl, for Ruud Lubbers, for Giulio Andreotti, for John Major, for Felipe GonzÃ¡lez and also for Jacques Santer, as President of the Commission.
I think it is right to acknowledge this.
The challenge now is to create an Economic Union which matches Monetary Union - as the President of the Commission pointed out - and also develop the Lisbon strategy, which in our opinion means sustainable development, more social cohesion, more full employment, more competitiveness.
In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would draw your attention to the European Parliament' s resolution on services of general interest, which is very explicit.
It is not sufficient to privatise services without liberalising, because that simply means replacing public monopolies with private ones.
There must be rules to protect citizens and consumers.
Look what has happened with Enron and what your government had to do about the Christmas power cuts, when it asked for the illuminations to be postponed by two hours.
With regard to enlargement, it falls to you to make progress on something which you not going to be able harvest, but you have to do it and I welcome the fact that you are taking this on responsibly.
With regard to the European Union' s international action, I believe that, as well as the need to persevere in the Middle East and relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean process, Latin America, and Argentina in particular, should currently be the focus of attention.
We share your concern.
We believe that we should respond in a decisive fashion, led by the Commission.
We Europeans have historical debts and links with Argentina, with those people who fled hunger or oppression.
We must tell the Argentinians that they must believe in their country, in their values and that we will be able to help them.
I would ask the Commission to put forward a practical proposal in this field.
Lastly, Mr President, I will comment on the debate on the Convention and governance.
We welcome the historic milestone represented by the establishment of the Convention. We have been fighting for it for many years.
