We are now being given the chance to do these things, and we will certainly make use of it.
Negotiations with the Council and the Commission to this end were, admittedly, tough and slow-moving at first â we spent eighteen months waiting for the Council to come up with concrete proposals â but we have now reached the final stage, and that is encouraging.
It is at this point that I would like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and all the other participants in the trilogue, especially Ambassador Woschnak, but also, of course, MrÂ Brok, the chairman of our own committee, and all those â too many to name â who have made our work easier.
I just want to briefly review the points that were of particular concern to us, and on which we have now reached agreement.
The call-back procedure that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner proposed to us is one in line with our way of thinking, and she has now â and this is my second point â assured us that the Commission will take into consideration Parliament's wishes as regards the review clause.
Thirdly, we have come to an agreement on matters of content.
We saw this as vitally important, and it will also be vitally important in terms of practical external policy, for example, our demand as regards the peacebuilding commission.
We have been able to reach agreement on landmines, on issues relating to women and children, on the conditionality of anti-terrorism measures, and on the revision clause.
In order to give you a better picture of what that means, let me say that, in the aftermath of the tsunami, we had a very cooperative dialogue in which we gave consideration to how the instruments that were now all working at once could be brought together, and how aid from the European Union could be got more quickly to the people who needed it.
I am very grateful to you for the completion of the Commissionâs feasibility study on the civilian peace corps, the coordination of which will, I think, involve us politicians in being responsible for bringing together and simplifying the right approaches.
Following the last two trilogues, there was evidence of compromise in the statement we got yesterday from the Commission, which stated that these measures were being taken on the basis of human rights and of international law.
We regard that as an important and fundamental precondition if the war on terror is to be steered in the right direction.
Turning, if I may, to the coordination of peacebuilding, I will be discussing the proposal you made yesterday evening with the Members who have up to now been actively working alongside me on this.
On this point, too, I think it should be possible for us to come to an agreement, which will make it clear to us how the Commission is contemplating bringing the Council and other actors in on its activities in this area.
It may be unusual to do so at this hour of the day, but the debate we are having today is a debate on fundamental principles.
We are going for a final spurt in order to be able to vote on the stability instrument in June, at first reading.
Let me conclude, though, by reiterating, and very clearly, that, if we really are to take seriously our commitment to human rights, then we would ask you to ensure that the proposal for a democracy and human rights instrument is brought before this House as quickly as possible, for we do not regard human rights and democracy as a bargaining counter, and nor should they be used as a means of putting pressure on the Development Committee.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡nyi is the rapporteur on the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, but he is not here, because the Commissioner has sent him far away to oversee the elections in Fiji.
MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡nyi sends his greetings and asks us on his behalf to thank the Commissioner for her speech, which is in complete harmony with the agreement which has been reached on this issue.
A major reorganisation in the financing of external relations is to be introduced through the regulations now being discussed.
Previous financial instruments are being combined and the decision-making process reformed.
The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is to replace the current TACIS and MEDA systems.
Cross-border cooperation is to feature a new arrangement, which will permit the flexible combination of the financing of external relations via the Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, on the one hand, with funding for the territory of the Member States out of the European Regional Development Fund, on the other.
Hitherto, cross-border cooperation has been very unwieldy, as the decision-making systems for funding under TACIS in external relations and regional development financing within the Union have been very different.
It will be a massive challenge to harmonise the administrative procedures and interlink them.
The pending implementing regulation must be drafted carefully and take Parliamentâs views on the matter into account.
For all the financial instruments we need a decision-making system that safeguards Parliamentâs influence even after the regulations are adopted.
The negotiations on this matter have gone very well indeed.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is pleased that the other institutions have at last approved Parliamentâs call for establishing an instrument for human rights and democracy.
The external relations instruments form a whole, and consensus must be reached on all of its components between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
This will require flexibility on all sides, including the European Parliament.
The changes to the financing mechanisms are so significant that problems can be expected in their practical application.
All the institutions must be ready to make changes, if necessary, to the regulations now being decided upon within the current Financing Period.
I was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the ALDE Group when the ENPI Regulation was being discussed and I would like to thank my colleague, MrÂ SzymaÅski, for his cooperation.
I am especially glad that the Northern Dimension and cooperation with our northern neighbours were also covered by the regulation.
Â Â  â IÂ would like to call upon my colleagues to consider their positions regarding the legal basis of the proposed regulation.
It is necessary to retain aÂ dual legal system and thereby to ensure that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will in future play aÂ role in the processes of development and economic cooperation.
If ArticleÂ 179 provided the sole legal basis, this process would be exclusively in the hands of the Committee for Development, and our committee would lose its authority.
You have already spoken of human rights here, although these are in the AFET portfolio.
IÂ would also like to draw attention to the fact that IÂ have been informed that aÂ dual legal basis would undermine the authority of the European Parliament.
This information is untrue, insofar as ArticleÂ 25 of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of Parliament clearly states that if there is aÂ dual system, then Articles 179 and 181a will implement aÂ codecision process, thereby giving Parliament greater authority.
If we have aÂ single legal basis relying on ArticleÂ 179 alone there is aÂ danger that programmes such as Erasmus Mondus or other educational programmes and student grants will disappear.
ArticleÂ 179 is not able to cover the broad spectrum of development and economic cooperation.
For example, it would not cover sectoral cooperation in areas such as transport and energy.
Not all types of cooperation can be subsumed under the term âdevelopment cooperationâ.
Furthermore, ArticleÂ 179 applies only to developing countries, and the EU does not have its own definition of developing countries, which it has borrowed from the OECD.
ArticleÂ 181a, on the other hand, speaks of third countries, which means its definition is less restrictive.
If ArticleÂ 181 were dropped, some countries would be automatically excluded.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we pass this directive with aÂ single legal basis, it means that ArticleÂ 181 will no longer have aÂ basis in the agreements and we will thereby be giving carte blanche to the Commission.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of my speech is the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, which I have followed as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development.
This new policy, which became necessary after the last major enlargement, covers a vast geographical area.
The primary objective of this policy is, as you know, the creation of a common area of prosperity and security for developing economic integration and political cooperation between the Union and its partner countries.
This is a challenge and, at the same time, a chance to take advantage of the opportunities that derive from this policy, including in terms of development, since most of the countries benefiting from the Neighbourhood Policy are indeed developing countries.
The Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument establishes a close relationship between internal and external cohesion: from that perspective, security is therefore linked to development.
I would therefore draw the Commission's and the Council's attention to the fact that development policy must have greater scope as an instrument of the Unionâs external relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this neighbourhood instrument that we will soon approve and which we are debating today and, in particular, I am pleased with all of the amendments that have increased the role played by civil society in the neighbourhood policy.
The spokesmen who have spoken before me have said that we are still awaiting a genuine instrument, which the Commission has said it will present, for strengthening human rights and support for democracy.
It is clear, however, that this neighbourhood instrument that we are debating now, following its passage through Parliament, has been filled with numerous references to that protection of human rights and the relationship with civil society and non-State actors.
I would call upon the Commission to bear this in mind and, when it comes to implementing this agreement with neighbouring countries, to remember that many of them are not democracies.
It must therefore bear very much in mind that this instrument cannot be allowed to strengthen non-democratic regimes and that it must therefore take very good account of these non-governmental actors.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur on the Neighbourhood Instrument, MrÂ SzymaÅski, for having taken on board so many of our committeeâs suggestions, which has added value to the Commission proposal.
I can do no other than stress â and in this I am expressing the Employment Committeeâs view â how important it is that the social dimension be given greater emphasis in promoting the Neighbourhood Instrument.
It is particularly at the outermost border of the European Union that an enormous economic disparity is to be found, and tensions can be reduced only if the social dimension is given an equal priority as the country draws nearer to the EU.
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate how important is the role played by the social partners in the Neighbourhood Instrument.
If there is to be partnership with these countries, then it is absolutely essential that their role be strengthened and promoted.
This House can count the implementation of educational measures and their social role as accompaniments to the action plans among its successes.
Â Â  Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was pleased to address the financial aspects of these issues.
We were glad that in the future our foreign policy and neighbourhood policy activities would be conducted within a more transparent and more simplified structure.
We have a saying: a bad neighbourhood is a Turkish curse.
It originated in the times when a large part of Hungary was under the occupation of the Ottoman Empire.
We are interested in a good neighbourhood, and I believe that this instrument will help prevent the European Union from building walls or erecting a Chinese Wall around itself, and will encourage it to efficiently help its neighbours to prosper, instead.
This will also be in the interest of our safety.
We supported the idea that in some cases we could, for instance, waive the cofinancing contribution, because in many of our neighbouring countries the organisations involved would be unable to support such a programme from their own resources.
I ask the House to support the proposal, and I would like to thank everybody for their work.
Â Â  Mr President, relations between the old and newer neighbours play an important role in European Union foreign policy.
In recent times, however, we have found out from the media that the financing of projects is in some cases quite unclear.
While I would like to commend the work done by the rapporteur, as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Trade, Research and Energy I do have two critical observations concerning the vagueness of the European Unionâs expenditures.
The first concerns the role of the European Parliament in the preparation, management and auditing of projects, which was included in the amendments proposed by the , but is not in the final text.
The status of legal entity submitted concerning partners is also missing.
The second observation concerns the introduction of the Northern Dimension into the draft from the same position.
The Northern Dimension is undoubtedly a most successful step by Finland in relations between the European Union and Russia.
Its extent has, however, not been defined.
From time to time it is presented as an immediate neighbourhood policy of the Member States â that is, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
The third and best possibility is good-neighbourly relations between the eight Member States from the Baltic Sea region and Russia, which naturally does not rule out the involvement of other countries.
Thank you, Mr President.
Â Â  . Mr President, it was entirely natural that the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should take an interest in standardising and simplifying the procedure for integrated border management and in migration, asylum policy, crime prevention and the prevention of human trafficking on the one hand, at the same time as in promoting the rule of law, the independence of courts and good administrative practices as laid out in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
We cannot jointly fight crime or build border infrastructure if the funds allocated for this purpose sink in a mire of corruption or incompetence.
That is why I wish to stress that the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are counting on the fact that practical support in the fight against crime and human trafficking will go hand in hand with support for an independent legal system, good administration and civil liberties.
This is necessary in order to achieve a balance between costs and benefits, and so that the demands and the profits are balanced in such a way as to ensure that our neighbours will not only be aware of the weight of their obligations but also perceive values that, to them, seem independently and convincingly necessary for a better, safer life.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Winkler, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument simplifies the European Union's external aid and strengthens cooperation with our neighbours, and that is a good thing.
Nevertheless, we must be prudent with regard to the funding we grant to the neighbourhood policy.
We need to bear in mind the differences between our neighbours to the East and those to the South, and the fact that reforms are being implemented at variable speeds.
Let us ensure that European financial aid remains stable and, in particular, that it continues to be divided as at present.
I am thinking here of our neighbours in the Mediterranean, who, as part of the Barcelona process, have a particular relationship with the European Union.
We need to show and prove that our partnership continues to be a high priority, by increasing our political, economic and cultural cooperation.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, members of the Council, what we in the Committee on Regional Development, and I as co-rapporteur (ArticleÂ 47) in particular, have committed ourselves to is concrete support for citizens on both sides of the EUâs external borders in the coming years.
As MrÂ SzymaÅski has already said, agreement on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument at first reading is now within reach.
The European border regions are offered the opportunity, in the coming years, partly with some EUR 700Â million per annum in funds from the European Regional Development Fund, of carrying out concrete programmes that cover a wide spectrum, including public health, education, the economy and the environment at Europeâs external borders.
It is vitally important that we, in consultation with the Council, have reached agreement on how we go about this.
Specifically, we have managed to maintain the INTERREG method under regional policy.
In that connection, we have consulted the association of the European border regions and the newly formed network of external eastern border regions, called NEIGHBOUR, who claim they know how to use this method, for they have received and adopted workable suggestions.
Finally, we have also reached agreement on the transitional regulation, which means that preparatory measures can now be funded.
Should we fail to reach agreement on the external border with the regions and the nation state, we will take concrete action after 1Â June 2010 to ensure that the funds can be spent in our own Member States on this side of the border and are not wasted.
A readily implementable Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Initiative (EMPI) will be before us from 2007 onwards.
In that connection, I would like to thank MrÂ SzymaÅski and the Council for their unyielding commitment to reach agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner views the economic cooperation instrument as important, and I do not see anything wrong with it becoming a matter to which the codecision procedure is applied at some point, even if that is not yet the case today.
As the rapporteur of the Committee on International Trade on the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, I would like to say that we want to help candidate countries in cross-border activities related to establishing a market economy, non-governmental organisations, implementing WTO principles and all academic exchanges.
At the same time, we strongly demand that the Commission present annual reports to Parliament so that we may see what the funds have been earmarked for, and so that, in a few yearsâ time, we can avoid feeling disappointed that they have disappeared somewhere and we do not know if the aid really reached European Union candidate countries or not.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, for our positive cooperation on the drafting of the Regional Development Committee opinion on the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance.
My opinion is that this report is an opportunity to provide at all stages for the involvement of the European Parliament in the control and management of the new IPA.
In that respect, consultation is not sufficient.
In fact, due to the budgetary and political character of the issues at stake, provision should be made for codecision procedures.
I believe that the lack of visibility in the level of funding per country, objectives and components should be clearly addressed and that the new instrument should ensure clarity and predictability of the Unionâs commitments to its partner countries.
Moreover, proper account should be taken of the specific situations and potential difficulties of the beneficiary countries.
Alternative implementing arrangements should therefore be in force in order to avoid any shared management problems.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I am very pleased at the change to the legal basis of the stability instrument, and am grateful to the Commission and the Council for having accepted this change.
I am also pleased that the negotiations with the Council made it possible to restrict the scope of the stability instrument by limiting cooperation in the fields of peacekeeping and anti-terrorist activities.
Nevertheless, the Commission's proposal aiming to establish a non-compulsory call-back mechanism does not make up for the deficiencies in Parliament's power of codecision on the political content.
With regard to the Mitchell report, I am delighted that Parliament has not yielded to the Commission or the Council.
Tomorrow, we are going to vote on a text that maintains Parliament's powers and allows it to retain its role as colegislator regarding the political direction to be taken by the new cooperation and development instrument.
There is no reason to yield because this power is an established right.
Indeed, the political guidelines on which we want to secure codecision will replace 16 regulations that underwent the codecision procedure.
Now that the initial battle has been fought, we expect the Commission to propose a policy soon so that we can complete the second reading before the end of this year.
Nevertheless, I am concerned about the neighbourhood instrument.
It raises the same problems as the development instrument, but the response provided is considerably different.
As in the case of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation instrument (DCECI), this instrument is subject to the codecision procedure but has no political content.
As in the case of the DCECI, the political content to be defined will, for 15 of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood instrument, replace around a dozen subject-related regulations subject to the codecision procedure.
In an effort to retain its competences, Parliament itself proposed the call-back mechanism to express its opinion on the political content of the neighbourhood instrument within the framework of the codecision procedure in the case of differences with the Commission.
We are an elected assembly and our work is, by definition, political.
We have chosen, though, to legislate on the most technical aspect of the partnership â the procedural framework â but to keep our peace on the political strategy.
Today, we are prepared to give up the call-back mechanism and to yield to the Commission and the Council in order to adopt this text at first reading.
Why should we go back on an established right?
Why should our legislative power be curtailed at a time when Parliament is achieving significant legislative victories in other areas, such as port services, the Services Directive and, tomorrow, the DCECI?
I understand that we need to reach a speedy compromise on this instrument with the Council and the Commission, but how can any elected representative vote to lose his prerogatives?
Â Â  Mr President, the facility to respond to threats against human rights and democracy is a self-evident and necessary objective.
On the essence of the proposal, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to say, as regards the instrument for stability, that the codecision procedure â which is now accepted by all sides â is certainly, legally speaking, the right procedure.
On the question of transparency and flexibility, transparency safeguards the avoidance of overlaps in the various activities, mainly with the CFSP, while flexibility affords the facility for timely intervention and improved efficacy.
I close by saying that certainly I have no objection to the proposed indicative financial framework and I would like to say that, through the annual budget procedure, we shall fight in the Committee on Budgets for maximum efficiency of the instrument for stability.
Â Â  . Mr President, I fully support the objectives of the âProdi packageâ of simplifying the structure of our external actions.
As the largest provider of overseas development assistance, a key trading partner for the LDCs and an important provider of technical and financial assistance, the EU has an obligation to ensure that our actions add value, are properly coordinated and are coherent.
The Committee on International Trade has three main concerns about the packages in general and the DCECI Instrument in particular.
Firstly, in relation to the legal base, we took the view that Article 179 was an insufficient base and that we needed a legal base that included cooperation with both developing and industrialised countries: in other words the inclusion of Article 181a.
Nevertheless, we respect the view of the Committee on Development that having this in a single instrument involved the risk of vulnerability between development objectives and industrial objectives.
Our second concern is the apparent downplaying of the importance of trade in the package as a whole.
We want trade-related assistance to be given a clearer focus and wonder, in the absence of a thematic programme, how trade will be handled in the proposed structures for the new instruments.
Finally, we share the other committeesâ concerns about the erosion of parliamentary control and believe that Parliament was right to reject the original 2004 proposals.
The breakthrough we have achieved with the Council and the Commission on review and expiry clauses should lead to a positive vote tomorrow, but Parliament must now be fully engaged in setting policy priorities throughout the package.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr SzymÃ¡nski, on the ENPI.
The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument â which will replace the existing Tacis and Meda programmes in 2007 â is, in my view, essential to budgetary discipline and procedure.
It will cover the Euromed countries of the Barcelona Process and the Western NIS countries, as well as the three Caucasus republics, which currently constitute the European Neighbourhood Policy countries on which I am Parliamentâs rapporteur.
Like Russia, which is not part of the ENP but enjoys the four Common Spaces, these are all key neighbouring countries whose geopolitical stability and economic prosperity is vital to EU interests.
We need to be surrounded by a ring of friends who enjoy free markets, security within their borders and shared values with the European Union, particularly on human rights and democracy-building.
Although generous, the aid provided in these dedicated instruments â in the case of the ENPI it is of the order of EURÂ 12 billion for the next financial perspective â is less per capita than that granted in the pre-accession process to EU candidate countries.
Nevertheless, it is an important contribution in technical assistance and investment in key infrastructure projects, which can complement the work of the EIB and the EBRD.
I also believe that aid and trade privileges must be the carrot that can be coupled to the stick of conditionality as part of the ENP, to ensure that the closer these countries move towards the European Unionâs values, the more they can be rewarded in future.
The ENPI must remain part of the codecision procedure under Article 179, with suitable monitoring and oversight by our Parliament.
I also welcome the concession by the Commission â and I gather the Council will also fall into line on this â to set up a dedicated instrument for human rights and democracy that will facilitate the EUâs priority support for building greater values of human rights, democracy and freedom in the rest of the world.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is disquiet within the Committee on Development at the difficulties that have arisen with the European Commission and the Council with regard to the negotiation of the instrument for development cooperation.
We approved the first Mitchell report more than a year ago in the Committee on Development and, since then, it has been at a standstill while we waited for the Commission and the Council to stand by their promise to take account of our arguments and criticisms of the Commissionâs initial proposal.
Nevertheless, those promises have not been fulfilled, despite some effort and progress, and they have not been reflected in any text presented to Parliament by the Commission.
There were three main problems with what has been proposed to us.
Firstly, it did not appear reasonable to have a single instrument for development cooperation and cooperation with the developed world.
We were concerned that resources intended for the development of the countries of the South could be transferred to cooperation with the countries of the North.
With regard to this point, the Council and the Commission appeared to sympathise with our position.
The second point was more serious.
We could not accept the idea of Parliament losing competences that it had had with regard to the seventeen instruments which were now intended to be compacted into one or two.
The entire process of European integration has been characterised by a constant effort to consolidate the democratic progress made within the interinstitutional relationship, which has essentially taken the form of greater competences for Parliament in decision-making.
We are surprised, and somewhat indignant, at the approach advocated by the Commission, which sets efficiency against democracy.
The intention has been to reduce Parliamentâs competences, on the grounds that they complicate the process and make it less efficient.
It is not the hierarchy of the Committee on Development that is at stake, but rather the competence of Parliament, and in that regard we cannot take a single step backwards.
In this respect, there has not been the least progress that can be objectively measured.
The third area of conflict relates to the fact that, perhaps more on the part of the Council than of the Commission, the intention has been to include actions relating to security, terrorism and immigration within development cooperation.
Some of them may appear appropriate; what is unacceptable is that they should be funded with resources earmarked for development cooperation.
For example, funding the repatriation of illegal immigrants from the instrument for development cooperation is not acceptable to us.
These programmes require a differentiated instrument funded from other sources.
In this area as well, there has been some progress in our debate with the Commission and the Council.
Mr President, we are going to vote for the text proposed to us, in the hope that, at second reading, the Commission will understand and accept our arguments, hopefully with the understanding and support of the Council.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is indeed consensus in this House on the need for reform of the development cooperation instruments, and that it needs to happen without delay.
In this field, there are already 16 different regulations, with differing priorities and running for different periods of time.
The existing procedure is complex, incomprehensible and opaque.
The Commissionâs draft, though, is a model of how not to tackle this state of affairs.
Simplification and efficiency are not the same things as the voiding of Parliamentâs right of codecision, the systematic blurring of the lines between development cooperation and foreign economic policy in our dealings with industrialised countries, or an obscure legal basis for the use of funds earmarked for development policy.
What I have heard from you today, Commissioner, amounts â putting it cautiously â to contradictory statements on these three core issues.
Perhaps we can take that as a reason to hope that the Commission might stir itself into life, which, in view of the fact that time is now running out, is precisely what it needs to do; many regulations will lapse at the end of the year, and, if we fail to reach agreement, our legal position will be a precarious one.
We want Parliament to vote right now, so that there can be no speculation about it being Parliament that delayed the agreement.
It is on that basis that we need to negotiate.
The Austrian Presidency of the Council has circulated some good ideas as to what a compromise might look like, and now the Commission really must abandon its tactic of sitting on the sidelines when these points are being discussed and meet us halfway and negotiate a compromise in which simplification and Parliamentâs full right of codecision are not seen as antithetical.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the dissatisfaction expressed, I feel I must sincerely thank the Commission and the Presidency, as well as MrÂ Mitchell, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and all the members of the parliamentary committees and the relevant secretaries for the hard work they lavished on reaching an agreement on four instruments for external action.
Interinstitutional cooperation and dialogue constitute a testing ground that will enable us to achieve a positive and effective outcome in the interest of all the actors involved, particularly those from developing countries.
As regards the development cooperation instrument, significant progress has been made on the expiry date, on the revision clause and on other topics too.
The negotiation process has succeeded in overcoming the differences.
With this first reading, we are concluding this initial phase so as to move on as quickly as possible to the creation of a task force of the Committee on Development, this being a decision that the committee itself has already made.
This task force will enable us, once we have received some formal proposals from the Commission, to discuss structures and contents with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible, since responsibility for any potential âgapsâ would lie with everyone and not just with one party.
A solution, which we consider positive, has been found on one of the decisive points of the Mitchell report, namely that of keeping cooperation with developing countries and with industrial countries separate.
I sincerely hope that we will succeed in finding a solution, too, regarding Parliament's powers to define thematic and geographical priorities, priorities that cannot be abandoned, not least in view of the fact that the document in question replaces 16 codecided regulations.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like, if you will allow me, to extend this debate, because we must remember that all of our discussions and our speeches today assume that we have a common policy on external relations.
However, it seems to have escaped the notice of some that, when the French and then the Dutch rejected the European Constitution a year ago, it was precisely because they did not want to let go of what they hold most dear, namely their world view as expressed in their foreign policy.
They have no intention of creating, as the Constitution proposes, a minister for foreign affairs, not even if it is MrÂ Solana, and they have even less intention of giving him services and funding.
No, they do not intend to have the same foreign policy as, for example, the United Kingdom or Italy, or of others, when they invade Iraq, a member of the United Nations, without the consent of the Security Council, thus disregarding international law and even the existence of international law.
They do not want a superpower that kidnaps, deports and tortures like the United States does, as we saw with the infamous affair of the CIA's supposedly secret flights, carried out with the tacit approval of our authorities, particularly of MrÂ Solana, who certainly does not let you forget that he was Secretary General of NATO.
If MrÂ Solana wants to defend human rights, then let him condemn Washington and their European accomplices, which, by remaining silent, have made themselves accessories to kidnapping and torture, rather than starting arguments with the southern countries that are insufficiently aligned for his taste, or perhaps too close to France.
We will certainly vote against these funds and this financial perspective, which is a fatal perspective for Europe and its dignity.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, MrÂ Mitchell, for the work that he has done on this report.
There are a number of points that I wish to make today.
I believe that it is imperative for Parliament to retain the power of codecision on strategic priorities, geographical and thematic aid programmes.
It must also apply for the multiannual financial framework.
It is essential that we do not allow the European Commission to introduce a single instrument in such matters.
I believe that, in keeping with the Millennium Development Goals, the scope of EU development aid should be restricted to the developing countries only.
On the question of aid funding, I believe that the budget support must be approved by the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country.
Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by qualified majority after the European Parliament, but we must ensure that any financial aid and debt relief is organised in such a way as to ensure that some corrupt African leaders, without mentioning names, cannot rearm themselves to bolster highly questionable regimes.
The EU is the worldâs biggest aid donor and is responsible for 55% of all development aid.
Unfortunately, much of that aid is of very little use to developing countries unless we also make trade work for them.
I propose a significant boost in aid for trade, which would be aimed at helping developing countries help themselves by enabling them to turn market opportunities into reality.
I believe it is vital that the European Parliament does not lose its joint legislative power with the Council on the issue of development policy.
Â Â  Mrs Commissioner, MrÂ Winkler, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democratsâ faction, I support Parliamentâs efforts to find a role for itself as an active joint partner in areas involving strategic foreign policy choices.
I was pleasantly surprised by MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldnerâs statement today that the commission would agree with both the implementation of the auditing clause and the European Parliamentâs right of participation in the case of the stabilisation instrument.
What is important is that these documents create a direct link between crisis aid, European Union development cooperation and the implementation of human rights policy.
The objective of establishing mutual additionality between the aid channelled through the stabilisation instrument and the aid provided in the framework of the three remaining foreign instruments is also worthy of recognition.
Thus we have an opportunity to create an integrated European Union strategic programme connecting the main policy instruments with the elements of the new stabilisation instrument.
I am pleased that the council and now the commission have supported the Committee on Foreign Affairsâ request for a separate âhuman rights and democracy instrumentâ.
With the perspective of implementing this instrument, there arises an opportunity for agreements to be concluded concerning the remaining three foreign policy instruments.
Todayâs message is that the European Parliament has established the objective of considerably increasing its right of participation in the issues mentioned.
We also now expect the commission to offer legislative initiatives for realising the foreign aid instruments in question.
The implementation of these instruments concerning all third countries, and on the same criteria is, however, a much more difficult question.
To that end, it is of the utmost necessity that the European Unionâs integral foreign and security policy should be implemented in practice, not only in theory.
This policy must be coordinated more firmly and effectively in order for it to create the necessary generally established framework for reacting to crisis situations.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Madam President, it was one and a half years ago that the Commission tabled new proposals for the financial foreign policy instruments, including development cooperation, in an attempt at simplification and rationalisation, and that is something of which I am entirely in favour.
The way in which the Commission wanted to achieve this, however, would mean that, while Parliament now â thanks to 16 regulations â has codecision powers, it would soon only have an advisory role in the area of development cooperation.
What Parliament wants is a say in how policy is fleshed out in terms of topics and geography and in the distribution of funds across the priorities.
Also â and that is a different matter in this instrument â the Commission would like to lump together economic cooperation with non-Development Cooperation countries and development cooperation by using a dual legal basis. That is something that remains unacceptable to this House.
Although we feel we have now, for lack of new proposals from the Commission, wasted 18 months, all is not lost.
The Committee on Development is prepared, on the basis of the Mitchell report, to set up a task force, and we are prepared to get our skates on, on one condition though, namely that the Commission tables its proposals within the next few weeks.
Firstly, we want a rationalised instrument, intended for development aid alone, with only ArticleÂ 179 as its basis, and thus restricted to official development spending.
Secondly, we would like to see separate proposals for programmes arranged according to topic and geography.
We are prepared to restrict the number of regulations.
We want the right of codecision on the broad outlines of policy.
Thirdly, we want financial priorities either on the basis of a multi-annual financial framework or by including a very low percentage in the geographical and thematic proposals.
What we propose is that 50% of all EU Official Development Assistance spending should be spent on Millennium goals and within this context, present spending levels for basic education and basic health care should be doubled.
It is now up to the Commission to decide whether it wants to do business, or remain at loggerheads with us, in which case we will obstruct its simplification and rationalisation initiatives and will revert back to those 16 instruments and all the unworkable micro-management that they entail.
I would urge the Council and the Commission, in order that poverty may be reduced in a credible and effective way, to accept our offer.
I would thank the Austrian Presidency for the commitment it has shown to date in this respect.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, with its various financial instruments, is the EU providing itself with the means to pursue its external policies sincerely and in full?
If Europe disappoints, euroscepticism will increase.
If we disappoint our partners, we are taking the risk that they will turn away from us.
I hope that the neighbourhood instrument will be effective and will bring the regional stability for which we hope.
In bringing the countries of the southern Caucasus into the neighbourhood policy, for example, has the Union taken account of the expectations of the people concerned?
I am talking about a sub-region that I know well.
Bordered by Russia, Turkey and Iran, it is now at the centre of European and international debate.
By guaranteeing their security, we are also guaranteeing our own.
For this to work, our neighbours need considerable resources to implement the action plans they are currently drawing up, and it is regrettable that the European Union and Parliament are not involved in the negotiations.
However, the important thing is that this instrument, the neighbourhood policy, must assist these countries on the path to democracy, that the Union must be a real player in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, namely, in the case of the southern Caucasus, the 'frozen' conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia, and in the peace plans for South Ossetia.
These countries have voluntarily turned towards our European values, and they must be supported in their action plans.
Because we now need to do more and better with the available resources â which seems to be the theme for today â I therefore call on the Commission to get the allocation of the scarce resources right and to invest in projects based on the fundamental principles of lasting peace and regional stability, respect for human rights and democracy, and sustainable development.
Â Â  â Madam President, very interesting though this stability instrument is as an approach, there is a quite fundamental problem with it, for it amounts to something like an attempt to disregard what is stated in the Treaty of Nice â namely, that there is no free-standing military budget â and introduce something of the sort by a circuitous route, and that I do regard as highly problematic.
This draft, however, states quite openly that the intention is that the new financial instruments should play a crucial role in âdeveloping the Union as a global playerâ.
It is fairly plain to see that what it is talking about here is military expenditure.
According to the Treaty of Nice, there can be no freestanding military budget, and we should actually leave it at that.
What is happening instead is a piecemeal approach to exploring alternative means of funding and developing them.
Another problem is the vagueness of this financial instrument, for it is capable of being used to fund not only civilian but also military projects.
I would urge you to be quite open in saying that you want to fund military operations, and be quite open about doing it, for that is something that can be handled politically.
That is why this is so very problematic.
Â Â  Madam President, we are constantly told to listen to the people, not least by the Greek President this very morning.
Let us do that and recognise that the people, when asked directly, say ânoâ to the Constitution, not least because they view with dismay the allocation of more and more of their money to pre-accession and even pre-candidate countries, some of which are undeveloped.
Here it is essential that developed and undeveloped countries be separated and that these funds are not for European countries alone.
So the EU should remember Third World countries outside the EU where its funds would be put to better use.
In fact, its activities often lead to poverty in the Third World, which is why my party wishes to put this aid back in the hands of Member States alone.
Only yesterday, this House voted to allow EU fleets the rights to fish the waters of SÃ£o TomÃ©, PrÃ­ncipe and Angola.
We all know what happens then: the EU fleets rape the waters, putting locals out of business and destroying fish stocks for years to come.
What price external relations then?
Yesterday, we gave rights to EU fleets to fish Moroccan waters and specifically rejected proposals that Member States could prohibit their fleets from fishing the waters of Western Sahara.
Half the people of that unhappy country live in Algerian refugee camps because of Moroccoâs military takeover.
Now there is political, uncivil insecurity for you!
Thus is Western Sahara impoverished when it could be helped.
But there are only 300Â 000 people there; they have renounced violence, unlike some other countries in receipt of EU funds, so the world forgets them.
Â Â  Madam President, while I would like to express my admiration for the rapporteur, MrÂ SzymaÅski, as well as for the other rapporteurs, I would also just like to highlight a few matters related to the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
We are talking today about an instrument that constitutes one of the tools for creating partnerships and neighbourly relations between the Union and third countries.
Yet are the funds which, as far as I know, amount to only 1.5% of Union spending, sufficient?
Are we really going to be able, with this money, to promote the spread of democracy, respect for human rights and civil society building?
With this kind of approach, specific attention needs to be paid to ensuring that objective criteria are used to determine how the funds are distributed.
Implementing provisions will also be important.
We do not have a lot of time.
It is good that Russia is mentioned in paragraph nine of the explanatory statement. It is a shame, however, that the same emphasis was not placed on Ukraine.
Finally, I would like to say that this financial instrument constitutes an opportunity for the European Union, which is home to barely 7% of the worldâs population, to contribute to global stability and security and to poverty reduction.
It will be beneficial to us all and will constitute European added value.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to start by emphasising the importance of our debate today, both as regards the subject and as regards the fact that it is a debate based on broad agreement.
We are all aware of the fact that the message that we send today, by debating this subject in the European Parliament, to third countries, irrespective of the relationship which these countries have with the European Union, is important.
I wish, of course, to congratulate all the rapporteurs, especially MrÂ Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, to whose report I devoted most time, both for the fact that he was extremely cooperative throughout the procedure in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and for the proposals which he formulated.
The very fact that for MrÂ IvÃ¡nyi's report we have an agreement between us in the European Parliament and also with the European Commission and the European Council is something that I consider very important.
It is also important that pre-accession assistance is being given, of course, to the two candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey, and to countries with European prospects, such as the countries of the Western Balkans.
Finally, I am delighted that we have resolved with the agreement what I consider to be the serious matter of the legal basis of ArticleÂ 181.
In other words, I consider that the agreement made â take heed â is important and I trust that it will be applied in the best possible way.
Â Â  Madam President, the idea that six regulations that are not subject to codecision and concern a range of detailed topics could be integrated into a single regulation and be labelled part of the better regulation effort is unacceptable to my group.
Do the Commission and the Council really believe that better regulation is achieved by cutting the European Parliament out of the procedure altogether?
How can you bring the EU closer to its citizens whilst attempting to take powers from the only directly elected EU institution, whose Members have the closest contact with the European citizens?
This Parliament cannot give up its competence and scrutinising role.
We need to maintain democratic oversight and, indeed, build on our responsibilities in development and external actions.
Seven months are left before the external actions regulations should come into force.
Let us see the Commission put its money where its mouth is and allow Parliament adequate time to legislate on the proposals which, let us remember, the Commission is desperate to have but has not yet formally put forward.
The Commission and the Council should pay attention: this Parliament will not be blackmailed on the Human Rights and Democracy Instrument.
Furthermore, giving up codecision would mark a dangerous step backwards for the development of the European Union as a whole.
This Parliament will not allow that to happen.
Â Â  â Madam President, I am glad that the new pre-accession assistance programmes are to be given an unequivocally political slant, and conclusions have been drawn from our experience with them, so that funds will from now on be spent in a more targeted, efficient and flexible way.
We know that progressive European integration is the driving force behind the processes of change in the countries of the western Balkans, and in Turkey as well.
This House has an interest in being consulted in good time when the framework rules are drawn up, when results are assessed and when conclusions are drawn, and we will consider very seriously the Commissionâs undertakings in this regard and also in respect of the Neighbourhood Policy.
If our solidarity is to be taken as read, then we must insist on unambiguous compliance with international law and conventions being expected in the same way.
By so doing, we will not only be reinforcing sound economic development, but also, and in particular, helping to underpin civil society as the seedbed of European integration.
Â Â  Madam President, last year we saw millions of young people marching to make poverty history.
Poverty matters to them; it matters to us.
Also last year, we saw the people of Europe â France and the Netherlands â reject the Constitution, because to them the EU was too remote from their concerns.
We now have a chance to bring their concerns about poverty and our concerns about connecting with the people of Europe together.
This Parliament is the point of connection, the point of transparency and accountability.
That is why codecision is so important.
That is why transparency is so important.
That is why accountability is so important.
That is why replacing 16Â codecision instruments with one will not work: replacing instruments on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, replacing policies on sexual and reproductive health, on measures to promote the full integration of environmental dimensions, on measures to promote the consolidation of sustainable management of forests â including those in developing counties, policies on consolidating democracy and the rule of law, on respecting human rights, on promoting gender equality in developing countries, on decentralised cooperation, on cofinancing with other NGOs, on food aid and food management, on development cooperation with South Africa, with Latin America, with Asia â it must be dotty!
Whoever in the Commission thought this up?
I do not think that the Commissioner has anything to do with it.
We have to be accountable; we have to report back to our people.
Our people expect us to tell them what we are doing with their money, and we cannot do that if there is only one development cooperation instrument that will cover this whole gamut of policy.
We have to set policy.
Parliaments are there to set policy, to implement and oversee the implementation of policy and to account for money.
That is what parliaments are for and we cannot avoid our responsibilities.
I do not think that anybody in the Commission should think that the MEPs in this Parliament are going to abrogate their duties.
I congratulate Mr Mitchell on a very good report.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, our representativesâ amendments to the neighbourhood policy instrument justifiably emphasise European values.
It is good that the instrument provides for the possibility of bypassing governments.
Unfortunately, however, we are sidestepping the definition of geopolitical priorities.
The final objective the European Union wishes to achieve with these not at all insignificant amounts is not specified.
There are lots of hints.
It is clear that in addition to the neighbourhood policy instrument, Russia has a separate framework and a Northern Dimension.
In other words, the European Union by default recognises the existence of a Russian sphere of influence.
At present, Moldova is a plaything in the hands of the Russian bear.
The Kremlin closes off the gas pipelines and dries up the countryâs largest source of export revenue â the wine industry.
In so doing, Moscow is not only testing the resilience of Moldova, Georgia and the Ukraine, but also whether the European Union has any foreign policy backbone at all.
Therefore, we must use our taxpayersâ money as a tool with which to sweep away the last traces of the Cold War in this united Europe.
In the interests of stability, more financial resources must be focused on democratising the areas of the former Soviet Union.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the success of the negotiations that we have held on a range of instruments for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible, and also the three rapporteurs, two of whom had to deal with matters subject to codecision, for having conducted proceedings in a manner worthy of codecision, the result of which is that we can be quite certain, if the human rights instrument is added, of bringing matters to a conclusion at first reading in June.

What I would like to say is that it is not the number of regulations that determines Parliamentâs prerogatives, but rather their content.
I think we have achieved a great deal in the three areas for which my committee is responsible, with the codecision on the stability instrument, with the options made available to us by financial regulation, with the breakdown of appropriations and enhanced political substance.
The review clause, which the present Commission has yet to guarantee within the life of this Parliament, the commitment to establish a legislative process on the basis of it, the possibility of this House having codecision on a mid-term review of the substance â these are just a few of the things that offer us more possibilities in comparison with what we had in the past.
It is important that there are few rules, and that they are readily comprehensible, for that is what transparency is all about.
Scarcely anybody â least of all we ourselves â knew how to find their way through the thirty rules that we had before, and that is why I think this is a better way for us to go down â which, I hope, we will.
We can take pride in having made a good job of this.
The European Union gives four times as much overseas aid as does the United States of America, and it is for that reason that we should make the effort to do it better and negotiate regulations for its speedy implementation, for implementation is what this is all about.
We need to take a closer look at European policy on the way the instruments are used, and it is particularly with this in mind that we in this House will attach great importance to checking up on the Commission.
Â Â  Madam President, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is important to the new EU Member States, including Lithuania.
Our border with our neighbouring countries is almost 1Â 000 kilometres long.
We are very keen that behind this border, in Russia and Belarus, democracy, human rights, economic prosperity and greater public welfare should take root.
Paraphrasing the former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, we could say that European Union citizens will never be safe and happy if, beyond the borders of the Union, people live in economic deprivation and in the absence of rights and fundamental freedoms.
I would like to stress that the document also offers the possibility of using financial resources for those countries that are inclined to freeze cooperation with the EU.
We need to coordinate these possibilities with a project to create a European democratic fund in support of civil society, as suggested by the Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, German Social Democrats and Members of the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is in the interests of the European Union to encourage our neighbours, particularly the countries in south-eastern Europe, to adopt our standards.
It will bring stability not only to that region, but also to the European Union as a whole.
The programmes we have had in the past have, for the most part, been implemented extremely effectively: we could list a whole host of examples, particularly with regard to the Balkans.
I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has started, in cooperation with Parliament, to develop new programmes for the period post-2007.
We need to do this, because it is in the interests of both sides.
However, it is also in the interests of Parliament and of everyone to ensure that the funds for these programmes are used optimally.
I can tell you from my own experience that there are too many projects in which there is too much discussion and not enough concrete action and aid.
There are too many projects that run in parallel and overlap with one another, and sometimes our projects compete with those from the USA and other states.
At any rate, there is no coordination.
My request to the Commission therefore comprises three points.
First, we need to draw up a specific overview of the projects in progress, and then keep this overview up to date and ensure that the resources and projects are coordinated.
Secondly, projects should only be approved if they actually provide practical aid ensuring that standards are raised.
Thirdly, the provision of funding must be linked with appropriate success.
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner state that we will undertake an initial review in 2009, which will show where we are making good progress and where we have problems.
In general, it comes down to being able to guarantee that the European Union's money is used optimally in the interests of security and stability in the region as a whole.
Â Â  Madam President, in order to extend the numerous benefits of the economic and political cooperation to the neighbouring countries, the European Union has created the so-called European Neighbouring Policy.
Using the new and often more flexible European neighbourhood and partnership instruments proposed by the European Commission, the European Union will have a direct or indirect effect on approximately 400Â million citizens in 17 external countries.
The new financial instrument is very important, and it will have a significant added value in the development and facilitation of cross-border and regional cooperation, and in strengthening the rule of law and developing good governance.
We have come through a long negotiation process, and although the Commission has invested a lot of work in this issue, I can still not consider its approach regarding Parliament as being altogether cooperative as far as the four instruments are concerned.
The Commission and Council are aware of the fact that Parliament welcomes the simplification of procedures, but it does not accept that, for the sake of simplification, the controlling role of Parliament should decrease, whether in respect of the external representation of the European Union or its budget.
Â Â  â Madam President, today's commitment by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the Commission is prepared to submit a proposal for a separate financing instrument in favour of democracy and human rights is already a positive development. We await the proposal from the European Commission, which will have its own legal basis.
However, this proposal by the European Commission must not be at the expense of the legislative competences of the European Parliament, especially its competences in the field of the budget, especially when we refer to matters connected with the foreign policy of the European Union.
European citizens, as we all know, are calling for the competences of the European Parliament to be strengthened, not weakened.
I wish to say and to point out to MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner that the new financing programme for democracy and human rights which she submits â and this is a particularly important and sensitive point â will need to include financing for the rehabilitation centres for the victims of torture inside or outside the European Union.
So far the European Commission has been the main source of funding for these centres and, consequently, their continuing operation is a fundamental humanitarian responsibility.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, today is an important day for Europe.
We have finally adopted the financial perspective for 2007-2013, which is also good news for the candidate countries and for countries of the Western Balkans.
Those countries will now have a clearer idea of the resources available under the instrument for preÂ accession assistance (IPA). I warmly welcome the establishment of the IPA.
I strongly believe that it will facilitate higherÂ quality and more flexible individual policies during the pre-accession period, and will also make possible more cross-border and regional cooperation between countries that are preparing for accession and those already in the Union, something I consider very important.
In common with previous speakers, however, I would have welcomed a greater involvement by Parliament in the formulation and creation of individual strategies and in areas such as decision-making on suspending assistance.
Â Â  Madam President, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is actually very welcome.
The European Parliament has been calling for cooperation between the EU and its neighbours to be made easier for a long time now.
In practice it has been very problematic that the EUâs own Interreg programmes and the programmes being implemented in the neighbouring regions have been completely separate, and that it has been impossible to realise joint projects on both sides of the borders.
Although we are now introducing the one-stop shop principle we have wanted for so long into neighbourhood and partnership policy, it will be challenging to put the programme into effect.
We have to remember that the external border regions are different.
Not just the population base but also political needs must be taken into consideration when channelling resources regionally.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief, since time is getting on.
This debate has convinced me that there is a joint effort here, a common interest, to conclude the negotiations on all the instruments as soon as possible.
The Presidency of the Council has already stated, in a letter to the rapporteurs MrÂ Mitchell and MrÂ van den Berg, that it is prepared to start talks next week, and I was grateful to hear MrsÂ Morgantini discuss the necessity for these talks in her speech.
We want to do that in all good faith.
At this point, I should particularly like to thank MrÂ Brok, who said what I, as President-in-Office of the Council, tried to say in the Committee on Development, namely that it is of course not the Council's intention to curtail Parliament's rights.
We have absolutely no intention â in the interests of credibility in the eyes of our partners â of curtailing Parliament's rights or opportunities for participation.
Quite the contrary: we are committed to credibility and greater efficiency.
It is therefore not necessary to count the instruments and to use that to measure how efficient we are; it is much more important for us to make progress in terms of content.
I am grateful to all of you for your willingness to cooperate with the Presidency, and I should like to end by quoting from the letter to which I referred earlier:
âI can assure you that the Presidency and the Council are fully committed to finalising a compromise on the DCECI before the summer break and will not spare any efforts as far as working time and personnel capacities are concerned.â
Â Â  . Madam President, President-in-Office, first of all I would like to say that this was a very intense debate on very important instruments.
I think you have seen that we have been very open.
However, I must also correct a misunderstanding by saying that we are clearly not opposed to codecision.
The DCECI instrument is fully subject to codecision.
Let me state clearly that we do not want to abolish codecision.
This is a complete misunderstanding and an incorrect interpretation.
We think that it is possible to work on the basis we have.
The Commission has accepted that the addition of additional policy content to the DCECI should follow very closely the policy provisions of the 16 existing regulations as far as they still reflect current realities and policy priorities.
However, let us not keep the current structure as the sole reference.
It is unnecessarily complicated.
We are saying that the policy provisions of these regulations can be perfectly imported, and adapted as necessary, into the main DCECI regulation.
I remember that you all always want quick, swift, efficient delivery.
How can we do that if we make things even more complicated?
I could not agree more with MrÂ Brok.
It is not the number of regulations but the content of the regulations that makes codecision possible.
A second minor point regarding the request for new Commission proposals: at this stage of the discussion, and given the urgent need to come to a prompt agreement, the Commission considers it necessary to use the Presidentâs proposal as a basis.
All the elements are already on the table.
I think they are a very fair reflection of what the Commission itself would have proposed, as we were closely involved in their development.
Moreover, the Council itself is now preparing its position on the basis of these proposals, so it is also in Parliamentâs interest to work on this basis, provide input and consequently establish the basis for a negotiated common position.
Let me also reiterate our wish to move forward, but now we really have to start negotiating.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote on the Mitchell report will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The vote on the other reports will take place in June.
The Commission can accept the following amendments:
7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 76, 77, 78, 80, 82, 88, 92, 99, 102, 113, 117
The Commission can accept the following amendments subject to drafting modifications:
17, 30, 31, 33, 36, 37, 38, 40, 62, 64, 86, 90, 100, 101, 105
The Commission can accept the following amendments in principle:
16, 18, 27, 28, 61, 87, 104
The Commission can accept the following amendments in part:
3, 10, 22, 25, 26, 32, 39, 43, 53, 56, 57, 60, 63, 70, 71, 73, 79, 93
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments:
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 20, 21, 23, 35, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 72, 74, 75, 81, 83, 84, 85, 89, 91, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 103, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0207/2006).
We will be dealing with the following questions to the Council.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I am delighted to have another opportunity to take questions under your presidency, and we will start with the first question from MrÂ Posselt on the progress made in the accession negotiations with Croatia.
Let me make it clear from the start that, in the accession negotiations with Croatia just as in all other accession negotiations, the principle is that each country is assessed on its own achievements.
In the interests of transparency, this principle must continually be emphasised, and the speed of the negotiations depends solely on the extent to which the candidate country â in this case Croatia â meets the conditions for accession.
It goes without saying in this regard that, as is stated in the relevant decisions, the EU's assimilation capacity must be taken into account.
The Council cannot and should not specify a date for the conclusion of the negotiations, which started on 3Â October.
With regard to the next step, the Council launched the accession partnership with Croatia on 20Â February; this partnership will set out the priorities that need to be met en route to accession.
The Commission's screening reports on the negotiation chapters 'science and research', 'education and culture', 'public procurement' and 'competition' are now available.
The Council has examined the screening reports on the first two chapters, 'science and research' and 'education and culture', and invited Croatia to set out its negotiation positions.
I am now in possession of these positions, and the Council now needs to draw up a Common Position.
The plan is that the specific negotiations on this chapter will commence on 13Â June as part of an accession conference at foreign minister level.
I would reiterate that how fast and how far these negotiations can be taken ultimately depends on the progress made by the candidate countries themselves.
Â Â  Last week, I was in Split with the leadership of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
There, in Croatia, there is considerable concern that each chapter will only be concluded, which requires unanimity, when the negotiations with Turkey on the same chapter have been concluded.
Can the Council once again make it clear that this is not the case?
You have indeed said that each country would be assessed on its merits, but there is still the risk that, as before, there will be a matching of speeds that is completely inappropriate in view of the subject and of the size of the countries.
Â Â  . From a legal point of view, there is no connection between different accession negotiations.
There may, of course, be a connection, if â as in the case of Turkey and Croatia â screening reports on a number of candidates are presented at the same time, and this can result in a certain amount of correspondence.
This does not, however, constitute a connection.
Therefore, the negotiations continue to be based on the principle that each candidate country is treated according to its own progress, and that there is no connection with the negotiations with other candidate countries.
Â Â  When does the Council anticipate that the negotiations will address the institutional chapter?
When it does so, what offer will the current Member States give to Croatia as regards the number of votes Croatia will have in the Council?
Will it be an offer based on the current voting system, which all Member States have agreed to change in the Constitutional Treaty, or will it be based on an offer made on the basis of the Constitutional Treaty?
In which case, will that be possible without reopening all the linked issues, which we thought were solved in the Constitutional Treaty?
Will it therefore not be necessary to re-examine the whole constitutional package?
Â Â  . In reply to Mr Corbettâs question, the normal procedure is for institutional questions to be dealt with last.
Of course, the regime that will eventually apply to the representation of new Member States in the bodies and institutions of the European Union very much depends on the debate on the future of the European Union and on the future of the Constitution.
However, that is still in the future and I cannot predict what will happen.
Â Â  I would like to ask a question similar to that put by MrÂ Posselt, who pointed to the potential for a dangerous parallel course with Turkey.
I see a different, more fundamental, problem.
We are currently having major difficulties in arranging the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria in such a way that we can stick to the deadline set, frankly very prematurely, by the Council and still ensure that the candidate countries have in fact achieved what we expect of them.
In the case of Croatia, the situation is slightly different: much has been achieved, much progress made, but it seems to have been put on the shelf.
Â Â  . I disagree, MrÂ Rack.
Nothing has been shelved.
We all recognise that Croatia has made considerable progress, and we have rewarded this progress accordingly.
There is absolutely no reason to doubt that the negotiations will progress rapidly, and that the progress achieved will be honoured accordingly.
I also see no connection here with other past or future negotiations.
Â Â  . On this question I must point out that, as you will all be aware, consular matters â of which this is one â are the responsibility of the national authorities.
As far as the Council is aware, negotiations between Portugal and Canada on this matter have reached an advanced stage.
I can therefore only say that the Council does not really have any competence on this issue, and I would add that, at the request of the country concerned, the issue is also not being discussed any further in the Council working group on consular affairs.
Â Â  â I must say I am astonished to hear that answer.
May I point out that four or five years ago, when I put a similar question, on the United States, to the Commission, I was told that the Council was working on the issue via a group that specialised in consular matters.
Yet we are now witnessing a concept in retreat, a European citizenship that used to exist and that used to be taken into account four or five years ago, which is no longer the case.
I should like to understand how this is possible.
Â Â  . I would point out that this is, and must be, ultimately a question of what the country involved actually wants.
If a Member State of the European Union wants to deal with a national issue nationally and bilaterally, and to discuss it with the third country, then the European Union should not interfere.
Were Portugal to say that it wanted something else, the Council would of course look into it accordingly.
Â Â  . In general, the EU and the Council are monitoring the human rights situation in Iran very carefully and with growing concern.
At the 60th session of the United Nations General Assembly, it was the European Union that tabled a resolution on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, thereby publicly expressing to the world its concerns regarding the situation in Iran.
I can assure the honourable Members that the European Union is using all the means at its disposal â publicly and confidentially, in declarations and dÃ©marches â to express these concerns regarding abuses of human rights in Iran, and it will continue to do so.
Regarding the case of Masouma Kaabi and her son, it has been reported that they were released on bail a few weeks ago.
The European Union is monitoring the situation and will take every available opportunity to discuss and express these very justifiable worries and concerns.
Â Â  I simply wished to point out to the Council that this is not a general reference to human rights in Iran, but rather we are talking about specific cases.
You have referred to the specific case of the person who has been released and not to the cases in which people have not been released.
I am referring to a very specific case, not to a general defence of human rights in Iran, since we are in fact doing that fairly effectively.
The same cannot be said about direct intervention in specific cases that we are aware of.
Â Â  . Concern for the fates of individuals is, in fact, and quite naturally, particularly close to the hearts of the European Union and the Council.
Particularly in individual cases, it is important to proceed in a way that is efficient and does not have the opposite effect to that intended.
That is difficult.
I myself have worked in this field for long enough to know that it is often difficult to find the right path, and to avoid giving the impression that we are not interested in these cases whilst at the same time not running the risk, by proceeding too officially, of the result being the opposite of what we actually wanted.
You can be assured that the European Union and the Council are working very hard to find the right path in each individual case â and it goes without saying that we care very much about the fates of these people.
However, I must tell you, quite openly and frankly, that the European Union's options are sometimes very limited and that we do not always achieve the level of success we would hope for â and this is, admittedly, sometimes very frustrating.
However, we will not be put off by that, and we will continue down this path.
Â Â  President-in-Office, you said that the scope of the EUâs powers is limited, which I accept.
However, the one thing the EU could do is to lift the label of outlaws and terrorists from the Peopleâs Mujahedin.
I raised this matter a few months ago and asked you to consider bringing it before the Council.
You said, to my delight, that you would not just consider it but positively do it.
Could you share with us the progress you have made or expect to make, or the timing thereof?
Â Â  . Indeed that question has been brought to the attention of the Council, which is still considering it.
I hope that I will soon be able to give you a concrete answer, but I cannot do that today.
I beg your indulgence and a little more patience.
Â Â  â As you are aware, the EU-Iran human rights dialogue has been suspended.
We are also aware that Iran is certainly interested in resuming this dialogue, but we know what the problems are.
What is your view of the situation?
Will the dialogue be resumed shortly, and what could this dialogue actually achieve in the cases specifically mentioned?
Â Â  . In this connection I should like to start by saying, as before, that it is a matter of balance.
Iran is certainly very interested in resuming this human rights dialogue, and of course the Council is also, in principle, interested in holding such a dialogue with Iran, because it offers an opportunity to raise many issues in this connection, including individual cases.
However, we cannot allow the European Union to get involved in a dialogue that will be abused by the other side as, so to speak, an alibi or as a whitewash.
The European Union therefore has a very specific view on the conditions under which this dialogue could take place.
One of the preconditions for the European Union entering such a dialogue is that certain specific concessions must be made in advance.
The European Union's expectations in this regard include, in particular, the release of political prisoners.
As I said, though, we are prepared to enter into dialogue, and if Iran is seriously interested in such a dialogue, the European Union will willingly take part, under the specified conditions.
Â Â  .
I shall be happy to deal with this issue in somewhat more detail although, if I have been correctly informed, I shall be able to adopt a more thorough position on it at 9 p.m. today, the Council having said that it is prepared still to be in this House at that time and to take part in this debate.
The Council attaches the very greatest importance to the issue, addressed by MrsÂ Andrikiene, of a common and coordinated energy policy for the European Union.
I should point out that, in the conclusions to the informal Council meeting in March on the subject of âA New Energy Policy for Europeâ, the Council referred to these problems and made relevant decisions on this issue under the heading âEnergy policy for Europeâ.
It was stated, in this context, that Europe has many challenges to meet in the energy sphere, notably the increasing dependence on imports and what has so far still been limited diversification.
In the conclusions, the Council therefore calls quite clearly for an energy policy for Europe that is focused on an efficient Community policy and on coherence between the Member States and between the measures taken in the various policy areas and that, in a balanced way, adequately fulfils the objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability.
I should like to mention in this context that, precisely where the energy issue is concerned, a careful examination needs to be made of what comes under the powers of the state and what can be done in this area at European level.
Synergy effects must be obtained in this sphere.
The European Council has also stated that the security of energy supply should be increased, partly by developing a common external concept and by promoting energy dialogues between the European Union and its most important partners and stronger diversification in terms of suppliers, transport routes and external energy sources.
The European Union and the Council too will, in the next few weeks, be devoting particular attention to precisely this aspect of external policy.
Using the existing structures as a basis, the Council will join the European Commission in working towards a more effective form of dialogue between the European Union and Russia.
It will not be long before the summit offers the opportunity to explore this issue, which will also be one of the important topics at this summit.
With a view to ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty, the Council is also calling for the negotiations concerning the Transit Protocol to be completed.
The legal framework offered by these instruments would increase the transparency and competitiveness of the energy markets and, at the same time, help create more favourable investment conditions in those countries that are parties to the Treaty.
In the framework of this common energy concept, a genuine energy partnership with Russia too should be possible, and security and predictability guaranteed for everyone.
It should be pointed out that this topic has not just come out of the blue.
Rather, the Council has for a long time already been developing an interest in this type of efficient and coordinated energy policy.
This issue has only now become particularly topical, specifically at 8Â a.m. on 1Â January 2006 â eight hours after the Austrian Presidency had begun â when, as is well known, developments took place in which Russia interrupted the energy supply.
The gradual construction of a legal framework for energy, be it through the promotion of renewable energy sources or through the successive liberalisation packages, which by the summer of next year will guarantee a complete opening-up of the common energy market, is already contributing to a coordinated and common energy policy, rightly called for by MrsÂ Andrikiene.
When it comes to the diversification of energy sources and transport routes, the very recent acceptance of the decision on trans-European energy networks is an important step in this direction.
The conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty with the South-East European countries, on which I shall be able to explain my position in detail in the next debate at 9Â p.m., also contributes to achieving this objective, as the internal concept of the energy market is extended to include neighbouring countries.
In this connection, the Council looks forward with interest to the evaluation of the energy strategy which the Commission wishes to submit to the Council and Parliament in the course of next year and which deals in particular with the targets and measures required for an external energy policy in the medium and long term.
Where, finally, the issue of the G8Â Summit is concerned, I should like to point out that the Council does not of course belong to the group of G8 countries and does not therefore take part, as the Council, in the meetings, either.
It is, however, prepared to deal with the issues of mutuality and transparency in other relevant forums such as the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue.
These important issues were also brought up for discussion very recently in a letter from the Energy Commissioner, MrÂ Piebalgs, and the President of the Energy Council, MrÂ Bartenstein, to the Russian energy minister, MrÂ Christenko.
Â Â  Madam President, I do not have a supplementary question.
I just wanted to thank the President-in-Office for his very detailed answer.
Â Â  I should firstly like to congratulate the Council on its success in having the 2007 internal market for the end user included in the final documents.
It will involve a lot more work now, but I think that it will be of corresponding benefit in terms of the Lisbon Strategy.
My question is: What actually is the situation where the Energy Community is concerned?
May it be extended to further states, and which states are the main candidates?
Â Â  . Good progress is being made in establishing the Energy Community.
The Treaty has now been signed by four states.
I see no basic reason why, if such a development is helpful, this Treaty might not be extended to other states too.
To my knowledge, there is not, however, at present any definite intention to extend it in this way.
The negotiations with Turkey, which has not signed the agreement, are also being continued with.
As a country of transit and a connecting link, Turkey is, logically enough, of great interest.
I could imagine some future development too entailing an extension to the number of states that are signatories to the Treaty.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission has produced a fine paper on the security of energy supply in the EU.
We know, however, that powers in this area are very fragmented.
What can the Presidency of the Council do in order to enable Europe to present a united front, particularly to Russia, and what can be done to enable our partner, Russia, to maintain in the field of energy production those standards of sustainability that we have achieved in the Community?
Â Â  If further standardisation is required of what you rightly call this fragmented state of affairs where powers are concerned, the Commission will have to propose legal regulations.
When it comes to having a credible common external policy on energy, the Council is endeavouring to devise a common concept as a follow-up to the March decisions.
The High Representative has also been asked for proposals in connection with this common concept.
MrÂ Solana will also produce something in this context because this is a very important issue in the framework of the European Unionâs overall external policy.
Â Â  In the January 2006 part-session of the European Parliament, the Austrian Federal Chancellor expressed his opinion on the possibility of introducing a direct source of funding for the European Union.
At that time, there was discussion of the financial perspective, which is funded mainly from contributions by the individual Member States, and the discussion therefore turned again to the subject of the European Union having its own direct source of funding for the budget.
When, in December 2005, the European Council reached an agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 â with the Treaty now signed, the Interinstitutional Agreement has therefore now been successfully concluded â the Commission was given the task of undertaking a comprehensive examination of all aspects of EU expenditure, including expenditure under the common agricultural policy and system of own resources and taking account too of the United Kingdomâs rebate, the intention being that the Commission should produce a report on the subject in 2008 or 2009.
In a joint declaration by all three institutions on the new Interinstitutional Agreement, this method of proceeding was confirmed in April 2006.
I should like, however, to emphasise in this context that, on this issue too, we must proceed on the basis of the principle of unanimity, and this is of course a very difficult issue to resolve because not all Member States are in agreement, especially on the subject of what particular direct source of funding should be opted for.
I believe that, here in the European Parliament too, there are still very different views on this issue.
Â Â  . I would like to thank the Presidency for that reply.
I noted recently that a colleague in this House suggested that there should be a tax on texts and emails.
If we really want to get peopleâs backs up and alienate young people from the European Union, that would be the way to go!
I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to his response.
He said that the issue of a direct tax was on the table.
Can he confirm to the House that this is no longer on the table?
Or is it still on the table for discussion and can it arise again for discussion in the near future?
Â Â  The issue is not only being debated, but it is also being looked into more closely.
Moreover, it will remain an ongoing subject for discussion in Ecofin, because an evaluation has, above all, to be carried out.
The fact is that this has been agreed within the framework of the Financial Perspective.
We therefore hope that a process has now been begun here that can ultimately be brought to a successful conclusion.
Â Â  In the view, no doubt, of probably the large majority of European Union citizens, it is high time that, instead of constantly looking for new sources of funding, for example in the form of direct EU taxes, and instead of constantly increasing the level of expenditure, we finally got to grips with combating fraud and waste.
What is the Councilâs position on this?
Â Â  â As a representative of the Austrian Ministry of Finance, I wholeheartedly agree with you that there are two sides to every budget â an expenditure and a revenue side.
There are two ways of handling budgets.
Our aim is to achieve a balanced budget in all the Member States at least through counterbalancing cyclical trends: by increasing revenue, on the one hand, which â of course â is unpopular with the public and the business community.
On the other hand, we are striving towards more efficient spending â we need to cut back expenditure, but we need to do so efficiently; and, on the revenue side, we need to ensure that governments do in fact receive all the fiscal charges provided for by law instead of introducing new fiscal charges.
This is an important discussion, and I recently travelled to some of the new Member States to discuss issues such as this, for example turnover-tax fraud, which is a major problem throughout Europe and is estimated to cost the economy EURÂ 70Â billion.
The same goes for the fight against customs fraud.
Under Austriaâs Council Presidency, we held discussions with tax experts in Vienna in February on ways of bringing turnover-tax fraud under control, such as introducing different tax systems and improving the existing system.
Â Â  Since they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
Under the current system, each Member State pursues its own tax policy in accordance with the economic and social conditions and requirements at national level.
Common rules on taxation are very limited.
This fragmentation of tax policy in the EU often creates tax barriers for businesses, particularly SMEs, which face high compliance costs and double taxation problems when operating in another Member State.
Moreover, the difference in national tax rates creates unequal tax competition, particularly between the new and old Member States, which results in unequal treatment of businesses and is one of the motives for relocating businesses in Member States with low rates of taxation.
Does the Council consider that adopting more coherent, uniform rules in regard to tax policy would ensure more equal treatment of taxpayers within the EU and boost competitiveness in the EU?
What stage has been reached in deliberations to promote the principle of a common uniform corporate tax base, to which the European Parliament recently gave its assent?
At the informal Ecofin Council meeting, there were also discussions on, inter alia, the introduction of taxation assessment basis for company taxation, revealing once more that a number of Member States reject the notion or at least are very sceptical about it.
In the light of the unanimity principle on taxation questions, does the Austrian Presidency think that tangible results are to be expected in the foreseeable future?
Will this issue be on subsequent presidencies' agendas too?
Â Â  â These questions concern a uniform assessment basis for company taxation.
The Commission is currently working on the technical preparations for a proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base.
These preparations are entrusted to a working group under the auspices of the Commission itself that was set up following the informal Ecofin Council in SeptemberÂ 2004.
On 5Â April of this year, the Commission presented the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee with a communication entitled âProgress to date and next steps towards a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)â.
This firstly reports on the progress made to date, as the title indicates, and secondly identifies the fields in which the Commission requires political support and direction for further technical work.
At the informal Ecofin Council held at the Presidencyâs invitation in Vienna on 7Â April, Ministers were presented with the Commissionâs initial report on the state of technical preparations.
At the end of this informal Council, the Council President, Karl-Heinz Grasser, stated that the discussions had shown there to be clear majority in favour of this assessment basis.
In the Ministersâ estimation, this basis would result in cost savings for enterprises and a simplification of the national tax systems.
In addition, the Commissioner responsible for taxation, CommissionerÂ KovÃ¡cs, stated that, although it was no easy task to speak up for a harmonised corporate tax base, the Ministers had engaged in an informative exchange of views over lunch.
In future, the Commission will report regularly to the Council on the progress of the work.
The Presidency has put an initial exchange of views between Ministers concerning the Commission communication on the agenda for the Council to be held on 7Â June of this year.
His expectation is that the contributions that the working group I have already mentioned receives from the Commission and the Member States will make it possible for rapid progress to be made with technical preparations.
As Commissioner KovÃ¡cs, the Commissioner responsible, stated at the last informal Council, the issue should appear on the agenda of the following Council Presidency, too â as envisaged in the annual programme.
This is an issue that cannot be resolved in the near future, therefore, but needs lengthy preparation.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, has a study been or will a study be carried out into the repercussions of the adoption of a uniform basis for assessment?
Â Â  â There are not yet any cost estimates available.
We need to await this study, which will take some time.
It is not possible to give a date for its completion.
Â Â  This issue of course demonstrates that unanimity is a stumbling block not only on taxation in general, but also within taxation issues.
After all, as the President-in-Office has said, there is majority support for this uniform assessment basis, but an open door to agreement is not yet in sight.
My question to the President-in-Office is: to his knowledge of the counter-arguments, how many countries firmly oppose this, and does he envisage any possibility of overcoming the barrier of unanimity?
In addition, should we not abolish unanimity altogether in the case of taxation relevant to the internal market?
Â Â  â The problem of unanimity now that there are 25Â Member States is particularly acute in matters of taxation.
Member States who have only recently introduced a completely different tax system, for example a flat-tax system â that is, a single rate for company taxation, income tax and such like â have difficulty supporting a uniform assessment basis.
It is natural for these countries to object, as they are currently benefiting from tax competition.
In specific terms, there are four countries that object to introducing it too quickly or to making any changes at all.
In my view, the only remedy is to be found in the form of a constitution, which Europe needs â and the more countries that join the EU, the more imperative this becomes â so that we are able to take majority decisions in this field, too.
As we have also seen in the matter of the reduction in turnover tax, which was very difficult to resolve, unanimity in matters as difficult as taxation causes problems when it comes to taking decisions necessary for the economy and to creating growth and jobs â something that can also be seen in connection with the Lisbon process.
To do so requires a flexible decision-making process and a Council that is capable of action.
Â Â  â This relates to the same subject.
The issue of finding a uniform tax base is a matter of tax harmonisation, and the question has also been asked as to what documents there are relating to this.
Unfortunately, there are no data available as yet on the amount that could be saved by this means; that is to say, on the costs that the economy could be spared.
Nevertheless, the Commission recently published the European Tax Survey, which establishes that enterprises doing business across borders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, incur substantial costs on account of the differing tax systems in the EU, and that this is by no means beneficial to competition.
In this connection, I should like to draw the Houseâs attention also to the Commission communication entitled âTowards an internal market without tax obstaclesâ, which was addressed to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee and whose most important objective is to relieve the burden on economic activity in the EU.
In addition, at the informal Council held in Vienna on 7 and 8Â April, the President of the Commission requested the presentation of detailed calculations with regard to the economic benefits of a consolidated tax base.
In general terms, I should like to point out, however, that the issue of transfer pricing represents an enormous administrative burden for enterprises operating in the internal market, one that would hardly arise at all if a common consolidated tax base were to be implemented.
In the past, the Council has adopted several measures to make it easier to carry out cross-border economic activities in the Community, including the Parent-Subsidiary Directive, the Merger Directive and the Interest and Royalties Directive.
In addition, the Commission has presented the Council with a proposal to amend the Interest and Royalties Directive, which is currently still under discussion in the Council.
Â Â  Do I gather then, that the reason we are doing it is because it is good for civil servants?
Do you not think it strange that the countries that do not want to harmonise tax are the countries that have the highest growth rate, the lowest unemployment, the highest investment in infrastructure and the lowest personal tax?
Does it not strike you as strange that they are the countries that do not want to harmonise tax and, in fact, do not want to interfere in other peoplesâ taxation systems?
The countries that have high tax, high unemployment and low growth are the ones that want to harmonise tax.
It seems extraordinary to me that we do not want to follow the countries that are economically successful at the moment, but want to bring in a tax system that is unsuccessful in other parts of Europe.
Â Â  . â We are concerned here with the issue of fair tax competition.
The EU envisages fair tax competition as a fundamental principle in all matters and interests; it is just that all participants should be on an equal footing.
The tax competition should ensue from different tax rates.
What we are concerned with here is the issue of the flat tax Some of the new Member States have recently introduced a new tax system in which the tax rates for enterprises are far lower than those of the old Member States.
Relatively unfairly â because these are all net recipients â this results in tax competition that prompts the question as to whether, in view of the severe reduction in taxes, these countries are really still able to discharge the social transfer responsibilities they share with all Member States: pension and health-insurance systems.
Â Â  I completely agree that there are differences in different countries, but you are talking mostly about new Member States that have implemented new taxation systems, and about unfair competition.
When the new Member States entered the European Union they did not know about the European Unionâs plans to harmonise taxes.
I disagree, therefore, with the view that we are not competing fairly with all the European Union Member States.
Â Â  . â Harmonisation of company taxation is, on the one hand, a matter of simplifying the system for the business community so that tax bases are not different in every country â with country A having different write-off facilities from country B or country C â but instead the facilities are always the same; as this is a great problem for enterprises.
Companies operating internationally have enumerated the variety of legislation that has to be observed in the motor vehicles sector â car manufacturing â alone, and the extent of the resulting administrative burden.
On the other hand, this harmonisation is about fair, transparent competition.
Transparent competition means that business profit â the base â is taxed according to uniform principles, and competition then arises from different tax rates.
We do not want to eliminate competition. It should always be carried out within the meaning of the Lisbon process.
The second point is that we are an internal market, and an internal market requires common rules.
Â Â  . â In connection with this question, I should like to point out that, on 3Â JuneÂ 2003, the Ecofin Council adopted the Directive on the taxation of savings.
This Directive aims to ensure that cross-border savings income received by persons resident in the EU in the form of interest payments is either taxed in the Member State in which they are resident, or subject to a withholding tax in the Member State that is considered the source State.
In order to preclude distortions of competition with important financial centres outside the EU, the Directive also provides that the same or equivalent measures be applied by a series of territories and third countries.
These include 10 dependent and associated territories, such as the Isle of Man, and five European countries, namely Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland.
The measures laid down in the Directive and the agreements concluded with the third countries and territories have been applied by all 40 contracting parties concerned since 1Â JulyÂ 2005.
Extending the territorial scope of the Directive to other relevant financial centres is possible in principle.
On 1Â DecemberÂ 1997, the Council adopted a Resolution on a code of conduct for business taxation, which deals with potentially harmful tax measures that affect, or may affect, in a significant way the location of business activity in the Community.
Sixty-six tax measures in the old Member States and thirty in the new Member States have been classified as harmful by the Code of Conduct Group and largely phased out.
The Code of Conduct Group is now focusing on its future work, on which the Council expects to receive a report in June.
Â Â  I thank the Council for that very comprehensive response.
I am still amazed that the situation is allowed to continue.
Liechtenstein must be a drain on Austria in the way it flouts the system so close by.
I am amazed that the larger EU states allow these anomalies to continue outside the EU but within the wider area.
These states are extremely dependent on our benevolence.
Andorra uses the euro, the Channel Islands use the pound sterling, but they pick and choose which laws they want to follow.
They exploit loopholes that the EU allows, and we continue to allow that and enable a few rich people to exploit the system, making a mockery of our EU regulations.
Despite everything the President-in-Office has said, I still think it is amazing that we allow these anomalies to continue.
I would have thought there is a need for even more action than he has just spoken about.
Â Â  . â I agree with the honourable Member in that ideally, of course, an internal market covering almost the whole of Europe should have tax rules in place; but these also need to be effective, and neighbouring countries and, if possible, countries outside the continent need to apply the same rules, otherwise we hand the EU public the possibility of investing its money abroad, where such rules do not apply.
That is why it was important to overcome any opposition â and I visited some of these countries myself when the agreements were being negotiated.
In any case, Liechtenstein, San Marino and the countries I named earlier have signed this agreement and, in this way, we at least guarantee that these territories follow uniform tax rules.
Naturally, we should like other countries, too, to follow this example. Switzerland in particular, situated as it is in the middle of Europe, should make efforts to apply the European rules, and should also be bound to them by an agreement.
Â Â  TheÂ President-in-Office of the Council must himself be aware of the criticism that tax havens are increasingly being used for the purposes of money laundering.
These countriesâ provisions on money laundering do not meet the usual high standards or are not being applied correctly.
Is the Council Presidency, and the EU in general, considering working with these countries to tackle and solve this problem?
Â Â  â I shall return to this question later.
One question relates to money laundering.
Naturally, it is important that uniform guidelines on money laundering be applied in all of the countries of an extended economic area â the FATF is an important body in this regard.
The Commission is also holding talks on this subject.
Â Â  . â We are now shifting from taxation to the budget issue.
What we are concerned with here is Member Statesâ adherence to their budgets.
Following the debate at the 2005 Spring European Council, the Commission made proposals for amending Regulations 1466/97 and 1467/97, which form the legislative components of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The relevant amending Regulations were adopted on 27Â JuneÂ 2005 following a lengthy discussion process â in the course of which it was asserted that the old Stability and Growth Pact was dead.
Both regulations were adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in ArticleÂ 252 of the Treaty, and Regulation 1056/2005 was adopted following an opinion from the European Parliament.
In addition, on 11Â OctoberÂ 2005, the Ecofin Council established a revised Code of Conduct relating to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and Guidelines on the content and format of the Stability and Convergence programmes.
All of these rules are publicly available, as is the information on the steps taken to date by the Council in connection with the revised Stability and Growth Pact.
The latter comprise the following legal acts: decisions in accordance with ArticleÂ 104(6) EC on the existence of excessive deficit in Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom; recommendations on measures to correct these deficits under ArticleÂ 104(7) EC; a decision establishing, in accordance with ArticleÂ 104(8) EC, that the action taken by Hungary in response to the Council recommendations regarding the correction of its excessive deficit had proved to be inadequate; and also a Council Decision giving notice to Germany, in accordance with ArticleÂ 104(9) EC, to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary in order to remedy the situation of excessive deficit.
In addition, the Council has delivered opinions on the updated stability and convergence programmes of all Member States, which had been drawn up for the first time in the context of the new regulatory framework for the amended Stability and Growth Pact.
In a nutshell, I can say that, in spite of the criticism that the Stability and Growth Pact was practically dead, the new Stability and Growth Pact has proved to be functional and alive.
This can also be seen in the significant fall in deficits in 2005 compared to 2004.
Â Â  I thank the Presidency for that reply.
I understand that economic growth is projected to be 2.3% in the European Union and 2.1% in the euro area in 2006, up from 1.6% and 1.3% respectively in 2005.
But would the President-in-Office share my concerns that growth rates do not appear to be converting into forecasted increases in employment rates?
Whereas I understand that one million jobs are expected to be created over the next 12 months, the unemployment rate would still remain stubbornly high, at about 8.4%.
Do you share my concerns that economic growth is not converting to jobs?
What steps are being taken to deal with that issue?
Â Â  â It was for this very reason that we made the Lisbon Strategy such a high priority at the last European Council.
This Council discussed growth, as growth is a means of increasing employment and thus reducing unemployment.
Specific objectives were given, including the gradual creation of one million jobs; and achieving these objectives in practice is a very important starting point.
Unemployment is the main problem facing Europe at the moment.
This Council Presidency, in particular, has taken very specific, targeted measures on this.
One factor currently endangering growth is the development of oil prices.
This potential risk must be clearly recognised.
We hope to see stability restored in this regard â particularly in global politics.
Indeed, for the most part, the issue of oil prices at the present time is less a problem of supply and more a psychological phenomenon.
The issue of Iran has already been mentioned.
We must do our utmost to ensure that, on the one hand, we really achieve growth rates â a very tangible presence before us â in international competition with the USA and the Asian economic area, and that, on the other hand, by means of political stability, all the risks that emerge time and again, and naturally have the potential to affect economic growth, play a less prominent role.
If we are to reduce unemployment effectively, however, we need to aim for even better growth rates.
A growth rate of around 3% would reduce unemployment perceptibly.
That is why the growth rate of 2.6 â even if it is a good rate in comparison with previous years â is still too low.
Â Â  What measures is the Council proposing in order to induce those countries that repeatedly endanger the Stability and Growth Pact with their excessive deficits to be more disciplined?
Â Â  . â I refer once again to my previous answer.
I have named all the countries concerned â Italyâs deficit being a prime example.
It must always be borne in mind in this connection, of course, that these countries â Italy in particular â have had elections this year, which naturally hinders an excessive deficit procedure such as this, because it means that political decisions are postponed for a while.
Italy has given assurances that it will now, with its new Government, take all the measures stipulated by the Council.
I have named all the countries giving cause for concern: Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and, among the new Member States, Hungary in particular, with its 6% deficit.
Each Council meeting consistently works towards reducing the deficit, and this has borne fruit.
To reiterate, the 2005 financial year saw a general reduction in the deficit compared with the previous year.
Â Â  Questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the recommendation by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty [13886/1/2005 â C6-0435/2005 â 2005/0178(AVC)] (Rapporteur: Giles Chichester)(A6-0134/2006),
- the oral question to the Council on the Treaty establishing the Energy Community for South-East Europe, by Giles Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (O-0024/2006 â B6-0020/2006) and
- the oral question to the Commission on the Treaty establishing the Energy Community for South-East Europe, by Giles Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (O-0025/2006 â B6-0206/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, I am not sure I have ever enjoyed such largesse of time before in this House, but I am glad it is in the company of a select club!
I wish to begin by expanding on the objects of our two questions to the Council and to the Commission.
I should emphasise that they are questions â although it is gratifying to see my name on them, the questions are on behalf of my committee.
I am very pleased to see that the Presidency is able to be present after all.
I appreciate that this may have caused inconvenience, but holding this debate at this time presents some inconvenience to me as well: I could be elsewhere consuming asparagus.
Because the Council has changed the original Commission proposal with regard to the role of the European Parliament from the consultation procedure to simply informing Parliament of any decision of the Council, I am bound to ask why the Council appears to be trying to bypass or circumvent Parliament.
What could the Council have to hide?
In the context of the apparent reluctance to be present here tonight, the substance of our question has added relevance.
Therefore, allow me to remind the Council representative, Mr Winkler, of our two specific questions.
The first is: what mechanism would the Council envisage for informing of Parliament prior to the adoption of a position by the Council with regard to the Energy Community Treaty institutions?
Secondly, by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the representatives of the European Community in the organs of the Energy Community Treaty, such as the Permanent High Level Group?
Before the House is invited to vote on the recommendation on the Energy Community Treaty tomorrow, we need some answers and assurances from the Council on these points, and I and others will be listening carefully.
Because this is a very important matter, the proposed Treaty creates an interesting precedent in extending the in a limited and very specific field to third countries, albeit that two of them should be joining the European Union very shortly or others are in various stages of negotiating accession.
It is also important because energy is currently perceived as a very important issue, largely as a result of events at the beginning of this year.
Those events were rather like throwing a large stone into a pond, creating ripples.
Energy is vital to our way of life, vital to our quality of life and vital to our standard of living, so how we organise markets and safeguard security of supply is equally important.
Turning to the question to the Commission, I should like to acknowledge from the outset the high level of cooperation and the positive response to our concerns that we have received from Commissioner Piebalgs.
Indeed, I welcome his open and constructive approach in meetings and in the recent letter with regard to the issues of informing Parliament about the activities of the Energy Community and addressing some of the concerns of my committee over social and human rights issues.
I trust that the Council will endorse his offer to inform Parliament in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues.
I welcome his letterâs assertion that he considers it of the utmost importance that Parliament is fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community.
Now I come to the specific points contained in our questions to the Commission, which I feel still require a response.
The Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty lays down in its Article 4(3) the provisions for providing âmutual assistance in the event of disruptionâ â see the Treatyâs Title IV, Chapter IV.
Yet the same article of the decision stipulates that: âin the event of special circumstancesâ the position of the European Community âmay go beyond the â.
So the first question is: what might these special circumstances be?
The second question is: what is meant by the phrase, it âmay go beyond the â?
I ask the Commissioner to put some flesh on those two issues for us.
The final point â by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the Commission within the various organs of the Energy Community Treaty â has been answered in general terms in the Commissionerâs letter.
However, I invite him to share any further thoughts he may have with Parliament on detailed implementation of these undertakings.
Finally, I come to the crux of the matter: whether Parliament should vote for the recommendation.
Let me say that I recognise the good intention of the Commission in offering to brief my committee about the work undertaken in the preparation and negotiation of this Treaty, although our reaction might have been more welcoming and less suspicious of what was being proposed had it not come out of the blue without any prior knowledge on our part.
I also recognise and appreciate the Commissionâs efforts to persuade the Council to take this Treaty down the assent procedure route instead of, as it were, slipping it through on the nod.
However, I am bound to observe that this was after we began raising questions about possible empire-building by the Commission.
This Treaty could provide an important message to the countries of south-east Europe, and even beyond, that the EU is capable of being outward-looking and wants to embrace them in the family of European nations.
I am not entirely sure how much comfort Bulgaria will derive from this, given the earlier decision to force early closure of Kozloduy â a decision which no longer has any technical justification in my view, but maybe this Treaty could help offset that negative message.
I close by expressing the hope that the Council in particular will be able to give us sufficient comfort this evening so that we can proceed to a favourable vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to say that it is indeed a pleasure for me to participate in this debate on a question that I consider very important, because in the eyes of the Council the subject matter is very important.
I was not invited to feast on asparagus tonight, so my destiny is an easier one than yours; but as a Permanent Representative of Austria to the Council of Europe I had the pleasure for five years to be invited to those feasts.
With your permission, Mr President, and with my apologies to Mr Chichester, I shall continue in German; but I hope that I will be able to give comprehensive answers to the questions that were put to the Council.
MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council does indeed consider the Treaty establishing the Energy Community between the European Community and the countries of South-East Europe to be an important instrument, for obvious reasons: security of the electricity and gas supply to the European Community and also to the contracting parties in the region.
This subject came to the attention of the Austrian Presidency somewhat dramatically only a few hours after, at 8Â a.m. on 1Â January, gas supplies were cut not only to Ukraine and Moldova, but also to Central Europe.
That made us all acutely aware of how desperate the situation had become.
As the Committee quite rightly notes, one of the objectives of this Treaty is the extension of the EC energy market to the countries of the region through their implementation of the on energy, environment, competition and renewables.
This strikes me as particularly important in the interests of the homogeneity and coherence of a pan-European strategy.
Hence, the Energy Community Treaty is characterised by the fact that one of the most important aspects of the work of the bodies it envisages is the implementation of the relevant provisions of Community law.
In addition, ArticleÂ 25 of this Treaty provides that measures may be taken to implement amendments to the , in line with the evolution of European Community law.
This dynamic reference also strikes me as very important.
The Council would like to emphasise that this means, of course, that Parliament is directly involved from the outset in the preparation of Community rules and the adoption of these rules by both of our institutions under the codecision procedure.
Therefore, these are rules that are then to be incorporated into the framework of the Energy Community Treaty.
The importance of Parliamentâs role in the adoption of the Energy Community Treaty is also reflected in the choice of legal basis, that is to say, in the fact that Parliament has a right of assent, as stated in ArticleÂ 300(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
We are not just talking about a right of consultation, therefore.
The Councilâs amendment to the Commission proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty to which the honourable Member MrÂ Chichesterâs question relates concerns the role of the European Parliament in decision-making.
The Council has indeed deleted ArticleÂ 5(3) of the proposal, which had provided for the consultation procedure.
It should be pointed out, however, that the Commission proposal had envisaged consultation of the European Parliament only in a single specific case, namely that of the establishment of positions of the European Communities on decisions to be taken by the Energy Community pursuant to ArticleÂ 100(iii) of the Energy Community Treaty; that is to say, decisions on the extension of this Treaty to other energy products and carriers or other essential network infrastructures.
In other words, under the Commission proposal, the Commission would present the Council with a draft relating to the establishment of a Community position on this kind of amendment of the Energy Community Treaty, and the Council would then have to consult Parliament on this position.
Such a procedure is not provided for in the EC Treaty, however, and so would be in addition to its procedures and thus alter its institutional balance.
Instead, the EC Treaty, more specifically ArticleÂ 300(2)(3), provides that the European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed.
However, even though the EC Treaty does not provide for informing of Parliament in the event of a scenario such as the one I have just described: for example, the extension of the Energy Community Treaty â where the deletion is relevant â the Presidency of Parliament will provide regular information on all the important aspects of the proposed Council position.
I should like to say in this connection that, as the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will remember, the last Council Presidencies that dealt with this issue informed Parliament, within the framework of their speeches to this Committee, on the state of affairs with regard to the Energy Community Treaty.
I should also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in certain cases, particularly when this is necessary for reasons of political importance, there is nothing to prevent the Council from consulting Parliament on its own initiative.
I would also point out that the Energy Community Treaty chiefly extends the in whose adoption Parliament is fully involved.
Let me now turn to the decision-making process in the bodies of the Energy Community and to the positions to be adopted by the European Community in these bodies.
As the House is aware, the institutional framework of the Energy Community consists of the Ministerial Council, the Permanent High Level Group and the Regulatory Board.
Parliament is not directly involved in the decision-making process agreed with the parties to the Energy Community Treaty.
However, ArticleÂ 52 of this Treaty provides that the Ministerial Council must present Parliament, and also the national parliaments of the contracting parties, with an annual report on the work of the Energy Community.
Regarding the position to be adopted by the European Community in these bodies, this is laid down in ArticleÂ 4 of the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty and is adopted by the Council pursuant to the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty.
One important aspect of this decision-making process is the requirement for Community positions on Energy Community decisions falling under TitlesÂ III and IV of the Energy Community Treaty to be in line with the , with the exception of measures falling under Chapter IV of Title IV of the said Treaty, which concerns mutual assistance in the event of disruption of energy supplies.
Moving on to Parliamentâs involvement, ArticleÂ 4(5) of the proposal for a Council decision stipulates â as proposed by the Commission â that Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed of any decision of the Council on the establishment of Community positions to be taken in the three bodies of the Energy Community Treaty.
There is no formal requirement for informing of Parliament, but it is the Presidencyâs firm intention to inform Parliament regularly.
The Commission will also be required to do so.
In addition â and the Council will take this into account â the position taken by Parliament once it has been informed will certainly influence the future decisions of the European Community.
I hope that this speech not only answers the honourable Memberâs questions, but also allays any fears that Parliament is not duly involved.
At all events, I can emphasise once more on behalf of the Council that it is important to us that Parliament is regularly informed and involved regarding not only all the issues in which its involvement is a constitutional right, of course, but also all the issues concerning the functioning of this Treaty.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for providing what I consider to be comprehensive answers, but we now have to analyse them in order to be completely aware of the current situation.
An exchange of information is obviously vital.
I would like to thank CommissionerÂ Piebalgs for his particularly active cooperation with Parliament.
Today, after the conflict in January, we know that energy security is not simply a problem affecting individual Member States, and not simply a challenge for the European Union as a whole.
We need a pan-European approach to this issue.
The Energy Community Treaty is a step in the right direction.
It foresees an integrated gas and energy market in part of Europe, facilitates investment and increases the security of gas supplies to the European Union.
However, the Treaty also stipulates that investment decisions will be transferred from a national to a centralised level, as this method is more productive, both in terms of costs and administration.
Thus the Treaty is a good solution.
It demonstrates that energy security requires a new approach, also in terms of European Union foreign policy.
It is also a good legal instrument with which to manage energy relations with Ukraine, which intends to sign the Treaty.
The European Parliament has, on numerous occasions, emphasised the importance of securing energy supplies on the basis of harmonious cooperation between the European Union Member States, which requires the legislative solutions announced by the Commission at the start of this year.
It is vital for this cooperation to exist within as well as outside the European Union, namely with third countries, in such a way as to avoid interfering with the interests of individual countries and not to exclude any Member State from the proposed solutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank both the Council and the Commissioner for allowing Parliament to continue to participate in these matters in the future.
The Energy Community Treaty, signed in October, integrates nine countries in south-east Europe with our energy market.
That is a historic event in at least two senses.
Firstly, it is a precedent, as for the first time it will extend legislation on the single market for the electricity and gas sector to nine countries outside the Union.
Secondly, it is the first multilateral agreement that applies to the whole of south-east Europe since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.
It will take much cooperation, but will thus stabilise the region.
Establishing the Energy Community is in many ways a rational and justifiable project.
The energy sector in the Balkan region is undeveloped and continues to suffer the consequences of a war that took place a decade ago.
There are frequent power cuts and there is no secure source of energy available.
Furthermore, the environment is suffering on account of old power stations and their emissions and, in addition, the lack of investment and lack of competition both pose serious problems.
The purpose of the Energy Community Treaty is to develop the energy infrastructure with the help of loans granted by financial institutions.
It is estimated that around EUR 25-30Â billion will be needed for investment in the electricity sector over the next 10Â years.
The fact is that a viable and reliable energy system will also tempt investors, which will result in the regionâs economic situation developing, improved general stability and a reduction in emigration.
Moreover, it is important for the Union to improve reliability of the energy supply (we are also speaking from our own point of view) and reduce dependence on single suppliers.
The Balkan region is also an important route to the Middle East energy in the Caspian region.
There are also causes for concern.
In spite of the energy in south-east Europe being at present underpriced, much of the population cannot afford to purchase electricity.
When the energy sector becomes market-based, it will be capitalised, so prices will inevitably rise.
The parties to the Treaty should therefore ensure that public service obligations are fulfilled and that prices are reasonable, so that the poor too can afford electricity and gas.
Parliament insists that the parties should sign a legally binding protocol.
This kind of binding commitment is important.
The single market must apply standards, in the areas of working conditions and social equality, for example, especially as we are talking about an energy sector that will be making massive profits.
Â Â  . Mr President, we know setting up an internal energy market between the EU and the countries of south-east Europe has advantages for both sides: for the Balkan states it helps establish the reliable energy supply necessary for economic growth, and for us on the EU side it facilitates access to gas resources in the Middle East and around the Caspian Sea, enhancing diversity and security of supply â especially important since the ripples in the pool that were alluded to by Mr Chichester.
However, there have been concerns, and the helpful letter from Commissioner Piebalgs does not entirely answer these.
It is not clear whether the ECT states will be signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is not clear whether the internal market will be underpinned by health, safety and employment standards, as it is in the EU.
It is not clear whether there will be any control of the demand side of energy, as there is through EU energy efficiency legislation, or whether environmental considerations, such as the control of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, have been given adequate attention.
There will be no level playing field if these standards are absent.
There is also the question of corruption in the energy sector.
To give just one example, in 2005 the British Serious Fraud Office investigated the involvement of a British company in the Serb state power company following allegations that corrupt money was being used to protect war criminals.
Because of all these concerns, it is understandable that the European Parliament should wish to be both informed and consulted in advance of decisions.
I regret that Parliament does not yet have codecision in this area and I wish that there was a Constitution in place so that it would have; but it is an outrage that the consultation mechanism could be downgraded.
We welcome the reassurances from Commissioner Piebalgs that he will keep Parliament informed in advance, but we need similar cast-iron reassurances from the Council too.
Nevertheless, being informed is not the same as being consulted.
Given the serious nature of the questions hanging over the Energy Community Treaty, it would be deeply regrettable if Parliament were sidelined.
There could effectively be no democratic oversight of this Treaty, because it is clear â not least from what the Council has said tonight â that the real decisions will be taken by the unelected Permanent High Level Group rather than by ministers themselves.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the present Treaty, but we should like to emphasise a number of points that have already been raised, in order to qualify our assent with some reservations.
In our view, all the signatories to the Treaty should actually make an unqualified declaration of belief in European fundamental rights or, in other words, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
We believe that it is absolutely necessary, including to prevent disruption in the energy market towards which we are striving, that the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding â impact in the fields of employment, social standards, working conditions, health and the environment â be given a binding legal basis.
The Commission and the Council need to take very seriously the call for these to be made binding.
In our opinion, it is very important that this Treaty not enable or pursue energy strategies that would have been appropriate 20Â years ago at best.
We believe that energy efficiency must be a very important concern in this new Treaty and that the market that we are intending to create should not be geared towards demand alone.
In accordance with the discussion on greater autonomy in Europeâs energy supply, consideration for renewable energy must be central in all regions under this Treaty.
We greatly fear that privatising the sector too quickly and without proper consideration could be harmful.
We have had experience with privatisation of state monopolies that was carried out too quickly, and believe that the Commission must bear in mind that the public interest in privatisation and the strategies to carry this out needs to be taken into account.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to acknowledge the work of all those who took part in drawing up these documents, especially our rapporteur.
I agree with his introductory analysis and speech, including the questions he posed.
As regards the Treaty itself, in my opinion we have succeeded in establishing an acceptable platform for bringing together countries that are not yet EU Member States in a given region, on the grounds of solving energy issues, with a view to their achieving EU compatibility.
Given that I am not an uncritical advocate of the all-powerful liberalisation of the market, I welcome the fact that the Commission has expressed the intention of dealing with related social aspects in a separate memorandum, which I take to be a good sign, and not only for the citizens of the region concerned.
Interconnection of energy markets undoubtedly translates into greater security of energy supplies both in south-eastern Europe and in the whole of the Union.
I do not, however, share the great optimism that the process of interconnecting the markets will lead to cheaper energy; at least this has not happened in the Czech Republic.
I should like to make one final remark.
I believe that the time has come to address the issue of setting up an independent European control centre for transmission networks, with a view to solving operational problems, in particular relating to the supply of electricity in EU Member States and their immediate neighbours.
Â Â  Mr President, I will outline here a few brief views.
The internal market is the most important source of prosperity that the EU provides us with.
It is also, without doubt, important for the internal market that we link up gas and electricity networks, including in south-east Europe.
As we have heard from a large number of speakers in the Chamber, this would reduce the risk of disruptions in one production unit knocking out large areas.
There would be stability.
It is truly excellent that we can also look forward to having regulatory authorities of an international nature.
Perhaps people in the region will also learn to cooperate with each other and thus minimise the risks of violent conflicts of the type seen in the past.
So far so good â but then comes the poison arrow.
All of a sudden, one reads in the report that if we have a common market then this naturally leads to a common external policy.
This is not at all the case, but it is possible misleadingly to make use of such an inference.
What we have here is precisely such an abuse in the grand tradition of Jean Monnet.
Instead of having an open debate about the pros and cons of a common external policy, such a policy is sneaked in in a completely different context.
This is a very common technique.
In reality, we know that the people of Europe do not want more supranationalism.
This fact is revealed the minute the will of the people is allowed to show itself through popular referendums instead of being filtered through the political establishment.
I contend that the text concerning a common external policy should be expunged.
Solutions to energy problems in south-east Europe should not be used as a means to promote such a policy.
Â Â  Mr President, the Energy Community Treaty is a success story.
It is worth stating this, because success stories of this nature are particularly rare; today, the combination of politics and energy is more likely to generate conflicts rather than diffuse them.
We could illustrate this with countless examples, from the manoeuvres of Russia, potentially endangering the gas supply of the European Union, to the Bolivian nationalisations, so enthusiastically celebrated the other day by the leftist Members of this House.
The Energy Community Treaty is a refreshing exception, and a true European success story that the European Union can be proud of.
As the result of three years of consistent and persevering efforts, our goal can finally materialise: we can cooperate in the modernisation and rebuilding of the energy supply of the war-torn Balkan region which is of such crucial importance to the safety of Europe.
I, too, naturally agree with this goal, just like I also support and require that the controlling role of Parliament in respect of the Treaty is ensured.
One of my reasons for this is that I am convinced that the stabilisation of the energy sector in the Balkans will facilitate the diversification of EU energy supplies.
I trust that the Treaty will give a fresh impetus to the implementation of the Nabucco gas pipeline project, which is meant to serve this purpose, and may be decisive in relieving the unilateral dependence of Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, on gas imports from Russia.
I trust that all these things can be achieved, and that the creation of the Energy Community will be a tangible argument for the single European energy policy, also supported by the Green Paper.
If this is achieved, the European Union can produce further energy success stories, and will continue to set an example of an attractive political community to its neighbouring countries and regions wishing to bridge the gap.
Â Â  Mr President, when we extend the single market to neighbouring countries we should not only promote the economic dimension of the European Union but, as when we promoted the single market within the Union itself, we should also include the social dimension.
The balance between the two parts is lost when it concerns the Energy Community Treaty.
For instance, does the Treaty not include participation of the social partners?
On other occasions Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the importance of social dialogue.
Early participation of the social partners in the relevant sectoral dialogue committees, like those in the electricity and mining sectors, has been positive for the social partners in the new Member States.
We know that liberalisation of the internal market for electricity and gas will necessitate many structural changes and new challenges for the companies and the workforce, as also for the citizens, with regard to affordable prices and security of supply.
We demand a commitment on the part of the participating countries to respect and implement the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will work towards a good memorandum, with legally binding statutes that also secure democratic control over the sector.
They should, furthermore, guarantee to oversee the work of the regulatory authorities and the resources and consultation processes of the relevant stakeholders.
Â Â  Mr President, buying energy from another country is one thing. The political ramifications in this case are quite another, and here it is a written document that matters.
The EU employs the as one of the founding principles to which all its Member States have solemnly signed.
How can this be extended to countries which are not even candidates yet?
The EU suggests going beyond the and overriding due process in the event of special circumstances.
What are these circumstances?
How short are your memories?
We heard this excuse before.
It led to a conflagration from which we are suffering still and to evils which we still do not comprehend.
You may know that I do not wish my country to be part of the EU, but currently it is and I am a democrat.
This House of properly-elected deputies should be consulted and should be the final arbiter, deleting the provision requiring the Council to consult Parliament before adoption of the Commissionâs position excludes this House from any meaningful debate.
This is all about enlargement by the back door.
Page 6 of the recommendation draws a parallel with the Coal and Steel Community and how it started the EEC as it then was.
That being the case, why not say so?
Why keep it secret?
Excluding Parliament, special circumstances decided by an unelected body, secretive motives: all are the beginnings of totalitarianism.
No, please do not scoff, because that kind of attitude is exactly how all the demagogues and dictators down the ages got away with it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my congratulations on this Treaty.
I believe that the EU is developing in the right direction here: in the direction of cooperation, and of approaching the global energy market with our eyes open.
My questions are as follows. Which countries are continuing negotiations?
What priorities are we setting?
Then there is my chief question: have the effects of the Kyoto Protocol been analysed with respect to these Treaties?
What will be the impact on energy generation?
What mix of energy sources will arise, and what kind of investment behaviour will develop in this field?
After all, I believe that these Treaties present us with an opportunity to sketch out certain structures and thus to realise the Lisbon agenda.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been expressed in the course of this debate that the Treaty establishing the Energy Community has historic significance and, from the point of view of its benefits, is not a one-way street.
It is not the case that we are handing these countries something on a plate, as it were â as the EU, too, benefits.
As MrÂ Buzek and others have also said, an important point is that this is a pan-European issue rather than one that concerns only the countries of South-East Europe or only the EU â an integrated energy market certainly could not function like this.
This Treaty contributes not only to energy security and energy supply but, generally, to increased stability in Europe.
As you know, the Austrian Presidency, in particular, has attempted in recent months to step up cooperation with the countries of South-East Europe and of the Western Balkans, to make some progress in the interests of stability and peace in Europe.
It is potentially very interesting to recall that the Energy Community Treaty was consciously modelled on the European Coal and Steel Community â which, as you know, was the genesis for the European Union.
Members such as MrÂ Paasilinna have also mentioned here that the Energy Community Treaty enables the very local and specific energy and environmental concerns of South-East Europe to be addressed.
A number of speakers have raised environmental concerns, such as increased mortality rates from winter cold, environmental degradation as a result of emissions from old power stations, the use of wood for domestic heating that results in deforestation, and the unsustainable use of wetlands and watercourses for hydroelectric power.
As has also been mentioned in the course of the debate, it is in Europeâs interests to think beyond the South-East European region â an example given here was the Caspian Sea.
I should like to mention in this connection that the Presidency sent a Troika mission to Kazakhstan to meet representatives of all the Central Asian countries, and also sent a mission to the Southern Caucasus.
Naturally, the energy issue â both the producer and the transit-country aspects â is particularly important in both of these regions.
Other points raised here have concerned Nabucco, for example: this is another important project that will benefit the security of Europeâs energy supply.
Doubts have been expressed, too, and that is reasonable, of course â but I believe that the issue of this Treaty must be seen in conjunction with the overall endeavours of the EU as regards this region of South-East Europe.
I should like to remind the House that all the countries who are party to this Treaty are involved in the stabilisation and association process, which, of course, also comprises respect for human rights, fundamental rights and other EU provisions.
Indeed, the purpose of the network of agreements we have made with South-East Europe is to introduce these countries to EU values, too, which naturally includes the values enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That is why I believe that the Energy Community is a unique achievement, a successful project, one that we wish to remain successful.
I have also sensed that in most of your speeches.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that Europe must speak with one voice to third countries on energy policy, and that the process of integrating our neighbouring countries into the European single market should be continued.
As I said in my introductory speech, I wish to make it crystal clear that Parliament naturally has a central, an important role to play in this, and that there can be no question of the Councilâs attempting to curtail Parliamentâs rights â which we could not do anyway, owing to the interinstitutional structure; on the contrary, we have an active interest in due involvement by, and joint action with, Parliament.
That is why we shall be involving Parliament in all the important issues regarding the Energy Community: in accordance with the EC Treaty, but also, as I have said, taking a very broad interpretation of its provisions.
In addition, Parliament will always be fully informed of developments.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall try to address some of the issues touched upon during the debate about the new countries that could join the Community in the years to come.
I really believe that Turkey is close to joining the Community.
It has been working towards this since the creation of the Community.
It has not signed up to it, but we shall continue to work with it.
It is quite important for Turkey as a candidate country â we have started negotiations with it and it is also a very important transit country â that it could and should sign this Treaty.
Two countries â Ukraine and Moldova â have also expressed interest in joining.
The issue of affordability is very important because energy prices should be accessible to the citizens of these countries.
Article 33 of Chapter IV addresses this issue as far as the Community can address it.
In the process of creating the Community we have devoted attention to social issues.
I agree that the social approach in Europe should definitely be directed more closely at countries that aspire to a vision that may one day come much closer to that of the European Union.
A memorandum of understanding is a good first step in that direction.
We have looked carefully at renewables and energy efficiency: Chapter VI addresses this issue.
On Kyoto, Article 13 in Chapter III â even if it does not say very much â covers this and the provisions on renewables and energy efficiency in the Treaty will definitely help to achieve the Kyoto goals.
Concerning privatisation, the Community does not impose any type of action in this area: any decision on privatisation will be taken by these countriesâ governments.
Concerning prices, I think these countries are already paying extremely high prices for energy.
An Energy Community could bring down prices because of the new investments it will bring in.
It will also help with regard to collecting payments, because there is a lot of money owed.
There is also diversification: these regions pay some of the highest gas prices to the supplier.
The supplier in these regions does not worry too much about price affordability.
This means that the Energy Community could bring much more stability â at least to prices â and could even reduce prices for consumers.
In addition, an brings public service obligations, which means addressing issues for the more vulnerable people in society.
Investments from the World Bank â the EIB is also very active in this region â and other investors will come as soon as the Treaty is approved and ratified.
I think there has been some misunderstanding about foreign policy.
This Treaty does not address that issue at all.
The Treaty states that in some cases when energy is bought from third countries, the Energy Community could apply some restrictions if these countries neglect the environment or social issues.
This provides an opportunity.
This Treaty in no way restricts the powers of the countries that participate in the Treaty to take independent foreign policy decisions.
It is very fair to look at these issues, because we cannot afford, if we want to promote sustainability, to buy energy from a third country where environmental standards are neglected and, as a result, the price of energy resources is perhaps cheaper.
So I think there has been some misunderstanding.
I really believe that this Treaty serves the interests of the region and of the European Community and I really hope that the countries that participate in this Community will benefit greatly from it.
Â Â  To end the debate, one motion for a resolution(1) has been presented, pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by James Elles, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2007 budget: the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy report (APS) [2006/2020(BUD)] (A6-0154/2006).
First on my list of speakers is MrsÂ GrybauskaitÄ, on behalf of the Commission, but, as I understand it, she would prefer the rapporteur to begin.
Are you prepared to begin, MrÂ Elles?
Â Â  . Mr President, normally it is âladies firstâ, but I am delighted to start the process, otherwise we are going to go round in circles.
With todayâs decision on the shape of the new financial perspective now behind us, we must now look ahead and formulate the broad strategy for implementation in the coming years, whatever its imperfections in terms of balance or level of expenditure allocated.
From the outset it is noticeable that the annual policy strategy treats the budget year of 2007 as one of a continuing series in the life of the Commission to implement the well-established priorities of prosperity, solidarity, security and Europe as a global partner.
We take a different view.
We do not believe that it is business as usual.
On the contrary, we see the 2007 budget as being a real opportunity to set a new strategic tone to the way in which the European Union delivers its policy agenda.
When reading the document, there is a strong sense of complacency, Madam Commissioner, a real lack of urgency about how to tackle the global economic political challenges facing the European Union.
Not least, there is no specific mention of the rapid rise of China and India in the global economy.
This will undoubtedly affect substantially both internal as well as external policies in the year ahead.
If, after all, strategies formulated at regional and local level, such as in the Thames Valley, include this factor as an urgent priority, why does the Commission choose to leave it out?
In sum, it reads rather like a routine bureaucratic document without serious political leadership or guidance.
Running through the report are three interlinked strands.
The first is the combined impact of reduced resources under the new financial perspective, and the emergence of new challenges leaves us no option but to set clear priorities in the next budget.
These priorities must be focused to reflect the new challenges lying ahead.
This is more a process during the life of the financial perspectives than simply in the 2007 budget.
In setting policy priorities for external relations, the 2007 budget must lay the groundwork for an increasingly outward-looking European Union.
