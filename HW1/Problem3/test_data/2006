This report does just the opposite.
Â Â  â Mr President, for reasons of principle, I would prefer the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, to speak first, but parliamentary order dictates otherwise.
The geo-strategic and geo-economic importance of India are self-evident.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to focus on the following: it has already been said and it is a fact that, for the European Union, India is only the fourteenth most important trading partner.
On the other hand, the European Union is India's main trading partner and the greatest source of foreign investment.
Consequently, these are important trade links, although there is still room for greater improvement, given that the volume of trade and investment has not reached its full potential.
As you know, the huge population in India creates the preconditions for a broad range and large number of potential consumers of European products.
Nonetheless, the precondition on India's side is that it needs to open up the market further and introduce economic reforms.
Indeed, it is in the common interests of the European Union and India to work to promote trade and investment, at both multilateral and bilateral level.
At multilateral level, the European Union and India need to highlight common objectives and common ground in order to bring negotiations on the Doha development programme to a successful conclusion.
For example, both sides have a common interest in protecting indications of origin.
There is also room to further increase and intensify work at bilateral level.
Customs cooperation between the European Union and India forms a good basis, as does holding a dialogue on matters such as investments and intellectual property rights.
To conclude, I should like to mention India's development policy, to which the European Union could contribute by giving priority both to the attainment of the development objectives of this country in general and to improving governance, the quality of the environment, social and economic cohesion, the social insurance system and the adoption of international working standards, as provided for by the International Labour Organisation.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking firstly as somebody who for many years has advocated intensifying our political and economic relations with the great multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy of India, and, secondly, having heard our draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Papastamkos, explain our position as a committee, to stress not just the increasing importance of our economic relations â and I recommend that you read the editorial in todayâs , which explains that Indian companies are becoming increasingly important in terms of multinational development â but also the fact that the European Parliament, together with the Interparliamentary Union, is implementing an initiative from Seattle, which we have now given concrete form, and that, from 24 to 26 November, the European Parliament is going to host an interparliamentary conference to accompany the WTO conferences.
I must point out, having chaired Parliamentâs delegation in Geneva two months ago, that we have drawn up a regulation, approved jointly by Indian, Chinese, African, Latin American and European parliamentarians, and I believe that this is an important step towards making globalisation more democratic.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to apologise for being late.
It is a good thing that we in the European Union are striving towards a strategic alliance with India in order to promote peace, security, human rights and democracy.
Our trade relations with India are also of importance.
That country is very successfully developing into an economic growth area of some stature.
In that respect, it is necessary for us to consider the implications of outsourcing European jobs to India, something that the present report rather overlooks.
Another aspect that deserves more attention is the difficult relationship between India and Pakistan.
I am not only referring to the Kashmir issue.
Pakistanâs stance towards international Muslim terrorism is â to put it mildly â ambiguous, and this must emphatically be denounced by the European Union.
The terrorists that are given shelter in Pakistan are a threat, not only to India, but also to the rest of the world, and thus also to the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I hope the Commissionâs recent communication and todayâs debate in this House will usher in a new era of relations between the EU and India.
The Lisbon strategy, commits us to achieving an economy racing along at the crazy speed of the US economy within a space of time that I regard as unrealistic.
If this strategy is to be implemented, the European Union will need the help of a partner and friend over the next few years.
Could Russia or China act as such a partner for the next 20 or 50Â years?
This appears highly improbable.
Anyone who has lived and worked in those countries and become acquainted with their policies and development plans would agree with me.
For many years, we have been receiving clear declarations from India it would like to build closer links, and that these could involve more than the economy and investment.
A willingness to forge closer political and global relations has also been expressed.
Now is an excellent time for the newly-enlarged and 450-million-strong European Union, which has been reinvigorated by an influx of new countries, to build links with the Indian economy of over a billion people.
This would create a new alliance of the kind we need.
It would bring together a quarter of the worldâs population.
It is in our interests to forge links with a country where 50% of the population is under 20 years of age, and where GDP has risen by an average of 7% for the past few years.
India is a world leader in many fields of science and industry, such as biotechnology, bioinformatics, electronics, the space industry and defence.
There remains a great deal for us to do.
There is work to be done with regard to the economy, investment, technological exchange and the building of civil society, and also with regard to the joint reconstruction of old international organisations such as the UN that do not always function as well as they should.
Whilst adopting todayâs Council statement and the recommendations made by this House, we should now think in such terms ...
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle, for the very important work he has done in his report, and I should also like to thank the Dutch Presidency, Mr NicolaÃ¯, and Commission Verheugen for their statements.
The further development of relations between the European Union and India will be of crucial importance to world peace, stability, security and development.
India is a huge democratic country in the region with a history and cultural past.
At the same time, however, it is a country of the future, which is building consistent and stable bases for its economic, social, scientific and technological development.
The European Union and the Member States have every interest in developing a new strategic alliance, a new strategic partnership with India, and this relationship will contribute to the democratisation of the international system, to the necessary global and regional balances, to the creation of a multipolar world, to the defence of peace, democracy and human rights, to the reform of the UN system and to the strengthening of its role in legitimising the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
India has a long tradition of independent and non-aligned foreign policy and of participation in UN international peacekeeping missions, such as in Cyprus, for example.
The European Union must take full advantage of this tradition.
I should like to finish by agreeing with what Commissioner Verheugen said; that we must, and that it is a major priority for the European Union to develop relations with India in particular in the areas of research, technology and the information society, where India has truly made tremendous progress, as confirmed by the thousands of Indians working in software and IT companies in Europe.
That is why the European Union must promote educational exchange and research institute programmes and immediately implement the scholarship programmes.
Â Â  Mr President, over the past few weeks, and with the EU-India Summit in the offing â it is taking place in The Hague at the beginning of November â the Dutch Human Rights ambassador has declared that the violation of the rights of 260 million outcaste Dalits is an international human rights problem.
Despite democracy and law in the worldâs largest democracy, practice is proving somewhat different.
Even though Indian law prohibits caste discrimination, it is still a fact of life.
I would call for this problem to be explicitly put on the agenda in our bilateral and multilateral trade talks and in context of the broad EU-India partnership that we have, which has been rightly championed.
In my view, positive support could help give the partnership a boost to such an extent that social isolation, child labour, exploitation and unfair trading are all addressed in one fell swoop.
In this respect, a positive agenda is being drafted, where the problems of the Dalits are being addressed and as a result of which their situation can be actively improved.
That is the platform where it should happen, but it is precisely this kind of international trade problem, linked to a real international legal problem of 260 million people, that calls for a common approach, not only in India but also in other countries.
I hope we have the courage to interpret this broader partnership in that way where this is concerned too.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will start by giving my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle.
The presidency can agree with most of the remarks and recommendations in this interesting and good report.
I also fully agree with everyone who said that it is very important to give priority to good relations with this very important country, one which is becoming more important economically, technically and politically.
Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle also mentioned the importance of UN reforms.
As everyone knows, the Council does not have a common position on the enlargement of the UN Security Council, so it is clear that the Union will not be able explicitly to state whether it will support the Indian request to become a permanent member of the Security Council.
I emphasise that the UN reforms cover much more than just the Security Council.
Possible disagreements on those reforms should not prevent us from implementing other necessary reforms in the UN.
Some Members of Parliament â Mr Ãzdemir and Mr van den Berg â mentioned the important issue of human rights.
As you know, discussing human rights within the United Nations is a sensitive issue; I am sure the European Parliament delegation which visited Kashmir last June noted that too.
Nevertheless, we will discuss the human rights issue, the situation of women and children, and other subjects, at the summit.
We have been consistent in our position that in the fight against terrorism, or any other kind of militant extremism, human rights should also be respected.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the result of the referendum and elections in Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, the political situation in Belarus is going from bad to worse.
During the parliamentary elections of 17 October 2004, very few opposition candidates were allowed to run and none of them were elected to parliament.
The referendum to allow a third presidential term is said to have been won by a large majority of votes.
The way is now open for President Lukashenko to put up his candidature for the presidential elections in 2006 and be elected for a third time, if not become president for life.
If these presidential elections are conducted the same way as the elections and referendum of 17 October, there is no doubt that he will succeed in this.
In our declaration of 20 October 2004 we clearly condemned the voting process.
We noted with great concern that the elections and referendum failed to meet the international standards for democratic elections.
The OSCE/ODIHR preliminary findings are clear about what went wrong.
The European Union is deeply disappointed that both during the election campaign and on election day there were concrete signs of the Belarussian authoritiesâ disregard for democratic rules.
The extent and character of the irregularities observed by the OSCE International Election Observation Mission raise serious doubts whether the results reflect the will of the Belarussian electorate at all.
Exit polls, which we consider to be more credible, suggest that this is not the case.
You probably all saw the subsequent pictures on television last week, of peaceful demonstrators and opposition leaders in Belarus being beaten up by police.
We are very concerned about these violent attacks.
These attacks, especially the attack on the life and health of opposition leader Lebedko, seem to have been well targeted and prepared.
We call upon the Belarussian authorities to release immediately all those who were arrested in exercising their right to free speech, as provided by the constitution of Belarus.
Needless to say, we also condemn the attacks on journalists, including Russian TV journalists, who tried to cover the demonstrations.
We are faced with a neighbouring country where one man on his own decides what is best for the population.
Opposition and independent media are repressed, democracy is a far cry.
And this is not a new situation: the situation has existed since 1996 when President Lukashenko abrogated the elected parliament, and changed the constitution to invest all the executive powers in the president, i.e. his own person.
It is not only in the interest of the Belarus people, but also in the European Unionâs interest to have democracy, respect for human rights, peace, security and prosperity in this neighbouring country.
So what can the European Union do to further developments in order to bring about a better life for the people of Belarus?
Since 1997, the European Union's relations with Belarus have been at a very low level.
In that year the EU decided not to ratify the partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus, in view of the abrogation of democracy in 1996.
All technical assistance was stopped except if promoting democracy or humanitarian aid.
After the presidential elections of 2001, when Lukashenko was re-elected, the EU decided to continue its strict policy towards the regime, but at the same time to try to continue and â if possible â to expand relations with civil society.
Unfortunately, the situation is only getting worse.
The popular support of President Lukashenko diminishes, and the regime â as a reaction â gets more and more oppressive.
So what can the EU do about it, in terms of both carrots and sticks?
Firstly, what has the EU to offer?
In order to bring about an area of peace, security and prosperity the EU has developed the European Neighbourhood Policy.
If Belarus decides to choose the path of democracy and rule of law, where the population decides on its own economic and political future, the EU is prepared to make Belarus the same offer as other neighbouring countries.
Of course we should not offer this whilst Belarus is not making any changes.
But how big is this carrot?
As prosperity in the new EU Member States neighbouring Belarus grows along with democratic stability, this may be expected to have a strong psychological effect on the people of Belarus.
This will hopefully be an irreversible process.
Assistance to civil society is already a long-standing policy of the EU.
But to bring about this support within the borders of Belarus is getting more and more difficult in practice.
The regime is doing everything to prevent western support to non-governmental organisations.
An alternative is to develop more activities for Belarus civil society outside Belarus.
The invitation of a number of opposition and civil society leaders to visit to Brussels in May is one example of this new policy.
But more can be done, in the form of participation of Belarussians in seminars, courses and studies abroad.
In the years ahead we should invest more in the Belarussian people in this way.
I am also very happy about the establishment of a separate delegation for Belarus in the European Parliament.
This will give you as parliamentarians a chance to focus more on this neighbouring country and to establish your own contacts.
I think that this step also proves to the Belarussians that the EU takes the situation in their country very seriously.
Secondly, what negative measures can the EU take?
Relations are already on a very low level.
We have had sanctions in the form of a visa ban against the Belarus leaders in the past.
Recently, we extended it to cover other high-level people.
The only area that is still left aside is the economy and trade.
Such a policy would clearly also hit the population as such, and will further isolate Belarus.
President Lukashenko would argue that the population is worse off as a result of the EUâs action, not his own policy.
Furthermore, the ordinary citizen will be worst hit.
So it is I am afraid a double-edged sword.
We have to be very careful when considering such steps.
The political developments in Belarus are of great concern not only to the EU, but also to others such as the OSCE and the US.
If we give the signals together, our voice will be better heard.
But we will also have to work together with Russia, which seems to be the only country to have some influence over Belarus.
We therefore also raised the situation in Belarus at the ministerial troika with Minister Lavrov last week.
Whilst the Russian government shares our concern about the situation, unfortunately we disagree about the way forward.
The Russians do not want to maintain the strict policy that the EU is implementing.
And that I deeply regret.
As I explained, the instruments available to the EU to influence developments are limited.
But we will continue, as the EU, as individual Member States and through the OSCE, to try to influence the situation with these instruments and bring about a real improvement of the lives of the Belarus people.
Â Â  . Mr President, the developments in Belarus are of great concern to the European Union.
The European Union has a major interest in the stability, prosperity and democracy of its neighbourhood.
It is deplorable that Belarus has not taken the opportunity of the October parliamentary elections to take positive steps towards democratic pluralism.
On the contrary, the parliamentary elections on 17 October fell significantly short of OSCE commitments for democratic elections.
The controversial referendum on the removal of the two-term limit on the office of the president failed to meet international standards.
As pointed out in the preliminary findings of the international Election Observation Mission of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the extent and the seriousness of irregularities during the electoral period and the voting day itself raise serious doubts as to whether the results of the elections fully reflect the will of the Belarussian electorate.
Freedom of expression, association and assembly were seriously challenged.
Election campaigning by the candidates was, in many ways, restricted.
The state media conducted an extensive campaign in favour of the incumbent political forces, whilst portraying the opposition in overwhelmingly negative terms.
Non-state print media had only a minor role to play.
Access to independent information sources remains limited by the fact that all nation-wide radio and television channels are state-controlled.
In the days following the elections, the negative trend in the political climate in Belarus has persisted.
Since election day, the authorities have turned, in an increasingly harsh and intolerant manner, against those citizens who have challenged the outcome of the elections and referendum in peaceful street demonstrations.
Many of those who have expressed themselves in public have been arrested or fined.
Opposition leaders and journalists have been beaten up.
It is extremely worrying that, time after time, dissident voices in Belarus are not listened to, but repressed by the authorities.
For better or for worse, Belarus is a neighbour country of the European Union, with important historical, cultural and social ties with the enlarged European Union.
We cannot be indifferent to the future of our relations with this or any other country in our immediate neighbourhood.
The European Union has developed a framework to reinforce further the relationship between the enlarged EU and its neighbours, including Belarus: the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), for which I happen to be responsible, for longer than expected.
As President Prodi has said, the aim of the ENP is to create a 'ring of friends'.
A key principle of the 'ring of friends' we are forging is joint ownership.
We cannot impose the policy on anyone, but we are ready to convince our neighbours of the benefits of the ENP.
We are offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of our relations, from political dialogue to economic integration, on the basis of commitment to common values.
This offer is also valid for Belarus.
Through the ENP, the European Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus.
If and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place, it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the ENP, with all the benefits that would bring.
Under the current conditions, however, there can be no fully-fledged ENP action plan for Belarus.
The October parliamentary elections and the referendum were an important milestone for Belarus under the ENP, but, unfortunately, Belarus failed to meet it.
However, closer relations, including relations in the framework of the ENP, are still a possibility, provided that fundamental reforms are introduced.
In the absence of fundamental reforms, one extremely important question remains: how should the democratic process in Belarus be further encouraged?
First of all, we believe in lasting engagement with the people of Belarus.
At present, a key element in EU policy towards Belarus is support for civil society and the process of democratisation.
The Commission wishes to pass a clear message to the Belarussian people, so that they know the EU has not forgotten them.
The needs of the population should be addressed by way of technical assistance.
People-to-people contacts between Belarus and the EU can be further fostered.
The European Union is aiming to raise awareness of EU policies and assistance benefiting Belarussian citizens.
I strongly believe that our new Member States in that region of Europe will help us to achieve our goals.
The Commission intends to use the assistance instruments at its disposal to continue support and assistance to civil society organisations, journalists and independent media, universities and, where appropriate, local authorities.
Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from relevant regional, cross-border and thematic programmes.
It should be mentioned, however, that the delivery of international assistance to civil society and independent media is far from easy.
In the past few years Belarus has refused to grant tax exemptions for EU assistance, in breach of earlier commitments between Belarus and the European Union.
Today, Belarus requires all foreign gratuitous aid projects to be registered by the state authorities, which allows them effectively to turn down any international assistance that they do not appreciate.
Secondly, we continue to monitor closely the state of human rights, respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the country and raise our concerns with the Belarussian Government.
Based on information submitted by European trade union confederations, the Commission has launched an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the EU will need to reconsider whether Belarus should have access to the benefits of the GSP scheme in the future.
Thirdly, it is important to take account of the long-term prospects.
In the longer term, our proximity to Belarus could and should be translated into close cooperation and exchanges in fields of common interest, such as trade, justice and home affairs, transport, energy and the environment, provided that fundamental political reforms are carried out.
The Commission wants to keep the door open for full participation in the ENP by a democratic Belarus.
I would like to conclude by underlining again that it is important that the Belarussian people â and especially those striving for democratic change â are not left out in the cold.
It is more important than ever to continue and develop our efforts to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus.
The Commission is committed to doing so.
Â Â  . Mr President, dear colleagues, if we just look at a map, we would see immediately that the expansion of the European Union offered Belarus a unique opportunity, if that opportunity itself is not only theoretical.
Both of these âifsâ are the particularly fragile props, on which we can only imagine Belarus as a bridge between the European Union and Russia.
The Belorussian bridge would be needed by all three sides, and profitable for Belarus itself.
However, first there has to exist a democratic, independent Belorussian state.
At present Belarus is a semi-dependent protectorate, ruled by an autocratic dictator, supported by Russia.
Those who believe that everything in Belarus, including the elections, depends only on Mr Lukashenko, are wrong.
When we criticise only the rulers of Belarus, we are departing from reality.
Since 1997 a Russia-Belarus union has formed, which is expanding in the direction of ever greater state amalgamation.
And so Russia's responsibility must not be ignored.
For instance MrÂ Lukashenko appointed General Ushopchik, a man wanted by the Court of Lithuania for the murder of unarmed civilians during the events in Vilnius in 1991, a Vice-Minister in today's Belorussian Government.
We hope that Lukashenko made this political provocation without instruction from Moscow's advisers.
But as for his friendship with the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, including arms trading, it is doubtful whether this could have been achieved without Moscow's approval.
It seems that the present situation is useful to Russia.
Were it not useful to Russia, the situation there would have changed long ago and the country would not be run by Lukashenko.
But the protectorate is given to none other than Lukashenko.
Not only to the country, but to the regime.
The situation will change when Russia understands that this is not the most useful scenario for Russia either.
Meanwhile an information centre on a democratic Belarus could already be operating now in Brussels, if the European Union were to help found it.
Â Â  . Mr President, six weeks ago, this Parliament urged the authorities in Belarus to call free and fair parliamentary elections on 7 October 2004 and to abandon a referendum to change the constitution.
This constitutional change would, in theory, make it possible for the current President, Mr Lukashenko, to remain in power for life.
At the time, I called this an impending constitutional .
Unfortunately, we have to conclude â and that is not the first time â that our appeal has been in vain.
No attempt has been made by the authorities to repair the damage of previous violations of the rights of opposition candidates.
Media coverage has been neither fair nor balanced, and the OSCE came to the conclusion that the parliamentary elections failed to meet international standards.
This also applied to the campaign preceding the referendum.
The outcome, a turnout of around 90%, 75% of whom voted in favour of the constitutional change, is shrouded in suspicion.
The parliament is paralysed, not one single opposition candidate having been elected to it.
Since the elections, small, but persistent, peaceful protests take place in Minsk almost every day, but absolutely all of them are violently quashed.
This situation calls for a response.
It should be made quite clear that, in the present situation, there is no room for reinforcing relations with the regime in Belarus.
It should be absolutely clear to MrÂ Lukashenko that rapprochement is out of the question as long as the regime does not commit to making efforts with a view to bringing about democratic reforms.
In those circumstances, Lukashenko will remain internationally isolated, but the force of this lever is limited.
We must also try to help bring about changes for the better in Belarus by supporting the democratic opposition forces in that country.
Last week, the American Congress adopted a Belarus Democracy Act, which takes measures to which Europe should also give consideration.
Finally, I have chaired the observation delegation during parliamentary and presidential elections in Belarus for several times now, and my frustration about the lack of change, despite all efforts on our part, is still very great.
Policy proposed by the Council and Commission receives our unqualified support, but in my view, the key to change lies with Belarusâ other neighbour, not the EU, but Russia.
I should like to urge the Council once again to take a firmer stand in talks with Moscow, for my experience has been only that, as soon as we declare the elections unlawful, a telegram would arrive from President Putin that very same day to congratulate MrÂ Lukashenko, for the umpteenth time, on successful elections.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, recent events in Belarus have mainly been observed in terms of the elections taking place in the country.
In the shadow of these elections, however, a referendum was held, aimed at amending the constitution and making it possible for MrÂ Lukashenko to remain in power in Belarus for the rest of his life.
President Lukashenko prevented observers from monitoring this referendum, which was of enormous significance for him.
It was therefore held without any kind of external checks.
Its significance was due to the increased difficulty of rigging the results.
In order for the referendum to be legally valid it was necessary not only for there to be a high turn-out, but also for over half of those entitled to vote to do so in favour of the proposals.
According to independent investigations carried out by Gallup, these requirements were not met.
There is therefore ample reason for neither this referendum nor MrÂ Lukashenkoâs right to run for re-election to the post of president to be recognised, even though no independent observers were present.
With regard to the European Unionâs policy, I believe it is worth noting that there is only a comparatively small chance of any sanctions imposed actually having an effect.
Belarus is fast heading towards self-isolation, and is turning into a country that entirely disregards the influence of other countries.
In view of this, the economic effect of such measures can also be only slight, and the impact of the promised aid and âCooperation with Belarusâ programme will doubtless remain very limited too, as PresidentÂ Lukashenko regards them as a poisoned chalice.
If this is the case, what else can be done?
The most essential action required, as already mentioned in this House, is the building of civil society.
This must be achieved not only through measures in Belarus itself, which could prove difficult, but by taking advantage of the opportunities provided by modern technology, including radio and television.
The latter could convey certain values and attitudes to Belarus, even if the transmitters are located outside Belarusâ borders, as would be the case under the proposals put forward by the United States.
Incidentally, and finally, it might be a good idea for EU actions of this kind to be synchronised and coordinated in some way with the US actions set out in recent decisions by Congress and the President.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has become apparent in this House today that progress and change can result from democratic processes.
For the people who live in Belarus, such a thing is the stuff of dreams.
We cannot fail to see that the European Union is continuing to look on while a Stalinist and dictatorial system comes into being on its doorstep, with a long list of violations of democratic and human rights, and a roll of victims that gets ever longer, day after day.
Many people in Belarus resigned themselves to this long ago.
If they can, they leave the country.
There is no hope any more.
It was only by using methods of this sort that Lukashenko was able to secure power for himself.
I am very far from satisfied with the statement by the Council and the Commission, which really has nothing new to offer.
It is not true to say that a framework is in place; the fact of the matter is that there is only a piece of paper.
There is not really a change in attitude, with a specific concentration on the situation in Belarus and consideration of which measures are feasible in order to support the opposition and civil society in that country.
None of the actual instruments make that possible; they must be changed.
That must go on the agenda now, for it is now that it is urgent, and not at some undefined time.
Let me take this opportunity to remind the House of Mr Marset Camposâ report on its behalf, which said in plain language what is now to be done.
Only if Belarus is democratic can we ensure our own security.
For that reason, I believe that we should be backing a democratic Belarus rather than playing the Russian card.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe I have had numerous opportunities to participate in the monitoring of elections in many of the Member States of the Council of Europe, including the elections in Belarus three years ago as well as those which took place in the country last week, and I am therefore in a position to make comparisons.
In this context, I agree with several of the critical observations contained in the OSCE report, for example that the political parties have had unequal access to television coverage.
I also reject the use of violence of any kind, whether perpetrated by individuals or by the state authority.
We should not, however, forget the apparent facts which proved so misleading in policy-making before the conflicts in Yugoslavia and in Iraq.
Secondly, we should bear in mind that what we say about Minsk today will hold true for Kiev tomorrow.
It is my belief, and it has already been stated before this House, that we all want Belarus to become a member of the European concert in a dignified manner.
In my opinion, the way to aid this process is not to impose isolation, but to provide help for the ordinary Belarussian people.
Belarussians should feel that the European Union is keen to see a stable and democratic neighbour on its eastern border, which respects the right to free elections.
I believe that we will achieve this not by means of resolutions alone, but also by means of concrete actions, for example by stepping up aid for people in areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, by helping resolve the issues of migration and border protection, by facilitating greater communication between students and by supporting civil initiatives.
These are all tools which may improve the situation for ordinary people, those for whom democracy is most important, in my opinion.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, there can be no doubt that human rights are violated in Belarus, that basic democratic standards are not respected in that country and that there is discrimination against minorities, primarily the Polish minority.
Furthermore, there can be no doubt that this situation is far from normal, and that it fails to meet our expectations with regard to the standards of a democratic state.
Nonetheless, we stand by the statements we made on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group at the last part-session.
As members of the League of Polish Families, we dispute the European Parliamentâs right to interfere in the foreign policy of other countries, as it is not competent to do so.
This House should concern itself with its own affairs instead of judging standards in other countries, especially ones that do not belong to the European Union, as such activities do not lie within its field of competence.
A parallel may be drawn here with Turkey, a country that has recently been the subject of much discussion.
Turkey is a country that is occupying half of Cyprus.
Turkey does not maintain diplomatic relations with Greece or Armenia.
It persecutes the Kurdish minority and has still not apologised for the genocide of the Armenian people.
In spite of all this, Turkey is regarded as a potential member of the European Union.
Belarus is a country where the persecution of minorities is not as widespread as in Turkey.
Belarus does not pursue any kind of hostile policy towards other nations and it wishes to open up its foreign policy and cooperate with other countries.
Even so, Belarus is condemned, whilst Turkey is regarded as a country that could belong to the European Union.
At the very least, we should apply similar standards to both countries.
Many thanks.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is abundantly obvious that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were conducted in a manner that violated all the principles of the rule of law and of democracy.
We all know what happened.
The events have been described to us by the Council, the Commission and individual Members of this House.
We need to be honest with ourselves, however, and admit that this is also a failure for the European Unionâs policy on Belarus so far.
Furthermore, it is an unusually vivid example of what could happen to Ukraine if we do not carry out far-reaching reforms of our neighbourhood policy towards the latter.
The history of Belarus since 1996 is an extremely alarming example of what could happen in this region, above all in Ukraine.
What action can now be taken?
Above all, major changes are needed.
Firstly, we should not recognise the results of either the elections or the referendum.
Indeed, none of the EU Member States should do so.
Secondly, we must extend the list of people whom we do not wish to see in EU Member States to include members of the Belarussian authorities.
Thirdly, this issue must be raised at summits held between the European Union and Russia.
Russia has recognised the results of the elections, and exercises political patronage over this political experiment in the heart of Europe.
It is also vital to invest in society, and we must make major investments in civil society.
In order to do so, I believe a separate fund to support freedom and democracy is needed.
We must have the courage and sufficient funding to set up an independent radio station broadcasting to Belarussians.
The Belarussian intelligentsia is currently stifled in its own country.
We must have sufficient funding to enable these individuals to study throughout Europe and to build a future for their country whenever such an opportunity arises, and whenever Belarus regains its independence.
This will be an investment in our common European future, a future in which I believe deeply.
If we do not make this investment, the United States will.
In so doing, it will gain the good will of yet another country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Personally, I would be very glad to see this happen, but I know many European politicians would not welcome such a development.
Many thanks.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on 17 October, the Belarussian voters went to the polls to vote in a referendum on a change to their constitution and to elect their Members of Parliament.
The turn-out was huge, and the constitutional change was approved by 77% of the electorate.
We should be very pleased about this awakening of democratic awareness and about the broad popular turn-out.
A number of people, such as the Vice-President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, believe themselves, however, authorised to take Belarus to task.
Some of the accusations voiced have been hypocritical and demagogic, especially those made by governments that, before lecturing others, should put their own houses in order.
Will the German people be consulted about the European Constitution?
No.
MrÂ Chirac will reach a decision on behalf of France concerning Turkeyâs accession to Europe and do so against the obvious will of the French people.
These accusations are, moreover, ill-considered. Rather than demonise a nation that has only been independent for 12 years, we should be very pleased about the progress it has accomplished on the road to democracy and not interfere in such an arrogant and moralistic way in its internal affairs.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, there can be no doubt that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were conducted in an undemocratic manner, that they were not free, and that they were not honest.
If MrÂ MaÅ¡tÃ¡lka and MrÂ Lang cannot see this, it is because they do not wish to do so.
I was a member of the observation mission sent to monitor the elections, and I saw for myself the way in which they were conducted.
The electoral procedure did not ensure that the election or referendum were democratic, and what is more, electoral practices frequently did not comply with this procedure.
We should draw two very important conclusions from this.
Firstly, the Belarussian Parliament has no democratic mandate to represent the Belarussian people.
Secondly, and this is something frequently overlooked, PresidentÂ Lukashenko has no democratic mandate to run for president in 2006, that is, to run for a third term of office and maybe even for subsequent ones.
The first conclusion is contained in the resolution I hope this House will adopt with an overwhelming majority of votes.
The second can be found in the amendments.
What action should be taken?
It has already been said that our policy on Belarus must be reconsidered.
One extremely important principle was referred to in both the Presidency and the Commission statements, namely the principle of support for society.
Our European policy on Belarus should be guided by the principle of supporting society and isolating the authorities, and this principle should remain in place until the authorities become democratic.
Alternative sources of information for the Belarussian people must be created.
A radio station broadcasting from Poland or Latvia should be established first, followed by a television channel.
Secondly, an extensive programme of scholarships should be set up for Belarussian young people and students who wish to study in one of the EU Member States, as well as a programme to support universities willing to accept them.
Finally, it is extremely important for there to be a unilateral abolition by EU Member States of visas and visa fees for Belarussians, a point which has not yet been raised in this House.
This would be a very significant gesture, demonstrating that the European Union is open to the Belarussian people.
Â Â  Mr President, dear colleagues.
Ten days ago in Belarus steps were taken which have distanced the country even more from democratic Europe.
And Belarus has already been a neighbour of the EU for half a year.
It is one thing for us to be more or less tolerant of a regime turning into an autocracy because it is far away, it is something altogether different, when a state, whose borders are barely thirty kilometres from Vilnius, one of the capitals of the EU States, is becoming unpredictable.
Ties with Russia, where anti-European moods are spreading, and where some of the gains of democracy are being removed, are becoming stronger and this has a certain influence on Minsk.
While supporting the position of the Council, I also believe that in the time left before the 2006 presidential elections it is necessary to adjust in principle EU policy on Belarus, to adapt it to new conditions.
It is doubtful whether measures, which partially support the efforts of Belarus' rulers to isolate themselves, the country and its inhabitants, are effective.
Generally speaking in the age of television, computers and information, self-isolation can only be successful over a historically short period of time.
We must draw Belorussians into true cooperation with the European Union, offer the hope of being a fully entitled democratic part of Europe.
Lithuania and Belarus' other neighbours have specific plans. These include the broadcasting of a free radio programme, the publishing of an opposition newspaper and the foundation of a European University of the Humanities in exile.
Additional EU funding is needed in order to implement these ideas.
Note that after 17 October, not double, but ten times more resources are needed for the creation of a civil society in Belarus.
Â Â  â Mr President, the elections and referenda in Belarus were held under acute pressure and intolerable interference, primarily on the part of the United States of America, which put into operation the so-called 'Act of 2004', allegedly for democracy in Belarus.
NATO delegates also suddenly discovered a link between Belarus and international terrorism.
The European Union followed a similar tack.
The statement by the Dutch Presidency and the Commission on the results of the elections are, in our opinion, yet more pressure on and coercion of the government of Belarus.
They violate international law and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of another state.
The allegations both on the part of the European Union and on the part of the United States of America about alleged violations of democratic rights are hypocritical.
The real reason, as we all know, for such intense intervention is the refusal by Belarus to yield to ÎÎÎ€Î and the other imperialist organisations.
The reports by the various western observers cannot be reliable, because they serve political expediencies, or should I say they are to order.
Moreover, there are other reports, by Russia, China and the Commonwealth of Independent States, which are different.
In our opinion, the people of Belarus alone have the authority and responsibility to decide on their future, which is why we denounce and condemn such pressure and interference.
No one gives you the right, gentlemen of the Commission, gentlemen of the Council, to teach and export democracy to other countries.
The people alone have the authority to resolve their problems.
Obviously, of course, both the European Union and the United States of America would express their satisfaction if the elections had been held as in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Kosovo or in Bosnia, which are under occupation, which have been turned into protectorates and in which, of course, in your opinion ...
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has given much attention to Sudan, and rightly so.
Yet we have maybe paid too little attention to Belarus and the East, given that MrÂ Lukashenko and the Belarussian authorities pay no heed to the European Unionâs position.
The reason for this may be that our demands for the protection of human rights and democracy in Belarus have to date been voiced in a mere whisper.
It is not a whisper that is needed, however.
We need to make ourselves heard in a loud and firm voice, maybe even shout sometimes.
That is what is required to protect national minorities in Belarus, including the large Polish minority, for example.
After all, we are not talking about a distant African or Asian country where a local tyrant is violating democracy.
We are talking about the European Unionâs closest neighbour, which is situated closer to Strasbourg or Brussels than some regions in a number of EU Member States.
Are freedom of the media and freedom of elections, things that are the daily bread of Europeans, to be foreign words in Belarus?
The short answer to this is ânoâ.
We need to do more than merely discuss this issue.
It is time to take action.
We should boycott MrÂ Lukashenko, but we should not boycott the Belarussian people, organisations and youth.
Â Â  Mr President, on 19 October the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that the elections in Belarus on 17 October fell well short of democratic standards â they were not free and fair â and I fully support the Commission's conclusions.
In addition, it has been said that Belarus can forget about the neighbourhood policy; instead, sanctions are in the offing, as the EU has a history of being willing to respond with sanctions to violations against democracy and human rights.
A week later, the opposite view was announced by the Russian Parliament, which declared that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were fair, free, democratic and legitimate.
Only eight members of the Russian Duma voted against, while 416 were in favour.
Our conclusion should be clear: the Russian Parliament has distanced itself from all democratic parliaments in the world and has also proved that the last dictator in Europe has the full backing of the Russian Duma, controlled by political forces closely linked to President Putin.
Almost at the same time, another document â the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 â was signed by the American President.
This is a clear commitment to support those in Belarus who are working towards democracy: students, trade unionists, civic and religious leaders, journalists and all citizens of Belarus claiming freedom for their nation.
This document provides for USD 45 million to be used to strengthen democracy in Belarus.
What then should and could the European Union â and we, the European Parliament in particular â do?
A month ago here in Strasbourg I spoke about the radio for good neighbourhood project for international broadcasting to Belarus.
This aims to renew cross-border broadcasting to Belarus in one radio channel, using the data resources of Radyjo Ratsyya from Belarus and the high-powered broadcasting licence of Radio Baltic Waves from Vilnius, Lithuania.
The support of Commissioner Verheugen and my colleagues from this Parliament is necessary to implement this idea.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much agree with all those who made critical remarks about the situation and expressed concern about developments.
I also agree with those who said it is important to try to find ways to improve the situation, especially by direct contact with civil society.
I will reply on one issue, which was mentioned by Mr Wiersma, MrÂ SzymaÅski, MrsÂ AndrikienÄ and others: namely Russia and the role that we and Russia could play.
We regularly discuss with Russia the situation in Belarus.
It is an important country for Russia and for the EU.
Unfortunately, the Russian and EU approaches to improving the situation in Belarus differ.
Russia understands EU concern about the human rights situation in general and about more specific issues such as the situation of the media and the closure of the European Humanities University.
However, the Russians think that democratic change can best be promoted by involving Belarus more in the international community.
As I tried to explain before, our approaches are really different, but you can be sure that where possible we are working with Russia on this important issue and trying to do what we can.
Â Â  â At the end of the debate I received six motions for a resolution(1).
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Â Â  â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the forthcoming elections in Ukraine.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you the situation in Ukraine before the presidential elections, and the state of relations between the European Union and Ukraine.
The Ukrainian people stand at the crossroads of very important presidential elections.
These elections will determine the direction Ukraine will take over the next four years.
At this important time, the European Union has four clear messages for the Ukrainian people.
The first message is simple: the EU is following the developments in Ukraine very closely.
Since we are neighbours, we know we matter to each other.
However, this does not mean that we always think the same way.
In fact, certain developments within Ukraine are followed with a certain degree of concern by the EU.
Ukraineâs track record in the areas of democratisation, human rights, upholding the rule of law, and the reform process, is mixed at best.
To give just a few examples, there still remain questions about the disappearance of a Ukrainian journalist, the current process of constitutional reform and the virtual absence of a pluralist media.
The EU regularly conveys its concerns to the Ukrainian authorities, for example during the recent EU-Ukraine summit, but also during other political dialogue meetings and through our embassies in Kiev.
We are therefore following very closely and with particular attention the electoral campaign in Ukraine in the run-up to the elections on 31 October.
We are pleased that Ukraine has generously provided invitations for international monitoring of the elections by ODIHR.
Many EU Member States will send observers and the ODIHR findings will be a very important reference point for the EU.
But we already have some concerns about the electoral process.
I will give a few examples.
There are clear indications that there is a biased media coverage.
As you all know, it is essential to provide all political candidates with equal access to the media.
Direct pressure on independent media has been growing in Ukraine, making it extremely difficult for the electoral process to be covered by a pluralistic and independent mass media.
Only independent and free media coverage of the electoral process can ensure free, fair and transparent elections.
Furthermore, there are reports of political pressure against voters, coercing them to take part in rallies and campaign events.
Other reports mention administrative harassment of the opposition, use of administrative resources to obstruct presidential candidates from campaigning by depriving them of campaign materials, the use of state money, property and equipment for campaign purposes, and so on. We hope that these incidents will not threaten a credible and democratic election outcome.
The Ukrainian Government has to ensure this.
As I said, we appreciate the Ukrainian invitation to monitor the election campaign and the elections, but foreign observers alone are not enough.
These are Ukrainian elections, for the Ukrainian people, needing Ukrainian observers.
We regret, therefore, that independent, non-partisan observers are not allowed to monitor the presidential elections as well.
We have communicated this message to the Ukrainian Government through our Council conclusions and through the declarations of an earlier presidency.
We have also used our various high-level contacts to get this message across.
And the Council will remain active, not just during the first round of elections, but also at the possible second round later in November.
We hope that this message will convince the Ukrainian Government to respect democratic norms more strictly.
There should be no manipulation of the election process to the advantage of one particular candidate and to the detriment of others.
Free and fair elections and respect of democratic standards are essential if Ukraine really wants a rapprochement with the EU.
The second message we have for the Ukrainian people is closely linked to the first one: Ukraine matters to the EU and vice versa, especially since enlargement.
Several of the new Member States of the EU have strong economic, cultural and historical ties to Ukraine.
Since enlargement, Ukraine is now a direct neighbour of the EU.
The enlargement process has increased the importance of Ukraine to the EU.
Moreover, the knowledge which the new Member States have enables the EU to conduct a more active and effective policy.
But our relationship is not just about economics, culture and history.
Ukraine is also an important political actor.
Its close relationship with Russia and its role in the UN, illustrated by numerous Ukrainian contributions to peace-keeping operations, are clear proof.
Our cooperation, therefore, in the area of foreign policy should be developed further.
ESDP is one area, and the fact that a framework agreement for Ukraine's participation in EU crisis management operations will be signed soon is testimony to this.
This brings me to the third message.
The EU has the right instruments to conduct an effective policy towards Ukraine and intensify our relationship.
First and foremost there is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which comes with ministerial troikas, political dialogues and numerous expert-level working groups.
The PCA will remain the cornerstone of EU-Ukraine cooperation.
Furthermore, I hope that we will soon be able to adopt the action plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy.
This action plan is an EU-Ukraine co-production and it will offer concrete objectives for the coming years.
As President Kuchma stated at the last EU-Ukraine Summit, we need to commit ourselves to implementing what should be a plan of action and not merely a plan of intention.
And the EU is committed to working on this in close cooperation with any candidate who wins in free, fair and transparent elections.
Finally, our fourth message: EU-Ukraine cooperation will not always be easy, but it is in our mutual interests that the long-term trend is uphill, not downhill.
If one listens to the comments and opinions of opinion-makers and politicians, both in the EU and in Ukraine, one often gets the impression that the EU-Ukraine relationship is sub-optimal at best.
Ukraine wants the EU to offer more: the prospect of EU membership, better treatment in the area of free movement, etc. And some say that if the EU does not do more for Ukraine, Kiev will automatically drift into the arms of Moscow.
The single economic area is often quoted as evidence that this is already happening.
Furthermore, the conduct of the upcoming presidential elections could possibly cast a shadow on our relations.
Here lies a task for the Ukrainian Government and its people.
But I believe that, even though our cooperation may sometimes be difficult, the long-term trend will be positive.
The trend simply is not towards isolationism one, but towards integration.
On 14 September the Ukrainian Parliament held a debate on EU-Ukraine relations.
At that meeting a large majority of the parliamentarians supported EU integration.
The joint action plan will be testimony of our own desire to enhance the quality of our relationship.
I would like to conclude that it is time for the Ukrainian people to make a choice.
Our message is clear, both on the elections and on the future of EU-Ukraine relations.
Election time is always hard and we wish the Ukrainian people every wisdom.
We hope they make the right choice: a choice for democracy and development, for justice and for the rule of law.
And let us hope the circumstances will be such that they can make that choice.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to point out the enormous importance of Ukraine as a strategic partner of the European Union.
Ukraine, being one of our immediate neighbours, with which we have close economic, social and human ties, is very particularly significant in terms of the long-term stability, security and prosperity of our European continent.
Ukraine is an important partner in establishing security and stability throughout the region; there is no doubt that it shares in our European culture and in our common history.
In its November 2003 resolution on the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Parliament reaffirmed that Ukraine â like any other European state with a democratic constitution and a market economy â should have the option of, one day, applying for membership of the European Union, subject to its fulfilling the relevant conditions.
This is not, at present, on our agenda, but my staff and I have nonetheless, over the past months, devised a medium-term and concrete perspective for the enlarged European Unionâs neighbours â the European Neighbourhood Policy to which Mr NicolaÃ¯ has already referred.
Liasing closely with the Ukrainian Government, we have devised a concrete and tailor-made action plan, which I will shortly be submitting to the Commission and, immediately thereafter, also to the Council and to Parliament.
Mr NicolaÃ¯ has already referred to the many vital and new things that are on offer to Ukraine and to its people through the Neighbourhood Policy.
We should not forget that we have cooperated to a significantly greater extent with Ukraine over recent years, especially since the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement entered into force in 1998.
Dialogue is being cultivated in a variety of ways, including an annual summit.
The European Parliament also, under our Partnership Agreement, has developed its own framework for in-depth dialogue with the Ukrainian Parliament.
It gives me great pleasure that the new chairman of your Houseâs delegation to Ukraine, Mr Siwiec, is from Poland, one of Ukraineâs immediate neighbours.
Although open and frank dialogue between partners ought to be the most obvious thing in the world, it is rather remarkable that the Ukrainian presidential elections scheduled for the coming weekend have shown themselves to be â to put it mildly â deserving of criticism to a significant degree.
I can, unfortunately, do no other than concur wholeheartedly with Mr NicolaÃ¯âs expressions of the gravest concern at the omissions and irregularities apparent in the election campaign, especially as regards the freedom of the media.
I do not want the Members of this House to misunderstand me; this has only a very tenuous connection with the debate we have just had on Belarus.
There is no doubt whatever of the progress Ukraine has made towards becoming a democratically constituted state, and, when it is borne in mind that the states that succeeded the former Soviet Union found this road a particularly long one, credit should be given for that.
Real political parties are coming into being.
Civil society is taking shape, and a whole array of non-governmental organisations are becoming vigorously active.
Regulations and mechanisms intended to guarantee due legal and democratic process have been drawn up and reformed in close cooperation with the Council of Europe and the OSCE, in which the support of the European Commission has been crucial.
Still to this day, though, it is a regrettable fact that, in Ukraine, many of these ground rules of democracy and the rule of law exist only on paper.
This is probably the fundamental truth that emerges from the present situation, as that country is preparing to go to the polls.
It is a fact that what we can see going on there now is an election campaign with virtually no holds barred.
We can of course see that as a positive sign, an indication of political competition, but it can also be seen as evidence that there is much still to be desired as regards political culture.
We should not forget, though, that there is a significant difference in comparison with other states in the region.
Whatever else might be said about it, the present election campaign in Ukraine is a real one, with several genuine and competing candidates.
I would also like to make it clear to you, though, that we cannot lower our standards for adherence to shared values and democratic principles, on which depends the implementation of our European Neighbourhood Policy action plan for the future â which is a very ambitious one.
It is not acceptable that authorities and other state bodies should interfere in elections at various levels and in all manner of different ways.
Nor is it acceptable that not only opposition politicians, but also independent civil society initiatives should be subject to increasingly repressive measures.
The first preliminary reports by the observers sent by the OSCEâs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights paint a somewhat gloomy picture of only partly objective reporting on the part of the national electronic media.
Critical and sceptical I may be, but I remain confident that the presence of election observers can help the elections to proceed in a democratic and legitimate manner.
The European Union has mounted a number of projects in order to try to help the Central Election Commission, non-governmental organisations and journalists to play their parts in the election process.
It is cause for gratitude that the European Parliament, like the EUâs Member States and the Commission, is sending observers to participate in the OSCEâs International Election Observation Mission.
Those who are then to report to us from Ukraine will have very great responsibilities, for much of what we do in Ukraine in the future will depend on what they have to say.
There is no doubt that the election represents a crucial test for democracy in Ukraine.
We in this place should appeal to the state authorities, to the media, to the political parties and, not least, to the candidates, to allow the remaining days of the campaign leading up to the election to be characterised by democracy, the rule of law and fairness, which are absolute requirements.
While the Commission is indeed prepared to promptly implement, under the New Neighbourhood Policy, the closer cooperation with the new President that we seek, it is not in the least irrelevant to us how this election is won.
Let me conclude by repeating that the closer partnership with Ukraine that we want is dependent on its commitment to common values and democratic principles and a determined and unambiguous policy of allowing these values and principles to be realised in day-to-day political life.
Â Â  . Mr President, the election schedule for this Sunday is critical for the future of Ukraine.
Unlike other former Soviet countries, the outcome is still genuinely uncertain and contrasts markedly with the election two weeks ago in Belarus, where a massive fraud was perpetrated on the people of that country.
Nevertheless, so far in the campaign, there have been widespread allegations of bias by the authorities against the opposition front-runner, Mr Yushchenko, ranging from the use of administrative resources dedicated to backing the incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych as a presidential candidate, to bizarre allegations of KGB-style poisoning with ricin.
Of more concern has been the harassment of opposition print media and impeded access to state and private TV coverage.
There are also allegations that there have been numerous paper or technical candidates submitted by backers of MrÂ Yanukovych in order to distort the composition of the local election committees.
In fairness, such tactics occur everywhere, are legal, and the government of Ukraine would have faced Lukashenka-style criticism if these candidates had been rejected.
There are also concerns that the polling stations set up in the Russian Federation will be very hard to monitor independently.
Also, I was personally concerned to hear last weekend that two serving policemen were found to be part of the mob that physically attacked a pro-Yushchenko rally.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the government of Ukraine's invitation for me to attend â with six other MEPs â as an observer in Kiev.
I call for restraint from any action to distort the true will of the people to elect a president of their choosing.
Ukraine now has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitments to free, fair and transparent elections as part of the European community of nations, where it truly belongs.
Â Â  . Mr President, Ukraine occupies a central position in the EUâs Neighbourhood Policy on account of its location â between the European Union and Russia â its size and its historical link with our part of Europe.
Democratisation in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges for the Neighbourhood Policy, which aims to build up relations with the countries surrounding the European Union.
Needless to say, the developments in Ukraine are also an important indicator of that Policyâs success.
The presidential elections on 31 October and the second round a few weeks after that play a central role in those developments.
In simplified terms, the choice is between the present course of a semi-democratic regime on the one hand and the European course of the democratic opposition on the other.
The government, President Kuchma, with the oligarchs supporting him behind the scenes, and the Russian President Putin who yesterday started a visit to the Ukraine lasting several days, support their own candidate, Prime Minister Yanukovych.
Despite a number of official reforms, the latter does not have a good reputation as regards freedom of the press, freedom of opinion and the guaranteeing of an open and fair democratic process.
In the run-up to the elections, countless incidents have been reported, including, as the most striking of all, the mysterious illness of the most important opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko.
We have grave concerns about this.
Nevertheless, as Commissioner Verheugen already stated, we welcome the fact that there is a true election battle being fought in that country, and we also hope that those campaigns persist.
Despite this, it remains to be seen whether the elections will receive the full approval of the international observers, our own and that of the OSCE.
I endorse Commissioner Verheugenâs appeal to those observers, urging them to take their weighty responsibilities very seriously indeed.
After all, the declarations that are made at the end of such an election often have a significant impact on relations between the European Union and the relevant country.
We would therefore urge the Ukrainian authorities, in the last days before the first round of those presidential elections, to ensure that all candidates have equal access to the media, to repair what damage can be repaired and to commit to a fair campaign in the second round â which will, of course, be the most important â so that the Ukrainian population can make up their own minds.
Ukraine has expressed a desire for still closer cooperation with the European institutions, and for stronger relations with the European Union.
The ties with the European Union can be strengthened only if Ukraine demonstrates that it takes its own democracy seriously, because a disruption in the democratic process in those elections could greatly encumber relations between the European Union and Ukraine.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, there have already been many occasions on which this House has heard of various violations of the principles governing the conduct of election campaigns.
I would, however, like to draw your attention to several new and, in my opinion, novel aspects that have emerged during this particular campaign.
The first of these is the appearance of fictional candidates in lists of candidates.
Twenty-three candidates are running for president of Ukraine, but in reality only a few are genuinely doing so.
Most of the others are registered in exactly the same way, but their participation in the election campaign is limited to a statement that although they are standing for election, the better candidate is in fact someone quite other.
In addition, their representatives in electoral committees are in practice representatives of an entirely different candidate.
The second aspect which has recently become apparent, and which could pose a risk, although the risk may have abated somewhat at present, is the large number of electoral constituencies outside Ukraine.
These have been set up because of the large Ukrainian minority living in Russia.
According to statistics, this minority numbers several million.
The electoral constituencies on Russian territory will be exclusively under the control of candidates, at least officially.
They will be beyond any kind of international control, and the number of votes cast there could influence the outcome of the election.
Finally, there is a third aspect to this electoral campaign, namely Russiaâs very strong support for one of the candidates.
Russia reacts sharply with accusations of interference in the affairs of other countries to any criticism of the way in which the electoral campaign in Belarus and in other countries is conducted, for example, yet in the case at hand it has absolutely no inhibitions.
An additional threat emerging is that the situation might be resolved by force.
I recently returned from a visit to Ukraine, during which I met a number of people, and concerns of this nature are frequently voiced in the country.
We need to be aware that such a threat could emerge.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen that, in contrast to the situation in the neighbouring country of Belarus, the presidential elections in Ukraine will involve a genuinely exciting neck-and-neck race between two strong personalities.
It really is a decision for the Ukrainian people.
Yet, as many other Members of this House have noted before me, we await this weekend and this electoral process with concern, as it is becoming apparent that the campaign is being fought on unfair terms, and with no holds barred.
President Kuchma is cracking the whip for his preferred candidate, and forcing state officials and television channels into line to support him.
We support Mr Wiersma in his call for an end to be put to this and for a fair electoral process to be given a chance.
I concur with the Presidencyâs demands and share its regret that local election observers could not be deployed, as during the last elections this proved to be a key factor in ensuring that the public viewed the elections as democratic.
An extremely high turnout has made clear the countryâs potential as a democracy , and it is therefore crucial that measures are taken to prevent any undesirable developments, as well as to ensure that these elections are conducted in a genuinely democratic fashion.
I have confidence in the people of Ukraine, but I also call on the Presidency and the Commission to ensure that support for democratic structures and, above all, for civil society is accorded a central role in the action plan, and is given higher priority than economic development, as the development of democracy in Ukraine still stands on shaky ground, and must be consolidated.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Ukraine plays an enormously important role for the EUâs Member States.
It has a common border with three of them, which of course gives rise to social and economic links, and, when overall relations with it are considered, it also wields powerful influence.
In addition, it plays a significant role in relation to Moldova, a country where Ukraineâs involvement is necessary.
Having spent six years of my life in Ukraine and having known the country for over 30 years, I can tell you that it is currently following a path which leads quite clearly to democracy.
We should be rather more restrained in our demands for tremendous speed and transformation, as some things simply take time.
As previous speakers have observed, it is of course the case that some doubts always remain; for example, Russiaâs support for a certain candidate can be said to present a problem.
Yet a problem is also presented by MrÂ Blairâs support for MrÂ Bush in the USA.
It is nothing new for there to be talk of checking certain votes cast by voters living abroad; indeed, a large number of Americans are allowed to vote in Germany.
It is always assumed in advance that there is an enormous risk that the democratic rules of play will not be adhered to in certain countries, whereas no such assumptions are made in the case of others.
We are all aware as well that in the last presidential elections in Florida there were heated disputes over popular votes.
We should have confidence in Ukraine.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, Commissioner, the first-round election campaign in Ukraine is drawing to a close.
Several international organisations have voiced a great many reservations about the way the campaign was conducted, a fact noted in key comments by previous speakers.
It cannot be said that the situation in Ukraine is similar to that in Belarus.
That would be a step too far.
There is, however, something both countries have in common, namely Russiaâs strategic interest.
In the course of the electoral campaign in Ukraine, this interest was very apparent at the Sochi summit on 26Â July of this year and during PresidentÂ Putinâs later visit.
We know Russia is interested in maintaining a particular political configuration in Ukraine.
The candidate who represents this configuration is the current President, MrÂ Yanukovich.
He enjoys far superior access to the media and more opportunities to communicate with his voters.
It is important for us to hold talks on issues relating to Ukraine with Russia, a key partner in such matters, and these talks should be placed on the agenda both of meetings held in the framework of the PCA and those held during the EU-Russia summit.
In addition, I should like to make a few comments on MrÂ Verheugenâs statement.
It is true that Ukraine does not yet fully meet the criteria of a democratic state, but we know that membership of the EU is the best incentive for it to fulfil these criteria.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Ukraine, a country where presidential elections are shortly to be held, currently has two development routes open to it.
One is the European route and the other the sub-Soviet route.
The first involves democratic standards, the rule of law, a market economy and accelerated political integration into the structures of the European Union.
The second involves the risk of the present political and economic model becoming entrenched.
What measures can we take to increase the likelihood that the first route will be taken, and not the second?
There is indeed little we can do, but we do have some options currently open to us.
It would be possible for us to monitor the voting closely and also the electoral campaign between the first and second rounds of voting in the presidential elections, as the campaign during this period will be at its most dramatic.
In addition, of course, we need to react.
Following the presidential elections, this House should adopt a resolution, and later a report, containing details of what needs to be changed in the EUâs policy on Ukraine.
Secondly, we should be prepared to postpone the adoption of an action plan for Ukraine by the European Union, or more specifically by the Commission.
The fact that the European Commission did not approve the action plan yesterday is to be welcomed, because a victory for Yushchenko would enable us to take more action, to make Ukraine more generous offers and to take measures to support democratic change in the country.
A victory for Yanukovich, in turn, would enable us to adopt the action plan in its current version, and to observe the measures taken by the new president, if this turns out to be Yanukovich, in the first days after his electoral victory.
If Yushchenko wins, we must be prepared to free up large amounts of additional funding to support the transformation of Ukraine, and we should send out a clear message now that we are prepared to do so.
After the elections we should promptly organise a donorsâ conference, similar to the conference in Georgia, or rather on behalf of Georgia, which made it possible for the European Union to take steps to support the transformation of this country.
It is vital to bear in mind that a strong, democratic and independent Ukraine is essential to the stability of Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ Verheugen has given us a good description of events in Ukraine, as he avoided speaking in black and white terms, resorting instead to shades of grey.
We have a tendency to perceive everything positively, like the Ukrainian authorities, or negatively, like the opposition.
Everything appears to be either good or bad.
In Ukraine, however, everything is either partly good or partly bad.
I will act as chairman of Parliamentâs observation mission, and I can assure you that the message we are taking to Ukraine is a positive one.
We wish to assist Ukrainians to build democracy and respect certain principles.
We are not going there with the intention of supporting anyone.
We are going to observe the conduct of the elections.
The aim of our visit is to bring European standards to the Ukrainian public.
It should be borne in mind that the elections in Ukraine will not be the catalyst for a revolution.
The mood among the Ukrainian public is not one of expectancy that revolutionary changes will occur.
I do not believe that MrÂ Yushchenko will introduce revolutionary changes if he wins, nor that MrÂ Yanukovich will become an of PresidentÂ Kuchma if he does.
We need to ask ourselves what contemporary Ukraine is actually like.
How does it differ from other countries of the former Soviet Union?
Speakers in this House have said that a genuine political battle is being fought, and indeed where else is a genuine political battle being fought in this region?
A month before the elections in Ukraine we do not know who will be President.
In the case of the Russian elections, however, it was a foregone conclusion.
The existence of any genuine opposition and any genuine alternative at all in Ukraine is an achievement of the past few years.
It is also an achievement for the European Union and the countries that supported the opposition.
We should not forget, however, that even the victory of an opposition representative would not mean that relations with the European Union could be scaled down.
It would simply pose new challenges.
Russiaâs unprecedented influence is an aspect that must not be overlooked, as this is the first time the latter has exerted its influence on such a scale.
We must be patient and consistent in our relations with Ukraine, and for this we also need time.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, when I listen to the comments made by MrÂ Verheugen and by representatives of Western Europe on the subject of Ukraine, I have the curious impression that none of you appreciate the reality of the country we are talking about.
This is a country that achieved independence a mere 12Â years ago.
It was under some form of occupation or another for centuries.
For centuries too, efforts were made to stamp out the Ukrainian language.
It would be impossible for such a country to get back on its feet and become both democratic and European in the Western sense of the word within 12Â years.
After all, your own countries took centuries to do so.
This is something that simply has to be taken on board.
I therefore believe that the European Union cannot afford to act merely as a passive observer of events in this country, a country that lies on the European Unionâs eastern border and has a population of 50Â million.
It simply cannot afford to do so.
Regardless of the outcome of the elections, a clearly defined programme is required.
This needs to be a programme to support pro-European forces, pro-democratic forces and democratic processes in Ukraine.
It should be targeted at young people, and designed to strengthen the economic dimension and economic progress.
It must also be allocated the appropriate funding.
I hope the European Union will put forward proposals for such a programme.
As MrsÂ Schroedter said, it must be targeted primarily at the citizens, not at the Ukrainian authorities.
We all need a programme of this kind.
There is nothing worse than someone who looks on indifferently as a small, weak child fails to cope with a difficult situation.
I believe we should take more concerted action.
It is true that the elections will not be fully democratic, but we should not make future aid dependent on elections and election results.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, caught as it is between two newsworthy events â the parliamentary elections in Belarus and the US presidential election â the election in Ukraine is nevertheless no less important for Europe and the whole world, although this neighbouring country is more democratic than Belarus, of course, and less influential than the United States of America.
Thanks to the members of the European Parliament from the new Member States, and their knowledge and experience of these questions, issues connected with Ukraine have been given special attention even in these first few months of Parliamentâs work, emphasising the importance of this new European neighbour state as a strategic partner.
In the last few years, a great and powerful democratic opposition has formed in Ukraine, but we can see negative tendencies in the field of media freedom and exploitation of the whole administrative machinery in the hands of the ruling elite.
These tendencies pose a threat to the process of democratisation and the fairness of the presidential election.
The election law is legally correct, but compliance with it is compulsory only for the opposition.
What is most alarming, however, is the attitude of the people themselves: everyone knows what is going on, but there are so many violations that society has become accustomed to them, and there are only a few people who think that such a way of doing things is unlawful.
What is more, the population is being brainwashed with advertising financed by the oligarchsâ millions.
The election law does indeed provide for a ceiling on campaign expenditure, but there is no real control of candidatesâ funding and political party finances.
The result of this election must be clearly and effectively reflected in the decisions of the European Union, not merely of censure or support, but also with respect to concrete strategic and financial issues.
Currently an action plan is being developed between the European Union and Ukraine within the framework of our new neighbouring country policy.
As a member of the European Parliament, I am in favour of refining the content of the document and signing it only once the election is over, once it is perfectly clear whether the Ukrainian presidential election has been democratic and whether the new government is being formed by democratic methods.
We all need neighbours who are democratic and free of corruption, so that entrepreneurs can earn greater profits in a freely competitive environment, and our people can sleep more soundly, in the knowledge that Ukraine has not put on the snarling bearskin of its big Russian neighbour.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, is Europe aware of what is happening in Ukraine?
The media launch constant attacks on the opposition candidate, MrÂ Yushchenko, who is not allowed to appear on state radio and television.
Rallies held by the opposition are disrupted by hecklers and journalists are intimidated.
That is not the worst of it, however.
The young Ukrainian democracy would be able to cope with such trials, but it cannot cope if those seeking to destroy it receive support from outside, namely from Russia.
PresidentÂ Putin is quite clearly backing MrÂ Yanukovich.
His current visit to Kiev, during the final days of the election campaign, is an obvious interference in Ukraineâs domestic affairs.
It is reminiscent of a Tsarâs visit to a subordinate province.
In addition, the announcement that 45 electoral committees are to be set up for Ukrainians living in Russia casts doubt on the credibility of the election results.
Yet Ukraine is no exception.
Russia also remains indifferent to the Belarussian regimeâs brutal violations of democracy, as well as to the repeated calls by this House and by the Council of Europe to search for political solutions to the bloody conflict in Chechnya.
Poland has always shown staunch support for Ukraineâs ambitions to join the Western community of European nations, and will continue to do so.
The simple truth is that Ukraine is a state of strategic importance for Western Europe, both from an economic and security point of view and in terms of geopolitical balance in Europe.
If the European Commission has no doubts as to the legitimacy of recommending Turkey, a âyesâ for Ukraine can only be a matter of time.
We should make every effort to reduce this time to an absolute minimum.
Our first step should be to say a clear ânoâ to Russia.
I therefore call on this House to ensure that the issue of elections in Ukraine is not passed over by the Member States during the upcoming summit between the European Union and Russia on 11Â November.
I would also call for every effort to be made during the next two weeks, which are crucial for Ukraine, to prevent Russia taking any action to strengthen autocratic tendencies in its neighbours.
This is my appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Verheugen.
We must not tolerate the creation of a new iron curtain.
Â Â  Mr President, there are plenty of reasons for being pessimistic about the presidential elections in Ukraine being conducted honestly and fairly.
Moreover, as it appears that the ballot box battle will require two rounds, it is of great importance that Europe should keep a careful watch on this Ukrainian electoral contest during the so-called interim period of 31 October to 21 November 2004, and I would emphatically call on the European institutions to do just that.
In addition, the European Union should not place all the emphasis on who leaves the arena as victor, but also on how the battle is fought.
If this is done in an unlawful manner, I would expect the Council and Commission to send a clear signal in the direction of Kiev.
Although Ukraineâs international isolation may not be in the interest of the Unionâs Member States, a âbusiness as usualâ attitude is out of the question if that happens.
I should like to finish with a pressing question.
How does the Council view the obvious interference of the Russian President in these Ukrainian presidential elections?
After all, this intervention undoubtedly affects the EU Member Statesâ external interests, not to mention Ukraineâs national independence and its citizensâ political freedom.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is very clear from remarks made by Members that the European Parliament is following closely developments in Ukraine.
Let me talk specifically about the election process and EU activities concerning the election, because a lot of Members made remarks about that.
As I said, we follow the elections very closely.
The basis for our opinion on the process will be the report of the OSCE Election Observation Mission.
The EU provides about half of the observers for this mission.
On a national basis, several Member States provide funding to NGOs that want to contribute to a free and fair election process.
In any case, the EU will not remain quiet once the first round of the elections has been completed.
We will issue a declaration clearly expressing our opinion about the election process.
Some Members â Mr Tannock and Mr Wiersma â spoke of the possible poisoning of the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko.
We are worried by these reports, but I do not want to speculate about what happened.
I am just happy that he is alive and able to continue campaigning, thus maintaining the broad field of candidates from which the Ukrainian people can choose.
Â Â  . Mr President, when I was asked what changes would occur within the European Union as a result of the accession of eight Central and Eastern European countries to the EU on 1Â May of this year, my answer was that there would be one extremely important change, namely that we would have to pay greater attention to our neighbours Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and that our new Member States would ensure that we did so.
I am glad that this afternoon has proven this prediction to be true, even if I do not agree with everything that has been said before this House, in particular by the Polish Members.
I do, however, welcome the fact that the representatives from our new Member States have taken advantage of this opportunity to highlight their regionâs specific problems.
I have taken the floor one last time in order to counter the impression that we are âneutralâ observers of events in Ukraine.
This is not the case, and the fact that the country is important to us means that we are extremely active in it.
Our activities relate precisely to the promotion of civil society for which Mrs Schroedter called, and indeed we have achieved a number of successes in this field.
It is by no means the case that the picture we have to paint is an entirely negative one.
It appeared to me that, on the whole, our views on this debate coincide fully with regard both to what we want and how we will achieve it.
The real issue at stake here is the connection between political reform in Ukraine and the prospect of it acceding to the EU.
Would a clear prospect of membership in the EU help democratic forces in Ukraine to take the upper hand?
My answer to this is a definite âyesâ, I am absolutely sure that a genuinely convincing prospect of EU membership for Ukraine would help.
That is precisely the reason why, together with the action plan, we have offered Ukraine a policy in which the action plan only acts as a start, with the policy being made up of various successive steps bringing us ever closer together.
During talks with President Kuchma I have always deliberately left open the issue of where this policy will ultimately lead, and it has been Ukraine itself which has said that it believes that it will one day lead to the European Union.
I do not believe that we should reject such an ambition on Ukraineâs part.
As a final comment, I do not entirely agree with some of the things that have been said in this House this afternoon, for example that we should have more sympathy for democratic deficiencies in Ukraine; after all, the country has a hard time of it, as it is a young democracy, which has been independent for only 12 years.
If you will forgive my saying so, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also only been independent for 12 years, and yet we demanded that these three countries meet our political and democratic standards in full.
They were able to do so, even though their past was as difficult as that of Ukraine.
I am in favour of us adopting a similarly demanding approach towards Ukraine, and of us telling the democratic forces in the country what we expect of them.
I do not, however, believe that the comparison made in this House this afternoon between Ukraine and a small child is an appropriate one.
A small child can be taken by the hand, or occasionally given a smack, if needs be.
Neither of these actions can be taken in the case of Ukraine, and in both cases the metaphor is inappropriate.
Ukraine is not a small child, it is a thoroughly self-confident, important and adult country, and I believe that we can very well demand of this country that it should also behave like an adult.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very sorry that I arrived only at the end of the debate about Ukraine, as I had a meeting at the same time with the Parliament delegation for relations with Israel.
It may have escaped me, but I asked the Dutch representative of the Council a pertinent question about the Councilâs stance with regard to the Kremlinâs obvious political intervention in these Ukrainian presidential elections.
The Council may have already responded to this question, but should it not have done so, my question still stands.
Moreover, I have put this question in the national language of the Councilâs representative, and a response would be appreciated.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can only add that we will also discuss this with Russia at the next summit on 11 November.
Â Â  â At the end of the debate I received six motions for a resolution(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
The session is suspended until Question Time at 6 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0017/2004).
We shall take questions to the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, the issue of inter-ethnic tension in Vojvodina has been discussed in the competent Council bodies and in the Council itself, namely in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 13 September 2004.
The EUâs heads of mission in Belgrade have been asked to draw up a report on the situation in the province with a general overview of the inter-ethnic relations and more information about recent incidents.
The report by the heads of mission, published on 15 September, states that although it appears that inter-ethnic intolerance has increased, the incidents â however disquieting â have generally been on a small scale and there does not seem to be a clear trend.
In the report, it is recommended that after the local elections taking place between 19 September and 3 October, a follow-up report be drawn up in due course, in the light of which the competent Council bodies will re-assess the situation.
In its conclusions about the Western Balkans of 11 October 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is satisfied with the undertaking given by the Serbian Government on 8 September that it will step up the dialogue with all ethnic communities, and the Council was looking forward to this undertaking being honoured.
The EU will continue to follow the developments in this area.
Respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities forms part of the EUâs fundamental values and is one of the objectives of the Unionâs foreign and security policy.
At present, Serbia and Montenegro have no contractual relationship with the European Union.
In the coming months, the Commission will be drafting a feasibility report to find out whether it can advise the Council to open negotiations about a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro.
Â Â  . â I am very pleased that the European Council pays attention to this important question.
It is important to emphasise that the safeguarding of minority and nationality rights is a fundamental condition to maintaining relations with the European Union and I am asking the Council to continue to pay serious attention to events in the same way and should any new event occur, then to take decisive action.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am obliged to the honourable Member for his comment.
As you know, our second report is not ready, but I can tell you that we are closely monitoring the situation.
I would also draw your attention to the Councilâs conclusions of 11 October, in which the Council welcomed Serbiaâs pledges for a dialogue with all ethnic groups.
To Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi and the President, I should like to add that I personally do have the impression that the situation has quietened down somewhat since the elections at the beginning of October.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
At their informal meeting in early September, the EUâs Foreign Affairs Ministers adopted a twin-track approach with regard to Serbia and Montenegro which will entail one blanket stabilisation and association agreement with two differently negotiated protocols on trade, customs and other sectoral areas of policy, which clearly fall within the remit of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
That was a positive gesture towards Serbia and Montenegro.
At the same time, the Foreign Affairs Ministers decided in favour of enforcing political conditions, including compliance with all international obligations, including those in respect of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, or ICTY.
The European Union would therefore ask all countries of the Western Balkans to cooperate with the ICTY as a token of their willingness to meet their international obligations and respect the principle of rule of law, the latter being one of the cornerstones on which the Union is founded in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
The leaders of those countries have promised to cooperate with the ICTY on several occasions, including during the Forum of the Western Balkans on 9 December 2003, which brought the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union and of the region together.
Moreover, the competent political leaders in Serbia and Montenegro, including the Presidents of the Union of States and of the two republics, as well as the Foreign Affairs Minister of Serbia and Montenegro have clearly spoken in favour of cooperation with the ICTY.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the representative of the Dutch Presidency for his reply; however, I should like to point out that, in the western Balkans, we witness escalating tension and instability on a daily basis.
We saw a few days ago during the elections in Kosovo that the Serb minority was absent.
We have seen the present rampant crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I should like to ask the Dutch Presidency what it intends to do under these circumstances.
We have the European strategy for the western Balkans.
What is the Dutch Presidency going to do?
The problems are accumulating.
I fear that a crisis is looming.
I should like to ask the Dutch Presidency which directions it intends to move in over the next few months.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am grateful for the honourable Memberâs comment, and I understand the concerns he is raising.
With regard to those items, the Council is looking forward to the Commissionâs feasibility study about opening negotiations for a possible stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro.
As you know, and I will reiterate this point, cooperation with the ICTY is a central issue, and this study also focuses on it.
It is something that will need to be monitored very carefully.
I hope, however, that you will understand that I cannot anticipate the outcome of this feasibility study.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 3, 4 and 5 will be taken together:
In Turkey, hundreds of nationalist members of the paramilitary organisation the 'Grey Wolves' held a heated demonstration outside the Ecumenical Patriarchate, throwing stones and pieces of wood, after which they hanged and burned an effigy of a Greek priest.
These events took place on the eve of the tragic anniversary of 6 September 1955 when a major pogrom was carried out against the Patriarchate and the Greeks of Istanbul.
The Turkish police did, however, take the necessary measures to prevent the worst.
What representations will the Council make to the Turkish Government to prevent the occurrence of similar events in the future?
Has the Turkish Government committed itself to the reopening of the Halki School of Theology?
What measures will the Council take to persuade the Turkish Government to recognise the legal personality of the Patriarchate and the rights associated with the management of its property?
Violations of the Christian minority's human rights persist.
The rights of individuals freely to practise their religion and use their own language are, in practice, restricted.
Old churches and monasteries fall into ruin or are deliberately destroyed.
The Turkish authorities continue to deny the genocide of Armenians and Syrians at the beginning of the previous century.
How does the Council intend to raise the question of the oppression of Armenians and Syrians in Turkey in its contacts with that country with its possible membership of the EU in view?
The protection of fundamental rights is a founding principle of the Union and an essential condition of its legitimacy.
In external relations, respect for fundamental rights is a categorical condition of candidate countries' accession to the Union.
In the light of Commissioner Verheugen's answer to my previous question, No E-3014/00(1), in which he stated that 'Respect for religious freedom is indeed one of the Copenhagen criteria that all candidate countries must fulfil before accession negotiations can get under way', will the Council say whether Turkey has complied with the criteria set out in Parliament's resolution P5_TA-PROV(2004)0274, with particular regard to the violations of the principle of religious freedom in Turkey (paragraph 36 of the resolution)?
Can the Council take a decision on a definite date for opening negotiations with Turkey before such violations, e.g. the failure to reopen the Halki School of Theology, have been eliminated and Turkey has also complied with the criteria set out in the memorandum of the Greek Orthodox, Syrian, Armenian and Roman Catholic churches submitted to the Human Rights Committee of the Turkish National Assembly?
Â Â  . Mr President, freedom of religion is one of the priority areas in the revised accession partnership for Turkey that was adopted by the Council on 15 May 2003.
In line with that priority, Turkey must create conditions corresponding to those in the EU Member States, so as to ensure that non-Muslim religious communities can function.
This also comprises the use of ownership rights in accordance with Protocol No 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The Council is fully aware that non-Muslim religious communities, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continue to experience problems.
Although some progress has been made in this area, various problems, particularly the problem of the legal position of non-Muslim religious communities and the registration of ownership, have not so far been resolved.
Comprehensive new legislation is still being drafted.
Meanwhile, the government is trying to find solutions to most of the critical problems.
In this context, the situation concerning the reopening of the Halki School of Theology also remains shrouded in uncertainty for the time being.
The Council is closely following developments with regard to freedom of religion in Turkey against the background of the Copenhagen political criteria for accession.
The Union will continue to raise this issue with Turkey within the bodies of the association agreement and in the context of the political dialogue, as well as at any other suitable opportunity.
It is, however, clear that preventing or handling specific incidents, such as the protests mentioned by the honourable Member, fall within the exclusive remit of the Turkish authorities.
As the honourable Member knows, the Commission accepted its recommendations concerning Turkeyâs progress on the road to accession on 6 October and has recommended opening negotiations with Turkey under certain conditions.
In order to guarantee the permanence and irreversibility of the political criteria, the Commission would recommend a cooperation strategy in order to strengthen and support Turkeyâs reform process, particularly with regard to the sustained compliance with the political criteria of Copenhagen.
The pace of the reforms will determine progress during the negotiations.
With specific reference to the Armenian and Syrian minorities, the report outlines an update of the situation, which is mainly reflected in the educational systems, schoolbooks and language teaching.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the representative of the Dutch Presidency.
I have two questions.
First, during all this discussion between the Commission and the Council and the Turkish authorities, have any specific commitments been made on the part of the Turkish authorities in order to meet these criteria?
Is there some sort of timetable?
Secondly, given that there has been a certain amount of tension in Greek airspace over the past few days, caused by Turkish fighter planes, does the Council intend to incorporate good neighbour requirements and non-provocation into the text to be adopted on 17 December?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I also wish to thank the Council for its answer to the question.
My follow-up question concerns the Turkish penal code which has, of course, recently been changed.
A look at this new code reveals an ArticleÂ 305 which still states that talking about the Armenian genocide in the media is a crime punishable by a prison sentence.
This means, of course, that it is still directly prohibited to mention this historical fact, namely that hundreds of thousands of Armenians were murdered in the last century in what is now Turkey.
Will the Council broach the subject of this ArticleÂ 305 in its contacts with Turkey?
How do you view its content?
Â Â  â Mr President, I am afraid that I too wish to repeat questions similar to those raised by my honourable friends.
Essentially, my question is this: the Council representative has already told us that, basically, Turkey does not at present meet the Copenhagen criteria and Mr Verheugen also said as much in one of his replies.
My question is this: can we start integration proceedings before the criteria have been met?
And, if we do, is there a specific timetable, as referred to by Mr Papadimoulis, whereby if the criteria are not met, integration proceedings are stopped?
That is what I want to know.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
We, that is to say you and we, but also we among ourselves, will undoubtedly be discussing at great length the steps both in the run-up to December and thereafter, as regards the issue of whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey, when to do so, and in what way.
Perhaps I can take the three questions together with the response to them.
The Commission has indicated â and I agree with what you have said about this â that, where the political criteria are concerned, we still have a long way to go.
The Commission has indicated, though, that a start could, under certain conditions, be made on negotiations with Turkey.
One of those very conditions is the entry into effect of this criminal justice system which has, in fact, been enquired about in the way the Commission has indicated.
What is very important â and it is clearly also important to you, to judge by your questions â is the fact that the Commission notes that once negotiations have started with Turkey, the political criteria will continue to be monitored very closely.
In fact, at least that is what the Commission proposes, if disappointing developments were to be noted, for example in this very political area in which you are now expressing concerns, it should be possible to activate a so-called emergency break in the form of suspending further negotiations.
That would be a new, more far-reaching step in the way we conduct accession processes compared to previous accession procedures.
I am convinced that these proposals and suggestions on the part of the Commission can in any event set the right tone in order to accommodate the concerns that have been expressed here and also by others elsewhere, if we were to take a decision on this in December.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Can non-Dutch-speakers understand me too?
The Council wishes to inform the honourable Member of the fact that the European Union has reacted very promptly, and predominantly via Echo, to the recent flooding in Bangladesh and Northern Indian States of Assam and Bihar, and aid has been granted to the tune of EUR 4Â million.
The Council would ask her to approach the Commission, which will be able to provide her with extensive information about the topic, particularly in terms of technical and financial assistance.
Â Â  May I thank the Council for its very brief response, though I had been hoping for a little more.
The floods in Bangladesh, and I have seen them, come nearly every year, but this year have caused some USD 2.2 billion damage.
This is a huge amount of flood damage: the European Union has very kindly sent EUR 4 million in aid.
I know that the Netherlands, with its long experience of beating back floodwaters at home, already supports considerable projects in Bangladesh, but I wonder what more can be done in the future.
Some 36 million people have been flooded, which is more than the population of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Ireland put together.
Flooding in the Low Countries of Europe is not permitted to get out of hand: the Dutch Government has made great efforts to fight back.
They do a great deal already in Bangladesh, but I wondered if we could know a bit more of what the plans are for the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too should like to apologise for the confusion about the questioner.
It is entirely clear to me now, although, if I may be so bold, I am a little less clear about for whom the question is intended.
After all, President, I can add very little to what I said a moment ago, and I need to refer to the Commission for the factual information.
On a slightly different note, the honourable Member pointed out that countries can, of course, develop activities in Bangladesh bilaterally, as they are doing, have done and will continue to do.
Particular attention has been drawn to the Netherlands, which has experience in this area.
It is true that we have developed activities in Bangladesh, partly based on Dutch expertise and experience of water.
However, a number of other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and France have also made contributions to Bangladesh bilaterally.
Â Â  . Mr President, as far as Romania and Bulgaria are concerned, the Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that the accession negotiations with Bulgaria about Chapter 24, Justice and Home Affairs, were provisionally completed in October 2003 and that a supervisory process has been set in motion.
Negotiations with Romania about Chapter 24 are still underway.
In order to join the European Union, the Member States need to meet the criteria of Copenhagen in which, among others, reference is made to stable institutions that guarantee democracy, rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities.
Given the importance that is attached to respect for the rule of law, it is obvious that the utmost importance is attached to effective, non-discriminatory law enforcement in Bulgaria and Romania, with efficient mechanisms for lodging complaints about corruption.
Both countries need to accept, and implement, a timeframe for legislation, as well as other measures aimed at developing the institutional and operational capacity of the law enforcement bodies and the judiciary.
Anti-corruption legislation forms part of this.
To date, the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities have taken a number of specific anti-corruption measures, the implementation of which is being monitored by both the Council and the Commission, which will continue to monitor it until the date of entry.
They will, in particular, be monitored by those bodies that have been established pursuant to the Europa Agreement, namely the Association Council, the Association Committee and the subcommittees.
The future European agency for external border control that is expected to be operational by 1 May 2005 will draw up, and develop, a common core curriculum for training border patrols and will provide training at European level for instructors for the Member Statesâ national border patrols.
Finally, in connection with the delays at the Turkish-Greek border, the Council would remind you of the decision of 29 April 2004 establishing minimum signposts at external border checkpoints.
The use of these signposts is compulsory at airports.
At checkpoints of their land and sea borders, Member States are entitled to guide the vehicles in separate lanes. These separate lanes are intended to simplify the control procedures and avoid unnecessary delays.
This separation may also be deviated from when traffic flows at border checkpoints are temporarily disrupted.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your detailed answer.
I have just one additional question; you referred to monitoring, which, if I understood you correctly, will be carried out primarily by the Association Council.
My question, prompted by specific inquiries from the people who live in my electoral district in Munich, is whether the public can address specific complaints relating to delays or corruption to the Council or the Association Council directly, and, if not, which body is responsible for accepting such complaints, which could subsequently be dealt with as part of the monitoring process?
Â Â  . Mr President, my concrete and direct response to a concrete question is to inform the honourable Member that in cases similar to those he describes, people can take their complaints to the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you once again, and thank you for the question.
As you know, it was during its meeting in Copenhagen in June 1993 that the European Council laid down the criteria for EU membership.
They include, among other things, political criteria requiring a candidate Member State to possess stable institutions, guaranteeing, as I said a moment ago, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities.
In December of this year, the European Council will, on the basis of the Commissionâs report and recommendations of 6 October 2004, decide whether negotiations with Turkey can be opened.
Further to Mr Papadimoulisâ previous question, we have already made reference to the Commissionâs recommendations and the conditions under which it advises to open negotiations.
I think I have already clarified this in a response to the three questions combined.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to ask a question regarding the situation arising following the signing of the draft Constitutional Treaty this month by government representatives.
During the debate on the Constitutional Treaty, there was much talk of how the European Union should retain its secular character, as well as a discussion concerning the preamble.
Will Turkeyâs membership in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference be compatible with talks on membership or future membership of the European Union?
Should the condition imposed during the debate on the Constitutional Treaty not also be put to the Turkish negotiators in a very specific manner?
Â Â  . Mr President, Turkey has rules and regulations laying down the separation of church and state, and the secular nature of the latter, more strictly than do some of the current Member States.
That is, in principle, not what the objection is about and nor is it mentioned by the Commission as such.
Of a somewhat different nature is the discussion we just had, namely where practice is concerned, the situation and religious freedom, and problems, some of which have, further to your questions, just been discussed.
The Commission will study this very closely and carefully, and, in this respect, if it is decided to open negotiations, those points will continue to be monitored very closely after these negotiations have started.
Â Â  I was quite alarmed by the implications of this question and, indeed, by the contribution we heard from the other side of the House.
The honourable Member mentioned protecting the secular character of the European Union, and, in its response, the Council referred to the position in Turkey, where there is a separation of church and state.
Nothing could further emphasise the European Union's determination to commit itself to being fully secular in nature than the accession of Turkey, a large country with a large number of Muslim people.
Yes, Turkey presents challenges for the European Union.
Yes, there are issues to be answered on human rights and a whole range of other aspects.
But I do not believe that religion should be part of this.
I, for one, welcome Turkey's accession to the European Union in the course of time.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that this issue is dealt with better in Turkeyâs legislation than in that of some Member States.
Firstly, I should be interested to know which Member States you have in mind.
Secondly, I should like to ask what you mean by this statement; that religious communities have no legal status in Turkey, or that Islam, the majority religion, is organised in Turkey by the state, or that no head coverings may be worn for religious reasons?
What did you mean to say was better regulated in Turkey?
Â Â  . Mr President, as far as the last question is concerned, I indicated that, as I read the Commissionâs comments and verdict, the formal separation of church and state is not the issue.
What the discussion is about, as it was in the past and will be in future, is the factual implementation of church and state separation, in other words freedom of religion as one of the points which is, and will continue to be, closely monitored, where the developments in Turkey are concerned.
In reaction to the comments â for I do not think it was a question by Mr Evans â I should like to state quite categorically that the position of the presidency in terms of religion as criterion to join, is not at issue.
Religion does not form part of the Copenhagen criteria or, for that matter, of the political criteria.
I want to make a point of stating this here emphatically.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
The Council would remind the honourable Member of the statements about Albania made by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on 14 September 2004, and the Council would emphasise that it never comments on public statements such as those to which this question refers.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, the exercise was carried out between 11 and 16 July 2004.
It should be noted that the European Union, in the context of the ESDP, does not carry out field exercises, that is to say exercises involving the deployment of troops, such as those mentioned in the honourable Memberâs question.
Exercises of this type, involving the deployment of national or multinational troops, continue to be the Member Statesâ exclusive responsibility.
As for the environmental effect of low-frequency sonar at sea, the Council is aware of the current studies into the possibility that whales, dolphins or other sea animals would sustain injuries, become deaf or lose their sense of direction as a result.
Â Â  While the European Union has certain obligations at international level, in relation to the Directive on natural habitats, for example, I recognise that issues relating to military manoeuvres fall within national competence.
However, we are talking about an area in which we are currently developing a common foreign and security policy.
My concern is that the United Statesâ courts are currently preventing this type of manoeuvre from being carried out close to the coasts of the United States, which implies that military manoeuvres, mainly carried out by the United States, are being diverted to the coasts of the European Union.
My supplementary question is whether the President-in-Office of the Council believes that, from the Councilâs point of view and within the context of cooperation in the common foreign and security policy, we should begin to adopt a position, at least by means of recommendations, with a view to preventing the United States from exporting this pollution to waters close to the European Union.
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
Unfortunately, there is very little I can add to what has been said here on this subject in the first instance, because formally, this is not a matter for the Council, or for the Presidency.
The European Union does not carry out the field exercises about which the questioner is concerned, but let me add that I do take those concerns seriously.
I already mentioned the current investigations we have mounted, and the involvement and interest we are displaying in this connection.
What I say is that we will continue to monitor the developments and investigations.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Neither the European Council nor the Council have taken up a position with regard to the matters raised by the honourable Member, since these fall within the remit of the Member States, as do the ones I mentioned earlier.
Article 106 of the Treaty clearly defines the respective powers of the European Central Bank and the Member States with regard to the issue of euro notes and coins.
Paragraph 1 stipulates that the ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of bank notes.
The notes are issued by the ECB and the national central banks.
Paragraph 2 specifies that Member States can issue coins on two conditions.
First of all, the ECB must approve the level of the issue and secondly, the issued coins must meet any other legislative measures that harmonise their nominal values and technical specifications.
Council Regulation No 975/98/EC determines the nominal values and technical specifications of the coins that can be issued by the Member States.
It is up to the Member States to decide, within this framework, on the volume of coins they want to issue at which nominal value, with the European Central Bankâs approval being required for every issue.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his response.
Obviously, I too know that this falls within the remit of the Member States.
Nevertheless, in my view â and I think, in the view of the public and of a number of consumer organisations, if in the euro zone and in the different Member States, different positions are taken up as regards whether or not to continue issuing certain small euro cent coins, or whether or not to round up prices, it is then difficult to still talk about a price policy or financial policy in the euro zone.
I would therefore like to ask the President-in-Office whether this might after all be submitted for discussion by the Council of Finance Ministers.
Â Â  . I very much understand the honourable Memberâs concern and the question, but as I just indicated in the first instance, this does not fall within the remit and scope of the Presidency or of the Council.
That being so, I have to disappoint her, because I cannot promise her that I want to table this for discussion.
This is, first of all, related to the formal positions, but also politically speaking, we in the Presidency do not feel it incumbent upon ourselves to put the important principle of subsidiarity, whereby not everything is always decided upon at this level but also at national level, on the agenda in this way.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
For years, the Member Statesâ various competent law enforcement bodies, including police, customs and coast guards, have made every effort to prevent the import of illegal drugs into the territory of the Member States.
It is of the utmost importance for those substances to be prevented from reaching the territory of the Member States.
The framework decision concerning the illegal drugs trade, which will be formally adopted by the Council before long, gives the law enforcement bodies in the Member States the space they need to act effectively against the import of illegal drugs and against a whole catalogue of offences.
In this connection, the EUâs drugs strategy should be mentioned; it is, as you know, the subject of discussion in the Council at present.
There is agreement about the priority that is given to the implementation of existing European legal instruments where the fight against the drugs trade is central, such as the European Convention on Mutual Legal Aid in Criminal Matters, which provides for the setting-up of joint investigation teams.
On 2 June 2004, the Commission published a communication about the reinforcement of police and customs cooperation in the European Union.
The Councilâs response is included in the draft of a multi-annual programme for the area of freedom, security and justice, the so-called The Hague programme, which will be adopted by the European Council on 5 November 2004.
Over the course of certainly ten years, the customs authorities in the Member States have organised joint operations every year in order to examine the smuggling of drugs, including Ecstasy, by air, land and sea.
An operation focussing on the smuggling of Ecstasy by air is planned for the near future, and over 20 Member States are set to take part in it.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
I am delighted to hear that new initiatives are being undertaken in this area, because it is a growing problem.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the presidency's position on tackling the smuggling of Ecstasy, since it can be made in someone's kitchen and does not need to be transported across borders; whereas heroin, opium and cocaine involve importation.
I should also like to ask about the Council's position on LSD and other illegal narcotics.
Most synthetic drugs can be produced locally.
Although some of the ingredients might have to be imported, that can be done legitimately and they are then put to illegal use.
Perhaps the emphasis could be shifted from Ecstasy smuggling to the major problems of smuggling from areas such as the triangle around Afghanistan, and via shipping routes.
Â Â  I would agree with Mr Crowley, but differ slightly on the matter of Ecstasy smuggling.
This is a major problem for London, the area I represent, where there is a lot of Ecstasy smuggling.
My question to the President-in-Office, though, relates to the EU drugs strategy within the framework of justice and home affairs, which the Dutch presidency has prioritised.
A drugs strategy report has begun its progress through Parliament.
Given the experience of the Dutch with regard to drugs prevention and drugs policy, what does the presidency propose to do to combat drug smuggling?
Â Â  The question is about strengthening cooperation between police agencies and coastguard services.
After 9/11 in the United States, the Americans discovered there was a lack of cooperation between the FBI and the CIA.
What is the presidency doing, or what proposals does it have, to improve the quality of between different agencies within Member States and across borders?
As the PresidentâinâOffice knows well â although I do not think he is listening to me â the problem is trust between the agencies.
We do not trust each other, and therefore there is no cooperation.
PresidentâinâOffice, what are you proposing to do about improving trust between these agencies?
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
With regard to the last question, as you know, there are far-reaching plans to improve cooperation and the exchange of information within the European Union, but the questioner was right to point out the major importance of improving cooperation with bodies outside the European Union too.
Those contacts have been made, improvements are being carried out, and the honourable Member was right to mention cooperation with the United States.
Mr Crowley was right to point out that, where the major and, indeed, increasing problem of Ecstasy consumption is concerned, it is not only a question of smuggling from outside the European Union, but also of what is happening in the European Union itself.
Logically, my initial response dealt with the external dimension of this discussion, but you are right that high priority should also be given to this problem internally, that is, within the European and national borders.
This does not detract from the fact that, of course, cooperation within the European Union is first and foremost aimed at the cross-border issue and it is, in fact â at least that is how I understand his comment â also an appeal to national governments to shoulder their responsibilities in this area.
The drugs strategy has been mentioned and questions have been asked about it.
As it is currently the subject of discussion in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, I am unable to respond to the question about the content of this drugs strategy and the priorities which we are setting in this respect.
What I can say is that the Dutch Presidency is hoping to take a decision on this subject in Decemberâs European Council.
This being the case, the European Parliament can find out about our objectives and priorities for the European drugs strategy before then.
Â Â  . Mr President, one of the most important elements of the millennium objective for development, which consists of setting up a worldwide partnership for development, is permanent debt relief.
As well as national and international measures, a broad solution should be found for the debt problem of the developing countries so as to make debts bearable in the long term.
In accordance with the consensus of Monterrey, which was approved by the Heads of State or Government of the members of the United Nations in March 2002, the EU recognises that permanent debt funding is of the essence for freeing up resources for private and public investments, and that the relief of foreign debt can play a crucial role when resources are freed up for activities that promote sustainable growth and development.
Achieving the millennium objectives for development is a core objective of the European Union and, in broader terms, of the international communities.
The commitments into which the EU Member States entered at the Monterrey Conference reflect the Unionâs leading role in international efforts to accomplish the millennium objectives and should find expression in the full range of the EUâs policy measures and in its decisions concerning the allocation of financial resources.
In its conclusions of 14 November 2002, the Council confirmed its willingness to, and I quote âcontinue its efforts to restore the sustainability of debts in the context of the strengthened Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, so that the developing countries, particularly the poorest among them, can continue to pursue growth and development without being hindered by the burden of unsustainable debtsâ.
The EU is also looking into the possibility of taking the present HIPC initiative one step further.
During the high-level dialogue on development funding, which was held in New York in October 2003 in the framework of the 58th UN General Assembly, the EU urged all donor and creditor countries which had not done so, to take on their share of bilateral debt relief and to contribute to the multilateral funding of the HIPC initiative.
The EU also emphasised that it is of great importance for the IMF and the World Bank to issue regular reports on whether their Member States meet their HIPC obligations, in particular with regard to Article 4 on control.
It was also mooted that during the official bilateral debt rearrangement in the Club of Paris, consideration should also be given to debtor countries which meet their HIPC obligations as creditors.
During the dialogue, the EU also declared itself prepared to talk with the international financial institutions and the other donors about possible changes to the way the requirements of additional debt relief, or topping up, are calculated at the end, on behalf of those HIPC countries whose debt burden is considered untenable at that time due to serious exogenous shocks.
It also showed willing to study ways in which the financial gap can be plugged and at the same time to bring about a fair reduction in the burden.
According to the EU, HIPC countries, as well as donor and creditor countries, are all responsible for permanent debt relief in the long term.
The question whether it would be a useful initiative on the part of the European Commission to set up a debt department, as the World Bank did recently, does not fall within my remit, as you will understand, but within that of the Commission.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer.
I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because I have not heard any real proposal.
A lot of people are talking about this, but very little gets done.
This issue is of enormous importance and the Commission should have come forward with more concrete ideas, rather than referring to various proposals that have already been made by other people.
I am disappointed with the answer to the question.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do apologise.
I fear, moreover, that I cannot totally allay the disillusionment or disappointment.
In my first speech, I did attempt to indicate specifically the Councilâs concern and involvement in this, together with the political weight and priority we attach to it, with regard to the very concrete organisation and aspects which the honourable Member mentioned.
For this I would refer to the Commission once again, as indeed he did himself in his more detailed question.
Â Â  We are now coming to the end of the scheduled time for Question Time.
I see that there are at least three more Members who are due to ask the next three questions.
I shall ask the Council if they can stay here for a little longer to answer one or two more questions.
In that case, Question Time is closed.
I apologise to Mr Newton Dunn, Mr Moraes and MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m, whom I can see are present in this House, but the Council has notified us that they have pressing commitments and cannot stay any longer.
Â Â  Mr President, I should just like to point out that the clock says it is 6.56 p.m.
The agenda says Question Time finishes at 7 p.m.
Therefore, surely, Question Time cannot be closed?
Â Â  As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Question Nos 14 to 33 will be answered in writing(2), except Question No 18, which has been withdrawn by the questioner.
Question Time is closed.
Â Â  â Mr President, number 20, which is the fourth question in line, is my question. I think I am the last.
Given the earlier procedure and what you too have said, could you perhaps allow a minor extension of 2 to 3 minutes for my question?
Thank you for your understanding.
Â Â  As I said, Question Time is closed, as the Council has to leave.
((1)
Â Â  Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I should like it confirmed â for the record â that all the letters of assessment on the Commissionersâdesignate have been forwarded to Mr Barroso, Presidentâdesignate of the Commission.
Â Â  Mr Chichester, I note your request.
You will certainly be given an appropriate confirmation.
Â Â  Mr President, last Sunday, speaking to my countryâs top newspaper, MrsÂ Loyola de Palacio stated that Spain was losing weight in the European Union and becoming an appendage of France and Germany.
We have said in this House over recent days that everybody has the right to think and express their opinions, whatever they may be, but when that opinion clashes with the responsibilities of a Vice-President of the Commission, calling into question three States of the Union, we believe that is very serious.
Since we believe it to be an insult to my country, Spain, and probably to two other countries of the Union, I would call on the Vice-President of the Commission for a specific rectification and on acting-President Prodi to intervene.
Â Â  Mr MartÃ­nez, as you yourself have mentioned, the predominant responsibility for reacting to this issue lies with Mr Prodi and the Commission and I have no doubt that appropriate reactions will be given, in accordance with the political sensibilities of those primarily involved.
Â Â  The next item is oral question B6-0019/04 by Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, to the Commission, on women and poverty.
Â Â  , . Mr President, Madam Commissioner, on Sunday 17 October the international community observed the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty, in order to draw attention to poverty as aÂ violation of human rights.
We are endeavouring to eliminate poverty, but, if we are to succeed in this, society must redouble its efforts.
It must take as its starting-point the experiences of those who actually live in poverty, and of the families that reject poverty and do everything to ensure aÂ better future for their children.
Such people are aÂ lasting testimony to the idea that wherever there are women, children and men condemned to aÂ life of poverty, their human rights are violated.
It is our fundamental duty to unite in order to ensure that these rights are respected throughout the European Union.
On 17 October 1987, in response to the call of Father Jozef Brezinsky, 100 000 defenders of human rights gathered in rue Trocadero in Paris to pay their respects to the victims of hunger, violence and ignorance.
They demonstrated their opposition to poverty and called on the human race to unite in order to ensure respect for human rights.
The European Parliament subsequently adopted this position in its annual reports on basic human rights in the European Union.
In 1996, in the same spirit, the United Nations launched its first Decade for the Elimination of World Poverty.
Through the Lisbon Agenda the European Union also became active in this area.
Allow me to mention two important points that relate to this problem.
The first is the adoption of aÂ position on participation.
