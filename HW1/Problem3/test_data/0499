Objections raised by Intertanko, the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, and by Greece, should be secondary to the protection of our marine, coastal and port environment.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will be supporting this proposal at second reading too.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his decisive attempt to secure conditions for preventing accidents at sea which have terrible repercussions on maritime pollution.
It is a moral and political duty both for the European Union and its Member States and for international organisations.
For my country, Greece, given that two Members referred to it, environmental protection is a particular objective, given that it is a country with a coast, islands, a large tourist economy and aspirations to become a transit centre in the Eastern Mediterranean, which means increased shipping traffic and increased dangers of pollution and accidents.
This strategy is expressed both in the policy of its government and in the huge investments by Greek shipowners in modern ships.
At the same time, however, due to our huge merchant fleet, we are also a country which faces huge problems in adapting to a new regulation which differs from international conventions and unavoidably results in rapid changes with economic repercussions.
The business capacity and jobs which risk being lost are parameters which no country faces as seriously as Greece.
That is why we would hope that the regulation will take account, as far as the timetable is concerned, of commercial activities under way and the contractual obligations of tankers.
Furthermore, we all know that no isolated measure suffices.
Shipping registers also have a huge responsibility.
Staff training, agreement and coordination between Member States and the availability of ports of refuge play a huge part.
We shall endeavour, through the general objectives of the European Union, to combine in the very best way environmental protection, the competitiveness of our European fleet and our economy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should once again like to thank Mr Le Rachinel and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their excellent work, which should enable the proposal to be adopted at first reading.
I would also thank all the MEPs who have spoken in order to emphasise the extent to which this obligation was an integral part of our efforts in the interests of maritime safety.
The amendment that you have proposed, Mr Le Rachinel, and that was voted unanimously in favour of by the Committee on Transport and Tourism is no less important for being technical, as it helps make the text still clearer.
I am therefore able to accept it.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would thank Parliament for again becoming involved in this maritime safety policy which - as one of the speakers emphasised - is all the more necessary in that the development of motorways of the sea and of maritime traffic will demand ever greater vigilance in the area of safety.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Development of the second-generation Schengen Information System (regulation) - Development of the second-generation Schengen Information System (decision) (debate)
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I consider it my duty to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for the excellent work he has done on these proposals and also for the speed with which we have received the reports and have come to have this plenary debate this evening.
Many Members will know that the Council of Home Affairs Ministers adopted some important conclusions last week.
These conclusions once again confirmed that the Schengen II Information System is the European Union's main priority, and therefore it is clear that extending the Commission's mandate on SIS II is essential in order to ensure that it can continue to develop the system in close cooperation with the Member States.
You will also be aware that the Council has accepted a proposal from the Portuguese Government - which I myself endorse on behalf of the Commission - for a temporary solution, which we have called SIS One For All.
That is to say, it is a mechanism designed to ensure that the internal borders of the new Member States can be removed during the phase of transition to SIS II, while keeping the original deadline set for the end of 2007.
That does not make us lose sight of the main objective, which is SIS II, which will guarantee greater security in border controls.
It will confirm the outcome that we want to achieve by the end of 2007, which is to remove controls on the internal borders of the new Member States that have asked to join the enlarged Schengen agreement.
Therefore, if these countries meet the necessary security criteria at their land and sea borders and at their airports, as I hope they will, they will be able to crown the political completion of their accession by forming a European domestic area without border controls, extending from Portugal across to Lithuania.
That will be an enormous political success for Europe.
SIS II will in any case continue to be our main objective: it will guarantee a higher level of security, be of greater help to the police authorities in charge of control and security, and provide better protection of personal data, which will be included in the system on the basis of greater transparency and accountability.
For all these reasons, SIS II remains the objective for our European area of security and freedom of movement, and that is why, in line with the rapporteur's position, we are asking for an extension to the Commission's mandate so that we can continue to develop SIS II.
The Council of Ministers' acceptance of the Portuguese proposal will entail a delay in implementing SIS II.
It will not be an enormous delay, and I can tell the rapporteur and Parliament already that in February 2007 the Commission will submit a definite proposal for the final date for developing SIS II.
The delay will be no more than six to eight months following the date originally set. All in all, that is acceptable, if you consider that in the meantime the new Member States will have achieved the political success of joining a European area without internal borders.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the importance of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), and Mr Frattini has just reminded us of this.
The advent of free movement within the Community area and the absence of internal borders means we must strengthen the security of the Union's external borders and this can only be done if information is shared between all members of the Schengen area.
Mr Frattini also said - and this is a view I share - that SIS II is not only a new generation of the Schengen Information System; it can also be said that this is a new Schengen Information System, with new functions, new uses and new imported data.
Apart from the technical issues involved in building a new system, there is also a political issue, relating to the legitimate ambition of the new Member States to join the Schengen area at the earliest opportunity.
This is a crucial issue for the new Member States; it is about whether or not they can offer their citizens the chance of free movement in the Community area.
In order for them to be in the Schengen area they have to join SIS.
As we know, SIS is not in itself sufficient, in other words, merely joining SIS is not enough in order to be in the Schengen area.
There is a series of other prerequisites that must be fulfilled.
It is a necessary requirement, however; one cannot be in the Schengen area without being in the Schengen Information System.
Consequently, the creation of SIS II has to be a priority for us, and this is why we worked so hard to achieve the adoption of the legal basis of SIS II at first reading - and, having worked closely with Parliament on this objective throughout the process, Mr Frattini is an eyewitness to this.
The adoption of the legal basis will prevent us suffering worse delays in implementing the SIS II, and I should like to thank him once again for his decisive help in achieving this objective.
The mandate granted by the Council to the Commission to develop SIS II finishes in a few days, on 31 December.
The Commission is proposing that this date be extended to 2007, and admits that the system will not be operational before 2008.
The proposal to extend the deadline to December 2007 is the optimistic version.
I was very pleased to hear Mr Frattini say that in February 2007 he will set out a definitive timetable and that he is only expecting a delay of six to eight months.
I must say that this prediction is considerably more positive than the worrying information that had been circulating.
It is still a delay but it is much less serious than we feared.
I hope he is right, as there are those who believe that we may face bigger delays.
In any event, Mr Frattini will know that Parliament always fulfils its monitoring obligations.
We want to monitor the implementation of this process, and if there are delays, we want to know why they have taken place.
I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups, in particular Mrs Mastenbroek and Mr Lax, and I should like to thank publicly those MEPs on my side of the Chamber who have kept a close eye on this issue, who have always encouraged me and who have constantly showed their great concern over the pace at which SIS II was being implemented, in particular Mrs Bauer from Slovakia, Mr Brejc from Slovenia, Mrs GÃ¡l from Hungary, Mr Demetriou from Cyprus and of course Mrs Kudrycka from Poland, who will speak on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this debate.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mr Coelho for such an excellent report and I would like to say that the extension of the Commission's mandate has raised no reservations.
SIS II is, and should remain, a priority.
The European Parliament has done everything within its ability to ensure this is the case.
We still wish to support the Commission so that SIS II can be implemented as fast as possible.
The original aims of the new system were to upgrade SIS I and to expand it to incorporate the new Schengen states.
The first of these aims has yet to be fulfilled.
The second required a political decision and the creation of an alternative 'SIS I for all' system.
It is unfortunate that it had to come to that, but the European Union must keep its credibility and fulfil its political obligations towards the new Member States.
However, I am hoping for a clear definition of how, in terms of organisation, time and funding are concerned, the 'SIS I for all' project will influence the implementation of the second generation SIS system.
We still need close cooperation and Parliament needs to be kept up to date regarding both projects.
We also expect the Commission to adopt a more assertive and demanding attitude towards the Member States, to avoid recriminations later on.
SIS II is a Community project funded from the European Union's budget.
This means that the Commission and the Member States bear the responsibility to a greater extent than was previously the case with the international SIS 1+ system.
The Commission can count on the European Parliament's political support.
However, lessons need to be learned from the mistakes and failures that have occurred so far.
I also hope that, in the end, the work of the Commission will result in all Member States feeling that they all own the SIS II project together, with no divisions between the new and old Schengen Member States.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, as it is known, is a database which allows the appropriate authorities in the Member States to cooperate and to exchange information for the purpose of creating an area without internal border controls.
This system makes it significantly easier for the citizens of the European Union to travel and gives the forces of law and order better conditions under which to fight crime.
However, SIS has been up and running since 1995. This is a very long time in an age of extremely rapid progress in the field of information technology.
That is why, as early as in December of 2001, exactly five years ago, the Council assigned the Commission with setting up a second generation SIS II system.
It is vital for the expansion of the Schengen area to include the new Member States.
It is hardly surprising that public opinion in these countries is concerned whenever it hears about delays in implementing this system.
Although European Union home affairs ministers have recently decided that eight out of the ten new Member States will join the Schengen area in late 2007 and early 2008, which means being in the SIS I system for a while, this is a stopgap solution, which will be costly and far from perfect.
I hope that the Commission will learn some lessons from the delay in implementing the SIS II system and that, in the future, it will work more efficiently on projects that are important to the European Union as a whole.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, a properly functioning information system is the basis for a successful exchange of data between the Member States.
This applies as much to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as it does to border controls and the issuing of visas and residence permits.
Moreover, a system of this kind should lead to greater security by providing a tool which is sound and at the same time flexible, and can be used to meet changing requirements.
In view of the fact that the efficiency of the current system allows it to serve a maximum of eighteen Member States, it is very important to implement the new generation Schengen Information System as soon as possible.
So far the implementation of this ambitious project has run into numerous problems resulting in serious delays to its implementation.
That is why, in the future we must do eveything in our power to prevent similar situations.
The delays in the implementation of the SIS II system are very dangerous in the view of the new Member States.
They mean a delay to their full integration into the European Union and restrict their ability to take full advantage of the achievements of the Schengen system and the removal of border controls on their own internal borders with other Schengen countries.
I would also like to draw your attention to the Eastern Dimension of the European Union's foreign policy and the changes which have to be taken into account as consequences of the expansion of the Schengen area.
Today Poland, which does not belong to this area, collects either no visa fees from its Eastern neighbours or fees which are very low.
From the moment that the Schengen area is extended, Poland's eastern border will become the only eastern border of the European Union.
This will mean higher visa fees running into tens of US dollars, which would also hit the citizens of Belarus or Ukraine.
This situation might be difficult for our eastern neighbours to accept, considering the fact that both Poland and the European Union have certain political plans with respect to deepening cooperation with these countries, and which may result in the creation of something similar to a new Berlin Wall.
This is something the European Union cannot afford to do.
(PL) Mr President, the implementation of the SIS II system reflects the organisational powerlessness of the organisational department to which this task was given.
Every day tens of thousands of drivers queue up like refugees at the borders of the European Union, in abysmal conditions.
Companies are losing thousands of euros.
People wonder about the nature of a European Union which scores own goals like that.
In Strasbourg, beautiful administrative buildings stand unused for 80% of the time. The cost of maintaining them is more than 200 million euros per year.
At the same time we are told that there will be delays because no buildings are available to house the system.
The citizens simply cannot comprehend the ineffectiveness of those in charge.
I think that the European Union would benefit if the people responsible for this situation were made to spend the night in an HGV.
Soon the nights will be brilliant with snow, while a bit of fresh air does no one any harm and actually increases alertness.
I propose that we finally move to clarify this matter which is so important to our citizens.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Violent video games (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on violent videogames.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly grateful to the few, perhaps less than ten, Members present in this Chamber to debate a subject that affects many tens of millions of young and very young people - our children - in the European Union.
The protection of the law and of the fundamental rights of young people and children must remain a major priority for the EU.
It is a priority for the European Commission, and I have to say quite frankly that the acts of violence and sadism that appear in some particularly bloody videogames are a cause of great concern to us.
New technologies that have enabled young and very young people to use the Internet and technological games have changed the relationship between adults and children.
Young people, our children, are often much more familiar with these technologies than adults are.
What is essential, therefore, is primarily greater responsibility and consciousness on the part of adults and parents, as well as focus and education to make parents, above all, fully aware of the risks and able to make informed decisions.
There is a classification system with labelling for the content of films, and also for games and videogames, that may be of use.
This must, of course, be combined with a mechanism providing for more effective education.
These components are necessary if we want a solution that works.
The European Union already has instruments for fighting these worrying problems within the policy areas of justice and security, and also the information society and internal market rules.
I must say quite sincerely, ladies and gentlemen, that I have also been highly impressed by certain child protection monitoring and enhancement initiatives that I was informed about by some Home Affairs Ministers before and after the Council of Ministers, and which have been taken up by some national political parties in certain Member States.
I refer in particular to increased control over the sale of particularly violent games and videogames to minors.
In my view, it is equally important to hold videogame producers responsible.
In 2003, a European self-regulation system, known as Pan-European Game Information, was adopted in order to help parents choose when buying videogames intended for minors.
This self-regulation system is supported by a large majority of producers.
It was developed after consultation with the industry, parents' associations and consumer associations.
It covers 27 countries and includes an indication of the minimum age for access to a particular game and a mandatory description of the content of a game or videogame that is placed on the market.
This system, ladies and gentlemen, helps parents to choose - assuming that it is the parents who decide what videogames their children buy - but it does not concern and it contains no reference to the content of the videogame.
Such self-regulation was established on the one hand to protect minors, but also, on the other hand, to comply with another fundamental principle: freedom of expression.
I intend to meet very soon with producers and the associations representing them in order to evaluate to what extent the indicators used in the self-regulation scheme are relevant or, I would say, up to date.
I think the time has come to assess whether those indicators have perhaps not been working as we would have liked them to.
With regard to the content of games or videogames that can be found on the Internet, in contrast, there are systems out there, but they are applied and implemented at the initiative of certain respected consortia.
The first is one known as the Platform for Internet Content Selection, and the second is the Recreational Software Advisory Council, both based primarily in the United States.
I must point out, however, that neither the United Nations study on violence against children nor the World Health Organization's world report on violence and health analyses this problem; it gets just a passing reference as if there were absolutely no need to examine it in greater depth.
In 2005, the Commission conducted an enquiry financed under the Daphne programme.
This enquiry, based on a series of studies of the violent videogame sector, revealed the need for a multidisciplinary approach, which currently does not exist.
One result of this study was that violent images have an undeniable influence on young people.
This influence may, however, show itself in different ways, depending on various factors. These, for example, include affluence; the young people's situation; where they live; whether they have an active parental figure close to them, or whether they have no parents close to them; control over the youngsters' access to the media and the Internet, in other words whether or not their parents exercise any control over whether they can have absolutely free access to the Internet; the level of education given; and the family's socio-economic level.
All these factors affect the way in which violence can influence the minds and mentalities of young and very young people.
There are other important elements to consider.
Firstly, this is not just a technical issue but rather an issue of education, which involves control for preventive purposes.
When I say control over the sale of violent videogames, I mean effective control, because today there are no mandatory instruments that make it possible to check whether or not a person under the age of 16 can buy videogames that incite or glorify acts of violence or even actual criminal acts.
I believe this House will at least want to consider this problem, in view of the fact, as well, that the schemes that Daphne has financed to combat violence against children are based precisely on this idea of how to protect young and very young people.
To conclude, following on from the child protection strategy that we launched in July, I intend to refer this problem to the European Forum for the Rights of the Child.
As you know, this forum has been set up to commence work at the beginning of 2007.
At its first working meeting I intend to start a public, transparent debate involving all stakeholders: non-governmental organisations, the Member States, parents' associations, young people, minors and also the national mediators responsible for children's rights.
The four keywords on this subject are: parents, communication and education professionals, producers - because we cannot tackle this problem at its roots if we cannot prevent the production of these violent games - and lastly politics.
It is a case of examining how politics can draw up a strategy to actually protect children without resorting to censorship.
These are the pillars on which we must address the problem that I have put to you this evening.
In the spring I will submit a communication on cybercrime to you.
In my view, criminals, law-breakers and Internet offenders see the young and very young as particularly vulnerable victims.
It is our political, institutional and moral duty to react firmly, with a European strategy against incitement to violence, against the exaltation of violence and against the glorification of violence.
Thank you, Mr Frattini.
I agree with your tactful opening remark, which confirms the need to bring some reflection and a few changes to the organisation of our parliamentary work, especially with regard to our plenary debates.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Frattini for his very helpful and very commendable introduction to this important subject.
We probably have not given enough consideration to this issue in this Parliament.
I am glad that we are now having this debate because there is considerable evidence to show that violence in videos has an effect on minors who watch them - very detrimental effects, which we need to get to grips with.
I think it is becoming clear that the self-regulation that Mr Frattini talked about is probably no longer enough.
We need to look at this further, to ensure that young people have controlled access and that the videos themselves are not gratuitously violent.
We see this kind of violence around us on our television screens and we are becoming more and more accepting of levels of violence in a way that we should not be and in a way that is not acceptable.
So, this is a good initiative and one which I hope that we will be able to take forward.
I am very pleased that the Commission undertook the survey and that it was done under the Daphne programme because not only do we see gratuitous violence on videos but also a representation of women that is unacceptable.
So, not only do young people see violence as such, they also see violence towards women and a portrayal of women that is not what we would wish.
There are two things that need to be dealt with: the protection of children and young people and making sure that women are not portrayed in unacceptable ways in these video productions.
We need to be clear about not being seen as a 'nanny state'.
This has to be introduced in a reasonable way, in a way which is acceptable to everybody.
We also need to give special attention to the Internet. The Commissioner mentioned this.
It is difficult because regulation of the Internet is very much in its early days, but we must not shy away from it.
We need to find ways in which we can sensibly regulate the Internet in everyone's interests.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Frattini very much for the highly practical proposals that he has put forward this evening.
There is no doubt that Europe is seeing a worrying and exponential growth in cases of violence, bullying and violence among children, and television and the Internet are undeniably affecting the way our children behave, as is the spread of violent videogames, which are becoming increasingly common and increasingly brutal.
I shall just give you one example: there is a very recent videogame called Rule of Rose, which is a really serious problem in that the main characters in the game are children, and many of the images are on the borderline of sexual perversion and sadism.
We therefore warmly welcome the current debate, even though - as the President has mentioned - it has been tucked away in an evening slot and has very few participants.
That is a real shame.
Even so, we expect some sort of action to be taken in this matter, and certainly not through censorship, as Commissioner Reding has already said.
We support your initiative, Mr Frattini, of sending a letter to the EU Home Affairs Ministers asking them to carry out a careful check on the controls that exist regarding videogame violence.
After what Mrs Reding said, we hope that the PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) system will really become a body able to exercise more effective control.
To conclude, we strongly call for practical measures to be developed to control and prohibit the distribution of violent videogames and to set up a kind of European monitoring centre for childhood and young people, not least so as to carry out preventive monitoring of game and videogame content and, if possible, to draw up a single code for the marketing and distribution of videogames for children.
The debate is closed.
Amendment of the Rules of Procedure (committees, quaestors) (debate)
The next item is the report by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of Rules 15 and 182(1) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure - Election of Quaestors and committee bureaux.
deputising for the rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to begin by giving the apologies of the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, who could not be here tonight because he has to represent Parliament in a far-away part of the world.
He is on his way there as I speak.
I rise to propose, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, an amendment to our Rules of Procedure, which would see a fourth vice-chairman elected in each parliamentary committee, a bureau of four instead of three, and a College of Quaestors comprising six members instead of five.
Why has such a proposal come forward at this stage?
It arises from an amendment to our Rules tabled by just two Members of the European Parliament - Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering - who considered that this would facilitate the participation of Members of Parliament from across 27 Member States - as we will be in January - in positions of responsibility in Parliament.
It would be a measure that would be inclusive, that would enable more Members to hold positions of responsibility, and that would make it easier to distribute such posts politically across Parliament.
We took cognisance of that proposal in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
It is a very important consideration.
We also heard that there were strong arguments against creating what many considered to be an inflation of Parliamentary posts.
There is, after all, no functional necessity to have a larger bureau of each parliamentary committee.
Perhaps - although that is more debatable - there is no functional necessity to have a larger College of Quaestors.
It was pointed out by many colleagues that we have enough positions of responsibility across this Parliament for most Members who wish to exercise such positions to have one.
It was felt that perhaps this was a rather hasty change to the Rules being put forward, for reasons that were not convincing for all of our Members.
That is why we came up with a compromise in committee.
The rapporteur - the chairman of our committee - asked me to deputise for him tonight because I was the one that proposed that compromise, which is that we have a fourth vice-chairman of each parliamentary committee and a sixth Quaestor for the remainder of this Parliament, until 2009, but that we do not make it a permanent change.
In 2009 we should revert to the current situation of three vice-chairmen of each parliamentary committee and five Quaestors.
Indeed, the size of Parliament, which is about to increase with Romania and Bulgaria joining, will actually decline in 2009, back to 732 Members.
I am sure Mr Duff will correct me if I got the figure slightly wrong.
It is logical to take this step now, for inclusive reasons, but not make it a permanent change; to revert to the present numbers in 2009.
That is the position of the committee, which I put forward.
I must also say that it is the position adopted by a majority in my political group as well.
I know that there are other views in Parliament, but I submit it to Parliament for consideration.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are therefore looking at these two amendments.
What are the reasons for the change in the number of Quaestors?
When Parliament had 500 Members, we had five Quaestors, in other words, virtually one for every 100 MEPs.
If we stuck with that ratio with the proposed 780 Members, we would have a very high number.
If, as the Committee has suggested, we increase the number of Quaestors to six, that would be one Quaestor for every 130 Members of the House, still a larger number than was for many years the case.
I believe that the complexity of developments and of the problems that will arise in the House with 25 languages - I am now including Catalan and Irish, for example - that this complexity affecting the conduct of business and decisions justifies increasing that number from five to six for a time.
The same applies to the increase in the number of committee vice-chairmen.
It is an indisputable fact that, so far as anyone can judge, we will now from January 2007 to the middle of 2009 have the largest number of Members this Parliament is ever planned to have.
This unusually large number of MEPs suggests that, or is the reason why, a larger number of elected representatives will be appointed to the committees for the same period.
It is of course not only to do with the conduct of business but also with the fact that people are already in these posts and the new Bulgarian and Romanian Members are now coming, who are of course also entitled to such positions.
We would have to take them away from existing Members and give them to new ones.
From a formal, legal point of view that is of course possible, but it would not be conducive to, let us say, committed internal parliamentary work.
There would be frustrations and disappointments, which can be avoided by taking this approach.
I grant that one thing has perhaps not gone as well as it might.
We could and perhaps should have recognised this six months earlier.
That would have made it easier to talk these things through quietly with all the parliamentary groups.
The fact that this idea unfortunately occurred to those responsible only very late in the day made it look as though a sitting had to be held on Monday and a vote taken on it on Thursday.
I ask for your forbearance.
It can happen in political life that you hit upon a good idea later than events really require.
I ask for your understanding for that and readily admit that many honourable Members found this fact rather hard to understand.
There was no ill intent behind it, no funny business; only when the new situation became clear did we suddenly find there was a new problem we had not seen before.
To sum up, I believe this compromise of creating an extra post in two areas for a limited period while making clear that we will return to normal at the end of that period is a reasonable proposal that will be good for the conduct of parliamentary business and I ask for your agreement and understanding.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I do not expect that I will take up six and a half minutes on this matter, but I would like to thank Mr Corbett for nobly standing in to prosecute a cause for which I think he personally lacks a certain degree of enthusiasm, and to thank Mr Friedrich who, with his customary courtesy, is declining to upset current postholders by ousting them from the positions that they enjoy in Parliament.
But the fact is that for 53 more Members of Parliament we are creating a further 23 posts.
Some of these posts are described as jobs, as if there was employment attached.
That is not the case for the majority of vice-chairmen of the committees.
For the Quaestors, there is perhaps a solid argument for an increase to six.
Perhaps there really is work for six Quaestors, but for the vice-chairmen of the committees I fear it is inflation of posts for its own sake.
That cannot present an especially attractive side of our parliamentary life and I am anxious about the reaction of public opinion.
I also think it is not conducive to increased efficiency or effectiveness.
There is no functional necessity for these posts, rather the reverse.
There is a risk that the bureaux will become top-heavy superstructures.
I also disagree that we are facing extraordinary circumstances.
When Parliament expanded to accept these MEPs from 10 new accession states in 2004, we did not increase the size of the bureaux of the committees.
We all agree with and are grateful for the proposal to include a sunset clause.
I fear that when we come to 2009, a sort of bureaucratic paralysis will fall upon Parliament and we will all decide it is safer and quieter to stick with this inflated size of committee vice-chairmanships.
May the sun set upon this manoeuvre as soon as possible, and my own group will oppose the change of rules tomorrow.
Mr President, if, like me, you learned the political ropes through many years of experience from the perspective of a minority and in opposition, you will be familiar with the arrogance and nonchalance with which those in power allow themselves to be identified with the institutions in which they have a majority.
Then there are the moments of suffocation in which you feel like a fish in an aquarium.
You open your mouth nice and wide, but nobody can hear you.
The sun went down long ago, but this debate is taking place before the European public.
Parliament, which screams for transparency and presses the Council and the Commission to take citizens and their cares seriously, is discussing its own affairs late at night, and then after long squabbles and only when forced to do so by the small parties.
These are not, in fact, Parliament's affairs but manifestations of the psychological, group-dynamic greed of the big groups in this House, nationalistic balancing acts - a vanity fair - that are all to the cost of this House.
There is no rational justification for this measure.
Yes, there are two new Member States. That much is true.
Yet a short while ago we gained 10 new Member States and there was no expansion of the offices.
There are more MEPs, but not more committees.
The Quaestors do not have any extra work any more than the committees do.
This motion does not serve to meet Parliament's needs and improve the way it works, but rather to satisfy the greed of the political groups and to pacify their fights about distributing spoils, and all of this at the cost of this House's reputation for dignity and its ability to do its work.
So, as a silenced fish in an aquarium where the lights are about to be switched off, I say to you that this is a shameless, unnecessary and politically indefensible act, and we will be voting against it.
It is a shame that two MEPs are defending this proposal, but the whole of this House will adopt this motion with a large majority tomorrow lunchtime.
That is very sad.
deputising for the rapporteur. - Mr President, I just wish to say that, while I understand fully the arguments against this proposal, it is unfair to characterise it, as Mr Voggenhuber did, as a conspiracy between the two big groups.
After all, the extra positions created would also benefit the small groups.
Indeed, the D'Hondt system that we customarily apply is one which, when there is a small number of posts to be distributed, arguably favours the big groups, but, when there is a larger number of posts to be distributed, it favours the small groups.
Therefore, I do not think the conspiracy theory is a correct analysis.
Certainly, on top of that, it was contested in my group: there was a lively debate on whether this was a good or bad thing for Parliament.
Opinions were divided, which was why we were so happy with the compromise that has been adopted with this 'sunset clause'.
On this point I do not think there are any rules to be formally adhered to, and therefore Mr Voggenhuber may take the floor briefly, although the debate itself cannot be reopened.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Corbett is right, and he has the honour of being one of the two Members given the task of defending this proposal.
I was not attacking him, specifically.
If the small groups were to take part in this shamelessness and keep their mouths shut, a crumb might fall from the cake for them too, here or there: of that, we are well aware.
The debate is closed.

A European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy - Biomass and Biofuels - Nuclear Safety and Security Assistance (debate)
Madam President, Members have decided to hold a joint debate on the three reports by Mrs Morgan, Mr Langen and Mr SeppÃ€nen.
This provides an excellent opportunity to discuss topics of key importance for energy policy just before the new year, topics that brought a great deal of inquietude last year.
Let me begin by addressing the report on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy.
First, I wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Morgan, for her impressive work on the energy Green Paper.
I also wish to thank and congratulate the draftsmen, Mr Zieleniec, Mr Wijkman, Mr Markov, Mr Ehler, Mrs Tzampazi, Mr Takkula and Mr VlasÃ¡k, for their contributions.
This document is an important contribution to the Commission's work on the strategic energy review.
Your work over recent months has fed into the Commission's wider deliberations on the future of energy policy in Europe.
I agree that the European Union needs an integrated, coherent and consistent European energy policy that maintains Europe's competitiveness, safeguards our environmental objectives and ensures our security of supply.
I also agree on the nature of the climate change challenge.
Climate change provides the strongest encouragement for a new energy policy.
Energy accounts for over 90 % of carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union, so we cannot tackle climate change without the right energy policies.
I agree that the European Union needs to show vision and determination to lead the world in accelerating the shift to a low-carbon economy. At the heart of this must be ambitious but credible targets for further reductions in greenhouse gases beyond 2012.
Without a functioning internal market, the emissions-trading system - the cornerstone of our efforts to deal with climate change in a competitive manner - will not work properly, nor will we achieve our aims of competitiveness and security of supply.
Therefore, the Commission will keep up the pressure on Member States to implement the legislation fully.
This week, we adopted another package of infringement measures against 16 Member States.
At this stage, we are conducting infringement proceedings against 19 Member States, and I believe that shows our determination really to implement the internal market.
In addition, in line with the conclusions of the internal market report and the final report on the energy sector inquiry, the Commission now intends to take action to address the remaining issues under the following headings: ensuring non-discriminatory access to well-developed networks, notably by looking at the issue of unbundling; improving regulation of network access at national and EU levels, which includes better cooperation at EU level between regulators; reducing the scope for unfair competition, through increased transparency and improved access to storage facilities; providing a clear framework for investment; and strengthening the focus of the public service obligation.
However, the internal market can achieve its goal only on the basis of decisions taken by European citizens.
The role of citizens is particularly important with respect to our energy efficiency agenda.
This is an area where everyone can contribute to a more sustainable and secure world, and we welcome your support for the energy efficiency action plan.
Europe's citizens can also make a difference to the role of renewables in our energy mix, but we cannot expect people to make the necessary shift unless the political and investment plan is right.
That is why I agree with the need for a stable and long-term framework for renewables.
Climate change, globalisation and longer-term targets call for a renewed effort on the technology front.
We all want to see Europe lead the way in global research, which means spending existing research budgets better, getting them to work as a catalyst leading to increased industry research funding in the European Union.
The importance of the external dimension is also well articulated in the report.
This year, our external policy has taken some very important steps: the establishment of the energy community and new agreements with several producer countries and transit countries, including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.
I would like to address Mr Langen's report on a strategy for biomass and biofuels. First of all, I would like to thank Mr Langen for this valuable contribution and his great help to us in the Commission as we look forward on the issue of renewable energy, including bioenergy.
First, the EU, acting collectively, will need to strengthen the legislative framework for renewable energy, committing itself to the establishment of a stable regulatory framework based on ambitious targets.
Longer-term, more ambitious objectives up to 2020 will need binding obligations on the part of Member States to guarantee burden-sharing and the development of an internal renewable energy market.
At the same time, we should allow a certain degree of flexibility to enable Member States to focus their attention on certain areas on the basis of their specific strengths and weaknesses.
Second, this framework will need to include legislative measures tailored to the specific obstacles facing renewable energy in individual sectors.
For example, access to the grid is a key issue for renewable energy in electricity.
The existing provision in this area may need to be strengthened.
As regards heating, measures are needed to overcome unnecessary planning barriers to solar panels, for example, and to create a level playing field for district heating.
In transport, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the extra cost for biofuels is greater than that of renewable energies in other sectors, but we need biofuels in the energy mix because they are a tool not only for combating climate change, but also in terms of security of supply.
In looking at the detail of the report, there are three basic points that I would like to highlight.
First, I welcome the emphasis the report places on the certification of biofuels to ensure that, whether produced in Europe or abroad, they need sustainability standards.
I understand the logic behind the proposed ban on the use of palm oil.
However, as the work of the round table on sustainable palm oil has demonstrated, the environmental impact of palm oil production can display enormous variations, and this has to be taken into account.
Second, I share the view that second-generation biofuels are critically important.
They offer better greenhouse gas performance and improve security of supply by widening the range of feedstocks from which biofuels can be made.
However, let us not create a false opposition between first- and second-generation biofuels.
First-generation biofuels improve security of supply, too, by reducing dependence on oil, and they also offer greenhouse gas savings compared with conventional fuels.
Moreover, first-generation biofuels serve as a bridge to the second generation.
As second-generation biofuels come onto the market, they will take over the supply and distribution networks and plants of the first generation.
Finally, I would like to endorse the view that there is a need to do more to inform society in general, and farmers in particular, about the use of biomass and biofuels.
We should particularly encourage farmers to venture into the new world of production of farm food and energy grasses.
Now I would like to address Mr SeppÃ€nen's report on the Council regulation establishing an instrument for nuclear safety and security assistance.
I wish to acknowledge and thank Mr SeppÃ€nen for the efforts made by the rapporteur and by Parliament as a whole to present this report in good time in order to have the new instrument available before the end of this year.
Improvement of nuclear safety has been an important part of our work in central and eastern European countries, as well as in the Community of Independent States, notably in Ukraine and Russia.
But we have also made an effort in other countries, such as Armenia and Kazakhstan.
It will remain essential in the coming years, as most of our neighbours and emerging economies rely heavily on nuclear power in order to satisfy their energy needs.
Because of the lack of time, I cannot comment on each amendment.
However, I should like to highlight some important considerations that prevent us from accepting some of the amendments.
I will not address the amendments on which we agree.
In Amendment 3, the rapporteur proposes to add a reference to the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.
The Commission considers that this is not the objective of this instrument and that it is covered by the instrument of stability.
Amendment 7 states that 'priority should be given to assisting nuclear installations and activities which are likely to have significant effects on the Member States'.
I understand the concerns that have led to this proposal.
I would stress that the Community primarily supports improvement in nuclear safety installations close to our borders.
However, I should like to repeat that the new instrument has a global objective; a nuclear accident in one place is a nuclear accident everywhere, as direct or indirect consequences will affect the whole world.
Finally, Amendments 27 and 28, limiting the scope of application of the instrument 'only to nuclear facilities that are or were in operation in third countries on the date of [the instrument's] entry into force'.
While it is clear that we will not provide assistance to the design and construction of new plants in third countries, there should be a possibility to provide assistance vis-Ã -vis all existing plants.
Otherwise, we would lose an efficient instrument to influence nuclear safety abroad.
To conclude, I once again pay tribute to the work of Parliament and all the committees involved on the Green Paper, the strategy for biomass and biofuels and the nuclear safety instrument.
I look forward to continuing our joint work for Europe's energy future.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - Madam President, at the beginning of this year a harsh shiver went through the homes of many people in Western Europe as the Russian firm Gazprom turned off the supplies to Ukraine.
The effects of that were felt throughout the European Union.
A harsh shiver went down the spine of many politicians as we realised that in future, if we were to continue on our current trajectory, over 80% of our gas was likely to come from outside the EU.
There are real security-of-supply issues that need to be addressed very quickly.
On top of this, there is an increasing awareness of the climate change agenda.
It is affecting our planet more quickly and in more dramatic ways than were hitherto imagined.
If we are to stem the tide of the effects that humans are having on the environment, we surely have to start by making radical changes in the way we use and produce energy.
I would like to think that the report we are voting on today will be an adequate response to those challenges.
The Commission has set out its stall on the scale of the problem.
We hope we have responded constructively to some of the tough choices that need to be made.
There has been no doubt that this is an opportunity for the EU to prove itself to the citizens of Europe.
This is one of the greatest contributions that Parliament has made to this debate, putting citizens and consumers right back into the centre of the energy debate.
If we are to take on these challenges the consumer has to be involved and we have to recognise that energy poverty is a real issue for millions of our citizens.
Energy efficiency is surely the most cost-effective way of meeting some of the energy challenges we face, and the Commission has come up with a very comprehensive action plan on energy consumption and energy efficiency.
It is imperative that we try to make the European Union the most energy-efficient economy in the world by 2020.
This is a great example of a situation where we already have reams of legislation in place and Member States are ignoring the laws that they have signed up to.
We have to reach a stage where we cut our energy consumption by 20%.
Implementation on this is absolutely crucial and I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what further steps we can take.
You suggested that we are going to initiate more infringement proceedings - but can we do more to name and shame Member States that are not implementing the laws that they have signed up to?
For too long, many Member States have been more concerned about getting the best deal for their national energy champions than helping or providing benefits for the consumer.
Why is it that in the UK last year 19% of the public switched energy companies, while in France the figure was less than 2%?
Is it because all the citizens in France and in Germany are happy with their energy suppliers?
I doubt it.
I suggest that it is because it is extremely difficult for many companies to access these markets because of some companies' in-built vested interests in keeping others out.
That is why we have to do something very serious in opening up and unbundling the energy networks.
When you arrive in the UK on the Eurostar, the first sign you see is a huge sign which says that ÃlectricitÃ© de France is giving power to millions of Londoners.
I dream of the day when I can get off the train in Paris and read a sign that says: 'Centrica - still not in Russian hands - providing power to millions of Parisians'.
I am afraid that day is a long way off.
Security of supply and sustainability have to go hand-in-hand.
We have to use mechanisms such as the emissions trading scheme to drive the economy.
Energy mix is up to Member States, but let us be sensible and acknowledge that the energy mix in one country will affect others, and that is why we need targets on cutting CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020.
We are insistent on binding sectoral targets of 25% in renewable energies.
That means no less than a revolution in the way that many Member States produce their energy.
We spend pitiful amounts on research and development and we have to work towards a truly common European energy policy in external affairs.
I would like to thank the other political parties, in particular Mr Reul, Mrs Ek, Mr Turmes and Mr SeppÃ€nen for their contributions and their support in this debate.
I hope, Commissioner, you will take on some of our ideas and we look forward to receiving your ideas on the strategic energy review in the new year.
rapporteur. - (FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I drafted the report for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on assistance to third countries in nuclear safety and security.
This regulation would mean additional assistance granted for other purposes and is necessary for the sake of an appropriate legal basis.
Assistance cannot be granted for improved nuclear safety and security in third countries without the legal basis established under this Regulation, which is Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty.
Thereafter, the EU can, for example, continue its work to improve nuclear safety and security in the old TACIS countries even after the TACIS programme has been discontinued.
Commissioner, it is the opinion of the Committee, not just the rapporteur but the Committee, that the EU should not provide assistance for the construction of new nuclear power stations, but only to improve the safety and security of the existing and functioning ones and other nuclear plants.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled Amendment 27 to the text adopted by the Committee regarding this.
The intention is good, but the wording does not make the matter any clearer; instead, it introduces a problem of interpretation.
When they say that nuclear plants eligible for assistance should be operating on the date of entry into force of the Regulation, it remains unclear whether plants that exist and are in working order but on that precise day are being serviced or are otherwise out of action can then receive assistance.
It is not appropriate to exclude such plants from assistance, and so I, for my own part, cannot sanction this amendment.
To my mind, Parliament's purpose in this matter is clearly expressed in other Articles.
This assistance should not just be given to improve safety and security at existing plants, nor should it be used for building new plants.
We should remember that responsibility for nuclear safety always lies with the plant itself and that EU aid to improve the safety and security of nuclear plants is only complementary aid.
It will help with the transfer of the special skills of the EU, its Member States or the International Atomic Energy Agency to nuclear plants in third countries, but there are not any economic preconditions for its use in eligible countries.
Finally, I wish to table an oral amendment to the report and correct the sum budgeted in the Committee's Amendment 25 and in the multiannual financial framework to EUR 524 million.
I wish to thank everyone for their excellent levels of cooperation.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Madam President, with one minute of speaking time I can only make two points.
First, biofuels are indeed very important, but they have to be produced in the most efficient way.
Biofuel production in tropical countries is much more efficient than in Europe.
Instead of benefiting fully from that, we seem to be ready to put a levy on such imports.
If we can import oil and gas from Saudi Arabia without levies, why are there levies on biofuels?
Apart from the efficiency argument, we are also depriving the low-income countries of much-needed income.
Secondly, emissions in China and India are expanding very rapidly. That is why, in its opinion, the Committee on Development has suggested that our Union should establish a proactive strategy of technology cooperation with these countries, offering financial support to cover some of the extra costs for the most efficient technologies possible.
Amendment 5 suggests replacing 'financial' with 'technical'.
We must be more ambitious than that, otherwise emissions from these countries will overwhelm us in the future.
Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote against Amendment 5.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (FR) Madam President, I shall start by thanking Mr Langen for his willingness to listen and for the wisdom and courage he has shown in his report.
The Committee on International Trade, having observed how far behind the European Union is in both the consumption and production of biofuels, has proposed that we increase imports, which is quite natural, but also that we focus more closely on European industrial production, with the dual aim of achieving energy independence for the EU and of providing outlets for agricultural crops such as sugar-producing plants.
The costs of producing ethanol are EUR 25 per hectolitre in Brazil, EUR 35 in the United States and EUR 45 in the European Union: that is why we are suggesting that it would be advisable to set, for a specified period, an acceptable level of penetration of bioethanol imports into the EU that can be reconciled with the gradual development of Community production, in line with the European sustainable development strategy.
Madam President, in our experience, liberalisation of the energy sector has always resulted in higher prices and worse service.
Within the EU, liberalisation and the separation of energy producers and distributors have resulted in under-investment in production plants and electricity transport networks.
It is this policy that was responsible for the blackouts in November 2006, and it will inevitably result in huge problems in the coming years.
Under these circumstances, we must as a matter of urgency accelerate investment in research in all fields, including nuclear technology, so that we can meet the challenges of the post-oil era and combat greenhouse gases.
It is imperative that we end the requirement for separation of energy producers and energy transport networks and that we halt all further attempts to liberalise the energy sector.
That is why I would advocate creating a European energy agency to coordinate the Member States' energy policies and their efforts in terms of research and development.
This body would head an economic interest group at EU level, which would involve all electricity production and distribution companies and would ensure access for all to reasonably priced energy.
Energy is not a commodity like any other: it is a common asset for humanity.
Madam President, as with other new regulations, the task of the Committee on Budgets in the case of the Regulation on Nuclear Safety and Security Assistance has been to ensure that the provisions thereof conform with the provisions of the new interinstitutional agreement that came into force in May this year.
That is the essence of my opinion. It was made easier by the fact that the rapporteur, Mr SeppÃ€nen, is a member of the Committee on Budgets.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food safety. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rationalisation of the use of energy, like the penetration of renewable sources in the Union's energy mix, is a universal demand for the Union.
The Union therefore needs to take all the measures needed in order to implement the demand for a common European energy policy.
This demand is expressed through the report by Mrs Morgan, whom I would like to congratulate.
It is important that we understand that the Union could save up to 20% of its current energy consumption. This is therefore an exploitable source of energy within the Union.
This saving could be achieved from the strict application of the Union's existing legal framework.
We have the necessary tools at our disposal today, by which I mean the Structural Funds.
For the next programming period from 2007 to 2013, an environmentally-friendly policy needs to be added to the European Regional Development Fund.
Madam President, I am speaking in my capacity as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on Mr SeppÃ€nen's report.
My committee is, broadly speaking, delighted with the report drafted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I would like to use the minute available to me to emphasise the following specific points: first of all, the support that the Community should provide for the drafting, under the aegis of the AIEA, of a code of conduct for the international monitoring system for nuclear incidents; secondly, the vital importance of the 'polluter-pays' principle in forcing third countries and operators to accept their responsibilities; and, thirdly, funding for cleaning up old nuclear sites, on the express condition that a high degree of safety can be guaranteed for lower costs and within a reasonable period.
On the other hand, it is regrettable that our amendments on the changes to the legal basis, the taking into account of independent audits by the European Court of Auditors and budgetary rigour with regard to consultation, to name but a few, were not accepted.
I am also delighted, on a personal level, that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy accepted my amendment to recital 13, pointing out that the Member States have sovereignty to make their own choices in the field of nuclear power.
What works for Austria will not necessarily work for Finland or Belgium.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Madam President, I welcome the two Commission communications on the biomass action plan and on the EU strategy for biofuels.
Clearly, there is an urgent need to increase the demand for bioenergy in order to combat climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce oil dependency and to enhance technology and economic development within the European Union.
The question is, how do we do that?
I consider that increasing demand in bioenergy would be achieved by prioritising research, development and demonstration of bioenergy and biofuels - particularly regarding second-generation and most efficient products - by promoting the creation of transparent and open markets and the removal of market barriers and through information campaigns involving producers, suppliers and consumers.
It is paramount for the future of bioenergy increase that this increase should not jeopardise European or third countries' ability to achieve environmental priorities, such as halting the loss of biodiversity, protecting forests, preventing soil degradation and achieving the good ecological status of its water body.
I welcome the Langen report's inclusion of the Environment Committee's request that the Commission introduce a mandatory and comprehensive certification system.
Coordination within Commission departments and Member State government departments encompassing an integrated approach is key.
I would urge the Commission to monitor progress and to formulate a cohesive policy involving all actors in the process of production and supply of biomass and biofuels.
In addition, it is crucial that Member States are allowed the necessary discretion and flexibility to decide for themselves their own goals and political measures, while reaching broad Community targets.
Bioenergy production should always comply with good agricultural practice and should not significantly affect domestic food production within the European Union and in third countries, and incentives should not be intended as indirect subsidies but should be limited to that which provides the highest efficiency, as well as environmental and climate benefits.
However, increased bioenergy production would provide a very positive boost to the farming community, and I believe investment in small-scale biofuel projects within the primary agricultural sector would be extremely beneficial.
I welcome the Commission's proposal to encourage public procurement of clean and efficient vehicles, including using high biofuel blends.
I call on Member States to encourage the development of national bioenergy action plans and welcome my own Government's move towards encouraging bioenergy production and incentives in the transport sector, as evidenced in last week's budget in my country.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to commend Mrs Morgan on her work, including the negotiated compromise, which reflects the views of the various political groupings among the Committee membership as well as experience gained in the field.
As draftsman of the opinion of Committee on Regional Development, I firmly believe that when it comes to drawing up Europe's energy policy we must work, above all, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, because concrete decisions on the energy mix and preferences in the area of renewable energy sources or nuclear energy must always be taken at Member State level, so that the geographical, climatic and economic conditions of a particular region can be taken into account.
We should also be aware that the cheapest energy is that which we do not have to produce at all.
The path we must follow is therefore that of energy saving.
In this context, there is great potential particularly in cities, which account for more than 70% of energy consumed, and this is why the Commission must initiate genuine dialogue with cities in particular, but also with autonomous entities and their associations.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of this debate we had the situation of January 2006, as Mrs Morgan pointed out.
It has become clear that Europe is tremendously energy-dependent.
In the year 2000, Europe's energy dependency was 50%, in 2030 it will be around 70%.
This means that security of supply is assuming a new, dramatic importance.
It also means that foreign policy needs to be refocused and new conclusions drawn in the matter of securing and using our own energy resources.
Finally, it also means that we need to rethink the issue of fine-tuning these three objectives of security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.
I do not believe we need only to put forward new ideas and concepts; as Mr Langen has already said, we need to try gradually to change reality.
We must put more value on the question of implementation and change.
What use are all the proposals if in reality hardly anything changes?
I am therefore very glad that with this report, we have contributed rather more realistic ways of looking at things.
We cannot demand reliability of investors and we cannot demand that undertakings invest more if we do not also offer reliability in the long term on the political side.
Constantly new proposals and constantly new institutions will not get us any further.
It also means, for example, that we should stop and think first when it comes to ownership unbundling.
Let us implement stage 1 before starting stage 2, because I have my doubts as to whether the expropriation or nationalisation of networks is the right solution.
The answer to the problem will not be a single solution but variety.
Energy efficiency yes, renewable energies yes, but we must also recognise that these offer only limited solutions to our problem.
There is no changing that.
If we want to reduce CO2, we must also invest more in nuclear power.
We do not want any subject to be taboo here; we want openness, variety, diversity, flexibility and realism.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) As co-rapporteur, I would like to add my voice to welcome Mr SeppÃ€nen's report on increasing the safety of nuclear reactors operating in third countries.
Europe has always played a leading role globally in the field of nuclear safety, and this programme will continue to assist us in this area over the next seven years.
The safety of nuclear energy depends for the most part on human factors.
The planning, construction, operation, maintenance, supervision, transportation and decommissioning of nuclear reactors are undeniably human responsibilities, for which requisite staffing and appropriate expertise and equipment are necessary.
This programme, destined for the Republics of the former Soviet Union, which are the European Union's immediate neighbours to the east, is therefore particularly important from the perspective of our own energy supply and safety as well.
At the same time, it will help European - and among them Hungarian - companies, researchers and universities which have the requisite nuclear safety, significant tradition and relevant experience to gain access to promising external markets.
I ask the committee charged with making decisions regarding the programme, and the European Commission, which is responsible for carrying it out, to do so as effectively as possible.
Please allow me to take this opportunity as well to congratulate the other two rapporteurs, and especially to mention the point made in Eluned Morgan's report, namely that it is abundantly clear that energy should not be primarily about the industries of the energy sector, but about the people whom they affect, that is to say, the consumers.
The key element in European energy strategy is to ensure that Europe's residents enjoy appropriate living conditions and to guarantee a supply of secure, affordable energy that is indispensable if we are to remain competitive.
I wish especially to congratulate the authors of the report for having succeeded in establishing harmony among the added value of the internal market, global challenges and the subsidiarity of Member States.
I offer my congratulations to the rapporteurs on this day and I hope, Commissioner, that you will have the opportunity to implement all this in the coming year.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues for their cooperation.
A prosperous, competitive and sustainable future for Europe will require a major shift in energy policy.
Today we have problems with production, distribution, consumers' rights as well as global warming, stability and security.
The challenge and urgent development of a new European energy policy is an opportunity for European citizens, European industry and the environment.
Therefore I welcome an ambitious energy agenda from the Commission next year.
I underline the importance of the message from Parliament today.
I therefore ask my colleagues to support the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where we succeeded in combining an enforced market solution, enhancing market entry for new players, more transparency and consumers' rights to information, with a clear political signal on long-term international and binding targets on renewable energy and CO2 reduction.
Moreover, I should like to emphasise the importance of including the distributor and consumer aspects to the current production concentration and to stress that existing technologies such as combined heat and power, trigeneration and district heating must be used to a much larger extent, reducing and making more efficient the energy we use.
Energy policy should not be considered as an isolated issue.
It is vital to develop FP7 as well as the reform of the CAP in line with the needs of an increased indigenous European energy production.
Parliament will support current structures of cooperation between Member States and the Commission's firm conviction to further develop them.
However, we are not in favour of new agencies causing a financial, as well as a bureaucratic, burden on the Union.
I should like to express my strong support for Commissioner Kroes' ambition to make sure competition legislation is not violated, in order to avoid abuse of market power.
Experiences are like stars: you see them first towards sunset.
The EU has the possibility to seize the opportunity to greatly improve the energy market, solve environmental problems and create new jobs.
Let us take that opportunity.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Morgan and Mrs Ek for a political line that combines environment with competition.
This is the way forward.
(DE) Madam President, Europe stands at a crossroads.
We have an energy and transport policy for a handful of big companies.
That means a green light for petrol-guzzling heavy vehicles, coal-fired power stations that damage the climate, hazardous technology, atomic power, unfair competition and the continuation of the profiteering we have on the market today.
That is the policy that the Commission - that is, Commissioner Verheugen with the active support of Mr Barroso - wants to put through against Commissioners with relevant expertise like Mr Piebalgs, Mrs Kroes or Mr Dimas.
There is also, however, an energy and transport policy for Europe's citizens and for thousands of small businessmen and tradesmen.
Such a policy would involve massive investment to modernise European buildings, creating thousands of new jobs, reducing Europe's energy dependence, including for gas, and getting improved standards for mass consumer goods like cars, refrigerators, flat screens and houses.
It is also very important that the existing directive on the promotion of renewable energy sources should continue in force, since it is so successful it is a thorn in the flesh of E.ON and EDF.
You have promised us a new directive on heating and cooling in January, Commissioner.
That directive must come, then the citizens will act accordingly.
We also need more competition. We only have this one planet.
We should not abandon it to the short-term profit interests of a few large companies and their political accomplices.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I participated in the Nairobi climate conference, which produced some significant statements and commitments.
First and foremost, it has now been decided that Kyoto will continue to exist after 2012.
In addition, channels of action have been opened up which go much further than trading in emissions quotas and which, instead, point the way to proactive, positive measures.
There will be two funds, one for technological adaptation and the other for renewable and clean energy.
Finally, the issues of technology transfer and combating deforestation were discussed.
Kofi Annan is right in saying that such approaches require stronger political leadership, and it is Europe that must express this political will, partly through the submission by the individual nations of serious, properly documented plans for reducing emissions, in line with the Kyoto targets and based on substantial progress in energy conservation and renewable sources of energy.
The European Parliament could, through its own Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, take on the role of providing encouragement and an impetus in that direction, not least through collaboration with the national parliaments.
What is needed is positive direction, which requires active political support and policies focused on cooperation and innovation instead of the purely commercial logic of privatisations and liberalisations, which all too often work in favour of speculative interests and not the public good.
Recently, there has been sparring on the nuclear issue: safety is best served by not using nuclear power, but avoiding it and holding back from it on the grounds that it does not benefit our future.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Morgan for drawing up this report.
The Green Book provides a very good basis for drawing up a cohesive energy strategy for Europe, and in the broader context, for the whole world.
It is a problem of fundamental importance, involving not only the supply of fuels, be they in solid, liquid or gas form, or of generating electricity, without which the whole world would grind to a halt, or simply of heating and air conditioning, but also of protecting the environment and averting harmful climate change.
Energy clearly also has a political dimension, as the widely known cases of shutting off gas supplies have shown.
Bearing in mind that time is limited, I would like to point out just a few problems.
Trading in greenhouse gas emissions is a worldwide problem and requires global solutions.
The European Union has to get the ball rolling on this.
Any mistakes could result in irreparable damage to the whole of the earth's atmosphere.
Innovation in energy policy involves both searching for new, renewable and clean sources of energy and radical rationalisation of its consumption.
In my view, we waste some twenty-five percent of all energy through inefficient equipment or through poorly thought-out transmission or organisational solutions.
I hope the Intelligent Energy Programme of the seventh framework programme will go some way to addressing this problem.
Road, rail, air and sea transport are in need of a new type of logistics where concern for the future takes priority over immediate financial interests or convenience.
I would like to ask, how many people drove to work unaccompanied today?
Energy security requires the establishment of back-up networks.
Otherwise we will experience a domino effect.
Examples from as recently as November show the fragility of current systems.
The European Union must observe the principles of solidarity and joint action in relation to energy suppliers.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, it is well known that if someone's only tool is a hammer, he gradually begins to see every problem as a nail.
The reason for this is obvious: a hammer's only real use is for banging nails in, so he has to imagine all problems as nails.
However, most of the problems we encounter in life are not nails so, with that attitude, most things go wrong.
A hammer cannot be used for making Venetian vases or convincing a political opponent.
What, however, the majority in this House have, is a hammer, namely the European Union.
Most of you want to believe or, rather, want to make others believe that the problems that happen to come to the fore at any particular time should, or must, be solved with the aid of the EU.
In actual fact, such problems are rare, the exceptions including nuclear safety, radiation protection and the problems associated with nuclear material in the EU and its vicinity.
Mr SeppÃ€nen is on the right track and should receive our support, but Mrs Morgan, who is threatening to bureaucratise energy policy to such a degree that, even in the short term, a million people will be needed to implement it, is on the wrong track.
Adjustments in the light of rising energy prices are best made at national level.
It is through countries and companies competing to find effective solutions to energy issues that creativity can flourish, not through imposing more bureaucracy on half a billion people living in economies quite different from each other.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add two comments to this joint debate on energy.
The first is that the European Union has absolutely no competence over energy, so much so that the various reports all stress that the Member States still have exclusive powers to make their own energy choices.
On top of that, Mrs Morgan has included a specific reference to maximum subsidiarity.
Everything in these reports, though, contradicts these statements, with their prescriptivism and demands.
The second is that the Europe of Brussels has already shown what it is capable of, by usurping the right to run energy policy and liberalising the gas and electricity markets.
What has been the outcome of this?
Higher prices for consumers, attacks on standardisation of tariffs and therefore on public service, blackouts, concerns regarding the maintenance, expansion and modernisation of the networks, and the list goes on.
We are currently watching the sector become increasingly concentrated, to the point that the much lauded competition that you bend our ears about is on the verge of becoming a monopolisation of the energy market by a handful of multinational companies.
The only difference is that these monopolies will be in the hands of private investors, and perhaps not even European ones, instead of the public sector.
Therefore, we are certainly in favour of energy security and energy efficiency, but it is up to the sovereign states to control these strategic matters.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have read in the Austrian media that the Temelin nuclear power station will soon have had its one hundredth emergency.
The Commission relies for information on the good will of the Member States' authorities.
Nevertheless, my sincere thanks go to Commissioner Piebalgs for promising to send an official letter to enquire how dangerous the Temelin power plant actually is.
I also welcome Amendment 5 to the SeppÃ€nen report, which has to do with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the area of safeguards and safety of nuclear power plants.
The Community should in future draft a code of conduct for an international nuclear incident warning system under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The SeppÃ€nen report makes an excellent proposal there.
We need peer review by experts who are empowered to make inspections not only in the Member States but at European level so that if risks arise a nuclear power station can be taken off line, by court order if necessary.
We owe that to the safety and health of Europe's citizens and population.
The Council must abandon the obstructive attitude it has taken in the past and agree to such a peer review group in the interests of safety.
We know that the safety regulations differ greatly, in the area of decommissioning and final storage in particular.
The result is a crass difference in costs and those with the laxest safeguards and safety measures and who do not bother about decommissioning and final storage will stand to gain.
We cannot have that.
I thank you for your support, Mr Piebalgs, and hope that the Commission will act resolutely in this matter.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, we support the reports and I congratulate the rapporteurs.
I would mention two matters.
We do not just have a problem with imports of energy, creating uncertainty, but also one with our own actions here in the Union.
Our spare energy capacity stands at 4.8% and is falling every year, while before it was 15-20%.
We have therefore drifted into crises as a result of our own actions.
Now we need to invest in new capacity, networks need to be built and improved, and we really must now ask governments to help.
We obviously also have to put a lot more effort into addressing the problem of energy consumption.
The other matter is that energy has become not just a political issue, but also a social one.
The poorer the consumer, the harder the situation is for him when energy prices are high, and this consumer should be at the centre of energy policy, just as it says in Mrs Morgan's report.
I would also like to ask the Commission what it intends to do to improve social energy security.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that energy is the European Union's lifeline.
Unfortunately, we only think about it occasionally, on Sundays.
I believe the EU as a whole is being very naive in the way it is dealing with the subject of energy.
Energy policy still consists of half-measures and the Member States are following different strategies.
The spring summit on energy was a failure, that has become clear.
The EU-Russia summit, that was important for us and had an energy component, collapsed because of Polish beef.
There are ideological disputes over atomic policy, these are things that are holding us up.
There are important regions of the world that could be key suppliers for us, such as Central Asia, but we have paid them little attention so far.
China, as has been mentioned several times in the debate, is building a large number of strategic alliances in the world in this very matter.
On the other hand, we are very highly dependent on oil and gas, we do not have sufficient interconnectors for a genuine European energy market, as we saw not long ago with this year's blackout.
I think that is a very poor record over all.
We therefore very much welcome the fact that you are getting more action plans off the ground, Commissioner, that the German Council Presidency will be concentrating on energy and that countries such as Finland, for example, are taking a very non-ideological and nevertheless very successful approach to energy policy by investing very heavily in biomass and also in atomic power at the same time, because they have obviously recognised the signs of the times.
I also particularly welcome the fact, Commissioner, that with the biomass action plan you have made what will probably be a very important contribution to energy diversification, to reducing our dependence on other regions of the world and to the 'lisbonisation' of our entire EU agenda.
I am thinking in particular of the agricultural plan here.
The plans are on the table. Now it is up to the Member States to stick to those plans.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have some very different reports on the table about energy strategies.
In my opinion, the Morgan report and the Langen report really deal with a positive future and a paradigm change in the energy industry as it has existed up until now, while the SeppÃ€nen report is actually about clearing up waste and contamination.
As I fully agree with Mrs Morgan, I would like to concentrate on the SeppÃ€nen report now and say that I find what this report suggests to be completely unacceptable.
Nuclear safety is and remains more fiction than reality.
If we look back over the past year and review the greatest events that made us sit up and take notice, then it has to be said that the European Union in general really ought to be aware of this.
We have had a helpless argument with Iran, which is threatening to build the atom bomb. We have been shaken by the nuclear test in North Korea and we can only say that the non-proliferation pact is a dead letter.
In the European Union we have the Forsmark atomic power plant in Sweden.
Sweden is a country that says it has the safest atomic power stations.
The Swedish supervisory authorities confront us with the fact that this reactor was only 18 minutes from runaway.
That emergency was not even discussed, let alone addressed, at European level.
We have taken on a great responsibility with clearing up the consequences of the Chernobyl reactor accident, but what do we find?
Incompetence, corruption in connection with the Shelter Implementation Plan, and nobody really knows what is the way forward there.
We also have a polonium scandal.
Large quantities of polonium, a highly radioactive substance from the Russian nuclear cities, are misappropriated, transported all over Europe, and no one knows how it can have happened.
So do not tell me anything about nuclear safety; it would be better to talk about nuclear insecurity.
(DE) Mr President, the various reports in the field of energy are actually quite typical of this European Parliament.
There is a lot in them and a lot of it is right.
At the heart of it, however, these reports are problematical.
They talk repeatedly about the energy mix.
That means of course that they are still looking to atomic energy and atomic energy is and remains wrong and dangerous.
When will the various people in authority at last learn the lessons of Chernobyl and the recent near-accidents in Sweden?
The only correct response is to get out of atomic energy immediately!
The EU is failing to encourage research, it is failing on energy efficiency and renewable energies.
It is a scandal that twice as much money, EUR 1.6 billion, is being spent on the arms research race in space as on a change of direction in energy.
The German foreign minister is always talking about 'energy foreign policy'.
This shows that the EU has global political ambitions, at other people's expense.
Instead of that, we need to get out of atomic energy immediately and invest massively in renewable energies, energy research instead of armaments research and cooperation in the field of energy foreign policy.
Mr President, there are over 100 clauses in this report on energy security, and nearly all of them call on the Commission to do something: to fix the carbon trading scheme, to foster investment in the European energy market, to encourage energy efficiency, to do more and more.
The Commission is going to be busy.
I want to question two assumptions about this ambitious programme.
First, it is assumed that the Commission somehow has the ability to address all these problems, as if it had a magic wand.
Second, it is assumed that the EU Member States can be persuaded to cooperate.
They will cooperate, as long as it is in their interest to do so, for instance, in selling surplus power - at a profit - to neighbours.
But when national energy security is at stake, all the Commission's powers will not be enough, and nations will look after themselves.
Compare the 'cooperation' over fishing that has brought several common species close to extinction.
My biggest worry, however, is that so much of what we are asking for, such as trying to meet impossible targets for carbon dioxide and renewables, pays little regard to the economic cost.
I fear that implementation of many of the recommendations in this report will be as economically damaging as the REACH Directive, which this Chamber triumphantly approved yesterday.
Mr President, you cannot have an open market in energy and a workable policy of energy-sharing without transparent competition.
The Commission's Green Paper recognises this.
However, on the island of Ireland, as part of a wider British Isles and European project, the opportunities for a free and fair market are being stifled by the state domination of the Republic of Ireland's market by the ESB.
Its near-monopoly of both generation and distribution must be broken, as it is keeping others out of the market and smothering competition.
I have to say that the Dublin Government has been most tardy in moving to break this monopoly.
I call today on the Commission to be more robust in demanding delivery of this necessary change.
With monopoly goes subsidised inefficiency and higher prices and so it would be for consumers in my constituency of Northern Ireland if we became a minority part of an energy market dominated by an unreformed ESB.
We cannot have that!
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me a few short sentences to outline the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The European Union is no longer a sanctuary.
Russia is using energy as a political weapon, the situation in the Middle East and the Gulf Region is unclear, and none of us knows what the political situation, and hence energy supply reliability, will be like in two or three years.
When we see how energy-hungry China has acquired energy sector rights in Darfur, has organised an African Summit, has gained entry into Nigeria and has concluded an energy deal with Iran worth in excess of USD 100 billion, we should be very worried about energy being supplied at tolerable prices, as this is decisive as regards the economic and social development of our continent, for jobs and much, much more.
For this reason, we must make particular efforts in these areas aimed at moving forwards, by diversifying our supply from all parts of the world, as well as through the internal networking of the energy networks within the European Union, so that individual countries cannot be penalised by third powers.
This would provide greater security.
However, it also demonstrates the importance of the Constitutional Treaty for establishing energy jurisdiction so that we are actually able to implement what we are talking about here today.
(ES) Mr President, I shall begin with Mr SeppÃ€nen's report.
The rapporteur has once again demonstrated his great experience in this field and his capacity for reaching consensus, by achieving a large majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I believe that the result is excellent, and we must avoid veering away from it by adopting amendments that run counter to the spirit of the proposal.
With regard to the Morgan report, I would like to stress a curious fact, and that is that the contribution of nuclear energy has been completely ignored.
I believe that certain Members prefer not to deal with the issue, in the hope of avoiding a controversial debate, but we must be courageous and once and for all acknowledge, objectively and without reservations, the significant contribution that this source of energy makes to security of supply and combating climate change.
I would like you to listen carefully, Mrs Harms, to the words of the co-founder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore, and I quote: 'Wind and solar power have their place, but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply cannot replace big baseload plants such as coal, nuclear and hydroelectric.
Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is too expensive already, and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants.
Given that hydroelectric resources are built pretty much to capacity, nuclear is, by elimination, the only viable substitute for coal'.
That seems to me to be an irrefutable argument.
I agree with you that Iran, with its nuclear enrichment programme, is a very serious threat to world security and stability, but the correct conclusion to be drawn from this is the opposite of what you propose, Mrs Harms.
The conclusion is that we must increase our energy independence.
In other words, precisely the opposite to what you are advocating.
We must stop looking at kilowatts in political terms.
We are not talking about right-wing kilowatts or left-wing kilowatts.
We are talking about sources that emit greenhouse gases and sources that do not.
Renewable sources of energy and nuclear energy must be seen as complementary and not as incompatible.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the three rapporteurs for their fine work.
However, I hope the other rapporteurs will forgive me if I concentrate on the report of my colleague, Mrs Morgan.
Hers is an excellent report which demonstrates the productive cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.
I am assuming that here today in Parliament, we will send a very clear signal to the Commission, a signal which the Commission, in the interests of continuing the truly sound cooperation hitherto in the energy policy field, should not ignore when it presents its energy package in January.
Hence the report, for instance, is calling for a compulsory 25% target for renewable energies by the year 2020.
The Commission is obviously thoroughly open-minded when it comes to a binding, general target.
This is good, but not enough.
The Morgan report also calls for binding sectoral targets.
We have targets for electricity and biofuels.
However, we must set these targets beyond 2010.
We have not had any negative experiences thus far.
In 2001, we saw with the Electricity Directive, which contained clear targets, that we had achieved a new breakthrough in the Member States.
On the one hand, this should not be jeopardised.
On the other, however, you, Commissioner Piebalgs, declared in this House in February of this year that you would present a Directive concerned with heating and cooling this year.
We would be happy to give you until January.
This is not at all the point, however.
Both we here in Parliament and industry and commerce in this area, which has truly supported your words, are expecting presentation of a Directive, as stated in both the Langen and Morgan reports.
I call on the Commission to fulfil its obligations and take action accordingly.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to make a few comments on the various topics that we are discussing this morning.
In the report on nuclear safety and security assistance, the European Union gives itself the task of improving nuclear safety and security worldwide by proposing an instrument for cooperation with third countries.
The European Union's responsibility is not to prevent the construction of new power stations or to demand that existing plants be shut down, decisions that fall within the sovereignty of the States, but to promote a culture of nuclear safety.
I therefore find the two amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which recommend more than the minimum, regrettable.
It is early intervention, before plants are put into operation, that will make it possible to lay down what safety measures need to be taken.
This morning, Parliament is also proposing an ambitious report on biomass and biofuels, which are important elements in energy independence for the EU and in the fight against climate change.
It will, however, be necessary to keep a close eye on the overall energy yield of biomass.
Finally, I would have liked to have seen a stronger message from Parliament with regard to the European Commission's Green Paper, particularly in terms of the effort needed to reduce energy consumption in buildings and in transport.
To take another example, we have once again glossed over the debate on nuclear power.
We have to acknowledge that nuclear power is part of the energy mix, that it helps to combat climate change and, what is more, that our expertise in this field is recognised worldwide.
I would also remind you that we need to encourage the network managers to get together to draw up a European code, in order to control the safety of energy transport networks.
Finally, now that private consumers are going to be faced with the opening up of the energy market, it is high time to consider the role of the regulators and to adapt the directives on the internal market with a view to keeping prices under control.
Energy is an absolute necessity, and it is vital for European citizens, particularly the poorest, to have access to this universal service.
(EL) Mr President, the Green Paper is being promoted within the framework of the anti-grassroots Lisbon Strategy and yet again donates more profit to Euro-unifying capital.
The European Union and the governments of the Member States, even those which demonstrate national protectionism, are privatising this strategic sector by sacrificing grassroots needs at the altar of private profit, of the profit of the large business groups and multinationals.
Liberalisation is bringing new profits to business and increasing prices at the consumer's expense.
One example is the privatisation of CDF in France.
In the first quarter since privatisation, prices to consumers have risen by 15%.
The same has happened in Greece and other countries.
The environmental protection which you cite is hypocritical.
In reality, you are trying to conceal the fact that liberalisation is being stepped up.
The energy supply must target a combined approach to grassroots needs, a reduction in energy dependency, the safeguarding of local security, environmental protection and, most importantly, the protection of energy as a social rather than a commercial commodity, and this is where our strategic difference and divergence lie: the Green Paper does not promote such needs.
On the contrary, it turns away from the consumer's - by which I mean the worker's - interests.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Not only do I welcome both the Commission's Green Paper and the report by Mrs Morgan on a sustainable European energy policy, but I also hope that this strategy will, as early as 2007, become one of our Union's priorities.
As I have, in fact, mentioned before, both yesterday in this Chamber and on other occasions, the EU's capacity to implement an energy strategy - and one that is not just sustainable but also autonomous - and thus its independence from the power games and economic interests that are often at work behind the scenes in this sector is a decisive factor in meeting so many of the global challenges that await us in the near future, not only in terms of competitiveness, but also with regard to the political and strategic weight that the European Union wishes to have and could obtain.
More importantly than finalising strategic agreements with current and potential partners, it is therefore necessary to step up efforts on research and to allow the Member States - each according to its own characteristics and potential - to develop to the utmost the sustainable energy resources that they have.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I believe that we should support all three reports and extending my thanks to the three rapporteurs for their efforts.
Above all, I would like to congratulate Mr Piebalgs for his work.
Two and a half years into this term we are now talking about energy in a completely different way than previously.
Firstly, it is now clear that our problems in Europe are based on threats to our oil and gas supplies, which is why the initiatives of the Commissioner, the European Commission and the Council of Europe concerning intensive dialogue with the partners who supply our oil and gas are worthy of support.
We need a common foreign policy as regards energy supplies.
Energy supply routes are also important, not just the suppliers themselves.
In fact, they are absolutely crucial.
Secondly, if we are to counteract the crisis in oil and gas supplies, we will have to rely on our own, European, sources of energy.
Over a period of two and a half years, the European Union has clearly acknowledged that energy savings and renewable sources of energy are a priority.
This is set out in all the documents, including those dealing with research and development of new technologies.
Biofuels are very important here, although some legislation is still needed.
Thirdly, the European Union is continuing with the EURATOM programme, which is the oldest Community programme and which has brought Europe a relatively safe and reliable source of energy through use of the atom.
This programme must be continued.
Renewable energy on its own will not be enough, although I support my colleagues who talk of the need for renewable energy.
Fourthly, after years of neglect, Europe has finally remembered that almost all countries have their own energy resources in the form of coal.
However, there can be no return to nineteenth and twentieth-century methods of coal consumption. Completely new technologies are needed.
I would like to thank the Commissioner and all my colleagues for deciding to undertake such actions within the framework of the European Union.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs and pointing out that the problem of energy, which is the focus of our concerns today, will continue to be a problem over the coming years, probably to an even greater extent.
As the rapporteurs have said, I believe that the proposals in the Commission's Green Paper are timely and necessary and that the work being done by Commissioner Piebalgs deserves to be highlighted.
Having said that, I simply wish to say that consumers must of course be placed at the centre of the energy policy, since we are talking about a public service that must be accessible to everybody, not just to those of interest to the market.
Over recent years, we have been prioritising the creation of the European market, but we have seen that that is not enough.
Many countries are showing great reticence when it comes to applying the legislation.
Just this week, the Commission has sent reasoned opinions to sixteen Member States.
I believe that we must ask ourselves why the market is not progressing and why there is not sufficient confidence and that the answer lies in the need for a common energy policy, and not just in the external field.
We need cooperation and solidarity amongst the Member States because, otherwise, it will be very difficult to achieve our objectives and meet the challenges facing us.
(SL) We have one debate, but a number of very important topics.
Above all I would like to talk about the proposal for a common European energy policy.
Debates on energy have finally been made a high priority.
Of course, they deserve such prominence, since the well-being of mankind is directly dependent on the quality, sustainability and cost of energy as well as the impact of energy on the environment.
Europe faces problems in this sphere, and we will only be able to resolve them if we act with a common purpose.
For this reason I support the idea of a common European energy policy.
However, the question remains: how are we to bring it into being?
In the proposal for the single energy market, the thing that most strikes me as being absent is the idea of the gradual harmonisation and standardisation of administrative bodies and the unification of their powers.
The European single market requires powerful national regulators, but we are also in need of a European regulator that will deal with cross-border problems.
Another important concern is the drawing up of an appropriate timetable.
In debates on energy, I should also like to see more emphasis on the transport sector.
Promoting public transport is a measure that can be successfully implemented now.
In addition, the streamlining of procedures with regard to the import of bio-fuels and their unification among Member States is a measure which we could implement over a relatively short time period.
The difficult energy situation and environmental problems are forcing us to assess the comparative advantages and drawbacks of individual energy sources, together with their impact on other sectors, such as the timber industry and agriculture.
In so doing, we must also carry out a realistic assessment of nuclear energy, which represents an important energy source in society, provided that it is used in combination with safe technology and within an appropriate safety culture.
Let us not confuse the peaceful use of nuclear energy with the abuses thereof.
Let us focus on institutional development which can prevent abuse.
It would be unwise, for instance, to renounce the use of nuclear energy, the chemical industry and medical research simply because of potential abuses.
It is for this very reason that Europe is earmarking some financial resources for the improvement of the safety of nuclear power stations in third countries.
Finally, in the field of energy we already have a large number of well-chosen objectives.
It is time that we internationalised some of them.
And it is also time that we ourselves began to work towards our set strategic objectives and implemented the legal requirements already adopted.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with regard to the strategy for biomass and biofuels, I would like to comment on two points in relation to this report.
Firstly, it is very important that priority be given to the principle of sustainability in all phases when producing biofuels.
In addition, however, we must also define standards in relation to cultivation and processing, in which connection the greenhouse gas balance during the entire production cycle must be the main criterion.
For my second point, I would like to mention the energy efficiency of biomass.
Here, the principal criterion must be how many kilowatt hours can be harvested per hectare per annum without neglecting sustainability.
As a result of the increased demand for fossil energy sources and the rapid price increases associated with this, it is important that the percentage share of renewable energy sources rises rapidly so as to dampen future price increases in fossil energy sources.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the serious electricity blackout that occurred on 4 November, initially in Germany, demonstrated - if there were any need to demonstrate it - that energy security is definitely a European concern and that it is at European level that we must find solutions.
It is to Europe that people are turning more and more to safeguard the balance between the supply of, and demand for, energy, which is increasingly subject to the volatility of suppliers and to the tensions resulting from the very unequal geographical distribution of resources.
Therefore, the Commission done the right thing in presenting us with this Green Paper, which we are examining today thanks to the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Morgan.
I congratulate her on her excellent work, and I am delighted that a broad consensus within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy should have been reached on such an important and sensitive issue as this and, above all, that the powerful idea that the three objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability are absolutely paramount objectives, should have been highlighted.
The same goes for the need to diversify the energy mix with the aid of the three pillars of fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewable energy sources.
Finally, many people recognise that, in the current state of research, the act of abandoning one of these pillars would cause problems and would compromise the achievement of the aforementioned objectives.
I should like to acknowledge the significance of this debate, which encourages us to be bold.
For the first time, we have been given the opportunity simultaneously to tackle the challenge of growth and the challenge of environmental protection, and this, in an increasingly worrying context due to the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.
As Mr Turmes said just now, we have only one planet.
I therefore particularly support the amendment which, taking account of serious environmental warning signs, proposes a global objective in terms of the percentage of non-carbon-generating energy sources.
To conclude, I will simply add, that, after the crisis caused by the failure of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, European integration must show the citizens that it is effective.
Energy policy gives us the opportunity to do that.
Let us hope the political will is equal to the task.
(NL) Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mrs Morgan on her courage and determination.
It would, in my view, be good to make three comments and not beat about the bush in doing so.
First of all, the climate issue deserves to be given top priority.
Secondly, the conclusion we have to come to today is that liberalisation has not been all that beneficial to consumers, that compliance with European rules leaves something to be desired and that the directive on tradable emissions needs to be amended in one or two areas.
Before we can ever talk about common energy policy, considerable improvements need to be made in the areas of compliance and implementation.
This is a task not only for the Commission, but also for us.
We will constantly need to question the Commission on the enforcement of European rules.
Thirdly, in the next few years, we will need to invest heavily in efficient, sustainable energy and innovative research.
We need to give subsidies for polluting energy short shrift, and direct as much as is needed of our funds to sustainable energy.
Billions are still being invested in polluting energy, especially coal and nuclear energy, and we really need to put a stop to this.
I should also like to give Mr Langen credit for his report on biofuels.
Europe needs to opt for compulsory blending of both petrol and diesel fuels.
Specific intervention is needed to guarantee that biofuels do not lead to the eradication of rainforests and a decline in biodiversity, or start competing with the food supply.
(ET) Eluned Morgan's report about the Commission's Green Book on the Energy Strategy has, in the course of Parliament's discussion of the topic, gone through numerous amendments from a slim draft report to a weighty report.
Most of the European Union's energy issues are covered therein.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work he has done.
I do, however, also have a critical comment.
Clause 66, which contains the hope that Russia would sign the Energy Charter, is probably now obsolete, considering Mr Yastrzhembsky's Tuesday statement.
On the far shore of this continent, in Sakhalin, Shell is withdrawing, and on the opposite shore, in the Baltic Sea, the harmonisation of issues related to the gas pipeline has reached a decisive stage.
Here I would like to highlight the positions under discussion in Sweden and those that emphasise national sovereignty.
I say this in order to underline the need for a common European energy policy, which is absent from the report and of critical importance in comparison with everything else.
Although it is the first point in the opinion by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but it has not received adequate emphasis in the report.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Morgan and the other rapporteurs.
I would like to emphasise the need to support research and development in new cleaner energy technologies that can meet our needs and to support what that requires in terms of investment in R+D.
It is true that the Seventh Framework Programme provides for an investment of EUR 2 350 million, that, furthermore, the Seventh Euratom Framework Programme funds research into fusion energy, nuclear fission and protection against radiation and that the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme also provides for resources to fund innovation in energy.
Despite all of that, however, our investment in R+D in this field is still considerably lower than that of Japan or the United States, and most of it is dedicated to research into conventional energy sources.
This demonstrates the clear imbalance between investment in R+D and the obligations stemming from a sustainable and ambitious energy policy such as the one we are debating today.
Ladies and gentlemen, this dysfunction must be corrected as a matter of urgency so that we can guarantee a genuine R+D strategy in the field of energy.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, after such a full and very rich debate it is very difficult and challenging to respond to the points that have been raised, because each of the three reports deserved a separate debate.
I shall try to emphasise the common rather than the divisive issues.
Firstly, it is very important that Parliament state clearly that there is a challenge to act now.
Actions to combat climate change should be taken now - there is no time left.
Security of supply and the competitiveness of the European economy are also urgent matters.
We should all like to see affordable prices for our industries and citizens.
We should also like to ensure that energy is produced and used in a sustainable way.
I think we agree on what should be done to achieve that.
We should provide for long-term perspectives for investment; we should provide for the full use of market forces; we should provide for diversification of energy sources and suppliers.
We know that we should focus strongly on energy efficiency.
We know that there is consensus for a focus on renewable energy, including heating and cooling.
We know that we should focus on research and development.
It is also important to realise that if we act alone, although it might be good for us, it will not be enough.
In order to do this we need the EU's economies of scale and scope.
However, it is also clear that, to achieve that, we must have a common vision and present legislation based on debate that responds not only to this vision but also to the principles of better legislation.
We need a general consensus in Europe.
We need one voice and to take joint action.
For those reasons I really believe that, when the Commission adopts the package on 10 January 2007, this will open the door, as Mr Langen said, to real action and real legislative proposals - good proposals not only in the legislative field but also in other areas.
I should like to thank Mrs Morgan, Mr Langen and Mr SeppÃ€nen for their excellent reports and the whole Parliament for this debate.
Unfortunately I have to finish on a sad note because last night I received the very sad news that my predecessor, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, has died.
I wish to pay tribute to her.
We will really miss her, because she was devoted not only to her energy remit but also to Europe.
She had very strong and clear views, which were not always shared by everyone.
We need spirits like hers.
I really believe that the best tribute we can pay her would be by taking very ambitious action towards creating a European energy policy and not being discouraged by legal hurdles.
In this way we will commemorate her in the best possible way.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)
(PL) I would like to express my support for Mr Langen's report on biomass and biofuels.
At a time of increasing reliance on fuel and energy supplies from third countries and increasingly stringent standards for environmental emissions, renewable sources of energy are among the most important aspects of ensuring secure energy supplies.
Developing the use of renewable sources of energy will enable the EU to reduce its dependence on mineral fuels and oil imports and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as encouraging the economic revival of rural areas by creating new jobs and exploiting unused agricultural land.
Unfortunately, in many Member States legal barriers such as a lack of promotional campaigns, the lack of a long-term fiscal policy relating to tax concessions for biocomponents of fuels, and the lack of opportunities to use additional funding for investment in the production of biodiesel and bioethanol are hampering the development of the biofuels market.
We should therefore consider simplifying procedures which promote the cultivation of crops that can be used as components in biofuels.
The further development of support mechanisms, including a system of excise benefits and concessions which take the real costs of creating biofuel components and biofuels into account, is an important element in creating conditions that will favour the development of the biofuels market.
- (HU) We are rapidly approaching the first anniversary of the gas price war between Russia and the Ukraine, which, along with minor distribution problems caused by a shortage of Russian natural gas reserves, awakened Europe to its energy dependence and the vulnerability of the security of its energy supply.
In the eleven months since those events, the institutions of the European Union have responded with the rapidity one may expect from them.
I shall sum up in three points the factors which, according to the parliamentary debates on the Green Paper published by the Commission in March, are of key importance in avoiding a similar situation in future:
1.
We need a common European energy policy in order that we might speak with one voice at the international level to our suppliers, including Russia, which is openly using its position in the area of energy as a political tool.
2.
In order that a common European energy policy might rest on a stable foundation, we need to create the necessary accompanying community legal framework as well.
The extension of the treaty establishing an Energy community to southeastern Europe must serve as a model to be followed by the EU's neighbourhood policy.
3.
Finally, I wish to emphasise that Europe needs to create new infrastructure as well as a new legal framework.
If we are to bring about the diversification that serves as the guarantee of a secure energy supply, we need to create new gas pipelines, gas storage facilities and LNG terminals as well as links.
The construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline would ensure diversification of both the sources of supply and the transit routes.
Alternative sources of energy must in future play a more significant part in the energy mix, and the role of nuclear energy also needs to be reassessed.
The energy dependence of European consumers is constantly growing.
It is our joint responsibility to ensure security of supply and thereby the security of our citizens.
- (SK) I would like to touch on the need to increase liberalisation of the energy market.
We must concede the fact that the Member States have formally complied with the relevant directives on the unbundling of energy generation, transmission and distribution, and that they are duly implementing these directives.
Nevertheless, no substantial changes have been observed on their energy markets.
There is still no competitive environment, and the incumbents largely retain their monopolistic position with respect to the unbundled operations in the energy chain.
The entry of new companies into the energy sector has frequently been blocked by protectionist efforts and excessive government regulation, with a negative impact on energy prices and spending on research and development.
I urge the Commission to keep up the pressure on the Member States to take more resolute measures to enhance the competitive environment, eliminate administrative barriers and thus facilitate the opening up of energy markets.
I would like to point out another important aspect, namely excessive government interference in regulators' activities, particularly in the area of price regulation, which hinders energy sector liberalisation.
Several Member State governments are jeopardising the independence of their regulators by amending the relevant laws, to enable them to appoint ministerial officials with the obvious aim of bringing pressure to bear on price regulation.
It is therefore necessary for the Commission to accelerate harmonisation of the regulatory framework, including the possible establishment of a European regulator, which would effectively eliminate unreasonable interference in the independent status of national regulators.
I would like to congratulate my colleague Eluned Morgan on an excellent report which points the way towards a 'green' energy policy for Europe.
I particularly support her call for a radical reform of the Emissions Trading Scheme to create a low carbon economy driven by a set target for a reduction of EU carbon emissions of 30% by 2020 and 60-80% by 2050.
She is correct to call for enhanced R[amp]D on clean energy technologies and for a step-change in energy efficiency.
I hope when EU leaders meet next March to discuss energy policy they all have a copy of this report in front of them and that they take its recommendations seriously.
Tribute
Ladies and gentlemen, last night we received some sad news.
At the end of the day we heard that Loyola de Palacio, Vice-President of the European Commission, Minister in the Spanish Government, head of the People's Party's list in the 1999 elections, had died.
During the final months of her life, she faced her illness with a courage that should serve as an example to all of us.
Loyola de Palacio, who was responsible for relations with the European Parliament as Vice-President of the Commission and who was an MEP before that, was a forthright person, a determined and strong negotiator, who was always true to her values and the values of Europe.
A tireless worker, who dealt with the people around her in a straightforward and open way, it was easy to appreciate Loyola's firmness and direct language, in her office and in the corridors of this House.
I can say this because I had many contacts with her.
I was a Minister in the Spanish Government, and she was the opposition whip.
We argued hard, but our arguments were always full of content and we related well as people.
Her death is sad news for all of us who knew her.
I would like to say that my feelings today go much further than the institutional and political. Please believe me when I say that they are also personal.
I am sure that all of us who knew her mourn her death.
I am sure, moreover, that the Commission will wish to add to what I have said.
Mr President, on behalf of the President of our Commission, Mr Barroso, and on behalf of the Commission and of Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, who is here beside me, I should like to thank you for the tribute you have paid to Mrs de Palacio and to join Parliament in mourning her loss.
Like many Europeans, I was very saddened to hear of Mrs de Palacio's sudden death.
All those who had the opportunity to know her admired her energy, her courage to the end, Mr President.
A woman of conviction, a committed European, Mrs de Palacio left her mark on the European Commission, of which she was vice-president between 1999 and 2004.
In particular, she worked to promote European transport and European energy.
Responsible as she was for relations with the European Parliament, she was able to establish trusting, fruitful cooperation with the institution and with all the MEPs, for the benefit of the Union.
Right up to the end, she worked tirelessly to help Europe.
She continued to work in this way with me, coordinating the completion of the trans-European networks and their extension to neighbouring countries of the Union.
Like many of you, I have lost in Mrs de Palacio a friend from whom I could always seek good advice and unfailing support.
I thank Parliament for joining in this tribute.
(Applause)
Times of bereavement put our problems and differences into their proper perspective.
Let us observe a minute's silence in memory of our colleague.
(Applause)
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)

2007, amended by the Council (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, as every year in this major exercise, there are a few technical corrections that need to be made at this stage.
I will be very brief.
I think the vote also will be as brief as I have known it.
Firstly, on Amendment 328 to line 22 02 02 'Transition and institution-building assistance to potential candidate countries': this is accepted with + EUR 2 million for commitments and payments.
These EUR 2 million are taken from line 19 05 01 'Cooperation with industrialised non-member countries'.
As a result, Amendment 314 to line 19 05 01 is withdrawn.
Secondly, EUR 5 million in commitments and payments is added to line 16 02 02: 'Multimedia actions'.
Thirdly, EUR 400 000 in commitments and payments is added to line 15 04 47: 'European Year for Intercultural Dialogue'.
With regard to the amounts in reserve which are released: Amendment 302 to line 16 03 02 - 'Local actions' - the reserve is lifted; Amendment 251 on 'European Schools' - line 26 01 50 23; lastly, Amendment 330 to 28 01 01 - 'Staff in active employment in the audit policy area'.
As regards EPSO, that is Amendment 255: it is replaced by an amendment to reduce the amounts in reserve to 25% of the appropriations on the relevant budget lines.
Finally, to take account of a problem on pre-accession assistance which arose from the Council's reading, and which we were not able to pick up quickly enough, we ask the Commission at the end of paragraph 25 of the resolution, 'to present a transfer request or amending budget during the course of 2007 if the amounts foreseen in the 2007 budget turn out to be insufficient'.
This concerns budget line 05 05 01 01.
I recommend that we vote on these particular elements which I have put forward as technical adjustments.
(Parliament accepted the technical amendments proposed by the rapporteur)
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have brought the 2007 budget to second reading.
It is the first budget for the enlarged EU of 27 Member States.
At the same time, it is the first budget in the financial framework for 2007-2013.
I am pleased to note that the consensus reached at the negotiations meeting between Parliament and the Council on 21 November 2006, finalised at the tripartite meeting on 28 November, has now been incorporated in the 2007 budget.
I realise that there are small differences of opinion over interpretation regarding the classification of expenditure in the budget, and I would like to remind you that the Council reserves its rights regarding this.
The Council may approve the ceiling for the rise in expenditure proposed as a result of Parliament's second reading.
I would now like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Janusz Lewandowski, and the rapporteurs, James Elles and Louis Grech, for the spirit of cooperation which pervaded the entire budgetary procedure.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, I would note that the 2007 budgetary procedure has been carried out in accordance with the Treaty and with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 and that, pursuant to Article 13 of the Agreement between the Council and Parliament, explicit agreement on the maximum rate of increase of non-obligatory spending, as laid out in Parliament's second reading, has been expressed.
The budgetary procedure can therefore be considered to have been successfully completed. The budget is definitively approved.
(Having invited the President-in-Office of the Council, Ulla-Maj Wideroos, the representative of the Commission, Dalia Grybauskaite, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Janusz Lewandowski, and the rapporteurs, James Elles and Louis Grech, to accompany him, the President of Parliament, together with the President-in-Office of the Council, signed the budget)
(Applause)

rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief.
I deeply regret the decision to resort to urgent voting on the three framework programmes concerning the area of freedom, security and justice for the period from 2007 to 2013.
While understanding the acute need to adopt the reports by the end of the year in order to allow the procedures for finance allocation to be started this coming 1 January, I believe that programmes of such importance at least deserved a debate in the Chamber.
Since I was not given the opportunity previously, I now take the opportunity to thank all those who worked together with me for over a year and a half: as well as my staff, I thank my colleagues for their work and the officials of the group and the secretariat for their efforts.

Amendment of Rule 81 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, Implementing provisions (vote)
- Before the vote:
Mr President, this vote adapts our procedures to take full advantage of the new powers of the European Parliament in the context of the comitology procedure, new powers that were secured earlier this year through the interinstitutional agreement negotiated by Mr Daul and myself.
It means that, when we confer implementing powers on the Commission through the legislation we adopt under the codecision procedure, any subsequent implementing measures of a quasi-legislative nature can be vetoed by Parliament.
This is the most important increase in the powers of the European Parliament since the Treaty of Nice and probably the only significant increase during this legislature.
The new rule will facilitate our use of this new power.
21.
Amendment of the Rules of Procedure (committees, quaestors) (vote)
22.
Creation of the External Borders Fund (2007-2013) (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to inform this House that during the tripartite talks on the border fund we were assured by the Commission and the Council that firearms do not qualify for purchase using this fund.
It will not therefore be possible to use the fund to buy firearms.
I therefore appeal to this House to adopt the compromise amendment referred to in the text as the LIBE Commission proposal.
23.
Creation of the European Return Fund (2008-2013) (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to an outstanding controversy, which is the requirement announced since the beginning of this Parliament making the establishment of a Return Fund conditional on the need to adopt a returns directive by the end of next year.
It is essential for this House to link the Return Fund with a Return Directive, but it has not succeeded in doing so.
I would therefore like to inform the Council that it is possible that if a Returns Directive is not adopted, Parliament may make use of its budgetary entitlements and suspend payments to the Return Fund in the 2008 budget.
That is why this matter is so important.
I therefore call upon this House to vote in favour of the Return Fund, because previously the Council threatened us with a veto of the Integration Fund.
I therefore urge you to vote together in this matter.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council will continue its work, during which it will be in close contact with the European Parliament to ensure that consensus is reached soon on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally remaining third country nationals.
The Council would point out that agreement on this proposal is one of the priorities that the Council and the Commission set in the action plan on the implementation of the Hague Programme established to strengthen freedom, security and justice in the European Union.
The Council will do all it can to promote the achievement of this objective and remind everyone of the European Parliament's role in any agreement on this proposal.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission will continue to encourage the Council in all appropriate fora to make progress on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third country nationals and to intensify negotiations with the European Parliament on this proposal, with a view to reaching an agreement by the end of 2007.
The Commission recalls that agreement on this proposal is one of the priorities set out in the Council and Commission's action plan implementing the Hague Programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union.
The European Commission is open to discussions on improvements to the proposal.
In doing so, the Commission will, however, remain committed to maintaining the dual objective of the directive: to be an efficient instrument of return policy and, at the same time, an efficient protection instrument for the third country nationals involved.
Moreover, the Commission will propose to include the implementation of legislation in the field of return, in particular this directive, as one of the priorities for the strategic guidelines, for the intervention of the Return Fund in the period 2008-13.

European Small Claims Procedure (vote)
- Before the vote on block 1:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I applied to speak for two minutes but will not need that long.
All the same, I would like to emphasise several points in particular regarding the introduction of the European Small Claims Procedure.
First of all, it is important that in case of doubt, the law is interpreted in the German language version since this was generally the working language of the European Parliament as well as being used exclusively by the Council and Commission for orientation purposes in the many trilogues.
Furthermore, it is important that the Member States utilise all the opportunities afforded by this procedure and therefore use the possibilities offered by modern means of communication. Member States should authorise and promote telephone, e-mail and video conferencing as means of communication.
A further important simplification is that form D must be translated by one person who is authorised to do translations in one of the Member States.
