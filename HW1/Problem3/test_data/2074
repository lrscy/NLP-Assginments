According to this amendment, which was adopted at first reading, 15% of emission allowances will have to be sold and the rest allocated free of charge (the 'grandfathering' method also favoured by the Commission), throughout the period from 2005 to 2012.
The adoption of this directive will usher in a new era, characterised by a culture of responsibility among both companies and states. It will bring operators and political representatives together on a path which citizens fervently wish them to follow.
. (FR) The European Union must take definite action to cut its emissions of the most polluting gases.
It must do so to protect the health of its citizens, to meet the Kyoto targets, to set an example to the world and to avoid looming catastrophe: the latest report from the International Energy Agency's climatologists predicts that energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions will double by 2030.
That is why I voted for the creation of this 'permit to pollute less' that will apply to the main sectors of industry from 1 January 2005.
Undertakings that exceed their quotas will be fined: EUR 40 per tonne excess, then EUR 100 per tonne after 2008.
This system of trading quotas is therefore a real breath of fresh air that will enable these emissions to be cut by more than 20% from 2010, not to mention EUR 2 000 million in energy savings.
There is one sour note all the same: I think it is unreasonable to ask Belgium to carry one eighth of Europe's total 'Kyoto' costs when it has only around 2.5% of the population and accounts for just under 3% of European GNP.
Saving the planet is the responsibility of us all, all the rich countries, all industries, including transport, and also individuals.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Chechnya.
I would like to welcome Mr Frattini, President-in-Office of the Council, to the Chamber.
. (IT) Mr President, my greetings to the representative of the Commission and all the Members of the European Parliament present in the Chamber.
If I may, Mr President, I would like to introduce my statement on Chechnya by expressing my full personal commitment and my determination to continue as of now attending the House and playing a full part in the work of the European Parliament, my intention to pay heed to the considerations expressed in this and other debates and to keep Parliament fully informed, insofar as it is in my power, regarding the Council's dossiers and activities.
Turning to the subject of Chechnya, as you all know, the situation in the Republic of Chechnya, one of the components of the Russian Federation, has been the object of the European Union's attention for some time now as a result of the serious acts of military violence and terrorism that characterise it and of the likely consequences for Europe.
The situation being played out in Chechnya will have an effect that reaches well beyond that small Republic.
The effects of the situation, whether negative or positive, will affect the entire Caucasus area.
I believe that some knowledge of past events, however summary, is important when forming an opinion on the present and on the outlook for the future.
That is why I am giving you this brief history.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the subsequent birth of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Chechnya has been the scene of violent Russian-Chechen clashes and of bloody separatist acts.
The 1997 Peace Treaty laid the groundwork for a broad-based de facto autonomy under the Presidency of Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, while guerrilla groups continued to be active throughout the country.
In 1999, Moscow intervened in Ingushetia and North Ossetia while, in Chechnya, Russian troops occupied the capital city of Grozny.
Years of attacks and repression followed in a climate of brutality on the part of both separatist fighters and Russian forces.
The European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE recognised, even then, Russia's right to defend its territorial integrity and to combat terrorism, but condemned its disproportionate use of force, inviting the Russian Government to implement a political solution to the crisis and to allow humanitarian aid organisations to enter Chechnya.
After 11 September 2001, Russia stepped up its anti-terrorism efforts, even though the connection between Chechnya and Islamic fundamentalism - which does exist - appeared to be quite indirect.
The roots of the war remain essentially nationalistic in nature, despite its growing and dangerous susceptibility to Islamic extremism, particularly as regards the methods and instruments used.
Although, in September 2001, a channel of dialogue opened up between the Russian authorities and one of the main exponents of the Chechen resistance, it remained uncertain and unclear whether a political solution to the conflict could be found.
It was against this backdrop that the serious terrorist incident at the Na Dubrovke theatre occurred, followed by the numerous, and equally violent, attacks of recent months.
The situation on the ground is extremely difficult: the local economy is falling apart, there is contention within the pro-Russian administration, there are terrorist threats from the separatists and brutality, and violent military action from Russian militias.
While, in the past, Chechnya had a flourishing economy, due, of course, first and foremost, to oil production and to a highly developed metal and mechanics sector, it is now considerably reduced; unemployment is at 42%, there are 64 000 Chechen refugees in the nearby Republic of Ingushetia, 8 000 displaced persons in reception camps and 290 000 homeless.
Civil life has, for the most part, come to a standstill, reduced to a very sorry state with the destruction of archives and offices.
Ladies and gentlemen, the major institutional reform initiative launched by President Putin with the adoption of a new Constitution, to be approved by local referendum, has been grafted onto these bases.
In Mr Putin's plan, the process should be supported by the international community and, in particular, by the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
The political plan consists of the concession of broad-based autonomy and greater powers to local organisations in the context of the Russian Federation, whose territorial integrity is thus safeguarded.
Withdrawal of non-necessary military contingents and the reduction of checkpoints were begun so as to facilitate the gradual normalisation of the region and the holding of the referendum.
The results of the referendum of 23 March - which saw an 89% participation rate - were, as we know, highly favourable to the draft Constitution.
This outcome has demonstrated that the Chechen people, weary of war, have chosen the political solution within the Russian Federation.
At the same time, it has also emerged that the separatist rebel leader, Aslan Maskhadov, and his followers, have lost the better part of the support of civil society.
In accordance with the recently adopted Constitution, it is possible to foresee Chechen presidential elections by the end of October, while parliamentary elections will take place no earlier than three months after the election of the future President.
Nevertheless, despite this positive outcome, the referendum is only a first step in the political transition underway.
A large number of unresolved issues remain, including the definition of the powers held by the Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation, the provision of compensation to those who have lost property and the adoption of measures for combating crime, including the crimes committed by the Federal Forces.
As you all know, ladies and gentlemen, at present, there are 200 serious criminal cases pending against members of the police force.
On 6 June 2003, the State Duma adopted an amnesty law for Chechnya to be applied to both rebels and members of the police force, on condition, of course, that they have not committed violent crimes.
It offers clemency to those who give up armed, separatist resistance by 1 September of this year.
Nevertheless, despite the amnesty, attacks on the ground are continuing, prompting, as a result, harsh responses from the police force.
The international community has been actively following the developments and the initiatives of Moscow.
While, in March, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution that contemplates the possibility of setting up an International Tribunal in order to bring those guilty of serious violations of human rights in Chechnya to justice, more recently, the political and institutional process begun was examined in depth in the course of the talks of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Moscow.
In the context of the OSCE, the Presidency is laying the foundations, in agreement with Russia, for the resumption of the organisation's activities in the Republic, based on specific programmes agreed regarding elections, good governance, the judicial system, the media, the police and humanitarian aid.
In April, the 15 Members of the Union presented a draft resolution at the Geneva Conference on Human Rights that censured, that condemned the serious violations perpetrated in Chechnya, a resolution which, as you are aware, was not adopted for lack of a majority of votes in favour.
Its failure to be adopted was, as you know, described by Moscow as a 'triumph of good sense'.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has noted the European Parliament's views on the situation in the Republic of Chechnya and will endeavour to ensure that the political process recently set in motion leads to the reestablishment of the rule of law and the reconstruction of the region's economic and social fabric.
The Union is united in its overall positive judgment of the start of the institutional process launched by President Putin with regard to Chechnya.
We now expect to see an about-face in terms of human rights and we call for the punishment of those guilty of abuses.
The European Union's continuing attention was made clear through the recent visit in April to Chechnya itself of the Troika of Heads of Mission in Moscow as well as through support for the resumption of the OSCE's activities in the region, which I mentioned earlier.
The EU-Russia Cooperation Council of 15 April last was the Union's first opportunity to send a high-level political message of vigilance, interest and general availability.
The St Petersburg EU-Russia Summit expressed the hope that the political process recently set in motion, along with economic and social reconstruction, will lead to the reestablishment of rule of law, to the promotion of human rights and to genuine reconciliation.
The St Petersburg Summit condemned any act of violence, particularly terrorist violence, that might jeopardise the current prospects for a political solution and acknowledged the substantial contribution that international organisations can make, working together with the Russian authorities.
Lastly, once the region's economic reconstruction is underway, the Union will also have to make a financial commitment, although one based on strict conditions, of course.
The representative of the Commission, who is due to speak shortly, will be able to describe to you the aid package being put together.
The cooperation of the Russian authorities will be fundamental in ensuring that this aid actually reaches those in deep need.
The possibility of launching a European Union initiative in Chechnya in the future deserves closer examination.
By supporting the process begun by President Putin, this initiative could extend Community intervention from the field of humanitarian aid, on which we have all been focusing up until now, to the different - but equally important, if I may say so - area of institution-building and the promotion of socio-economic development, placing a number of practical initiatives in the framework of the existing cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE.
The OSCE is currently assessing, along with its Russian counterpart, the possibility of aid interventions in specific sectors: I have already mentioned elections - an extremely important area - the judicial system, police reform and the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons.
These elements of institution-building are traditionally held to be Union priorities too.
In conclusion, with regard to the institutional process launched by Moscow, the Italian Presidency will be committed to facilitating a definitive political solution which, if possible, involves all the representatives and segments of the Chechen population not compromised by terrorism.
We believe that the institutional reform launched should have the practical, genuine result - the automatic result, if I may say so - of improving the present levels of respect for the human rights of the Chechen people.
. (ES) Mr President, following the Council's position, clearly expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, I must say that the Commission can only repeat that the European Union is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism and, in this regard, that it supports Russia in its legitimate fight against terrorism in Chechnya or anywhere else.
There must be no doubt about this.
This means that the defence of human rights is an absolute and that, if the main violation of human rights is terrorism itself, which does not respect the basic right to life, that does not mean that we must not always be aware, in any action or fight against terrorism, that human rights are a fundamental element which must be respected at all times.
Having said all of this, and moving on to the areas which are more directly related to the Commission's activity - which is what I am going to focus on in order not to repeat what has already been said - I would point out that it is necessary to make progress on the possibility of providing humanitarian aid in Chechnya.
As the honourable Members know, the European Union, by means of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), is the main provider of humanitarian aid in the Northern Caucasus.
Since October 1999 we have provided more than EUR 110 million in aid to the victims of the conflicts in Chechnya.
The security conditions in the Northern Caucasus are still deficient, which means that there are considerable logistical problems.
However, the Commission trusts that the Russian authorities will adopt a more open attitude, for example, with regard to the attempts to liberate Arjan Erkel, the European aid worker who is still being held hostage.
The reluctance, in certain cases, of the Russian authorities to allow non-governmental organisations to use the necessary radio communications, as well as the system for granting residency and work permits in Chechnya, remain the principal obstacles to providing humanitarian aid.
In this regard, we will continue to call for improvements in the treatment offered, in order to facilitate the carrying out of humanitarian operations, in accordance with the basic rules on safety, efficiency and supervision and, of course, independent evaluation.
Furthermore, although the Russian authorities have assured us that they will not repatriate the thousands of displaced persons in neighbouring areas to Chechnya by force, referred to a moment ago by the President-in-Office of the Council, the truth is that ECHO has informed us that it is observing that the possibility of replacing the deteriorating tents and building more solid shelters in neighbouring Ingushetia is being denied.
Returning to Chechnya must not be the only option for the displaced people.
In addition to continuing to closely monitor how events develop in general, we will continue to insist in particular that any repatriation of displaced Chechens must take place voluntarily and unconditionally.
With a view to the future, the Commission will continue to monitor how the situation develops, including the work under way, with a view to the signature of a treaty intended to clarify the status of Chechnya within the Russian Federation, as well as the preparations for the presidential and parliamentary elections in the Russian republic, scheduled for October and December.
In this regard, we will continue to analyse how the situation develops.
The Commission is now stressing that all these actions, all this progress, should take place with the utmost transparency, entirely in accordance with international rules, and, above all, that they should be carried out in a way that helps to resolve this conflict once and for all.
Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council conveyed a moment ago in a positive and constructive manner that he is prepared to join forces with us.
We extend a very warm welcome to you in our midst in this Parliament, Mr Frattini.
Commissioner, you also quite rightly mentioned the name of the Dutchman, Arjan Erkel, a moment ago.
I am very indebted to you for this, because Arjan Erkel, the head of the MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres mission in Dagestan, has been missing since August last year.
He was kidnapped, and it is especially important that this abduction should receive the Commission's, and also the Council's, attention.
We know that Arjan's father has been keeping everyone informed about this case for months now, and I hope that it will have a positive outcome.
We were going to return home via Chechnya after the trip we recently made with four MEPs.
I have to say that it was quite a depressing experience: compared to Bosnia and Sarajevo - I can draw a comparison with the war situation at the time - Grozny and Chechnya are actually worse off.
We, and also the Americans, in particular, have a dangerous tendency to define this Russian war in the way that suits us best, hence, along the lines of 'if you do not criticise our war, then we won't criticise yours'.
We in the European Union should be careful about doing this: it is not only rebels and terrorists who are fighting the Russian armed forces, there are also others that most definitely fall within the category of resistance fighters.
The Chechens are not wrong by definition, and nor are the Russians.
The fact is, however, that many citizens in Chechnya, on account of the action taken by the Russian troops, tend, in their desperation, to veer to the anti-Russian camp.
We ourselves were able to make out from conversations on the streets that there are justified complaints from people who saw their friends being beaten up and who therefore know that others are too scared to go to work in Grozny, because the risk of random, extremely rough action from the Russian military is enormous.
We can somewhat identify with this situation if you know that many of us have a colonial history in our own countries, during which time all kinds of things happened that did not come to light until much later.
In the case of Russia's action in Chechnya, matters come to light quicker, which is good.
This is why I should like to urge both the Commission and the Council to employ all political and diplomatic means available to us in order to curb the violence in Chechnya.
Indeed, this is desperately needed, and we cannot even be all that demanding.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation I head is happy that it was able to gain first-hand knowledge of the situation.
That is what happened the first time.
We met the Russian, Ingushetian and Chechnyan leaders and members of their governments. We met people in camps and in Grozny too, as well as the Chechen diaspora in Moscow, and obviously members of humanitarian organisations, both national and international.
Besides human rights, we wanted to get to know about social, economic and educational issues and medical facilities, the situation regarding refugees and the possibilities of leading a normal life in general.
Firstly, I wish to raise the matter of Russia's change of strategy.
It is no longer pursuing a military solution but a political one.
This is a positive approach and one that the European Parliament has been calling for for a long time.
Secondly, it is obvious that all parties are tired of war and want peace.
I do not now mean the criminal elements that have turned the war into a means of making money.
Thirdly, it would appear that a window of opportunity has presented itself that is to last about a year, until the elections in the Russian Federation and Chechnya are over.
It is to be feared that after the elections the situation may go back to what it was before.
For that reason, there should now be strong support for the political process that has been started.
There is also the risk of 'Chechenisation' of the conflict, with violence moving more and more in the direction of civil war.
On the road to peace it is vital that Russia should convict war criminals and that the army should withdraw.
Human rights must be protected.
The Chechens must also cease their armed struggle and terrorist attacks.
Observations have been made from several sources that combat action on the part of the Russian army has already diminished in the region over the last six months.
At the same time, however, violence on the part of armed groups has increased, which is very worrying.
We must determinedly press on with the social, cultural and economic reconstruction that has only just started.
As one possible candidate for President of Chechnya said to me, money creates peace.
The Russian Government has put together a kind of politico-economic package to normalise the situation.
It may well need revising and adding to, but the choice of direction is important here.
In connection with this, the European Union should likewise strengthen its measures in the region.
The European Union is already the biggest external provider of assistance.
The Commission recently also granted EUR 16 million in humanitarian aid, which is only right.
Our delegation is calling on the aid organisations to get to the region quickly, safely and unimpeded.
Without outside help it will take even longer to put things right.
It is also essential that the office of the OSCE in Znamenskoje can be got fully up and running without delay.
In a few months' time they will be planning elections and the start of election campaigns there.
It will be very important to check that the campaign is made transparent and that the requirements of democracy are being fulfilled.
This will require a long-term presence.
If the campaigns are not democratic the elections can hardly be either.
Finally, the idea of a peace conference has also been proposed. All parties could participate as well as the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
I have not named the guilty parties in my speech because now is the time to seek peace.
Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the joint resolution of the political groups on Chechnya.
We thus support the Russian Government's attempts to stabilise conditions in the region on the basis of the recently conducted referendum.
At the same time we would stress that there must be respect for human rights in Chechnya.
If Russia's current policy does not lead to the hoped-for outcome soon, it will, in my opinion, be wise of Russia to consider whether there is an alternative to it.
It is extremely difficult to bring peace to Chechnya when certain powerful groups are trying to bring about its secession from Russia.
On the other hand, Russia is holding on tightly to its regional unity, which is something the international community has also given its clear support to.
Russia undoubtedly has enough resources for military control over Chechnya, but it will have to pay dearly for it in terms of loss of human life and financial losses, and politically too.
Unless armed resistance starts to subside, the Russians will have to ask themselves whether it is worth paying such a high price for military control of war-ravaged Chechnya.
They will have to consider whether an alternative to their current policy on Chechnya can be found.
The solution arrived at in Kosovo might perhaps serve as a model in principle.
That way Chechnya would still indisputably belong to the Russian Federation, but international peacekeeping forces and local police forces would be responsible for security.
It would certainly be hard for Russia to agree to such a solution, but it will not be easy if the present situation continues either.
The solution is in the hands of the Russians themselves.
Outsiders cannot advise or guide them.
Russia itself must decide what sort of policy it wants to put into effect in Chechnya.
At least for the time being, Russia continues with its current policy, and, as I said to begin with, the ELDR Group supports the joint resolution of the political groups based on it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the referendum on 23 March as a first step in attempting to stabilise the situation in Chechnya.
I also welcome the administration's efforts to make life more bearable, to gradually reopen schools, and to partially reinstate energy supplies, public transport and medical care in Grozny at least. But that is by no means enough.
The Russians really need to make reconstruction a top priority.
Against that background, I hope that the elections in December 2003 or March 2004 will lead to political stabilisation in Chechnya.
The European Union should be prepared to provide whatever assistance is needed to hold free and fair elections.
Nevertheless, I regard it as highly problematic that international organisations have still not been given free access to Chechnya in order to provide urgently needed humanitarian and medical aid.
As has already been mentioned, the refugees' plight remains precarious.
Humanitarian aid must not be cut, nor should refugees be forced to return against their will, unless and until the necessary conditions have been met.
I am concerned that since 11 September the Council and the Commission have effectively stopped discussing the actions of the Russian army in Chechnya, which have chiefly resulted in enormous suffering amongst the civilian population.
Whilst we condemn acts of heartless violence by Chechen terrorists, we also condemn the disproportionate use of military force and arbitrary acts by the Russian army.
You cannot cherry-pick when it comes to human rights, and it is not by breaching human rights that the conflict will be de-escalated.
If the European Union wants to help resolve the conflict, it must work with Russia and press it for further changes in its policy towards Chechnya.
Mr President, Mr Frattini, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to recommend our travel report to you, because it is, in my view, a balanced one, and it makes more subtle distinctions than do some of the speakers I have heard so far.
Commissioner, the fight in Chechnya is not a fight against terrorism only.
The situation is far more complex.
If you read up on it, you will notice that you will speak of Chechnya in a yet more balanced way.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have paid a visit to Chechnya, and I did not gain the impression that the Russians have the situation under control.
People are being abducted on a daily basis.
Soldiers are being killed on a daily basis - ten a day on average.
Human rights are being violated, and the Russians have indeed changed strategy and switched from a military strategy to a political strategy, which involves a referendum and elections being held soon.
However, Mr Frattini, Commissioner, it is a strategy that is being imposed from the top down.
It is not an inclusive process; it is not a process that involves all the layers of the Chechen population.
Neither is it a process that involves the rebels, the resistance fighters, or even Mr Mashadov, the most recently elected President.
I think that we will need to do a great deal in order to remedy this situation.
As far as the humanitarian situation is concerned, I can fully support what the Commissioner has said.
She has, I think, given a correct summary.
Something must be done about what the humanitarian organisations are going through over there.
Mr President, I should like to conclude with the Arjan Erkel case.
Arjan's father is in the public gallery, together with representatives of MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres.
I should like to tell him here officially that in our resolution on which we are voting tomorrow, a paragraph has been devoted to his son's abduction.
I also give you the assurance that this text will be translated into Russian the day after tomorrow.
We have a delegation meeting of the Russian delegation in Moscow next Monday and Tuesday and as the chairman of this delegation, I can assure the relatives that we will bring up their son's case for discussion during our delegation meeting in the Duma next Tuesday.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really do feel that no man is more blind than the man who refuses to see.
What sort of political process is this?
We have witnessed a referendum in which less than 15% of the population voted, in which Western journalists present in Grozny were able to vote: what more do we need to prove that it was a complete charade?
I am pleased to hear that Mr Oostlander found when he went to Chechnya that the normalisation process described by his friend, Mr Putin, has had no effect whatsoever for months.
What is happening in Chechnya is that a policy of terror is being implemented by a state which has succeeded - and the resolution does not mention this - in killing 200 thousand people in 10 years, which has succeeded in turning 300 thousand out of a population of a million inhabitants into refugees, which eliminates dozens and dozens of Chechen civilians every day, and I am talking about civilians, not soldiers, through the Russian armed forces present in Chechnya.
So this is the normalisation process!
If we want to pretend, in the interests of a potential great Russian market, that the policy of terror implemented by the Russian Federation in Chechnya does not exist, then we can continue to do so, but, in that case, we will be accomplices to genocide - and we must be aware of that - for when 20 to 25% of the population of a country is eliminated in less than 10 years, that is called genocide.
This is worse than Bosnia, it is worse than Kosovo. Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, I believe - as Mr Staes said - that the way forward is through negotiations between the two parties concerned, that is between President Putin and President Maskhadov.
The rest is pure and utter garbage that we are inventing in the name of interests which we do not want to admit to.
It was suggested earlier that the war in Chechnya is linked with the war on terror.
I wish to make it very clear that I believe that what Russia is doing in Chechnya is not a war on terror, but that it is actually giving rise to terrorism.
We need to be quite clear that Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov's widow, is right when she says that what is happening in Chechnya is genocide.
I shall not mince my words - I believe that this is a colonial war driven by the energy interests of Gazprom and others. That is what it is really about.
So it is vital that we should not deceive ourselves.
Many well-regarded international human rights organisations came to the conclusion that the so-called referendum was a total sham. Convenient partners for bogus peace talks have been created.
The OSCE has already observed elections in Chechnya.
There has already been peace in Chechnya once.
Mr Mashadov was democratically elected in the presence of OSCE observers, so why are we not negotiating with him?
Why has he been forced to go underground?
This has happened precisely because he represents his people and is not a puppet.
This will not lead to peace, Mr President-in-Office, so the basic presumptions underlying this debate are utterly false.
Choosing puppets as your partners in talks has never been effective and has never led to peace.
I would therefore like to make one point very clear: what I regard as being dishonest about this debate and about many of the speeches we have heard - including speeches made by Mr Putin, who used Chechnya as the bloodiest election platform in history in order to come to power - is the word 'normalisation'.
When was the last time we heard about 'normalisation'?
It was in 1968, when the national uprising by the Czech and Slovak peoples was put down.
That is not the sort of normalisation we want!
Mr President, Commissioner, one thing of which I am certain, having taken part in this delegation, is that, today, it is completely inappropriate to apply the word 'peace' to Chechnya. Three thousand were killed at the start of the year.
Forty-nine communal graves have been found, a very small proportion of which can be ascribed to terrorism and a very large proportion of which can be attributed to the abuses perpetrated daily by an army which has established itself as an occupying force.
The referendum was an illusion of normality.
It is difficult to decree normality in a country by waving the barrel of a kalashnikov.
In view of all this, we believe that the political solution must genuinely be a political solution, and for that to be so, Mr Frattini, I put it to you that all the parties need to be involved.
The former President, Mr Maskhadov, must take part too, and he cannot be dismissed so hastily, Mr Frattini, as a rebel separatist.
Former President, Mr Maskhadov, was elected democratically by the Chechen people at the end of the first war.
Today, Mr Maskhadov is an essential point of reference if we want to achieve genuine peace, true peace.
There is also a danger that Chechnya will become a permanent war zone where old grievances are superseded by new.
One last recommendation to Mr Frattini and to the Commission.
We must ensure that Russia is involved in this peace process and that it shoulders its responsibility.
If we continue today to talk about the possibility of Russia acceding to the European Union, without considering this ongoing conflict as an element which is already causing difficulties in our relations with Russia, we will certainly not be facilitating the peace process.
Apart from being extremely premature, talking about the accession of Russia could be extremely dangerous in terms of the fate of Chechnya.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I think there is a lot of truth in what my fellow MEPs, Mr Fava and Mr Staes, said about the continuous violence in Chechnya.
The reports they have submitted about the lack of reconstruction and about obstacles placed in the way of the humanitarian organisations are shocking.
The information we have obtained to the effect that 30 000 Russian soldiers took part in the referendum is mirth-inducing.
Chechnya is an international issue.
I think it is an outdated notion, incompatible with the EU's general policy, to say that it is an internal matter for Russia to resolve.
We must call for more vigorous efforts to be made and for greater support to be given, as well as for the OSCE to be allowed to open its office again.
We need effective election monitoring.
At the same time, we in the EU, too, must contribute to the reconstruction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the Commission statement on p reparation for the World Trade Organisation Ministerial meeting (Cancun, 10/14 September 2003).
Mr President, I have tried to be as quick as possible.
It is very fortunate that Parliament sometimes gets ahead of the agenda.
It obliges us to get away from our usual responses and I am very glad of that.
Thank you for asking me to bring you up to date on such an important event as the fifth ministerial conference of the WTO, which will be held in Cancun in September.
Our basic position is well known: we want the Doha development programme to succeed by pursuing the European Union's three fundamental objectives.
The first objective concerns support for economic growth, which we need in Europe as much as in the rest of the world.
The second concerns the need for multilateral rules to govern more open markets, which will make for a better link between our trade interests and the values of our societies.
The third objective is that the developing countries should be integrated into the international trade system, which has been the recurrent theme of this round of negotiations.
We see it not as a matter of rhetoric but as something very specific.
Each part of the negotiation programme must have added value in terms of development.
We are only a few weeks away from the Cancun conference; the time we have remaining to make the conference a success is therefore limited and the preparatory process must be stepped up.
The necessary political impetus needs to be given in several areas, namely agriculture, access to industrial markets, investment, competition, facilitation of trade and public contracts.
In all the areas I have just mentioned, details need to be decided in preparation for the final negotiations.
In other matters, like geographical names, the link between trade and development and questions concerning the settlement of disputes, we are looking for initial results at the Cancun conference that will probably be modest and will have to be amplified in the final agreement.
There is still therefore much to be done.
Our feeling is that these objectives can be achieved and that the issue is not the complexity of the questions but the political will.
This is also true for a subject I have not mentioned but which will be important for the Cancun conference: the problem of the poor countries' access to medicines.
As you know, the United States prevented a decision being reached on this last December despite our having reached a balance around the WTO table.
There seem to have been a few developments, but they are not confirmed and it is clear that the US position will have to change if a global agreement is to be reached at Cancun.
Without going into the details, let us consider each of these subjects.
Firstly, agriculture.
We need a complete set of rules and a date for the submission of bids.
From this point of view, the agreement reached in the 'Agriculture' Council last week strengthens the hand of your negotiators.
That agreement clearly marks the start of a new era.
This progress will make for a better use of resources, greater transparency and improved quality, environmental protection and animal welfare, which are all things that farmers, consumers and taxpayers have said they want.
This reform also sends a clear signal to the rest of the world: we are very much turning our backs on an old system that created certain distortions of trade.
The new agricultural policy is more favourable to trade, as the developing countries wanted.
Thus, after consulting your Parliament, the ministers of agriculture have given your negotiators, Commissioner Fischler and myself, a line of credit which we are not going to make public - we are not so naive - but which we will use to the extent that is necessary and justified.
That line of credit will only be opened if we are certain of obtaining something in return.
I am thinking, for example, of the disciplines that will have to be put in place for other systems of support, in particular the US system whose harmful effect on trade is known to us.
I am also thinking of the protection of geographical names.
For all these things we will want something in return, there must be no mistake about that.
There is no question of unilateral disarmament, as my colleague Mr Fischler has rightly said.
In agriculture, we have done our duty.
It is now up to our partners to take initiatives, the US in particular, since in the last few years they have reintroduced a system that creates distortions.
The second point is market access for industrial products.
This is a major objective of the Doha programme.
The opening of trade must be as universal as possible so that these advantages benefit the largest number.
Our aim is to see that the developing countries get better access to our markets, that is, to those of the developed countries, but also to make possible a significant reduction in the trade barriers that might exist between developing countries.
We must not lose sight of the importance of the South-South dimension of market access.
Thirdly, the 'Singapore' issues, namely competition, investment, facilitation of trade and transparency in public contracts.
We must determine the negotiating rules so that talks can be launched formally.
This objective remains one of the Union's priorities.
These questions cannot be separated from the single commitment.
We will resist all temptation to drop one part or another, for to do so would jeopardise the round's entire equilibrium.
We will therefore have to reach agreement on the rules.
Fourthly, the important questions for the developing countries, namely special and differential treatment and implementation.
We are trying to be more flexible towards the developing countries, moving in the direction they desire and wish for without creating a sort of two-speed WTO.
We are willing to make progress in this respect and to draw up a framework agreement or even a set of guiding principles for adoption in Cancun in order to ensure that greater attention is paid to these questions which - let me repeat - are important for the developing countries.
On trade and the environment, which are sensitive issues in this Assembly, at the Cancun conference we shall have to reach a decision on WTO observer status for multilateral environmental agreements and on the deepening of discussions on other environmental subjects.
You know our programme in this field: greater consistency between multilateral environmental agreements and the rules of international trade.
That is why, for example, we have asked that the secretariats of the multilateral agreements and the UNEP, which acts as secretariat for some types of multilateral agreements, should be given observer status at the special sessions of the Committee on Trade and Environment devoted to this question that are held in Geneva.
We also think that the Cancun ministerial conference ought to decide to deepen the discussions on voluntary labelling for environmental purposes.
There is a possibility of constructive dialogue in favour of trade in products that are kind to the environment, especially when they originate in developing countries.
I will end with a word about our working methods, by which I mean the relationship between your Parliament and the Commission in this field.
As always, we are working closely with Parliament to prepare for the Cancun conference.
We have in a way anticipated a number of favourable outcomes of the Convention in this field, since the text currently on the table proposes giving Parliament virtually the same rights as the Council in trade policy, namely codecision for the adoption of laws implementing trade policy, the right to be kept informed throughout the negotiation of international agreements and the right to give assent to the outcome of negotiations, which is the line those of you who have looked into this question were looking for.
I therefore believe that our joint efforts have paid off.
There are no doubt grounds for thinking that, in some respects, the text is still rather convoluted and could be improved.
I think there are still a few pockets of unanimity that a number of you have rightly continued to question.
Progress has nevertheless been real and European democracy will clearly be the winner if the Intergovernmental Conference does not water down the Convention text on this point.
It is therefore with this attitude that we are going to collaborate for the Cancun conference.
As you know, a delegation of Members of the European Parliament will be coming to Cancun with us, as they did to Seattle and Doha.
I am personally delighted about that.
Likewise, we are in favour of the idea of a WTO parliamentary conference, because the parliamentary contribution can only strengthen the negotiator's legitimacy.
To achieve the outcomes I have just described which, as I said, are both ambitious and feasible, we will have to work hard between now and the Cancun conference.
We will do so with you.
This dialogue and these debates are necessary because we know that, without them, we will not have your support.
That is why we are waiting impatiently for the resolution on which, if I understood correctly, the vote will be taken tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats backs all Commissioner Lamy's efforts to achieve a good result at Cancun, and we are obviously in total agreement with him that we need to get the text approved that has now been drafted in the Convention in the area of trade policy and also in the IGC, so you can rely on that.
A successful outcome for the Doha Development Round remains a key factor in promoting worldwide economic growth, in order to strengthen multilateralism and Global Governance.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the general approach with regard to the negotiations as laid down in the Council's mandate for the third ministerial WTO Conference in Seattle.
We would like to urge all WTO members to take the necessary enhancing decisions in Cancun in order to bring the Single Undertaking, the topics of that Round, to a successful close within the agreed deadlines.
The political will displayed by the Member States during the ministerial OECD meeting at the end of April and the G8 summit in Evian is said to be crucial when it comes to making a success of the conference in Cancun and the trade round.
What is important now is that we want to see action rather than words, and that the right negotiating climate should be created.
Over the past three months, we have not seen a great deal of progress in the WTO negotiations.
Many target dates for dealing with specific topics have not been met and are thus, unfortunately, on the agenda in Cancun, which is, in consequence, already threatening to become overloaded.
Needless to say, we welcome in this framework the agreement that the European Union reached in the Council last week concerning the reforms of its agricultural policy, a result on which we would particularly congratulate Commissioner Fischler.
We have good reason for endorsing what the Commissioner has said.
We now hope that the United States, in particular, will follow the EU in taking similar steps.
We should, however, note the fact that this is a fundamental breakthrough.
Important items on the agenda in Cancun also include, in our view, the so-called Singapore topics - investments, competition, trade procedures, transparency of public contracts - and we would call on the Commissioner to be very much involved in these topics.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also requests the formal opening of negotiations in the area of competition policy.
We would emphasise the potential benefits of binding basic principles in the area of competition policy, such as transparency, non-discrimination, procedural honesty and international cooperation between competing authorities.
In the area of public contracts, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of a multilateral and legally binding agreement on public contracts, including goods and services contracts.
Needless to say, we totally agree that education, public health and the audiovisual sector are sectors that have to be treated separately, and we would like to keep it that way.
The European Union has always been one of the advocates of this WTO Round and as the world's largest trade bloc, it owes it to itself to continue to work hard and make Cancun a runaway success.
Mr President, Commissioner, long before the summit in Doha, where the present trade talks have started, my group, that of the Party of European Socialists, emphasised the special nature of these negotiations and the special responsibility that they entail.
On the one hand, there are, of course, the regular agenda items about opening up the markets, which receives my group's unqualified support.
After all, we are aware of trade's capacity for bringing prosperity to our citizens and our trading partners.
On the other hand - as, in fact, the resolution emphasises - these negotiations are, above all, a test of the WTO's capacity to correct a great imbalance in the trade system, to distribute the benefits of trade more evenly and to support sustainable development.
They are a test of our capacity for putting globalisation to work in the interest of all people.
This is why we put to you the following key questions: will the negotiations lead to a considerably fairer distribution of trade profits, particularly between north and south?
Will the negotiations prove that the trade system serves our citizens' desire for ecological and social progress rather than subjecting it to the same?
Will the negotiations strengthen the WTO's transparency and liability towards integration into the wider system of Global Governance?
The mandate that we would like to give Commissioners Lamy and Fischler in Cancun is to ensure that the answer to these questions is affirmative.
My group has set the following four tests in this connection.
First of all, EU negotiators must move more in the direction of the developing countries' requirements in the areas of industrial market access, implementation, special and differentiating treatment and, above all, the trade in agricultural products, but must also demand the same commitment from the United States and other developed countries.
The United Nations recently asked the industrialised countries to cut back considerably in trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and to phase them out eventually, without a quid pro quo from developing countries.
We support this request and would ask the EU negotiators to do likewise.
Secondly - and in Cancun, if not sooner - the WTO must at long last deliver on the Doha promise in order to widen the benefits of the TRIPS in public healthcare to countries with a modest, or no, pharmaceutical industry, which the United States has stood alone in blocking since December 2002.
Thirdly, Cancun must convey the right message concerning relations between trade and non-trade affairs.
In the agricultural modalities, this means safeguarding the right of WTO members to determine food standards and to promote public goods, such as rural development, environmental protection and animal welfare.
This also means that clear progress must be made in the trade and environmental agenda of Doha.
Cancun must give the current TRIPS review new impetus and must focus more clearly on the interests of developing countries, and it must break through the impasse of the fundamental labour standards.
Finally, strengthening the WTO's transparency and democratic liability, where Doha only made a tentative step, must be firmly placed on the negotiating agenda.
We want a strong EU initiative in line with the proposals that Parliament adopted by a large majority in October 2001.
People across the world have two objections to the WTO as it stands now: a lack of honesty and a lack of democracy.
We should listen to our citizens; we should make them our priorities.
Commissioner, we know that at the moment in West Africa, cotton is a specific example of proposals and negotiations where Europe could make a considerable difference.
If you could make a contribution to this in the next few months, this would be a useful leg up.
We would like to hear a concrete reaction from you on that score.
Mr President, I would like to ask three sets of questions in the very generous allocation of 120 seconds given to me this afternoon.
Firstly, on agriculture.
Obviously, like everybody, we in the ELDR Group share the enthusiasm for the outlines of the deal on the reform of the common agricultural policy.
We accept entirely that the tactical priority must now be to turn the tables on the Americans in particular, and to see if they will put their money where their mouth is as far as agricultural reform is concerned.
My group has a number of outstanding questions.
Firstly, whilst there is visible progress in this reform on the elimination or the reduction of trade-distorting internal support, what about market access?
There is nothing in that package that a priori includes improved market access: beyond a reiteration that the European Union takes in more products than anybody else, I want to know at what point are we going to offer greater market access?
Also at what point are we going to really tackle some of the unforgivable aspects of certain sector-specific regimes still in place, notably in sugar?
The second set of questions concerns the Singapore issues.
My group accepts the basic view that the Singapore agenda is one that is worthwhile pursuing, but we are still not quite convinced that the legitimate concerns of developing countries about the scope and complexity of those talks have been addressed.
What assurances can the Commissioner give us that those concerns will be addressed by or at the Cancun summit?
Final set of questions.
The Commissioner suggested in his opening remarks that he would act as if he were anticipating the outcome of the next Intergovernmental Conference as far as increased powers for the Europe Parliament are concerned.
Could he give me an assurance today that, even if the treaty flowing from the Intergovernmental Conference, which includes the power of assent of the European Parliament, is not yet ratified, in those circumstances he would still submit the outcome of next year's conclusion of this round to us for a vote of assent?
Mr President, the difficulties we are experiencing at this critical juncture in the negotiations leading up to Cancun do not augur well for an easy ministerial meeting in September.
These difficulties arise to a large extent from the current world trade system, with its liberalising tendencies and the consequent effects, so often negative, on the fragile economies of the less developed countries.
The North and the South have not benefited from this system in equal measure.
The most important questions raised by those countries must, therefore, be treated with the utmost respect. It is also essential to put a stop to that liberalising tendency, at least until a full assessment of its consequences is carried out.
The Development Agenda must not be a paper tiger. It should rather instil in us an unshakeable resolve and steady us on a firm course.
Over and above that, it is vital to give real and meaningful content to the clause granting special, privileged treatment to developing countries. The European Union should, moreover, establish a strategic alliance with those countries.
We are all aware of the central issues at stake.
I will confine myself to brief comments on three of them: medicines may become a key area, if they are not one already.
The United States has stood in the way of an agreement, and is even pressuring some countries to give up the right to import generic medicines.
It will be important to stress and emphasise the fact that the right to health must take precedence over all commercial interests.
As for the trade in agricultural products, another important area, market access may well be at the heart of the negotiations.
The spectacular increase in US farm subsidies does nothing to bring an agreement closer, but the European Union will be able to take an important step forward, particularly if it contributes to the phasing-out, in the long term, of all export subsidies.
Finally, as regards access to the industrial market, the textiles and clothing sector merits special attention, since it is particularly vulnerable and since concessions, above all bilateral ones, have already been made.
We can countenance a few measures in this sphere aimed exclusively at developing countries, but we must always take care to protect this important industry and its employment potential.
Mr President, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Cancun conference and the preparatory talks are far from being completed, especially in the sectors thought to be favourable to the developing countries.
The fact that the dismantling of agricultural subsidies remains very limited shows the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the rich countries for giving up their privileges; the US is the worst offender, despite having joined in the development round.
The European Union, obsessed by its own interests, has also revised CAP reform downwards.
Revising the TRIPS agreement to ban the patenting of living things ought to be a priority at Cancun.
If intellectual property rights are applied to all forms of life, they violate the sovereign rights of states and populations to protect their resources and skills and deny the very existence of public good.
Negotiators, if you want Cancun to be a success, then listen to the call from the Africa group and drop the Singapore issues.
The absence of solutions to the famous paragraph 6 of the Doha declaration on access to medicines proves that our governments are under pressure from the pharmaceuticals firms and are afraid to adopt a bold and truly humane stance.
Once again, there is a great risk that in the outcome a compromise solution will be vaunted that would have been considered unacceptable at the outset.
In Egypt last week, the US seemed to take a step forward by dropping a restrictive list of diseases.
There then remains the problem of which countries are eligible.
What is meant by sufficient manufacturing capacity?
Rather than accept a second-rate compromise, should we not rather start again with a new basis for negotiations that will result in an economic and practical solution for the developing countries?
Let us not forget the spirit of Doha.
Nothing must prevent countries from protecting their population's health.
In particular, nothing must prevent any member from taking part in the WTO talks fairly and transparently.
We will be particularly vigilant about this when we are in Cancun.
Commissioner, I am asking you not to go back on our commitments.
The Doha round must be the round of the developing countries.
Nature and human beings are not commodities.
The environment and health are more important than the WTO rules.
Do not undermine the European Union's credibility and good faith. Work for sustainable and fair solutions in Cancun.
Mr President, WTO gatherings have in recent years become the focus of anti-globalisation protesters.
A common fear that we hear voiced is that mechanisms of global governance which are removed from democratic control and participation are being put in place and that a world order is being created which serves the goals of capitalism, and not people.
Clearly, against this backdrop, it is vital that we parliamentarians, as the directly elected representatives of the European people, be completely involved in shaping the process and the outcome.
The current round which began at Doha is being hailed as the development round.
We all share the belief that priorities should be given to the needs of developing nations.
These have not shared the benefits of previous trade rounds and the European Union must insist on their full and active participation in the Cancun negotiations.
Market access is a very important element in encouraging integration of developing countries into the world economy.
The EU has offered ambitious market openings for developing countries in goods as well as in services, while avoiding the risk of going for total liberalisation, which most developing countries could not cope with at this stage.
The 'Everything But Arms' initiative is evidence of the EU's approach in this regard.
I urge the Commission to press other developed countries, particularly the United States of America, to follow the European Union's example.
It is intolerable for the EU to be criticised by the President of the United States of America for its relationship with the developing world when, in terms of both aid and market access, we are light years ahead.
EU imports from developing countries grow at an average rate of 12% and now account for 4% of total EU imports, representing EUR 420 million in 2001.
Following on from last week's agreement on reform of the common agricultural policy, it is imperative that we safeguard the European agricultural model in the negotiations.
We have a duty to our own consumers and to our farmers to maintain the stability of national agricultural markets and protect them from international price fluctuations and to uphold the models of production and land use which are typical features of European agriculture.
I stress that any reductions agreed in the WTO on import tariffs, export refunds or trade-distorting domestic agricultural supports can only be agreed on the basis of a fair distribution of costs among all developed countries, particularly the United States of America.
In conclusion, in Cancun this September the EU will be participating in a set of talks which are of crucial importance to many sectors of our national economies, from agriculture to culture.
In this context it should go without saying that the Commission is obliged to defend strenuously vital interests in these areas, in particular in insisting on full inclusion of the so-called non-trade aspects, such as environmental sustainability, consumer protection, social and regional equilibrium.
Failure to do so would result in an agreement that would not be acceptable either to European citizens or indeed to their parliamentary representatives.
Commissioner, the ostensible reason for your reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was that this would give Europe room for manoeuvre in the WTO negotiations.
The compromise agreed in Luxembourg last week largely follows the Commission's recommendations.
Let me ask you a few questions.
Can you tell me today what new horizons this reform opens in the negotiations?
Can you explain to me what agriculture will gain despite a reform that will have very harmful consequences for our farmers?
European consumers are making ever-tougher demands about food safety, product quality and production conditions.
These are resulting in ever-tighter constraints on farmers regarding environmental protection and animal welfare.
Do you think you can meet their expectations by requiring that only products that meet the same standards can enter the European market?
If not, that would distort competition on our own markets and penalise our own products.
In the matter of public health, the Union has opted for a ban on meat treated with hormones.
Will you firmly defend that position, since we do not want it called into question on any pretext?
Our agriculture also produces very high quality produce that is recognised by designations of origin that are often the spearhead of the regional economy.
How do you intend to get our WTO partners to accept them?
Finally, we support the Union's moratorium on GMOs against the complaint filed by the United States.
We are looking to you, Commissioner, to maintain an offensive and unyielding stance in defence of European agriculture and consumer demands and to refuse to make any concessions in the matter of opening markets.
Yielding everything to liberalism would be the end of European agriculture.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too hope that the Cancun event will discuss development, but it must focus first and foremost on the development of international trade, the further liberalisation of trade.
We Europeans must take care not to weigh the agenda down with issues which are unrelated to the liberalisation of trade, or we will end up handicapping the talks.
Commissioner, you said that we have done what was necessary with regard to the CAP.
I believe that we have done the absolute minimum needed to stop the definitive failure of the negotiations but we have done nothing more, we have done too little too late. The Community agricultural policy system is still highly, firmly protectionist.
Mr Clegg has already spoken about this.
Taking the example of sugar, how can we say that the Community agricultural policy is not protectionist where sugar is concerned, for example?
What has sugar got to do with rural development?
What has sugar got to do with environmental or social clauses?
We continue to pursue a hard and fast protectionist approach with regard to sugar, to the detriment of the farming community of Mozambique, for example.
The case of sugar - protectionism pure and simple - is only one example.
On this basis, Commissioner, Europe will find that it is still in very serious difficulties at Cancun.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, the WTO round of talks at Doha were being called the Development Round already at that summit: its end result would be that the developing countries in particular would be able to benefit more from the advantages of globalisation.
This must also be the objective at Cancun in September.
In this respect it will be important to ensure that the developing countries receive the technical and financial assistance they need to help them develop their capacity in terms of administration, industry, commerce and exports.
At the same time, however, it will also be necessary to emphasise the importance of good administration, good-neighbourliness, internal harmony and the fight against corruption as these countries strive to attain the standards of the developed countries.
The alarming prevalence of AIDS, though not just that but many other epidemics too, means that, prior to the Cancun Summit, we should break down the barriers that have been preventing access to reasonably priced medicines everywhere.
The problem is a tough one politically and industrio-politically, but it can be solved.
A certain superpower, in terms of its resources and potential commercial might, Russia, is still outside the WTO.
The Cancun agenda does not and cannot include discussion of Russia's internal legislation or its properly organised administration, or how its WTO membership negotiations could be sped up.
It is nevertheless very much in the interests of the EU in particular that Russia should join the WTO as quickly as possible.
It is by no means just Russia that is suffering from the situation as it is now: the present state of affairs is essentially weakening reciprocal economic relations between the EU and Russia with regard to investment and trade between them.
As with the less developed countries - or should I say as with the other less developed countries? - Russia too should be given support to develop its administration, customs systems, taxation and payments, and other such matters, so that they reach the reliable level that WTO membership requires.
The Commission will have a tough job regarding this in the future.
Commissioner Lamy is used to hard and productive work, but this particular field of activity will also bring economic benefits for the EU.
Mr President, we welcome, and do not take for granted, Mr Lamy's cooperative approach in working with Parliament.
There are issues which the Socialist Group, like others, finds difficult: the Singapore issues, especially investment and competition.
Of course we appreciate the importance of both.
On investment: currently there are over 2000 bilateral investment treaties. That leads to great complexity for developing countries and an imbalance of power, which will not disappear with a multilateral treaty.
On competition: naturally domination by just a few companies leads to high costs, and developing countries are the prime victims.
However, we are still concerned about our approach to the Doha Agenda, and we are not yet convinced that the WTO is the right place or that this is the right time to discuss investment and competition.
Like the Commissioner, we have listened very carefully to developing countries.
We know that they show very great disquiet about the Singapore issues.
The declaration of the trade ministers of the least developed countries of 2 June made this absolutely clear.
Some of the larger developing countries are downright opposed to negotiations on these issues.
Therefore, there is no way near the explicit consensus which is needed.
What should the EU do in those circumstances?
Should we persist and foist an agenda on unwilling developing countries?
If we do, there will be a price to pay in other negotiations!
There are many more important issues and they are identified in our resolution and in the Commission's mandate.
Let us concentrate on them at Cancun.
We are all convinced that fighting for multilateralism is a good thing.
With multilateralism under threat, we must do all we can to make Cancun a success.
But it is a bit like squaring the circle. On the one hand the Americans are defending their interests by every means, while cultivating the myth of total free trade and, on the other, many countries of the South are unable to take their place in the world economy, questioning the present trade rules and demanding positive discrimination.
How can the EU play its part as a bridge-builder and point the US in the right direction?
While noting the positive efforts that have been made, I do wonder about a number of points in the policy on Cancun because we, too, are not without contradictions between our interests and our intentions.
Firstly, how can we make a better defence of special and differential treatment?
The developing countries are not the only ones at fault; we are not clear on this point either.
The scope for such treatment is excessively broad, depriving the concept of differentiation of any real relevance.
And the question of the rules is very much a grey area.
Can we look at them again for TRIPS and for regional areas, not forgetting the question of technology transfer?
Secondly, I support those who do not want to drop the aim of preparing questions about 'Singapore' - I differ from Mrs McNally slightly here - because it involves key aspects of the link between trade and development.
But does the EU have to stick to its initial line?
I agree with the bottom up approach, but would it not be better to support the restrictions, especially pre-establishment, involved in the claim for a political area?
Moreover, there is an urgent need for the Cancun talks to be underpinned by powerful parallel initiatives for the redistribution of direct investments, guaranteeing their sustainability.
Thirdly, so far as agriculture is concerned, we are defending a strong position regarding internal support and the calculation of tariff reductions.
But will the most vulnerable countries of the South, which only produce one thing and are net importers, benefit in any way from it?
Should we not increase market access and abolish export subsidies on products that are strategic for those countries and adopt a framework initiative in favour of fair trade?
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for reminding us of Cancun's common theme - the integration of the developing countries.
Thank you, too, for matching words with deeds in one or other area where the WTO ought to act differently.
If we want to show solidarity with the South and with the most fragile populations of our own area, we cannot treat health, education, water, energy or the necessary progress in sanitation systems as mere commodities.
People in all countries must have the benefit of reasonable prices for what are really public services to humanity.
The negotiations on GATS need to change course.
The right to healthy food in sufficient quantity is also a common good of humanity.
Farmers of the North and the South must be able to support a perspective of true multifunctionality.
Rural development, the very symbol of the non-market sector, and which will be as crucial an issue tomorrow as it is today, is in fact part of the reorientation of the CAP as just adopted by the Council.
It reinforces the adjustments that are a positive signal for our small farmers and for those of the countries of the South.
But if you can rely on the start of the decoupling affecting cereals products or meat, then export subsidies must be less obvious and must continue to be less obvious.
The distinctive nature of European farmers must be protected.
But if solidarity with the small farmers of the South is to be clear, they must be allowed to benefit from support systems similar to the CAP, which still protects European farmers.
The prime task of both of them is to feed their fellow citizens by freely producing the appropriate food.
They must be helped to do so in the face of the two or three agro-industrial monopolies.
Mr President, since the WTO was set up in 1995, the gap between rich and poor countries has become greater.
The Doha Development Round was not worthy of its name.
Now, the Doha deadlines are to be maintained.
Mrs McNally is quite right in saying that this is not the time for adding new topics to the agenda that take account neither of the developing countries nor of the environment.
This would derail the debate on those topics concerned with promoting the objective of sustainable development.
This is an objective that, together with free and fair trade and the eradication of poverty, is incorporated into the EU's new draft Constitution.
The EU now has a unique opportunity to demonstrate that the Constitution is not just a paper tiger.
What the EU should focus upon is ensuring that every country has its say in the negotiations and not only, as is usually the case, the rich and privileged countries that will take care of their own interests.
Cancun must result in practical progress for the developing countries and show that there is a real willingness on the part of the rich countries to prioritise the fight against poverty.
Finally, it must at long last be ensured that governments do not have a monopoly on negotiating and implementing WTO agreements, but that a democratically elected assembly is set up.
Mr President, if negotiations are properly conducted, there is give and take.
If Europe receives the measure with which it has already given, it ought therefore to get a lot in Cancun.
Was not the avowed aim of the CAP reform to improve the Union's negotiating position in the Doha round and not to define the agricultural policy the Europeans need?
My question is therefore this. What substantial concessions is the Union asking from its partners in return for the cascade of unilateral concessions it has made since the end of the Uruguay round?
I will mention a few: the 'Everything But Arms' initiative, the unilateral abolition of import duties on cereals from the Black Sea, the granting of tariff quotas, the decoupling of compensatory aid and the associated dismantling of our common organisation of agricultural markets.
I hope that the Union is at least going to put the unfortunate Blair House Agreement back on the negotiating table, since it prevents us from pursuing a consistent policy for oilseed development and is causing our output to stagnate at a derisory million tonnes while world production is increasing by 5% a year and now exceeds 300 million tonnes.
I also hope that the Commission will get the principle accepted that nations have a right to feed themselves, since this is a basic principle of food security in both quality and quantity terms.
We must not in fact allow countries that are structural exporters to force us to give them a so-called right of access to the Community market for products in which the European Union has a production surplus or for products, Mr President, that we want strictly controlled, like GMOs.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, all of us taking part in today's debate are agreed that we have to allow the developing countries to benefit more than they have done to date from the advantages of free and fair world trade.
For that reason, they have to have better access to our market for their industrial manufactured goods and agricultural produce.
In addition, though, they need to improve the knowledge they need in order to be able to get a foothold in the various markets, and their ability to actively and expertly defend their interests in WTO negotiations.
We therefore strongly support the Commission in its efforts, by means of technical aid, to make it easier for these countries to become independent actors on the world market.
If, though, we are not to lose sight of the fact that economic growth for all trading partners is the most important goal of WTO negotiations, it naturally follows that, in offering access to this market, we must, in the negotiations, develop an adequate strategy with regard to the developing countries so that they might have a practical awareness of the advantages of negotiating on the traditional issues of market access and competition, as well as on other issues.
Whilst we have an interest, in the context of the GATS negotiations, in cautiously extending the scope of services, we insist on the cultural and organisational diversity of Europe, as reflected in the area of health, education, the audio-visual sector, and the local provision of services of general interest.
We also believe that we should have no interest in making exceptions of this sort for further sectors and removing them from the scope of the market organisation for services.
Europe leads the world by a long way in the provision of services.
Those who, in this area, adopt a defensive and protectionist position do not recognise the strengths and competitive advantages that the European Union possesses.
What has to be said as regards the body of WTO legislation is that we are meant, in particular, to develop the rules on procedure, transparency and the resolution of disputes, and that the WTO should become an independent and international jurisdiction in trade matters.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Commissioner that, together with the Interparliamentary Union, the European Parliament will, as we have done before, be staging an event in Cancun.
The object of the enterprise is that members of the parliaments of countries belonging to the WTO should meet together in order to exchange information.
An additional consideration is that, in our view, many trade issues are moving further and further away from what have traditionally been considered as such, with which they formerly coincided, and touch on very sensitive areas that are of great interest to many members of the public.
These include the service sector among many others.
The event will be held in Cancun on 9 and 12 September, and this House will be playing a leading part in it, with many of our Members being present.
We would of course be glad if all Members of this House with an interest in these matters were to circulate information about this event.
Let me also address a second point, one raised by Mr Clegg, that being the issue of whether you will at all agree - whether or not the Convention so decides - that this House must approve the agreement negotiated in Cancun, no matter when or how it is concluded?
Now for my third point. Might you consider reiterating today that Parliament is to give its approval and have - within the Article 133 Committee - a right equal to that of the Council to be involved and informed, and, furthermore, are you able to make a statement to the effect that Parliament should also have a part to play in allocating seats on it?
Commissioner, a few days before the last European Union/United States summit, you expressed your satisfaction that there were, and I quote, 'solid commercial relations between the Union and the United States that enable us to work together on the Doha programme.'
However, just before Cancun, it is vital that there is a European commitment that is not afraid of being different from the American positions in several areas.
This is what I think is expected by those, such as the trade ministers of the LDCs very recently, who are criticising the WTO's inability to respect the Doha timetable, to complete the negotiations on decisions in favour of development, on access to medicines, special and differential treatment or trade in agricultural products.
So far, no progress has been made.
I would like to reiterate my fear of this 'dimension' of development disappearing due to a policy that gives priority only to commercial trade and has been dogmatic in choosing to liberalise it.
While the gulf between rich and poor countries is widening, it is difficult to accept this desire to include new subjects such as investment, competition or public markets.
For its part, GATS threatens public services and State missions when there has not yet been any evaluation of what effect liberalisation may have.
Under these circumstances, there should be a moratorium.
The right to health, education, food safety, and energy should prevail above commercial interests.
The European Union should, on the contrary, work towards the democratisation of the international trade system and cooperate closely with developing countries so that the development objectives prevail.
Mr President, the agenda of the forthcoming ministerial conference is more than full and contains a number of essential topics, including life-saving medicines and agriculture.
In addition, we have the task of enabling poor countries to meet the standards on working conditions, animal welfare and the environment, so that they can import their products into Europe.
For this, producers in developing countries will need help in the field of producing, and trading in, products in line with European standards.
In this context, I would argue in favour of a restricted agenda that contains the essential topics I have mentioned.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to focus his contribution on these topics so that a specific result can be achieved.
It may be commercially rather more appealing for Europe to negotiate on new topics, but developing countries simply do not have the capacity to do this.
Cancun's success will therefore be measured in relation to the interests of the developing countries.
It is, after all, a development round.
Mr President, Commissioner, to ensure that significant progress is made in Cancun on the realisation of the development agenda is not going to be easy, bearing in mind the need to reflect the interests of all the members of the WTO, to take up the concerns of the least-developed countries and in view of the great number of issues to be negotiated.
All of these issues are essential to ensuring that multilateral trade relations lead to economic growth, if we want this growth to be equitable and its benefits also to reach the least-developed countries.
Hence the need to make progress on all fronts in the development agenda and if possible within the time periods laid down, in line with the support you are providing on behalf of the European Union.
In view of the brevity with which I am obliged to speak, I will restrict myself to access to the industrial product markets, in particular, naturally, the textiles and clothing sectors and to respect for the rules which govern international trade.
In this regard, I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that there is no reduction in the European Union's tariffs while other countries have not reached the tariff levels laid down in the Union.
Secondly, that you pay special attention, within the framework of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, to the issue of designs and the international exhaustion of the registered trademark and to actions to combat counterfeiting and pirating.
Finally, I would ask you to promote simplification of the commercial defence mechanisms in order to make them quicker and more effective, because the persistence of tariff barriers, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers is incompatible with the process of liberalising the markets.
Because the rules of the WTO are binding on all members and therefore compliance with them must be guaranteed.
But also, because the future of the European textiles and clothing industry depends on it, as the Commissioner is well aware.
Mr President, Commissioner, after the reform of the CAP we now have to deal with Cancun.
It is quite clear that in this context it has to be said that our European trade objectives do not demonstrate our will to reduce the gaps in development between North and South, between developed countries and the rest of the world.
In this sense, in terms of agriculture, we of course need to agree to increase the special and differential treatment for LDCs that are already included in the Marrakesh Treaty.
We also need to confirm the results of Doha with regard to the substantial reduction of our export refunds, and at the same time, to ensure that this measure is extended to all forms of export subsidies because we are aware that it is not only the Union that is involved.
At the same time, it is clear that the Union should condemn the recent American farm bill, which protects American producers against the ups and downs of the market, and which therefore threatens to generate an excess in supply and a fall in prices on international markets.
As well as this, Commissioner, the Union must defend the right of each Member State of the WTO to set its production and food safety standards and to apply them to the products that come on to their markets.
European producers have a right to this guarantee on imports, as well as international recognition of geographical indications in order to increase the value of their regions and traditional know-how.
All in all, Commissioner, Cancun must benefit the developing world, but without being detrimental to the large majority of small and medium-scale European farmers.
Mr President, we must beware of arousing too many expectations and too great ambitions on too many fronts by overloading the agenda for Cancun.
Yet we cannot overemphasise that trade is good for both parties.
There is plenty of research and empirical evidence supporting this view.
We must concentrate on removing barriers and improving access because that benefits all parties to trade.
I express the hope that the CAP package of reform will convince our trading partners of our goodwill in this matter.
But I cannot help wondering whether they, as well as we, will have to wait until the final text when the devil in the detail becomes available to us.
I note the number of disputes that we have with our partners across the Atlantic, in particular one concerning GMOs and access to the EU market, which has now been referred to the disputes procedure.
I hope that Cancun or the disputes procedure will enable us to resolve this sort of dispute because the EU must not be seen as a fortress of privileged countries.
Cancun is in the new world.
I hope that will create an opportunity to bring the two sides, on either side of the Atlantic - the old world and the new world - together to resolve trade differences to the mutual benefit of our citizens and our economies.
So I wish Commissioner Lamy and my colleagues who will go as part of the European Parliament delegation a successful meeting.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Cancun Conference is not looking good.
There is the feeling that the European Union is going to make it even more complicated with its negotiation strategy.
That Cancun is not looking good is due to the frustrations that have built up among developing countries since the end of the Uruguay round, frustrations which have already led to the failure of the Seattle Conference.
Once again, their confidence is being tested, as many of the significant commitments made in Doha were not honoured and the deadlines not respected.
This is true of such issues as access to medication, but also of special and differential treatment, the issues surrounding implementation, and of reform of the regulations on dispute settlement.
This is about what Europe is going to achieve during these negotiations by using its considerable clout.
Is it going to use it in order to provide answers that restore developing countries' confidence, or will it go no further than a narrow vision of its commercial interests?
Let us look at the Singapore subjects.
Why is there this insistence on imposing a multilateral agreement on investments on the developing countries at all costs, when they do not want it?
They cannot see why the rules and conditions for foreign investment in their countries should be governed by the WTO.
However, you insist on making it one of the European Union's conditions for an agreement in Cancun.
Do you not feel that this is an extra burden that serves no purpose?
You are entering into a wrestling match between the European Union and the developing countries.
Rather than that, we would prefer an alliance between the European Union and the countries of the South.
You have also heard many different speakers from different groups in this House asking you to concentrate on the essentials.
Use your clout, the European Union's considerable influence, to improve special and differentiated treatment, to make progress towards access to the markets, to bring about reform of dispute settlement, to ensure that the environment is taken into account, to promote access to medication, and not to serve an agreement on investments, public markets or competition, which should not be the responsibility of the WTO.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, in discussing the WTO negotiations in Cancun, we have a clear objective in mind.
The global economy needs framework conditions, and if we do not succeed in giving it some, and in good time, we will face conflict situations that may well lead to major difficulties, not only for us in Europe, but also for the world as a whole.
As 20% of our jobs depend on world trade, our vital interests are involved when we consider what markets will be accessible to us in future.
There are currently ten new countries wanting to join us, and, when they do, Europe's population will grow by 20%, offering us an interesting market, with interesting production techniques.
Across the world, billions of consumers await the products and services that we supply.
We should be constantly reminding ourselves that Europe's success is in fact founded on the active efforts of small and medium-sized firms, which account for 80% of taxes paid.
For that reason, it should be a matter of primary concern for us that the right conditions should be created to enable small and medium-sized firms to take part in international trade.
We therefore demand that all import rules be notified to, and made available by, the WTO, so that it becomes once and for all transparently clear what provisions - on labelling, packaging customs duties - have to be complied with when supplying goods to a specific country.
Today, if a firm is part of a group and has its own experts, it can readily find the answers to a vast number of questions, but for a small firm of under half a dozen people, this is impossible.
We therefore demand that there should be a register, kept at the WTO, in which the import rules of every country are recorded, with the possibility of completing a standard form, in current language, downloaded from the Internet.
Whilst we want to give small and medium-sized firms in developing countries a chance to export, we also demand that the 18 million small and medium-sized firms that we have at present in the European Union - especially those interested in exporting worldwide - should get what they are entitled to, and that the WTO should give them a fair chance.
The fact is that these firms employ two-thirds of the European Union's workforce, and I believe that it is worth our while to stand up for them.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make two points about the strategy we should pursue at Cancun in September.
My first point is that the Doha Declaration is very clear on the need to ensure the best possible balance between commercial and non-commercial aspects of trade.
In this connection, key issues include the precautionary principle, food safety, basic rules governing GMOs and also respect for designations of origin and geographical descriptions.
We will have to make it clear that the use by various third countries of our geographical descriptions and designations of origin, which are linked to a culture, a region and a history, as generic and semi-generic products is completely unacceptable.
For Australian, Canadian and New Zealand producers to sell products labelled as 'port', 'Madeira', 'champagne', 'Parma ham', 'Manchego cheese', and so on, is unacceptable because it demonstrates an improper appropriation of a commercial advantage to which those producers are not entitled.
My second point is to remind you that the recent reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) fully permits us to assume a more assertive stance in the negotiations.
Rather than pour all our energy into the issue of protecting geographical descriptions and non-commercial concerns, we can also attempt to impose a wide range of regulations, in particular toughening legislation on export credits, state-owned enterprises and the abuse of food aid and the de minimis clause.
We can convince all rich countries to grant the 49 poorest countries in the world the same conditions granted by the EU through the 'Everything but Arms' initiative. We can force a clear distinction to be drawn between developing countries and the poorest countries in the world, since it is unrealistic to put countries such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia and various South American States in the same class as Mozambique, Chad, Burkina Faso and most of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States.
Apart from agriculture, this is also an issue in, for example, the textile and clothing sector, where the complete opening up of the Community market to products from the former group of countries would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in the European Union, especially in the poorest countries and those lagging furthest behind, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and the new Member States in Eastern Europe.
It is to be hoped, then, that a fundamental balance between all these concerns can be reached at Cancun. If it is not, globalisation will be rejected by our societies.
I should like to compliment the Commission on having managed to achieve a new agricultural agreement that offers plenty of scope for a new WTO Agreement.
Not one single product is still receiving direct support now and, insofar as import tariffs still apply in the European Union, production is restricted and an important proportion of the world market has been surrendered.
Accordingly, the assigning of quotas in the EU's dairy sector has meant that we have relinquished five percent of our share in world trade.
Unfortunately, I have to say that this five percent has not been utilised in any way by developing countries.
In addition, the European Union has concluded a trade agreement with the world's 48 poorest countries, and we provide free market access to many former colonies and to the Balkan countries.
If we consider that we are on the eve of an enormous enlargement of the Union, we have to establish that the European Union has given free trade a huge shot in the arm.
We already import more agricultural products from the developing world than the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand put together.
This means that the European Union has adopted an open stance and has, in this respect, most definitely contributed to a new world trade agreement.
It would, therefore, not surprise me if certain groupings, including in this Parliament, were to claim that this agreement does not go far enough.
We have gone further than any other trading bloc; we offer more market access than any other trading bloc.
This means that it is precisely this strong position that will weaken us if we do not take a united stand.
By undermining the joint European position, there will be even less consideration in the world for non-trade affairs, such as animal welfare, food safety, the environment, but also for social aspects.
This is precisely the quality that Europe can add to a new world trade agreement.
I would once again like to congratulate the European Commission, particularly Commissioner Lamy and his colleague, Mr Fischler.
I hope that this Parliament will be united behind the Commission.
Indeed, on the basis of the present agreements on agricultural policy reform, we are in a strong position in new negotiations, and we have a great deal to offer to the world in terms of social justice, but also in relation to non-trade matters.
Mr President, as the speeches have shown, multilateral trade negotiations in the twenty-first century have many facets and are a mixture of interests and values, one that is, in any case for us Europeans, to some extent indissoluble.
They also raise, as we have realised from listening to you, issues around the overall balances on the international stage, between North and South, North and North and South and South.
I would briefly like to respond to a few of your speeches, grouping them into three themes, first of all access to the market, then the rules of international trade, and finally, several other issues that are not necessarily directly linked to the first two but are worthy of clarification.
First of all, on access to the market, concerning the industrial sector, I agree with what has been said.
We must move towards what some of the developing countries want.
It is in their interest and also in our interest.
However, let us remember that there is also a South-South interest in the liberalisation of trade for manufactured products.
Trade in manufactured products still represents 80% of world trade.
Here we have all the dimensions that I mentioned, and Mrs Ferrer is right in saying that in these matters, we should not stop at tariff issues, but also look at non-tariff barriers.
You have all spoken a great deal about agriculture, which is quite normal due to the current circumstances.
It is true that the reform of the common agricultural policy that was adopted last week gives more impressive results in terms of discipline - the issue of budgetary support for our farmers - than in terms of promises of broader access to the markets in the future.
However, we have not yet agreed to confirm in some way at WTO level, the disciplines that we decided between us.
We are free to confirm them or not at international level and we will do so if others do.
We are therefore looking for something in return, which is what we are going to work on for now, as the support compensates for some handicaps and takes into account some concerns among European consumers and citizens.
As Mrs Auroi and Mr Bernier said, with our support we are compensating for this type of handicap or additional constraint.
Mr Clegg asked whether there was still room for manoeuvre in the negotiations in terms of access to the market.
I am sure he will allow me, and Mr Fischler, to remain discreet as regards how much we have in our pocket.
Mr Clegg will be aware that it is not good to negotiate with transparent pockets, so our pockets will not be transparent in a public sitting such as today's.
However, he is right, as is Mr Della Vedova.
There is no doubt that the forthcoming reform of the sugar market, which Mr Fischler and the Commission have announced for the autumn, is probably more promising from this point of view for a product that holds great interest for developing countries.
I would like to point out, in response to Mr Souchet, that this reform of the common agricultural policy was made with European considerations in mind, by Europeans and for Europeans.
It is all the better if it improves our position in international negotiations, but that was not our original motivation.
Our motivation, as established at the Berlin European Council, was to carry out a mid-term review of some organisations of the market and of the functioning of our support for agriculture.
With regard to the rules, some of you have mentioned access to medication.
I will not repeat what I said in my initial speech.
The European Union's position on this is clear: we support the commitment made in December and we expect the Americans to adhere to it, otherwise there will be a major problem in Cancun.
Regarding non-commercial concerns, to which Mr van den Berg made particular reference, they are indeed on the table, including for agriculture: animal welfare, the environment and food safety.
There are also subjects concerned with the regulation of international trade, such as the geographical indications cited by Mr Garot and Mr Cunha.
You are right.
We cannot tell our farmers that the time has come to think less about quantity and more about quality without keeping to the agenda that we have, which consists of improving and making more operational and more easy what the WTO texts are already establishing in terms of protection: geographical indications.
The last delicate subject is the so-called Singapore subjects, and in particular investment.
Our starting point has always been that it is better to have a good multilateral international platform than a bad jungle of bilateral agreements.
You rightly said that some developing countries are not enthusiastic, but not all of them!
Some others are entirely in favour of starting negotiations on these subjects, particularly investment.
Fundamentally, what developing countries are saying is a little like what I have heard here this afternoon: some are very much in favour, and some are very much against, some are 'maybe' for, and others are against 'unless'.
That is the situation we are in and in answer to Mr DÃ©sir, in the choice between the bilateral jungle and multilateral order, I have often heard him say things that are more multilateralist than what he has said this afternoon.
What path should we take?
We must stay firm on the need to deal with these issues, while responding to the justified and repeated concerns of a number of developing countries, to the fear that they have that by committing to multilateral agreements on these subjects, they would be reducing the area of autonomy of their economic policies.
We must find ways of responding to this concern.
In any case, in general, I am still persuaded that multilateral is better than bilateral in these fields.
Regarding special and differential treatment and issues of implementation, I think that I indicated in my initial speech that the European Union was open and that it was more a case of convincing other partners in the North, the United States, Japan, Canada, to demonstrate a little more flexibility.
We are working on this.
I will deal with two or three more questions.
Regarding cotton, Mr Van den Berg, it is not the Union, for once, that is being accused by the developing countries.
We do not export any cotton.
We import a huge amount of cotton and what we do produce in no way supports exportation.
We must produce 2% to 3% of the cotton produced in the world.
It is therefore the United States that is being challenged on this point.
Mrs McNally and Mr van den Berg talked about fundamental working standards.
Unfortunately, this subject is not on the programme for Cancun, because it was not put on the programme for the cycle of negotiations launched in Doha.
Some, but not all of the subjects launched in Doha are on the programme for Cancun.
Having said that, we cannot add new subjects to the Doha programme.
You know our position: we regret not having managed to better link fundamental work standards and the rules of the World Trade Organization.
To some extent, we made do with our bilateral policies in order to achieve this.
Therefore we cannot, unfortunately, expect good news from Cancun on this point.
We need to wait for another cycle of negotiations to put the subject back on the table.
On the question of what the Commission thinks of Parliament being involved at the end of the negotiations, I have no objection at all, on behalf of the Commission, to the results of the cycle ending with a vote in the European Parliament, unless of course the Council of Ministers disagrees.
In any case, the Commission's position is what I have just told you, in response to Mrs Mann and Mr Clegg.
As regards Russia's accession to the WTO, I can tell Mr Suominen that we are working on it.
I am spending my day here today, with my colleague German Gref, who is the Russian Minister for the Economy and Finance and the negotiator appointed by Mr Putin.
This is probably our sixth negotiating session and, thanks to the debate this afternoon, you have given him the opportunity to look around this lovely town of Strasbourg, and I am sure that he will be very grateful to you.
I can tell Mrs Auroi and Mrs Boudjenah that we debated GATS only a few weeks ago.
Parliament took a position on it, so I am not going to come back to the subject.
Finally, regarding the good news that Mrs Mann gave us on the joint demonstration in Cancun by the European Parliament and the International Parliamentary Union, and the work that she, Mr Schwaiger, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and many others have done to associate the national parliaments more with the work of the WTO, for the Commission this is good news.
You know that we support your efforts in this area.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the International Criminal Court.
. (IT) Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, it is both a great honour and a great responsibility for the Italian Presidency to take the floor before the European Parliament on the issue of the International Criminal Court.
It is certainly an honour since Italy has, from the very beginning, been among the Court's major supporters and has given its name to the Rome Statute.
It is, at the same time, however, a great responsibility for the Italian Presidency to continue to support, with the same determination as our predecessors, the efforts of the international community to give life to an international jurisdiction that puts an end to impunity for those guilty of committing the most heinous crimes.
The Court is proving to be a great success: to date, 90 countries have joined the Rome Statute.
The Court held its inaugural session this year and, with the election of its President, judges, Prosecutor and Registrar, has become a fully functioning element in international relations.
The European Union can be proud of having made a decisive contribution to these developments.
The Italian Presidency has an important heritage to defend, and it intends to defend it.
Only a few days ago, on 16 June, the Council confirmed its commitment to the Court through the adoption of a common position that has the political significance of confirming the European Union's unconditional support for the institution.
On the basis of the common position, the May 2002 Action Plan will be updated.
Action in support of the Court will remain an essential component of the Union's foreign policy measures.
As you all know, in the pursuit of this action, the European Union will find itself facing some sensitive and complex issues, but this will certainly not lessen our commitment in any way.
Our initiative will take various forms. Firstly, Italy will represent the European Union at the Second Assembly of States Parties in September.
We are diligently preparing for this engagement and we will do everything in our power to resolve all the issues which are still outstanding with regard to the institution and the way it functions.
Secondly, to ensure the Court's efficient functioning and guarantee its independence, the European Union will continue to encourage the States to transfer swiftly and fully their contributions, determined according to the decisions made by the Assembly, and to respect the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court.
Thirdly, the European Union will continue to urge those States that have not yet done so, to become party to the Statute, because we believe that the broadest possible participation is both desirable and necessary.
In accordance with the provisions of the common position, a large-scale awareness campaign has already been launched in this regard, particularly in the context of political dialogue with non-Member States.
Fourthly, the European Union will continue to uphold the integrity of the Rome Statute, including in our relations with our friend, the United States of America.
As you can imagine, this is a frequent item on the agenda in transatlantic discussions and it was raised just last week at the European Union/United States Summit in Washington.
Ladies and gentlemen, our aim is to pursue broad dialogue on all aspects of the issue with the United States.
We and the United States share the same fundamental values and place the same importance - great importance - on the objective of putting an end to impunity for the most serious crimes and identifying the people responsible for committing them.
However, objectively speaking, we have to admit that our views differ on what the Court's role should be.
The United States, with its massive presence on a global scale, is concerned about the possibility of politically-motivated accusations against its citizens.
The European Union believes that the Court's Statute provides sufficient guarantees of impartiality and authoritativeness, such as the high calibre of the judges and the principle of complementarity of the Court's work, to lessen, or even allay the fears of possible exploitation of the institution's activities.
My predecessors have updated Parliament on developments in these ongoing discussions between the European Union and the United States of America and on the initiatives developed by both parties.
I will not repeat what everyone already knows, but I would like to point out how, as far as Italy is concerned, we intend to proceed during this Presidency.
The United States fears, inter alia, that the Court could constitute a threat, albeit an indirect one, to the conduct and implementation of United Nations' peacekeeping operations.
The European Union considers that the Court is an important safeguard for the protection of peace forces too. In this context, the UN Security Council has examined the United States' proposals to exclude peace forces from the Court's jurisdiction for two consecutive years.
The European Union was able to express its firm support for the Court during Security Council meetings open to non-Member States in both years.
This year, the Union also publicly came out in favour of convening the Security Council meeting which took place on 12 June.
During this meeting, all the members of the Security Council were asked to strive to find a solution which would preserve both the integrity of the Rome Statute and the smooth operation of peace missions: two factors which are clearly not incompatible.
The United States, as you know, is seeking to conclude a series of bilateral agreements to exempt its citizens from the Court's jurisdiction.
We heard yesterday that US military assistance has been withdrawn from some countries, including five which are about to join the European Union, which have declared that they are not amenable to such agreements.
The Union regrets this measure.
We do, of course, intend to analyse the matter in depth with a view to further talks with Washington.
I would remind you that, last September, the Council adopted Conclusions with certain guidelines to follow in concluding exemption agreements in order to preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute.
The conclusions and guidelines were first and foremost intended for Member States and candidate countries, but they are clearly relevant to all States Parties to the Rome Statute.
These documents have been disseminated in a large number of non-Member States with the intention of informing them of the basic position that the European Union has already taken over this issue.
The European Union is firmly convinced that the International Criminal Court will make the world a safer place, or rather, it will help make the world a safer, fairer and more peaceful place.
The simple fact of establishing the Court in practice will be a deterrent to committing the most serious crimes.
By putting an end to impunity, the Court will strengthen the supremacy of the law and make a fundamental contribution to peace.
In conclusion, the Court will very soon prove to be a genuinely independent, effective institution.
It will do so by working on actual cases and those who distrust it will be able to see - I repeat, from the Court's actual work - that the Rome Statute guarantees the highest criteria of justice and does not lend itself - or, at least, we must endeavour to ensure that it never lends itself - to political manipulation.
This will, of course, be one of our tasks in the frank, friendly dialogue between the Presidency and the United States of America.
Mr Moreno Campo, recently appointed Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said when he was sworn in, 'An International Criminal Court that is totally independent and impartial brings hope, but at the same time raises reasonable fears and misunderstandings'.
This Court brings the hope of a new era for international justice; it provides an effective tool for fighting impunity, and is therefore a deterrent factor - as the President of the Council has just said - to those who are tempted to carry out serious criminal acts that the Court has the authority to try.
But it also, if we look at the position of the United States, raises fears and misunderstandings.
It is the Americans' fear of their people being pursued for political reasons which has led them to make efforts all over the world to obtain bilateral immunity agreements for their nationals, and which also led to the renewal of Security Council Resolution 1422.
In order to secure these agreements, the United States have not hesitated to use the threat of refusing to give military help to countries that do not sign them.
What does this position mean?
As they did not sign up to the Rome Statute, the United States consider themselves free to conclude immunity agreements, particularly in view of the considerable number of American soldiers deployed in the four corners of the globe.
Whatever the value of this argument, there is no doubt that the significant contribution from the United States to peacekeeping cannot be ignored.
It is also clear that countries that have signed the Rome Statute cannot use some sort of hidden door to escape their obligations to the International Criminal Court.
The guiding principles, adopted by the Union in September 2002, and to which the Presidency of the Council referred, are a little clearer on this point: we do not think that these agreements are necessary, but we accept them as long as they satisfy certain well-defined criteria.
The agreements that the United States are trying to make do not match our conditions and are clearly aiming to undermine the Rome Statute insofar as they do not have any clear provisions to prevent impunity and they understand impunity as applying to those other than American nationals in a country for certain military or strictly administrative reasons.
So how can we put forward our position?
We did this with the common position on 16 June, which unambiguously indicates that the guiding principles are not just some sort of internal scheming, but must be applied to justify the protection of the integrity of the Rome Statute in our relations with third countries.
This position was the result of reasoning and dialogue.
My colleagues Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen have joined forces with the Greek Presidency in sending joint letters to the Foreign Ministers of Member States, candidate countries and the Balkan States.
They stress the need to take into account the Union's position.
We have given instructions to our heads of delegation in third countries to stress the importance of this issue.
In countries that have already signed an immunity agreement, our heads of delegation have been invited to look more closely at the probability of ratifying those agreements.
These diplomatic efforts are backed up by the considerable support that we have given to the NGOs campaigning for an effective International Criminal Court through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
Also, very recently, the Thessaloniki European Council confirmed that the Union unreservedly supports the International Criminal Court.
What are the results?
Having recalled our principles and the action we are taking, let us have a clear view of this.
The results are rather mixed.
Even leaving aside the agreement signed hastily by Romania in August 2002, and even though the Member States and candidate countries resisted American pressure in order to come into line with the Union's position of 16 June, it is clear that the situation in the Balkans remains vague: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and very recently the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia signed such agreements, none of which comply with the conditions defined in the Union's guiding principles.
We have not concealed our disappointment and we have expressed it to those countries.
Regarding the renewal of Security Council Resolution 1422, there is no doubt in our minds that the legality of this measure is, at best, questionable.
We allowed an open debate in the Security Council where the concerns as to the legality of this proposition could be expressed.
In a remarkable speech, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, not only raised doubts about whether the Security Council Resolution should be based on Article 16 of the Rome Statute but he also questioned the need for it.
In fact United Nations peacekeeping forces remain under the jurisdiction of the State of which they are nationals and they would be immediately repatriated if they had committed a serious crime.
As long as their country of origin dealt with the matter correctly, the additional jurisdiction of the Criminal Court would not enter into play.
Finally, on behalf of the Union, the Greek Presidency unequivocally stated that there was no question of accepting automatic renewal of this resolution in the years to come, allowing this conduct - because that is what it is - to continue unchallenged.
Finally, I would like to mention the considerable aid provided by the Union since 1995 for the International Criminal Court through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, in the shape of EUR 13 million, which is a significant sum, along with our efforts to raise awareness among parliamentarians, civil servants, civil society, those working in the legal system and even military personnel, for example, in the new independent States.
Hand in hand with this goes our work in training defence lawyers in order to make this Court a tangible and immediate reality.
Thinking also about what form our support will take in the next few years, we are listening to NGOs and several MEPs who will speak at a seminar organised by the Commission on 14 July to hear various points of view on this issue.
I feel that I have defended and presented a position that is entirely in line with what the Presidency of the Council has just said.
No one will be surprised at this.
There is no doubt that the International Criminal Court presents a challenge in terms of transatlantic relations.
When the eminent team made up of 18 judges and prosecutors begins its work, we are convinced, as Europeans, that the International Criminal Court will prove worthy of our support and confidence.
It will also dispel the concerns that remain here and in the minds of our American friends.
Mr President, I should like to concur with the Commissioner, who, a moment ago, said that he totally agreed with the Council's positions.
Parliament's full support for both your positions is apparent from the resolution that we have adopted.
Contrary to what we thought in the past, economic order and the internal market are not the most important components in the European Union.
The crux of the matter - which we discovered very clearly during the enlargement process - is the fact that we are a legal community, one that is committed to the rule of law and to an international legal order.
These are the elements that make up the heart of the European Union and determine its character.
This is why it goes without saying that the three major institutions within the European Union should stand united behind this same line.
You sometimes hear that recourse to the law is a sign of weakness.
Europe is weak in a military sense, and this is why it is said that we pay particular attention to such things as the international legal order.
The Americans are strong in military terms, which is why they can manage without this concern for the international legal order and can rely on power politics.
This is an extremely cynical view, although there has obviously been cause in the past to think along those lines.
In my opinion, the International Criminal Court's predecessor, the Tribunal for Yugoslavia, was set up at the time because those who then felt responsible, or behaved as if they were responsible, for the war in Yugoslavia and its ending, looked for a way to delay military intervention.
This is when we got this Tribunal for Yugoslavia.
Fortunately, the International Criminal Court, which is the present institution, has not been a mere palliative for a long time.
The European Union will, of course, need to be convinced in other areas that it does not lack in the ostentatious display of power.
After all, the implementation of law always needs to be backed up by power, and this also applies to the Americans.
Power is exerted in order to administer law.
In fact, we can also refer to the American Constitution in this respect, which considers international legal order, rule of law and democracy to form part of their national interest.
This is a very fine definition of national interest.
The present threats to third countries with a view to having these countries sign bilateral inviolability agreements are, of course, a serious matter.
The new accession countries are, at the same time, new NATO members; it is to be seen how serious the Americans still take the existence of NATO if military assistance is simply withdrawn.
Moreover, the ICC provides only supplementary jurisdiction, whereby it is assumed that the countries that have signed the agreement are themselves constitutional states and most definitely call those to account who have possibly misbehaved in the course of their military duty.
In some Member States, we do indulge from time to time in some antics that stir up distrust on the part of the Americans. This is illustrated by the strange fact that General Franks was denounced by Belgium as a war criminal.
If legislation is used in this manner, it is made political, as the minister stated a moment ago, and this leads to distrust of the law.
It is, therefore, vitally important, in my view, that the EU Member States should be well aware of how they need to behave in this connection so as not to stir up any distrust among the Americans.
It is, of course, the case - we have to give this to the Americans - that the US runs a greater risk than we do, particularly on account of the large-scale activities in the military sphere.
Despite this, I think that, especially given this understanding, a dialogue with the US must be a priority.
There may be room for some humour in this. The law about a possible invasion of The Hague, for example, is obviously something that we cannot possibly take seriously.
Mr President, I do not wish to repeat what Commissioner Lamy has already said, that although the International Criminal Court is not a political instrument, it is starting life in a particularly difficult political context, and that, since 2002, the United States have been clearly trying to forcibly short circuit the Court, both in the UN and by signing bilateral agreements with a considerable number of countries.
I would like to say how shocked I am as a parliamentarian by the methods that are being used to put pressure on certain countries - and I am thinking in particular of the pressure that Colombia is under, threatened with the suspension of American aid for combating drug traffickers, and the pressure put on the Baltic countries or other NATO candidate countries - but also the extent to which the whole of Europe is currently dependent on the European Union; and there is a very particular symbolic significance in all of us, the Council, Parliament and the Commission being in agreement.
It is absolutely essential that the Italian Presidency should be aware that this International Criminal Court is more than an instrument for fighting the Americans and their unilateralism; it is a way of us ensuring that we restore European coherence in both international policy and international law.
We will therefore watch very closely what happens in the Court.
Mr President, the good news is that the ICC has been successfully established with 139 countries having signed up and the president, prosecutor and judges appointed.
It will prosecute the worst kind of crimes, such as genocide, mass slaughter, widespread rape and ethnic cleansing.
It will help make the world a safer place.
The European Union must live up to its leadership in establishing the Court by ensuring that all Member States fulfil their funding and legal obligations.
The United States' opposition to the Court is totally irrational.
There are ample checks and safeguards to prevent politically motivated prosecutions.
It is absurd to claim that US peacekeepers would run the gauntlet of anti-American prejudice.
US domestic political ideology is in conflict with American security interests.
Surely an international court which signals that the international community will not allow gross breaches of law to go unpunished coincides with the objectives of the United States global security doctrine.
We may not be able to stop the US from shooting itself in the foot, but we ought to be able to stop it shooting the rest of us in the foot.
It is deploying the most outrageous bullying tactics to get small countries to sign bilateral immunity agreements.
Six of the seven EU accession states which are candidates to NATO have not obtained a waiver and have had military aid cut off.
It is alarming to see the Bush Administration pursuing its anti-ICC campaign to such lengths as to cut off military assistance to its allies in the war against terrorism.
Indeed, most ICC member states are democracies with relatively strong commitment to the rule of law, so the aid cut-offs represent a sanction targeting states that abide by democratic values.
That is extremely perverse.
The Balkan states are in a very vulnerable position.
Croatia and Bulgaria have refused to sign.
Romania, Albania and Bosnia have granted immunity and Macedonia, too, I understand.
It is no good just saying we regret that they do not live up to EU criteria.
We have to both sanction and protect these accession and aspirant states.
This is the kind of exercise which, if the EU cannot hang together, with its candidate and aspirant states, makes people despair of a common foreign and security policy.
We should be able to do more and I hope we will be able to do so.
Mr President, the International Criminal Court, which celebrated its first birthday yesterday, received a new poisoned gift from its Evil Fairy Godmother when the United States of America started to carry out its threat to impose sanctions on those countries that have not yielded to its pressure on them to sign bilateral immunity agreements.
In the struggle between sovereignty and law regarding the new world order the United States has in this way chosen ever more obviously to maximise its own sovereignty at the expense of international law.
As our ultimate purpose is to safeguard the rule of law and take a stand against war crimes and other international crimes going unpunished, it is more important than ever that we should strengthen cooperation amongst ourselves to bring about universal administration of justice, so that those guilty of these serious crimes are made to answer for their deeds properly and without exception.
That means supporting the ICC in every way possible and getting rid of the giant loopholes that still exist in judicial practice, for example by increasing EU Member States' legislative capacity for dealing with international crimes.
Everybody must be equal before the law.
Any retrograde steps in this area would mean a reversion to barbarism.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council on his first day and hope his response to us today on the International Criminal Court is a reflection of his future cooperation with this House.
A former Nuremberg prosecutor, Benjamin B. Ferencz, said: 'There can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, no meaningful law without a Court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstance.'
The International Criminal Court affords us the opportunity to ensure that not only captured prisoners or the lowest of the service people involved in conflicts, but also generals and heads of state can be brought to justice for genocide and for crimes against humanity.
It is unfortunate that, while so many positive things happened in the latter half of the twentieth century, words such as 'ethnic cleansing' and 'genocide' have come into our normal vocabulary.
We must have a proper mechanism in place to ensure that, if a national court is not able or willing to bring a case against somebody who is accused of crimes against humanity, then there must be an international forum to do so.
That is why we ascribe and subscribe to the International Criminal Court.
However, I would hate it if people - especially the people in the gallery watching us today - went away from this Chamber thinking that this is merely an opportunity for the European Union to bash America.
America is wrong in its stance with regard to the International Criminal Court.
However, it is entitled to take that stance; it is entitled to put forward its own viewpoint and its own ideas; it is entitled to make new agreements with third countries, if it so wishes.
However, those countries will have to deal with the consequences of those negotiations.
Finally, we can give leadership, as we already have done, and the best way to do so is by example, not merely by criticising people who do not agree with us.
Mr President, the International Criminal Court has now begun its work. The court deserves support from every state in the world, without exception.
People who commit serious war crimes, including rape, must not be able to avoid being brought to justice.
The EU wholeheartedly supports the court and gives it its full backing.
It is incomprehensible how a democratic country such as the United States can ask for its not to be possible for those of its citizens who are complicit in this type of crime to be held accountable for serious war crimes.
If the United States itself were to take legal proceedings against such criminals, that would be in accordance with the International Criminal Court's charter, and the court would then have no reason to prosecute American citizens.
The United States's action cannot but give the impression, however, that the United States has no intention of taking legal proceedings against its citizens if they are guilty of serious war crimes.
That would be devastating, especially for the United States as a community founded on the rule of law.
It is, of course, also unacceptable for the United States to blackmail other countries with a view to undermining the International Criminal Court.
The United States's threat to withdraw military or economic aid if a bilateral agreement on impunity is not signed is dictatorial language that must not be accepted.
I assume that the Commission and the Council will vigorously oppose this conduct and press for the United States to accept the International Criminal Court as an important legal instrument for combating serious war crimes.
I would like to say just one word, Mr President, in answer to a point that many speakers have mentioned, which is the announcement by the United States that they are suspending their military assistance to countries that refuse to enter into agreements exempting Americans from the provisions of the agreement on the International Criminal Court.
That this news does not surprise us does not mean that we do not regret it and even - as the Presidency of the Council said just now - condemn it.
However, we are also pleased to see that many countries have been able to resist the pressure that they have been under.
I think that the courage shown by those countries in working towards the success of the agreement on the International Criminal Court deserves both our respect and our admiration.
I will finish by saying that once again, the pressure that those countries are under is all the more inappropriate, all the more incomprehensible, inappropriate because it is incomprehensible, given that the Statute of the Court provides a means to respond to the American concerns, which, in certain respects, we can understand just as many of you do.
Why, when solutions exist are they relentlessly trying to go further?
This attitude can only leave us all with doubts.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office and Commissioner Lamy.
I am sure that Parliament will support all the efforts made so that the Commission and the Council Presidency, in their relations with the United States Government, reach a positive outcome.
I must say that, also from personal experience, it would be desirable for their words to fall on more receptive ears than those we encountered as a European Parliament delegation when we raised this matter with the President of the United States Congress Foreign Relations Committee: we were answered, shall we say, in not particularly diplomatic terms.
We have our courts and our Constitution and we will never allow a United States citizen to be tried and judged outside them.
I am sure that there will be more receptive ears within the United States administration and also the United States Parliament.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0098/2003).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
I would like to welcome the Minister, Mr Frattini, to this Question Time. He will find that Parliament is willing to cooperate fully in this dialogue between itself and the Council.
Mr Carnero has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to express to the House our sadness at the news that a young Spanish aid worker, a 22-year-old from Toledo, Ana Isabel SÃ¡nchez Torralba, was killed last night in Equatorial Guinea.
According to the news, she has clearly been the victim of shots from soldiers of that regime who, in an unjustifiable and criminal action, opened fire on a civilian vehicle which had just crossed a military checkpoint.
Mr President, I believe we are looking at an action which demonstrates the behaviour of forces of law and order which are accustomed to maltreating and attacking citizens.
We will undoubtedly ask the corresponding questions, but I would like, as well as expressing our indignation, condemnation and condolences, to say that I believe the Council of the Union must take whatever measures are necessary to demand responsibilities, clarity and justice from this dictatorship which contains these elements capable of murdering this truly exceptional young woman.
. (IT) The Council is well aware of the difficulties caused by the travel restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities on European citizens living in the Palestinian Territories, a matter which Mr Alavanos referred to.
These restrictions cannot be justified on any account.
As in the past, the European Union, and now the Presidency of the Council, will use its frequent contact with the Israeli authorities in order to highlight the importance of the free movement of citizens of European countries, with European passports, who intend to travel to and from the occupied territories.
I thank the Mr President-in-Office.
His reply is very positive.
I wish to say that this refers to a great many people with European passports, including women and children, Italians, Greeks and other nationals of the European Union who have married Palestinians.
I should like what he said to be put into practice; in other words, at the first opportunity and taking account of the friendly attitude of the Italian Government towards Israel, which was even expressed in the wish that Israel should one day become a member of the European Union, for this matter to be raised as a matter of urgency, so that a solution is found quickly to the very unfortunate situation they face.
. (IT) I will answer both questions together, starting by saying that, clearly, the European Union firmly condemns, once again, the savage terrorist attacks carried out in Casablanca and in every other part of the world.
The attacks in Casablanca are a brutal confirmation that terrorism is a growing threat to democracy, peace and international security, from which no country can consider itself free or safe.
The struggle against terrorism calls for maximum determination from the international community and the strongest will to co-operate and initiate concerted action.
The European Union will continue - and I consider this to be an absolute priority for the Italian Presidency - to do its part to prevent and eliminate this threat.
The Union has adopted a global approach to the fight against terrorism which encompasses all the European Union's policies. It is based on an action plan which is being implemented according to plan and a regularly updated schedule.
An updated report by the Presidency on activities related to the fight against terrorism was, as you know, submitted to the Council during the June 2003 part-session.
Internally, the Union is using political, economic and legal instruments; at the same time, the Union is taking steps to incorporate the fight against terrorism into all aspects of its foreign policy.
In political dialogue meetings with non-Member States - and clearly regarding the matter in question, Morocco - this issue is regularly included on the agenda.
Lastly, at the same time the European Union is continuing to foster dialogue and exchanges between cultures, religions and civilisations.
This is a considerable task, being carried out chiefly within the Barcelona Process framework to create a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the dialogue of cultures and civilisations, a measure which can help eliminate the causes of all forms of fundamentalist violence which may lead to terrorism.
Mr President, Minister, on the subject of suicide attacks, I am reminded of a recent book by the French sociologist and thinker Emmanuel Todd which is entitled After the Empire.
In it he discusses how societies, as their education improves, develop towards democracy to become a political system which guarantees freedoms and justice, and, in this process, the West appears to be the great promoter of democracy, progress and development of peoples, while at the same time being leader and arbitrator of conflicts.
In seeking and prioritising its own interests, however, the West does not behave with justice and equity in its international relations, but rather it generates a new form of anti-democratic autarchy which will end up bringing it into conflict with the rest of the world and will lead to its unsustainable decline.
In the light of these views of Mr Todd, I would like to ask you whether you do not believe that through unjust impositions and exploitations, through pre-emptive wars based on false evidence of weapons of mass destruction and risks to world security - as in the case of Iraq - what the invading governments have created, rather than peace and freedom, has been new despair and new hates whose only outlet seems to be terrorist attacks and self-destruction aimed at achieving a fairer world for those suffering from exploitation and aggression.
. (IT) Terrorism can never - I repeat, never - be justified when women, children and innocent people are killed and when civil life is affected.
Having said that, it is clear that the structural causes of terrorism must be tackled, and those causes may also be found in despair, poverty and in the difficulties of dialogue between cultures.
This is why the global European strategy must consist, on the one hand, of a no-holds-barred fight against all forms of terrorism and, on the other, of in-depth dialogue between civilisations and cultures.
We must address the structural reasons which may lead to - but I repeat, never justify - terrorist actions.
Believe me, Minister, I also vigorously condemn terrorist activities and the crimes committed, but I would like to point out that the American professor, John Esposito, an expert in Islam who heads the centre for understanding between Muslims and Christians, has stated that Washington has always based its relations with the Gulf countries on oil interests, and not on an understanding of their culture and their people.
He has stated that we must distinguish between extremists and the majority of citizens and that, in order to combat terrorism, without alienating Muslims and causing a genuine clash of civilisations, we need public diplomacy and we need to build bridges and tackle the roots of the problems, and that simply to use military and economic means is not sufficient.
So I would like to ask a question. Does the Council believe that the decision to invade Iraq, adopted with the participation of European leaders such as Mr Aznar, Mr Blair, and also Mr Berlusconi, which has led to a great numbers of deaths, to destruction, immigration and desolation, is a better way to deal with the problem of world security than initiatives such as the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland or the Roadmap for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict?
Do you not believe that, as Professor Esposito points out, if we want democracy in the Middle East or in any part of the world, we cannot go about it by telling people in other countries what that democracy must consist of, how it must be organised and who must lead it?
Question No 4 by Sarah Ludford (H-0354/03):
Subject: EU Member States and the terrorist attack in Morocco which claimed 41 lives
What does the Council think about the terrorist attacks in Casablanca which killed 41 people, including a number of Union citizens, and injured many others?
Since the attacks took place after the war waged by the United States and its allies in Iraq, does it consider it significant that many of the dead and injured were in an establishment linked to a Member State?
What political measures will the Council consider taking in order to avert or limit the danger of such terrorist acts?
. (IT) The Council is not aware, it has not been informed of the launch of the pilot project concerning the matter referred to in Mrs Ludford's question.
However, in the recitals and main body of the report on the development of terrorist profiles, mentioned by Mrs Ludford in her question, the obligation to respect fundamental rights and freedoms is stressed.
I repeat, I am not aware of the launch of a pilot project, but in any case, the reference to the obligation of absolute respect for fundamental rights and freedoms can neither be removed nor toned down.
I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that there is no pilot project so far.
My understanding was that there was an intention to run one.
I certainly do not see the point in passing the recommendation if it was not intended to be implemented.
My alarm comes from the fact that the recommendation passed last November did not even acknowledge the risks of discrimination.
That must be acknowledged because the network of fundamental rights experts pointed out that such profiling presents a major risk of discrimination.
If one is to profile people by their characteristics, such as nationality and psycho-sociological features, and then decide from that who is likely to be a terrorist, one has to be very sure, it said, that there is a valid statistical link between the characteristics and the risks.
I would like an assurance from the Minister that, if he has not done any pilot projects yet, if there are going to be any, or any real projects by Member States, he carries out that statistical exercise before allowing the projects to take place.
. (IT) I believe I can assure Mrs Ludford that it is the Council's present and future duty to take into account the outcome of today's debate.
I will certainly provide the Council Secretariat with information in this respect so that it can take it into consideration should this intention exist and should this pilot project be prepared in the future, something which - I repeat - I do not believe to be the case at present.
Question No 5 by Patricia McKenna (H-0361/03):
Subject: Illegal occupation of Iraq
The United Kingdom, a member of the Council, is illegally occupying Iraq.
What is the Council's view of one of its members illegally occupying another country, and what actions will the Council take to rectify this situation?
. (IT) The Council has not discussed the legal nature of the war in Iraq and, as Mrs McKenna well knows, both the international community and the European Union Member States have held differing opinions on this issue.
The Council was extremely pleased to see an end to military action and the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1483 on post-war Iraq.
This is proof of a new spirit of cooperation in the international community, on which we must build the future.
The Resolution and the appointment of a Special Representative in Iraq has given the United Nations an important role in the reconstruction process in Iraq, in accordance with the European Union's own recommendations.
The Union is committed to carrying out a major role precisely in the political and economic reconstruction of the country.
Humanitarian assistance is already underway: the Commission and Union Member States have contributed over EUR 700 million in appropriations for humanitarian aid.
In 2003, the Commission and the Secretary General/High Representative, Javier Solana, are remaining in close contact with the United Nations Special Representative in order to explore possible further European Union action precisely for post-war Iraq, so that we can help at this stage, in whatever way and unconditionally, with the Iraqi people's immediate needs.
It is quite clear that there is no international legality for the invasion and current occupation of Iraq.
It has now been revealed that the British Government, Blair and company, told lies to justify backing the American and British invasion and occupation.
There are two things I would like to ask the Council.
Firstly, in relation to the resolution. It is quite clear that the resolution just gives succour to the US and the UK for the illegal action that they took.
The country is in crisis: there are a huge number people that are food dependent; law and order has broken down; people in Iraq are saying that now that they come out on the streets people are dead; the whole structure has broken down.
That is the first thing I would like to know from the Council, in relation to the current situation in Iraq, which definitely cannot be left in the hands of the British and the Americans.
Secondly, what is the Council going to do in relation to a number of EU citizens who are imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, as it is clear that the British are too scared to stand up to the Americans and defend their own citizens?
They are citizens of the EU as well and it is up to the EU to do something about this and also about the illegal occupation of Iraq.
It is absolutely unacceptable that the US and Britain are allowed to gain advantage from illegal activities.
. (IT) All I can say to Mrs McKenna is that the European Union has already addressed the issue on various occasions, including during meetings of Ministers for Foreign Affairs - as I believe it will and should continue to do - in order to examine in what other ways Europe can be involved in Iraq, first and foremost for the Iraqi people, what other contributions, what other initiatives Europe can arrange for Iraq.
We should pursue this current examination, clearly in close contact with the Anglo-American forces in Iraq.
Some States, as you know, have carried out humanitarian missions in Iraq at national level.
Italy is one of these countries, but it is important to establish a commitment by Europe per se to the Iraqi people, its needs and requirements.
Minister, you have not answered my question in relation to the involvement of Mr Aznar, Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi in the war in Iraq.
You mentioned the Barcelona Council and the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue - that is all very well - and you have also said, in your reply to Mrs McKenna, that the Council had not dealt with the issue of the Iraq war.
I would like to ask you whether it is not true that the Greek Presidency was trying to bring the European Council together to deal with this issue of the war and Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and Mr Berlusconi were opposed to the issue being dealt with within the European Council?
To be absolutely frank, I am not sure whether this is a supplementary question to Question No 5, but the President-in-Office of the Council must decide this and reply if he sees fit.
Mr President-in-Office, you said that the Council had not discussed the legal nature of the intervention in Iraq; however, the Greek Presidency, in its declaration on 16 April, essentially legalised the Anglo-American intervention - or what I would call incursion - and the Council in Thessaloniki took a similar position.
This is, of course, manifestly opposed to the disposition of the peoples of the Member States of the European Union, who have demonstrated in every country against this murderous incursion.
Is the Council not concerned about the gap between its deeds and the peoples' disposition?
. (IT) My reply will be especially brief because we, the States and peoples of the European Union which were all extremely pleased with, and fervently wished for the intervention of the United Nations with Resolution 1483, must now look to the future.
Looking to the future means looking after the people suffering in Iraq and ensuring that conditions are created so that in the future, hopefully the not too distant future, the Iraqi people can again take control of their own destiny and then their own country.
Looking to the future means seeing how we can assist, how we can help the Iraqi people to once again run the State, the institutions and the public administration following the fall of a brutal dictatorship.
This is what looking to the future means; this is what was intended by the Thessaloniki Council and the Greek Presidency, which managed the Iraq crisis excellently.
Question No 6 by John Joseph McCartin (H-0363/03):
Subject: Human rights in Russia
Is the Council aware of the extent of violence against women in Russia and, in particular, violence in the home which is estimated to result in the deaths of 14 000 women each year.
Is the Council aware that the Russian Government has not ratified the optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women which confers authority on CEDAW to examine complaints by individuals and groups?
Finally, will the Council undertake to consider this problem and report back to Parliament?
. (IT) The Council has not received any detailed information regarding the cases of violence against women referred to in Mr McCartin's question, or regarding the reasons why the Russian State Duma has failed to ratify the Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a convention signed by Russia on 8 May 2001.
The Council closely follows developments in human rights in the Russian Federation and regularly raises issues related to human rights and the rule of law in meetings with the Russian authorities.
The Council, I can assure you, will raise the matter of violence against women, as well as the failure to ratify the protocol, in an appropriate forum.
We must remember that there are Member States of the European Union which have not yet ratified the protocol.
Moreover, the European Union will also continue to express its general concern in this field - in order to promote the protection of human dignity without distinguishing between men and women, with particular reference to women's rights - in international organisations, starting with the United Nations.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for the positive reply to my question.
This is a problem we should be aware of in the European Union, with its share of world trade, with its economic weight in the world and with the political clout that it undoubtedly has.
This question should be addressed and I am happy that the President-in-Office agrees with me that this is an issue which the European Union should take up.
We should bear in mind that, even if there are states in the Union which have not ratified this treaty, the European Union in its own treaties nevertheless guarantees equality for women in the workplace and in many other situations, so it is not a serious question within the European Union as it is in the Russian state.
The Russian state today is achieving economic growth.
It is making progress again.
We are happy to note that, but progress will not be sustained unless there is equality for all its citizens, and particularly the weaker ones.
Question No 7 by Malcolm Harbour (H-0372/03):
Subject: Hallmarking of precious metals
Can the Presidency confirm that it intends to retable the proposal for a directive on the harmonisation of the marking and testing requirements for precious metals and, if so, the basis on which it intends to proceed with such a proposal?
. (IT) The Italian Presidency will propose reopening the discussions, suspended in 1998, on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions on the control of weights and measures for precious metals, as presented by the European Commission on 22 April 1996.
In light of the latest developments in certain Member States' legislation, the Presidency considers it appropriate to reopen the debate to highlight possible compromise solutions.
In this regard, the Italian Presidency intends to seek solutions on issues which are still unresolved, such as increasing the level of consumer protection through the obligation to respect harmonised technical requirements for all products placed on the market, the position of marks with a higher information content with regard to identification, the responsibility of manufacturers and inspection bodies, and, lastly, the completion of the free movement of products in the internal market for this sector.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive reply.
However, I am concerned that, from the point of view of my own country, the United Kingdom, the current proposal tabled by the Commission would seriously undermine a proven system of consumer protection that has existed for hundreds of years.
I would put it to the presidency that we already have an International Convention on Hallmarking of precious metals, which the European Union could accede to and which would provide a proven system of consumer protection without the necessity of moving in a direction that, as he knows, many countries oppose.
Secondly, I would put to him that there is a major interest in the accession countries.
I can send him a statement from the assay offices in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which are seriously concerned about this proposal and are alarmed that the Italian Presidency is pushing for a conclusion to this directive before they have a chance to accede to it.
It is extremely unsatisfactory that the Italian Presidency is opening a text to which it knows that it will be difficult to find a solution and which will seriously affect consumer protection.
. (IT) I would like to thank Mr Harbour for pointing out these difficulties.
Clearly, the Presidency will take duly into consideration, before the dossier is actually opened, the difficulties which Mr Harbour referred to.
