We need to contemplate how Europe might rid itself of a situation in which it is crisis-prone in the context of the energy markets.
No action at the present time will have any quick effect.
Apart from anything else, consumption is growing all the time.
We therefore need to create an entirely new kind of energy ethic which takes this situation into account.
We have to think about a basic approach to saving energy.
People no longer know what the dark and gloom are when there is always light everywhere.
Consequently, I would ask the Commissioner whether it could put together an up-to-date energy saving package, based on a new ethic, which would show people, industry and society the way towards saving energy, because that would actually be the most sustainable path of all.
At the same time, moreover, we would produce energy-saving technology and use renewable energy sources.
Â Â  Commissioner, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and say that I support the agreement being striven for, but once more would like to draw attention to the fact that today Member States, which are part of the Baltic region, are practically isolated from European energy systems.
Regrettably, the revision of the TEN-E annexes failed to take the geo-political situation into account.
The controversial North European Pipeline, which goes around the Baltic countries and Poland, remains on the list of priority projects, while projects which were put forward for inclusion on the priority project list, and which are particularly important for this region, like the âAmberâ gas pipeline and the âYamal IIâ, able to cross Belarus, or additional synchronised electricity connections, have not been debated by the European Council.
This is not right.
In 2006, the European Commission must prepare a plan of priority connections, which would determine concrete measures for the integration of isolated energy markets.
Member States must show solidarity, taking common interests into account.
This is the only way to guarantee a secure supply of energy resources across the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, that did not happen in Europe, but it could have done.
Not only have we failed to learn any lessons from the power cuts in California in 2000, but you are creating conditions that will result in Europe also experiencing a large-scale energy disaster.
Your proposals will result in a more expensive and less reliable energy supply.
Separating the transport network from electrical energy production units is an economic, ecological and industrial aberration.
Once again, the European institutions are taking the side of financial interests to the detriment of the general interest.
The capitalist market is incapable of making long-term investments in the energy sector.
Satisfying shareholdersâ interests means sacrificing research, sustainable development and security.
The decision to artificially create a large internal energy market will also lead to a large number of jobs being axed and many others being put in jeopardy.
Our Union needs a strong European public arm, funded by the public in order to fulfil the needs of Europeans.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is essential that the supply of energy to the European Union should be secure, reliable and reasonably-priced, for the sake of both private citizens and the businesses based in it, and in order to maintain the competitiveness of the EUâs industries.
Improving the efficiency of energy generation and making the best possible use of existing production capacity and infrastructure makes sense not only in economic terms but also, without doubt, as a way of protecting the environment.
If we are going to develop the infrastructure for the energy networks right across the EU, we ought at least also to equip them with new technologies in order to make them more efficient, to avoid the unnecessary duplication of pipelines, and to reduce to a minimum such forms of environmental pollution as the escape of methane from natural gas pipelines.
It would also be an important step towards achieving the target of reducing energy consumption.
Important though considerations of the security of the European Unionâs energy supply might be, energy policy cannot be a reason for promoting, on a massive scale, the accession of Turkey to the EU.
I do not believe that any country outside Europe should be allowed to become an EU Member State if the only reason for it being allowed in is the desire to extend the EU to the boundaries of the energy-rich regions in the Middle East and around the Caspian Sea.
Even if Turkey does not become a member, the mooted oil pipelines will still be able to run through it and it will still be possible to realise the gas infrastructure projects.
I believe that these things will be possible even if Turkey becomes no more than a privileged partner of the European Union rather than a fully-fledged Member State.
Â Â  â The goals of the proposed decision, which we are debating today, are clear â to adapt the landmarks for the expanded 25-member European Union, to allow the funding of common importance projects to be determined, to bring about conditions for the creation of an internal gas and electricity market, and most importantly, to guarantee the security of power supplies by connecting Member State networks with one another and with those of neighbouring countries, the countries in the regions of South Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, Ukraine, etc. During the first debate, the European Parliament already approved the Commission's proposals on the laying down of priority actions, the description of projects of European importance and the appointment of a European coordinator for complex projects.
However, the Council expressed a different position when, for example, it proposed the rejection of the European coordinator and other important provisions which we had already endorsed.
Instead of this, the Council only endorsed non-essential amendments laid out in Parliament's resolution, and while endorsing the creation of the Trans-European Network, the Council interprets it only as a simple combination of Member State networks and the coordination of European Union Member States' energy policy measures.
I consider this wholly insufficient.
The European Union energy market has more than 450 million consumers.
This market is the second largest in the world.
If the EU acted together, it would be able to defend and force others to respect its interests.
Bearing in mind the recently arisen crisis involving Ukraine and Russia and the declarations made at Hampton Court, I stress that we undoubtedly need a common European energy policy.
We need more than the 25 individual Member State policies.
The creation of the European network in turn is only possible if we improve and expand the linking of networks.
On the subject of common interests and priority projects, I would like to remind Parliament of the gas transit pipeline project âAmberâ and to debate its inclusion on the project list of landmark priority projects of European importance.
It should also be taken into account that the implementation of projects would improve the security of energy supplies for states in the Baltic region.
Â Â  â Mr President, the revised guidelines will extend the European Unionâs current gas and electricity transmission networks to the new Member States, and I welcome that.
We have already seen what happens when the internal market does not work, when it is not fully completed, when supplies are not secured.
Europeâs main gas supplier, Russia, has shown that it is willing and able to turn off its gas supplies to its own political advantage.
That leaves us extremely vulnerable, and I am glad to see that at last the European Union is taking the whole issue of energy seriously.
Gas prices around the world have soared, but there is no reason why gas prices in the United Kingdom need to be three times those of the Netherlands.
We have been told in the United Kingdom that factories may have to close for the short term. The reason is that the high prices have caused a shortage of gas supply through gas pipelines, which is due to the lack of access to other European Union markets.
Gordon Brown has said that the lack of liberalisation of European energy markets has cost the United Kingdom GBPÂ 10 billion a year.
How can United Kingdom companies be competitive in the face of that kind of inequity?
European Union leaders have recently backed the Green Paper suggestions on developing gas and electricity interconnections.
That is all very well, but we should not avoid a debate on issues such as price fixing, national champions, the resurgent nationalism and Member Statesâ failure to implement European Union legislation.
On that note, I am encouraged by the announcement that the Commission will open 50Â new cases tomorrow against European Union governments that have failed to implement European Union laws by failing to open up the EUâs energy market.
That is great news, but may I ask the Commissioner why it has taken so long to take this action?
Â Â  â I welcome the discussion on the landmarks of the Trans-European Energy Networks â it was much anticipated and necessary.
Three new EU countries, the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have until now remained outside the European energy system.
The Trans-European Energy Networks must be a common interest of the entire Union, and must connect energy of Member States in the internal market and with eastern and southern neighbours.
Without the creation of the Trans-European Network, as the most important priority in terms of EU energy security and economic competitiveness, the EU will remain on the periphery of the energy market.
As a state which is dependent on Russian gas and oil and one which is reliant on nuclear power, Lithuania cannot also let itself become dependent on electricity supplies from Russia.
We must begin to build the electric bridge between Lithuania and Poland and connect Estonia and Finland by electric cable at the earliest opportunity.
The common Baltic electricity market would become a constituent part of the EU electricity market.
I urge you to show solidarity and support for the incorporation of the Baltic energy networks into the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for this debate.
Trans-European networks are an extremely important part, but they are just one part, of European energy policy as I see it.
One very important precondition is cooperation between Member States.
I think the great news I have had over recent months is the cooperation in the energy sector between Baltic countries.
Governments are looking for a common energy policy even if their markets are isolated; but that still clearly indicates that governments should look towards that policy.
The European Council gave a lot of assurances, because the Heads of State and Government again came back to the interconnection issues â the 10% decision from Barcelona that was neglected â and called for a priority interconnection plan.
In this respect trans-European energy networks actually provide the basis of an answer.
There have been critical remarks to the effect that networks could give rise to some types of speculation.
That is why I am saying that regulation is as important as interconnection.
Regulation is absolutely necessary for the market, and the Commission has been always rigorous in asking Member States to implement EU legislation.
But there are two stages.
First of all we must get each Member State to transpose the legislation.
We have achieved that in 23Â cases and 2Â cases are before the European Court of Justice.
So that is one stage.
Then there is conformity.
The new package addresses the conformity issue.
Perhaps there will have to be new cases because the conformity issue does not arise only from Commission studies but is also raised by market participants when they find the directive has not been implemented correctly.
So that is not the end of the story.
It is clear, however, that networks and the good development of networks are absolutely necessary.
Networks do not only mean interconnection, they also mean storage: it takes a long time to build gas storage, for example.
I know that the challenge is huge.
There was some talk about avoiding duplication and I know that there are a couple of projects in the same area.
Here I think governments should help by seeking a common approach and not building competing networks; instead they should look to the development of the best projects, which serve the interests of most of the Member States and the European Union.
Finally, in answer to the question as to what European energy policy means, it does not mean the sum of EU Member Statesâ policies.
It is based on Member Statesâ policies, but it creates a new area of action for the European Union in a situation where globalisation in energy markets has given rise to new challenges, where the action of one Member State does not fully or adequately respond to the expectations of the citizens of that State, and where it is our duty to act at the scale of and within the scope of the European Union as a whole.
Trans-European networks are definitely one of the instruments we can use.
I would like again to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Laperrouze, and all the shadow rapporteurs who have had the patience to negotiate with the Council and, at the appropriate moment, reached this overall compromise that I can accept.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0065/2006) by Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report on competition policy 2004 (2005/2209(INI)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to examine a report that, for the first time ever, is taking on a political dimension.
In the 2005 referenda debates on the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the notions of an area of free and open competition â as it is currently referred to â or undistorted competition â as it would have been referred to if the treaty on the European Constitution had been adopted â were at the centre of the debate.
Our problem is to prove now that competition policy can serve the people, that it must serve the people and that it already serves the people.
There is broad consensus on this point within our committee but, from the moment when I, as rapporteur, had to highlight obvious cases that required a reassessment or a reorientation of competition policy or that, on the contrary, called for competition policy strongly to be encouraged, disagreements arose.
In its current, post-amendment, state, the report is characteristic of the European Parliamentâs reports, which practically no one can, or wants to, read because they say absolutely nothing at all.
I hope that, on at least three points, forceful ideas are reaffirmed in order to show the people that the European institutions are there to serve them.
Competition policy is divided into three broad areas: the fight against the formation of monopolies, the fight against cartels and the fight against State aid that is illicit or harmful to healthy and undistorted competition.
I will take these three examples and I will propose forceful ideas to you on these policies, ladies and gentlemen.
Firstly, the fight against monopolies: the European Unionâs policy has been admirable in its struggle against Microsoftâs abuse of its dominant position.
My committee, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chose not to support the Directorate-General for Competition in this fight.
I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to reaffirm the European Parliamentâs support for the Directorate-General for Competition and for the Commission in the trial of strength they are conducting in relation to Microsoft.
Secondly, I will address the formation of these monopolies and the fight against cartels.
Overall, the Directorate-General for Competition has behaved admirably.
I am thinking, in particular, of the Vivendi/Hachette affair.
I believe that, in an attempt to do things too quickly, mistakes were inadvertently made in 1999 during the merger between RhÃŽne-Poulenc and Hoechst.
We need to try to understand how these mistakes came about.
We do not have the right to cancel the measures taken by the Commission, and I do not want this, but I am calling for a committee of inquiry to investigate what happened in order to understand how tens of thousands of employees and tens of thousands of small shareholders came to be ruined due to the Commissionâs failure to carry out checks, despite the fact that it had committed itself to doing this.
The third point on which I am calling on you to intervene and to voice forceful ideas concerns the field of public aid.
The Directorate-General for Competition and the 2004 report approve of this aid when it is consistent with the Gothenburg policy and the Lisbon policy.
We must support the Directorate-General for Competition on this point.
When, however, the Directorate-General for Competition supports the town of Charleroiâs giving generous subsidies to the airline Ryanair, I believe that it must be criticised because that kind of action distorts competition between towns, between businesses and between modes of transport in a way that is detrimental to the Lisbon and Gothenburg policies.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur MrÂ Lipietz and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for this report.
I am aware that there are a number of points on which I have to thank the rapporteur for giving the credit to the Commission and its services.
As you note, competition policy must help drive EU competition, competitiveness and growth and, as the rapporteur mentioned, in the end it should all work in favour of the consumers â what he called the ordinary people.
I am glad that Parliament follows competition policy developments closely and proactively.
Our valuable debate in February on state aid reform is a very good example.
I will continue to involve you fully in policy development, even if the Treaty does not give this House a legislative role in this area.
This Parliament has also been an ardent and consistent supporter of the Commissionâs work to enforce the competition rules fairly, firmly and effectively, as rightly mentioned by the rapporteur â whom I thank for that.
I agree with your comments on many issues: the anti-trust reforms implemented in 2004; the coordination of the European competition network; European Competition Days; international cooperation; and of course consumer information.
On private damage actions for breach of the EC anti-trust rules, I look forward to Parliamentâs review of our Green Paper.
We are continuing to work on the review of ArticleÂ 82 of the Treaty, on areas of importance for the information society and on the sector inquiries, where I take your point about the areas in which our methodology could be improved.
Turning to a couple of specific points touched on by the rapporteur, we have discussed Altmark at length before, and the Commission will provide guidance when adopting decisions on individual cases.
I have no indication in relation to questioning the behaviour of the national competition authorities as regards national incumbents, but would remind you that, if such a case arose, the Commission can intervene and deal with the case itself.
Finally, I have two comments in response to Mr Lipietz.
First, the Commissionâs handling of the Hoechst/RhÃŽne-Poulenc merger in 1999 and 2004 has been discussed at length and in detail during the committee meetings when this report was being prepared.
The Commission has provided detailed responses to all the points raised.
I do not think that any new factors have been brought forward.
So, as far as I am concerned, that is behind us.
Secondly, the Commission decided that some of the aid granted to Ryanair at Charleroi was compatible with the common market in the context of transport policy.
This concerned aid which permitted development and improved use of secondary airport infrastructure that was underused and represented a cost to society as a whole.
However, I should add that the remainder of the aid was found not to be compatible and must be recovered.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I very much commend the report as it emerged from committee and I thank Mr Lipietz for his work.
I think it is the general view that the report has been improved by a number of the amendments made and I want to focus quickly on some of them: the emphasis on consumers, with specific proposals adding that we support the idea of private competition and enhancing the role of the consumer liaison officer.
We welcome the first year of implementation of the process of reform undertaken by the Commission and we are also looking forward to the completion of the ArticleÂ 82 approach â the interpretation of which is currently the subject of consultation.
I do not, however, propose to go through all the provisions in the report in detail.
I just want to say that, in welcoming, for instance, the sectoral inquiries that have been launched, I draw attention to the aim of the Commission and of Commissioner Kroes to tackle protectionism.
In this context, I make no apology for highlighting something of great concern to all of us, which has arisen since this report was drawn up, and that is the vote that has recently taken place in the United States Senate to extend the process for dealing with merger cases in a way which amounts to blatant US protectionism.
In my view, this amendment of the rules of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States could place new and damaging restrictions on foreign investments.
Those are not my words, but the words of six of the leading financial services institutions in the United States.
The Commissioner, along with her colleagues, has been working very closely with the US Government to deal with issues of regulatory cooperation.
I have in front of me a copy of the agreement of last December.
ItemÂ 8 of this states: âWe â that is the US Government and the Commission â agree to discuss any significant remaining obstacles to transatlantic investment that the other party identifies, and will consider how to address and reduce such obstacles with a view to promoting closer transatlantic economic integrationâ.
In my view, the proposals in the United States strike a blow against that proposition and I would say that it is so serious that the Commissioner should make it clear to her counterparts in the United States that if they proceed in this way then retaliatory measures in Europe may be necessary.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation of the annual report on competition policy which is being presented to Parliament for examination, debate and resolution is an example of the Commission fulfilling its responsibilities.
It offers the opportunity to highlight the most important milestones, to consolidate the accumulated acquis and to enhance it on the basis of the experience we have acquired over the period and with a view to the future.
In this regard, I believe that Mr Lipietz has been a genuinely effective rapporteur.
As rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would like to begin by saying how pleased I am that, since 1 May 2004, the competition policy has been extended to ten new countries as a result of enlargement and that the authorities of the new members have been integrated into the Network of Competition Authorities.
After the elections, Parliament issued its opinion on the investiture of the new Commission, which included a new Commissioner responsible for Competition.
An active and growing role for Parliament gives more legitimacy and transparency to the implementation of the competition policy, as has been becoming clear.
Parliamentâs repeated aspiration to be given codecision powers is well justified.
During 2004, the Commission completed its modernisation package.
It has improved the guarantees of its procedures and has promoted initiatives in the field of the information and communication society.
It has tackled secret agreements and abuses of dominant positions and has also controlled mergers and State subsidies.
We have been keen to stress the importance of these actions and express our support.
Nevertheless, we have also detected shortcomings and weaknesses in the report, such as the lack of an assessment of the effects of the most important decisions on State subsidies and mergers, the treatment of services of general interest, the problems of collective negotiation in sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, the promotion of international cooperation, including with the emerging and developing countries, or the role of consumers in a genuine competition culture.
The final resolution will be more complete if it reflects all of these aspects, so that they may be given the attention they deserve.
The competition policy is fundamental to the success of the Lisbon Strategy and achieving the growth and employment objectives.
The resolution we adopt will be of more value if it reflects this reality, the strategic role and the potential of the European Competition Network and will be stronger if it establishes two clear guidelines: that the Commission should focus on issues that are relevant to our citizens, to improving their living conditions, and that it should act proactively, anticipating and promoting changes rather than simply reacting to them.
Â Â  . Mr President, in 2004, the Commission issued its decision on Microsoft.
Press reports since then, concerning attempts at compliance, have presented conflicting information.
This is not the first time that progress, and even the right of defence prior to hearings or to appeal, seems to have been compromised by the Commission denying undertakings access to full information or evidence against them.
In effect, undertakings are told: you must do more, but no, you cannot have the evidence and we will not tell you exactly what we want.
Is such lack of transparency necessary, useful or, taken to its extreme, even in line with the principles of justice that one associates with an advanced democratic community?
With some reservations, I welcome the ArticleÂ 82 consultation, which draws on recent experience, but it seems to me that there should also be more consultation with regard to Commission procedures and Regulation (EC) NoÂ 773/2004.
This should include comparison with other countries, including the United States, keeping our aim of fostering a competitive business and investment environment.
The Microsoft case is particularly difficult because it includes interoperability in a highly technical field.
It is very important to define the general procedures for interoperability and it is with some regret that we lost those in the CII Directive.
However, the general procedures for interoperability must not be defined by a hard case.
Hard cases make bad law, and at present it is even difficult to reconcile the proposals in the consultation document â such as paragraphsÂ 238, 239 and 240 â both with themselves and with the apparent demands on Microsoft.
There are also further concerns in paragraph 242, concerning trade secrets.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wonder if Parliament and the Commission would be so keen to applaud the Competition Commissioner Mrs Kroes if they knew that for some 13Â years she was a member of Ballast Nedamâs welfare council, which was set up to protect employee welfare.
She would therefore have been aware of the situation that would result when Ballast Nedam, owned by a Dutch construction company, unceremoniously pulled the plug on the UK subsidiary, leaving some 2000 employees with a grossly under-funded pension fund.
Many in my constituency are now almost destitute.
If this is the type of behaviour which results in people being awarded positions in the Commission, it is little wonder that Europe is doing so fantastically badly in everything it turns its hand to.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when we debate competition policy, there is something that there is good reason for emphasising, namely the fact that European prosperity, European businesses and European jobs have been boosted by competition.
The ability to launch new companies and to mount a challenge to old, existing companies is what has created European well-being and prosperity.
It is therefore perfectly legitimate and extremely important to defend competition policy against all those forces that, in various ways, wish to introduce protectionism.
As is also apparent from the report we are debating, there are a couple of tasks in this connection in which the Commission has an especially important role.
The first is to debate competition issues from the perspective of the internal market as a whole.
That is a step we must take because, if we are to obtain global champions, we must also ensure that we are able to obtain large and energetic European companies that operate across borders and that can also be players on the global stage.
This requires a new competition policy that is in various ways an advance on the old one.
I think, then, that the Commission must act vigorously and be unswervingly loyal in implementing the Treaty.
By that, I mean that it must take vigorous action in respect of those sections of the internal market in which Member States do not comply with what is required of them.
This applies to issues in relation to telecommunications, in which we have seen how the industry has prospered as a result of the deregulation of competition, and it is important that all sectors of the economy benefit in the same way.
Energy issues are another case in point, and I welcome the fact that, from what I have understood from the media, the Commission will act vigorously to bring about an internal market and to combat the protectionism we see today when it comes to various company mergers.
The last task is the one also discussed by MrÂ Evans, namely that of ensuring that we obtain a transatlantic competition policy that is reciprocal and that invigorates the whole of the transatlantic economy.
In saying that, I also wish to emphasise that it is competition and competition policy that are the strongest forces behind European integration today, weaving our economies together and giving us new jobs.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this annual appointment is important because it is the only time when the European Parliament can fully discuss competition policy as managed by the Commission and evaluate it.
As such, it is important that this Parliament ensures that free and undistorted competition remains genuinely free and undistorted and that, when matters deserve to be looked into a little more closely, this can be done, including in this Chamber, whether it is a question of Microsoft, of Rhodia-RhÃŽne-Poulenc or of Ryanair-Charleroi.
Given, Commissioner, that you are going to reopen the debate on, among other things, the important concept of mergers, which plays a key role in competition policy, I should like to draw your attention to one point, in the hope that this Parliament will support us on this issue.
It seems to us that the threshold criteria that are already in force within the Commission prevent it from declaring its competence each time that it ought to.
On the subject, for instance, of the alignment of the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche BÃ¶rse, you were not competent in the end because the turnover in question lay below the thresholds.
These are grounds here for a real investigation.
My second remark concerns the Mittal-Arcelor affair.
Does free and undistorted competition imply that the ownership conditions of the businesses in question should be left completely to one side?
It seems to me that this is also a matter for serious thought.
Lastly, my final point: you will not be surprised to hear that, as far as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is concerned, competition policy is only meaningful if it contributes to the Lisbon Strategy.
It must integrate social objectives, environmental objectives and long-term objectives.
I hope that, in this way, we will succeed in rebalancing the concept of free and undistorted competition so that the Union actually becomes the most competitive area in the world, while honouring the need for full employment and sustainable development.
Â Â  Mr President, since competition policy is one of the mainstays of European policy, and in view of the importance of its good and solid implementation in the light of the Lisbon Strategy, I wholeheartedly endorse the greater emphasis placed by Commissioner Kroesâ reform policy on the simplification of procedures and on preventing red tape and legal expenses.
This report is right to give your competition policy centre stage, because politicians should not, where specific cases are concerned, step into the shoes of the Commissioner or even the judge.
In fact, it appears that some fellow Members find it difficult not to do so, but in the report that is the subject of todayâs discussion, your competition policy is central.
The setting up of the European competition network is an important development and I call on the Commission to improve the exchange of information between the national competition authorities within it, thus ensuring that unity in the implementation of European competition policy continues to be guaranteed.
Finally, I should like to urge the Commission to speed up the last section of the modernisation operation, namely ArticleÂ 82 on the abuse of dominant economic position.
In that respect, I should like to stress the importance of policy that gives ample consideration to the market structure and does not, as is currently the case, focus all its attention on the market share of a certain undertaking.
After all, globalisation has changed the world, and large undertakings with a considerable market share, which, for example, make important contributions in the field of innovation, must not simply be judged by their dominant position, but must be seen in a broader economic context.
I hope that, where Article 82 is concerned, you will do justice to this in the policy you will be presenting in due course.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me first of all to respond briefly to what MrÂ Bloom said a moment ago about the Ballast Nedam case and the pension funds of its English employees.
It so happens that I took a keen interest in this case at the time, and I think that this was a typical example of the lack of supervision or rules in the United Kingdom, and it is therefore unfair to hold Europe responsible now.
Moreover, this was back in the Thatcher era, just to put it into context.
I will confine my observation to a number of issues that have also been covered in the report and that have recently been discussed, particularly in the debate about the way in which national interests can once again come into play in competition policy.
On that score, there are certainly two things that affect the rules of European competition policy, one of which is the two-thirds rule.
It would be good if further steps could be taken in that respect, because too little consideration is being given to the differences in size of the Member States and the effect that certain measures have, also for the sake of neighbouring countries and for regional policy.
That is a crucial point which we have once again raised.
The second point has also already been touched upon by Mrs BerÃšs when she quoted the example of stock markets.
It is obvious in that case that, even though the turnover is below the threshold of European interference, the effect of such a level of concentration can very much be European, and as the Commissioner already indicated, that is therefore a reason to find out if we can broaden the criteria for European competences in this connection too.
I should like to raise this issue once again in respect of those points, and I should also like to ask for support for our Amendment 9.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, let me just thank Commissioner Kroes for her work as competition commissioner during the period to which this report relates, although she was in office for only half of it.
I think that this House has also, taking the Commissionâs report as its basis, been able to produce a good alternative text, the positive aspects of which have already been mentioned several times.
I would like to talk about two things that have not yet been mentioned.
The first is that I believe it would be desirable for the Commission, in the coming year, that is to say when evaluating the year 2005, to again list services of general economic interest separately.
After all, the Commission does want, in the immediate future, to enact further legislation in this area, and so consideration of it under a separate heading would be beneficial.
Secondly, I was rather surprised that the report on the year 2004 made absolutely no reference to postal markets.
We are, in fact, following with great interest the moves to open up the postal sector, and believe that these reports will, over the coming years, give us a few things to read about.
Please allow me, though, to pass over the report and make a few brief comments on competition policy in general.
It is always being said that competition law is at the heart of the European treaties, but â as has already been lamented â it does lay considerable burdens on the executive.
The cases that we are currently getting in Europe do, however, raise the issue of whether competition law really is still supreme or whether it might not be the case that other factors have started to play an important role.
I believe that we in this House can say, with hand on heart, that we really do want to give priority in our economic policy to the full transposition of Articles 81 and 82.
While I think it is an extremely good thing that you are also introducing a number of structural reforms into European law on restrictive agreements, I do also believe that there are many issues â of which the ââ is one â that show us that what is needed is better cooperation between the national competition authorities.
With that in mind, I encourage you to carry on from where your last speeches began.
Â Â  â The ultimate aim of competition policy is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and, in so doing, to guarantee the provision of high-quality goods and services at affordable prices for most European consumers.
We have witnessed a series of mergers in the internal market that have led to natural monopolies in essential goods and services.
The Commissionâs evaluation of this phenomenon, although in principle a good idea, is often inconsistent with these objectives in practice, especially when it comes to public services.
At a time when protectionist sentiments have resurfaced, Europe must guarantee its citizens that it is capable, above all, of ensuring the provision of essential goods and services safely, universally and at the lowest possible cost.
It is therefore not sufficient to deepen the internal market.
This must at least be accompanied by better regulatory powers.
Community regulation needs to be effective and the discrepancies between the Member States must not lead to further competition distortion.
Europeâs citizens will only have confidence in the construction of the internal market if they receive guarantees that the monitoring of their most basic needs will be strengthened.
It is therefore important to update the rules in force to meet our objectives.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, competition policy is the motor that drives the strategy for growth and employment.
It is clear, then, that the European Parliament advocates enhanced consultation, because we want as much competition as possible and â for social and environmental reasons and for the sake of fairness and ethical values â only as much regulation as is absolutely necessary.
That means that the drawing of every boundary is a political issue.
It is the competition policy that drives the internal market, and that is why there is a connection between the implementation of the four freedoms using the competition policy or because of it, and the reinforcement â both external and internal â of the single market.
I get the feeling that we are still treating competition policy as being on three levels: competition policy within the Member States, competition policy between the Member States, and the competition policy of the European Union in a globalised world, and that that is the reason why there is so much legal uncertainty.
The Altmark ruling may well have laid down clear test criteria, but there have been plenty of instances in which the Commission has interpreted them in different ways.
There is, on the one hand, the debate about whether investigation of dominant position should refer to the national market on one occasion and to the European market on another.
There is no clear distinction drawn between what is part of competition policy and what is part of services of general interest.
Now the chapter has been removed from the report altogether.
As I see it, competition policy also involves ensuring that directives, once adopted by us, are implemented uniformly.
Inconsistent transposition of directives results in distortion of competition and is one of the causes of the resurgent protectionism with which we have to contend vigorously.
We therefore urge the creation of a single European area for both research and energy, while also advocating codecision in fiscal policy matters, where the very minimum that is required is a single tax base for businesses.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make three points.
First, I welcome both the European Parliament report as changed and the Commissionâs report on the guidelines for 2004.
Things are moving in the right direction and I should like to congratulate the whole team of DG Competition and the Commissioner, who is continuing Mr Montiâs work very well.
We are living in a mood of economic nationalism right now, and being the Competition Commissioner is not necessarily the easiest job in town.
The Commissioner is doing a good job.
My second point â and one that Mr HÃ¶kmark made as well â is that it is very important to take a broad approach.
To my mind, competition and the internal market are married; they go hand in hand.
Commissioner Kroes takes care of the competition part and Commissioner McCreevy takes care of the internal market side.
If today we were to define the four freedoms, I do not think, unfortunately, in the mood we are in, that we would get them.
Therefore, keep the four freedoms in mind; they are under attack, much like competition policy in general.
That brings me to my final point about the four key areas dealt with in the report itself.
The first is mergers: keep on fighting against the type of protectionist behaviour that you see, for example, from the Spanish Government in the Endesa case or from the Polish Government in the banking sector.
Secondly, on state aid: continue your vigorous control, kill all the national champions you can â they are bad for consumers and taxpayers.
I would urge you to read MrÂ HÃ¶kmarkâs report on this issue.
The third is ArticleÂ 81 on cartels: fight them.
They are all over the place; they try to hide; tease them out; keep the consumers happy.
Finally, on Article 82 on dominant positions: there is a sufficiently high profile case.
I am not entirely sure that all is clear on that case.
One can perhaps see both sides, but it is important to keep at it and, much like Mr Evans said, if we want a transatlantic market, let us keep it and let us watch out for American protectionism in the meantime.
Â Â  Mr President, before I start might I ask that someone remove the âtâ from my name up on the screen because it is quite unnerving really!
I would like to associate myself with the comments made by Mr Stubb and Mrs Bowles, but I would like to talk about transparency in these issues.
Am I the only one here to think that the behaviour in the Commission in relation to transparency in competition cases has been quite odd?
It is bizarre in a way, because the Commission seems to be conducting prosecutions in the media, rather than in hearings or in courts.
Before Christmas we had the strange outbursts from the Commission spokesperson in relation to the case concerning the collective selling of UK football premiership TV rights, and this tactic has been repeated in the Commissionâs ongoing anti-trust investigation into Microsoft.
I certainly find it a matter of concern that the Commission, whilst acting as investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury in competition cases, can make public statements condemning the people it is investigating, or happily allow confidential documents to enter the public domain without any apparent concern or investigation.
Those of us interested in transparency in the European Parliament, and indeed those of us interested in justice in the wider world, are becoming more worried that the Commission seems to be willing to ride roughshod over natural justice in its bid for a judicial and public relations result against those it is pursing.
Madam Commissioner, you have made a number of very sensible statements about the future direction of competition policy in the EU, including the statement on 13Â December 2005 on improving rules for access to files in merger and anti-trust procedures.
Can I humbly suggest that you circulate this more widely throughout your department, because in the recent Microsoft case and in others before that â in the General Electric case, in the Tetra Laval case and in the TV premiership football case â access to information and files you are keeping has been one of the Commissionâs weaknesses.
Â Â  . Mr President, I sincerely hope you will not cut me off.
Let me say that I am very happy with the statements of nearly everybody in this debate, especially the remarks that have been made about this portfolio.
Competition policy is a challenge; indeed it is an instrument, a motor for achieving the Lisbon Agenda.
I could not agree more with Mr De Rossa and Mrs van den Burg that we must deliver, within the framework of Europe, sustainable and full employment and social welfare; but at the end of the day we must also deliver more economic growth and more and better quality jobs.
Turning now to a couple of details about competition policy, it was rightly mentioned that cartels are absolutely unacceptable and we must combat them.
Where there is a near-monopoly, we have to realise that this does not benefit the consumer.
People may argue that in the short term it is a pleasing situation, but I can assure you that a monopoly or near-monopoly will not be very keen to spend money in areas like research or innovation.
Yet we badly need that type of investment.
Why?
Because we have to compete on the global stage, because we need to be aware that competitors from outside Europe are investing in depth in research, in innovation, and in their competitiveness.
So, Mr Evans rightly referred to the need for fair treatment, for a bilateral but not unbalanced approach: if we are behaving ourselves, the others should behave as well.
It is a question of the competitiveness of Europe.
I really appreciate your interest in competition policy.
The Commission informs you of all the major policy initiatives in this area and, of course, I pay attention to all the opinions of Parliament.
We may not agree completely at every moment, on every subject, every dossier; I do not agree with a couple of remarks that were made this evening because the way they were put does not reflect the truth and is not realistic.
But I will come back to that in more detail.
I have listened carefully to the views expressed by the rapporteur, by the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by all other Members.
I would like to add a few words in response to specific issues.
On international cooperation, I think that in a global market competition is very important and the competition authorities need to be in line.
Regarding a European network, I am really impressed by the European competition network and those concerned are doing an extremely good job.
We can still learn from each other and we still need to realise that the time has passed for national policy.
At the end of the day we have one internal market.
It is about two-way traffic.
Mr McCreevy and I are buddies and we need to tackle all the barriers that have to be tackled.
In relation to Microsoft, which was touched upon by a couple of Members, the Commission is actively pursuing the implementation of the MarchÂ 2004 decision.
I accept, of course, remarks that do not agree with my line, but to say that we are not transparent, that we are not listening to all the questions and remarks, is not the truth.
Since MarchÂ 2004, there has been a decision, which has rightly been mentioned and discussed; I have done so myself with the head of Microsoft.
With regard to ProfessorÂ Neil Barrett, a very highly respected advisor to the Commission, he was indeed appointed by the Commission, but the list he headed came from Microsoft.
He is very well-known for his knowledge and independence and to put it in quite clear language, he is the bridge between Microsoft and the Commission.
He is indeed the advisor.
But when we took the decision in December 2005, the statement of objections â which included a preliminary finding that Microsoft had not delivered what it had promised, that its obligation under the MarchÂ 2004 decision did not take the form we were expecting â was not made public because of issues relating to certain procedures, protectionism and the legitimate interest of all parties.
The hearing was an opportunity to have what I hope was a fruitful debate and every participant in it was given the floor.
This is not only about Microsoft; there are complainants elsewhere and there are a couple of other really interesting American companies.
So Microsoft is not the only interesting company from the United States: there are a couple of other interesting companies that have lodged complaints with me.
Therefore, without a doubt, I had to act and to react.
I hope that will clarify the situation when we come to discuss what was talked about last Thursday and Friday.
Another hearing â the Court hearing â will take place in Luxembourg on 24-28 April 2006.
Once we have discussed what was talked about last week, we will come to a conclusion as soon as possible.
Mrs BerÃšs mentioned Mittalâs bid for Arcelor.
She should read it and she promised me she would, so let me be precise: the announcement of Mittalâs bid for Arcelor has attracted a great deal of attention not only in the media but also in some European capitals.
The operation has not yet been formally notified to the Commission.
If and when it is, the Commission will examine it very carefully and impartially and will conduct a wide-ranging investigation to assess its possible impact on the steel industry in Europe.
It is the responsibility of the Commission, the Commissioner and the services involved always to look very carefully and impartially at all cases.
Size and nationality in itself is not a factor in making our decisions.
The question is whether a decision can be taken and whether things can be done in the way requested by the parties, or whether there should be remedies.
We will be looking at that.
Let me turn to the merger regulation and competence for cases under the two-thirds rule, which a couple of Members mentioned.
At the moment we are asking the Member States for information.
Once we have received that information we will have a debate and dialogue with those Member States and will try to reach conclusions.
The rules and decisions were made in the 1980s and were right for that time, but since then, fortunately, the internal market has developed.
I am aware that the internal market is not yet complete, we still have quite a lot of work to do and the four main freedoms still need to be achieved.
At that time the two-thirds rule was the correct instrument, but now we have to consider whether it is still appropriate in that area.
In certain sectors we need to ensure a balance and equal treatment, and there should be transparency regardless of the country in which a merger takes place.
Brussels must ensure equal treatment, whatever the background to a merger might be.
Mr HÃ¶kmark and Mrs Ferreira raised the subject of mergers in the internal market.
We are all aware that concerns have been expressed about the alleged upsurge of protectionism.
It should be combated.
I can understand it just a little, but it is not allowed and should not be tolerated.
We should explain to those concerned that it is not in line with the decision we took on one internal market, one Europe, in which we are and will be in a better position to compete with the outside world.
The Commission has significant powers under the Treaty to act as an independent and impartial referee to ensure that Member States fully respect the internal market rules and do not create unlawful obstacles to cross-border mergers.
I can assure you that the Commission is firmly committed both to using these powers and to corporate restructuring in Europe.
For that we need a united Europe.
It was rightly said that we must apply the rules of the game in the same way whether the team is playing at home or abroad.
We have rules to respect and we have decisions to respect â the decisions taken in the past.
We have to implement those decisions: one internal market and the Lisbon Agenda.
Nearly all of you agreed that we should fight for that.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- the report (A6-0056/2006) by MrÂ Hammerstein Mintz, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Special Report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the draft recommendation to the Council of the European Union in complaint 2395/2003/GG, on the openness of the meetings of the Council when acting in its legislative capacity [2005/2243(INI), and
- the report (A6-0052/2006) by MrÂ Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on access to the institutionsâ documents (2004/2125(INI).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Austrian Presidency for its cooperation on this issue, and I would like in particular to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, who has shown considerable enthusiasm and commitment with regard to transparency and how to promote it.
I would also like to mention Mr Cashmanâs initiative on the regulation of public access to the institutionsâ texts, a report that is parallel to this one but which moves in the same direction.
The Council currently has a credibility problem.
On the one hand, the political leaders of the Member States support Article 1.2 of the Treaty on European Union, and they have signed the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which states that the Councilâs decisions must be taken as transparently, as openly, and as close to the citizens as possible.
The reality is very different, however.
The Council refuses to open up its legislative meetings to public and media scrutiny.
The European Ombudsman is right to say that we are dealing with a case of maladministration, concluding that the Council has not given a significant valid reason not to open up the doors to its discussions.
In order to increase the ordinary citizensâ interest in and commitment to the European Union, and in view of the current constitutional crisis, Europe needs to take courageous and imaginative steps to bring European issues closer to everyone.
It must start by opening up its doors to public debate; the Council does not want to do so, however.
If millions of Europeans were able to watch the ministers on the television openly discussing European issues such as the energy crisis, the services Directive, the retention of personal data or stem cell research, we could awaken much more interest in European issues and we could put an end to the lethargy of millions of Europeans who show very little interest in European affairs.
Public opinion is caught up in strictly national debates.
This report adopted by the Committee on Petitions fully supports the recommendation of the European Ombudsman, who has taken the view that the principle of transparency should be applied not just to the discussions of the Council, but to all cases in which the European Parliament is involved, including consultations and issues relating to individual rights and freedoms and those included in the third pillar.
In October, the European Ombudsman published a report calling upon the Council to review its refusal to meet publicly when taking decisions of a legislative nature.
To this end, the Ombudsman asked the Council to change its Rules of Procedure, in order to guarantee access for the media and public opinion to its debates.
Nevertheless, and despite the recommendation of the British Presidency, the Council has not taken any steps to change its Rules of Procedure in a manner that promotes transparency.
The leaders of the Member States can therefore carry on saying the opposite in Brussels to what they are saying to their voters at home.
The implications of this openness that we want to see could be profound for the Council and would change its nature.
The ministers would have to speak under the scrutiny of the media and under the gaze of millions of people.
This would be the best way to make European democracy visible and to awaken ourselves from the current lethargy and boredom.
The Council could begin with a pilot programme, which would explain how decisions are made and the nature of the procedure to millions of people in front of the television cameras.
I would like to put the following question to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission: are you prepared to propose concrete initiatives to make transparent and open debates and decision-making in the Council possible?
If not now, then when?
The citizens and the European Parliament are asking the Council to come out into the open.
The ball is in the Councilâs court.
Please open up your doors.
We Europeans want to participate.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to associate myself wholeheartedly with the statement by my friend Mr Hammerstein Mintz.
I was the original rapporteur on Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1049/2001 on public access to documents and I well remember the heated debates, not only within Parliament but within the Council and within the trialogue, as we set out to win the arguments for what was at that time a groundbreaking regulation.
I remember â and it is worth naming some of the old EU-15 â the vehement opposition from France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Austria.
I am pleased to say that the Austrian Presidency has now changed its attitude, but I mention this because it shows what a long way we have come.
There are different approaches to openness and transparency.
We have the wonderful Nordic example, and then we have the rather suspicious view taken in other Member States, but arguably we have nothing whatsoever to fear from transparency.
What is there to fear from opening our decisions to external examination?
What does a Member State have to fear from explaining to its own parliament why the minister voted as he or she did?
I make several recommendations in my report and I call upon the Commission to take action.
We recognise that Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1049/2001 was not the end of the game but merely the beginning of a long â arguably cultural â journey to win the argument for openness and transparency within the three institutions.
We come from different traditions.
That is why I have called for a further review of the regulation.
This review was provided for in the original recommendation and there are several areas concerning the regulationâs implementation which now, several years later, could be substantially improved on the basis of the lessons that we have learned from its implementation.
We need to look again at the definitions of legislative and non-legislative texts in relation to public access to documents, in order to ensure that all the institutions are working in an open and transparent manner.
Access to documents is not a gift â it is a right.
This is especially important when Parliament and the Council are working in a legislative capacity.
Increased interinstitutional cooperation and increased use of the codecision procedure necessitate greater openness by the Council in particular.
Citizens must be able to see what is being agreed in their names by national ministers of national governments so that they and opposition parties can hold them to account.
We need to look at the way we define the circumstances in which specific documents can be classified completely, or in part, as confidential.
These rules should provide legitimate derogations for specific clearly-defined reasons, but should not be interpreted in a broad sense, which would essentially have the result of denying public access to documents.
Here is the point on which I shall finish: we won the argument from 1999 until May 2001 when the regulation was adopted.
Time and time again we have won the argument for a review of the internal rules of the institutions so that the Council in particular, when meeting in its legislative capacity, should meet in public and vote in public.
The arguments have been won.
I know the Vice-President is personally committed to the whole notion of openness and transparency.
The House is committed, but that is not enough.
We have a wonderful window of opportunity on 9Â May, Europe Day.
Let us make Europe Day a positive day when we can announce how we will improve the citizensâ right to know what is done in their name.
Finally, there is a rise of anti-Europeanism, not least in the ten new countries that joined us two years ago.
Often governments which bring a country into the family of the European Union suffer as a result; they are not re-elected.
We would be a friend of anti-Europeanism if we continue to cloak what we do in secrecy.
Let us take on the anti-Europeans.
Let us promote our institutions.
Let us celebrate what we do.
Let us bring forward that review of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1049/2001, not reluctantly but with enthusiasm.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by congratulating the European Parliament and, of course, the rapporteurs, MrÂ Mintz and MrÂ Cashman, for two very important reports.
If I may begin by commenting on openness in the Council, the Commission fully supports open meetings of the Council.
As early as October, we stated, in plan D, that the Council should be open when it legislates, and we support the initiatives taken by the Council.
I am convinced that open meetings of the Council would increase the EUâs credibility, as well as peopleâs interest in the EU.
I know that, in terms of principle, there is a consensus between our institutions on this issue, and it is now the Member States that must take action and deliver results.
I also believe that it would be an effective way of putting an end to what we call the âblame gameâ, so this is an important issue.
Openness also has to do with public access to documents and with Regulation 1049/2001.
Formally, this legislation applies only to Parliament, the Council and the Commission, but it has, for all that, come to apply to many more bodies.
The EUâs various offices and agencies â indeed, most of its bodies â have voluntarily adopted corresponding rules concerning access to documents.
Just as the rapporteur, MrÂ Cashman said, the EU institutions have in this way â and thanks in no small measure, then, to the European Parliament â achieved in a remarkably short period of time a level of openness that is very good indeed compared with that to be found in many Member States.
That is not to say that matters cannot be improved.
They can and must be.
In 2003, the Commission carried out an investigation into the ways in which the regulation had been introduced in the first few years.
In 2004 we published our evaluation report.
By then the regulation had only been in force for less than two years, but it had operated well, and there was no immediate need to revise it or any legal obligation to do so, either.
That was why the Commission thought it better to wait for the Constitutional Treaty to be ratified before we did anything further.
The Constitution requires new legislation in this area.
The fact is, we all know how matters stand with the Constitutional Treaty.
Meanwhile, the European Court of Justice has also produced several proposals for introducing rules governing access to documents.
The Commission thought that this was now an appropriate moment at which to begin overhauling the regulation, and the decision to do this is part of the broad European transparency initiative, which we in the Commission decided on in November of last year.
MrÂ Cashmanâs report is therefore extremely timely, given that we are in the throes of looking to see how we can improve the rules governing public access to documents.
The Commission â including, I can promise you, myself personally â will be looking extremely carefully at the reportâs recommendations.
One of the conclusions drawn by the Commission in its evaluation report of January 2004 was that the regulation had primarily been used by EU professionals, lobbyists, consultants and law firms, rather than by the general public.
That is something we want to change, and we must do much more to reach out to people.
What, in the first place, we are concerned with here is, of course, public access to documents or the publicâs right to keep itself informed, and that is a further argument in support of our wanting to see a general consultation take place before we change the legislation.
The Commission intends to hold such a consultation between July and October of this year.
We shall then put forward a practical proposal at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.
Without going into the details of the reportâs various recommendations, I should simply like to clarify matters in a number of ways.
RecommendationÂ 2 talks about increased openness in the legislative procedure and of a clearer dividing line between legislative and administrative documents.
The proposal is a very interesting one, at which we shall look closely.
The same recommendation also relates to the Official Journal and electronic publication thereof.
Our institutions had jointly decided to look at this issue back in 2004, and the Publications Office has already issued a report on the future of the Official Journal.
RecommendationÂ 3 talks about documents classified as confidential.
In this area, we must be careful not to confuse different things.
Confidentiality does not in itself lead to a general exception to the rule whereby people have the right of access to documents.
A refusal to issue a document classified as confidential must be justified in precisely the same way as a refusal to make any other document available.
The procedure is the same, and the institutionâs obligations are the same.
The same recommendation also discusses the issue of the European Parliamentâs access to information classified as confidential.
Here too we are in danger of confusing matters.
Parliamentâs rights in this area are controlled not by the regulation but by AnnexÂ 1 to the framework agreement between our institutions.
In our experience, the framework agreement operates well.
I think that recommendationÂ 5 contains quite a few extremely interesting and useful proposals concerning more user-friendly registers and databases.
They are proposals requiring no legislation, as they deal with practical details and measures.
The interinstitutional committee appointed through the regulation in question last met in November 2005 and decided to appoint a working party to look at those issues, so a solution may be nearer than we think.
To conclude, the Commission is very committed to the issue of public access to documents.
We have embarked on an overhaul of the regulation, and we have begun to take a closer look at many of the issues discussed in the report.
We hope that the European Parliament will continue to help matters along and we expect great things of the general consultation we shall be carrying out between July and October.
Public access to documents is about scrutiny and credibility and, when it comes down to it, democracy.
It is therefore important for us to continue to cooperate constructively and for us to listen to the general public.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying, on behalf of the members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on Petitions how grateful we are to Mr Hammerstein Mintz, the rapporteur, and also to MrÂ Cashman, for the work they have done and for the reports that have resulted from it.
They are indeed making a considerable contribution to putting beyond all doubt this Houseâs willingness to make Europe more transparent.
If you do not mind, I would like, briefly, to say something about the Hammerstein Mintz reportâs pre-history.
It so happened that we were discussing with our friends in the German Young Christian Democrats just how it can happen that we so often get reports in the national media about certain decisions for which the European institutions are then blamed, even though the Council â which is very visibly present this evening â had an equal hand in taking them.
This, combined with the Convention, gave us the idea of approaching, through Mr Brok, the European Ombudsman in an attempt to find out what the position was on this under the European laws that the Council had played a part in adopting.
It is of course, only natural that those who talk a lot about closeness to the public and about the need for the EU to become more democratic, should play an active part in making this a reality.
To do so would be to do a great service not only to the esteem in which Europe is held, but also, in this specific instance, to the prestige of the Council and of the European Union as a whole.
Despite the individual issues that Mr Cashman and MrÂ Hammerstein Mintz have addressed, there is less of a need for action on the transparency and openness front in the Commission and in this House, but certainly a good deal more remains to be done within the Council of Ministers.
The way the Council functions does, of course, make this more difficult to some degree, since there are various things that are not as stable as they are in Parliament or in the Commission, but I do nevertheless believe that, in a debate such as this one â without wanting to offend the Austrian Presidency â one ought to be able to expect a much more serious approach to be taken to this.
There is no doubt about the fact that not all the information that people might like to have can be made available to them, but the fundamentals of transparency should nonetheless apply.
Perhaps, Commissioner, you could pass that message on to your colleagues.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall not detain the House by taking up two valuable minutes but would like to commend to the House the very valuable work of MrÂ HammersteinÂ Mintz.
He has worked very closely with all of us, and on behalf of the PSE Group I would like to say that he has the full support of my group.
If you would allow me, I failed to thank my good colleague MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld with whom I worked very closely, as with others, on my report, and I thank the House for its patience.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is widespread public suspicion of the European decision-making process, and no wonder when ministers meet to make laws behind closed doors.
It does not have to be like that.
We may never make the European Union perfect, but we can at least make it better.
The Ombudsman has given us great moral authority and has added moral authority to the cross-party campaign that exists in this House, which has commanded an astonishing degree of support.
In the case of my own country, it has managed to get pro-European Liberals and anti-European United Kingdom Independence Party members united on a platform together in common cause â a unique event.
There is a simple principle behind this: laws should be made in the open.
Ministers should voice their opinions, do so honestly and do so in public, so that citizens can know what they are doing and national parliaments can hold them to account.
In signing the Constitutional Treaty, every Head of Government committed himself to that principle: the Council should meet in public when debating legislative acts.
But it does not require Treaty change, it just requires an alteration in the Councilâs rules of procedure: not even one of 25 votes, just 13 votes â a simple majority â can bring about that quite fundamental change and the introduction of that principle.
The British Presidency came out with some warm words but, at the end of the day, fudged it.
(No!)
Well, they have not changed the rules of procedure, Michael, that is the reality.
The Austrian Presidency now has the opportunity to make the difference.
When I put the question to the Austrian Foreign Minister in January, she said: well, we will do what we can, but we are conscious of the delicacy of the matter.
Why is it delicate?
This is about openness and transparency, a fundamental European principle to which every Head of Government has committed himself.
I look forward to the Austrian Presidency taking the initiative now and putting it to a vote.
If the reality is that some Member States â France for example â which are behind the scenes trying to block this initiative, then let them be named and shamed and let them answer to their people and to the people of Europe.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is democracy?
Whatever the answers to that question that have emerged over centuries of European history, there is not one single one of them in which public access to the legislative process is not described as one of its foundational principles and as something without which it does not exist.
The Council of the European Union is making so bold as to treat a fundamental principle with contempt; it has the sheer nerve to say that that is its own business, its own policy decision, and, with unparalleled cynicism, to reject the openness and transparency required by the Treaty, by claiming that this requirement for transparency applies to a future Union.
The European Parliament cannot do other than find that intolerable.
This report touches upon the innermost heart of the crisis of public confidence in Europe.
The more I concern myself with this abuse â and I was successful in getting it made one of the main items on the Conventionâs order of business â the more it appears to me that the Council is the black hole in democracy, that it the democratic deficit.
This House should do everything in its power to prevent this from becoming a token exercise for the sake of our tender consciences.
We are the directly-elected representatives of the European citizens, and we have to make this our business.
Grateful though I am for this report, what I propose goes well beyond it: we in this House, as the representatives of the European citizens, should present the Council with an ultimatum, with the end of this year as the deadline.
If the Council does not, by then, comply with this fundamental principle of democracy by amending its rules of procedure and conducting its legislative business in public, this House should reject all those of its proposals for legislation that have not been discussed and adopted in public.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst the Commission and Parliament probably draw most attention in the European Union, in the final analysis, it is the Council that wields most power.
That is where the vetoes are held and where there is scope for deferral for what the Commission and Parliament have decided.
It is there that the governments of the Member States do their bartering, where intransparent business interests are protected and where everything is shrouded in much secrecy.
The proposed Constitution that was rejected last year by the French and Dutch electorate would have done nothing to change the Councilâs powerful role as government and senate rolled into one.
One of the Unionâs main democratic shortfalls is the fact that the Council meets behind closed doors.
In practice, this makes it impossible for Members of this House or of the national parliaments to be certain that the ministers of their Member States have voted as they said they would.
A case in point is the vote on the software patents a year ago, where either the Dutch or the Danish minister had lied to their parliaments about their own voting behaviour.
This renders democratic control over decision-making impossible.
We should not wait for a constitution to throw open Council meetings â not just legislative, but all meetings â to the public.
Further delay will amount to the deliberate undermining of parliamentary democracy.
Â Â  . It gives me real pleasure to be addressing the meeting today, because we are talking about two documents prepared by Parliament, by Members of this Parliament, by an outstanding member of the Committee on Petitions which I chair, Mr Hammerstein Mintz, and because we are also discussing a report prepared by MrÂ Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs â he is Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Petitions and an outstanding member of it.
One of the starting points of the discussion is the report of the European Ombudsman, Professor Diamandouros, on the openness of the Councilâs work.
The work of Professor Diamandouros, our European Ombudsman, is also closely associated with our Committee.
In addressing you on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, but also as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I am especially pleased to be able to speak of those three extremely well prepared documents and I would like to congratulate their authors, MrÂ Hammerstein Mintz and Mr Michael Cashman, on their excellent work.
We have been speaking of openness today.
Sometimes you hear it said, though we have not heard such views today, that not everything needs to be open, that there are negotiations, discussions, preparations.
Indeed, we agree with this.
These negotiations, discussions and preparations need to take place behind the scenes.
We are not demanding the sort of openness that would enable us to eavesdrop on what ministers discuss with colleagues in their offices, or ahead of Council meetings.
Once the Council begins its debates, however, we want to know what it is debating and who represents what point of view.
There are at least three reasons for demanding such openness.
The first reason is simply that we have a right to the truth, and therefore we want to know what the truth is.
Secondly, we have a right of oversight.
We have a right of oversight as individual Members of the European Parliament and as the European Parliament as a body, and we also have a right of oversight as members and as citizens of the European Union.
In addition, our colleagues, the Members of Parliament of the Member States whose ministers speak in the Council, also have a right to know.
In other words, both European and national public opinion have a right to know what takes place in the Council.
There is also an issue which is especially close to the heart of the Committee on Petitions, and that is bringing European institutions closer to the citizen.
If we say that there is a crisis of confidence in European institutions, it is this openness of debates which should overcome this crisis.
In other words, we want there to be confidence in Europe, we want the confidence towards which, I am very pleased to say, the Committee on Petitions and its two outstanding members, the authors of these reports, are working.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is a very simple method of implementing openness in the EU: reverse the procedure so that there is open access to all meetings and documents, unless the opposite is decided.
That is the way things are here in the European Parliament, and it is something from which the other institutions can learn.
Our committee meetings for the purpose of preparing legislation are open.
Why cannot the corresponding deliberations in the Councilâs 300 half-secret working parties be opened?
Our use of experts is a public matter.
Why will the Commission not say who are involved in the 3Â 000 secret working parties?
The proposal to reverse the procedure received 200 of a possible 220 signatures in the Convention.
No other proposals gathered so much support: all the elected representatives in the national parliaments, all but one of the Members of the European Parliament and 23 out of 28 governments.
The proposal does not even require a change to the Treaty.
It can be implemented by means of a simple change to the Rules of Procedure.
Both the Commission and the Council can adopt the proposal by a simple majority: 13 out of 25 Commissioners and 13 out of the 25 countries in the Council.
Come on now, MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ SchÃŒssel, get matters under way so that people might feel respect for the necessary cross-border cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I should like sincerely to thank MrÂ Cashman for his constructive cooperation over the years in the cause of increased openness.
The European Parliament has always been the driving force, but I must, in all honesty, also acknowledge that the Commission and the Council have also contributed lately to the really quite huge increase in quality that we have seen over the last five years.
We now have a legislative procedure in the EU that, in certain respects, is much more open than that of most national parliaments, my own included.
The purpose of this overhaul is to produce the same rules for all three institutions.
I of course hope that, in the long term, the process will rub off on the national bodies.
The regulations must be designed in such a way that they can be embraced by the majority of institutions in both the EU and the Member States.
Parliament is taking this initiative on openness in order to increase democratic control and produce clarifications when legislation is unclear.
The minutes of meetings of the Council must be published when the Council acts in its legislative capacity, which does not mean that details of all the Coreper meetings have to be made public.
Just as in the conciliation process, some scope for negotiation should be guaranteed.
Openness should, of course, be applied, however, when decisions on the actual legislation are actually taken.
To give the general public access to legal opinions as a matter of course would be to restrict the scope for political action. Either that, or the opinions would be of lower quality.
The alternative would be opinions of reduced quality.
Parliamentarians involved in a particular issue should, however, be allowed in certain instances to study the legal opinions, once they have undertaken in writing to observe the confidentiality that applies to everyone else who has had a part to play in the matter.
Clear and robust data protection is a basic condition of increased openness.
The rights concerned - openness and data protection - complement and reinforce each other.
Information given out in confidence must be respected.
Nor must we have any retroactive measures in this area.
I am convinced that, once the Commission has completed its work, we shall have a fair and balanced proposal.
I have every confidence in MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
There must be further development of the way in which people are given access to documents, and the Council must show respect for people and for the democratic process.
A lot remains to be done in this area.
Â Â  I thank Commissioner for being a committed supporter, together with the European Parliament, of making Council meetings public.
I can only repeat what was said by those who spoke before me, because everybody talked about the same issue: parliamentary legislation is a fundamental principle of modern democracy, invested with legislative and executive powers.
Although there are certain parliamentary chambers in Member States of the European Union â such as the British House of Lords â which are not elected directly by citizens, at Member State level these chambers, too, make their decisions publicly.
Unfortunately, the Council is an exception to this fundamental principle.
Within the democratic system of the European Union, this is the only legislative body in the world that legislates behind closed doors.
The exclusion of the public and the secrecy do not increase at all the credibility of the European Union.
When a particularly important, controversial issue is being discussed, the debate between Member States would be more transparent and more understandable to everybody if the Council conducted the legislative debate in public, during one of the earlier stages of the process.
Therefore, I particularly welcome the excellent report of Mr David Hammerstein, the proposals of Mr Michael Cashman and the report of the European Ombudsman in this matter, and I would like to thank them for their work.
I would like to remind everybody of the fact that in accordance with the first article of the Treaty on European Union, decisions must be taken as publicly as possible, bringing the European Union even closer to the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, according to the EU Treaties, decisions must be taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the people.
Neither of these principles is being implemented in practice, and that certainly does no credit to the EU.
It is not acceptable that the EUâs most important law-making body, the Council, still meets behind closed doors when acting as a legislator.
I can just imagine what would happen if the national parliament of a Member State closed its doors when starting to make laws â the parliament would be bound to disapprove of that.
In the EU, however, it is still possible to make laws undemocratically.
Greater transparency would make it easier to monitor the European Parliament, and the national parliaments too, and would greatly improve public debate on questions relating to the EU.
Today it is very difficult for national parliaments and the public to follow and monitor the decisions made by their own ministers in the Council.
This really is no longer acceptable: one part of democracy is transparency.
At present in the EU, people are saying that the Constitutional Treaty should be ratified quickly.
I in fact regard it as a lot more important for the EU to promote transparency and for all the EU institutions to do their utmost concerning this, and first and foremost, obviously, the Council.
This way, this black hole in democracy could be filled and transparency would be a fact of life in legislation at EU level.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would thank the rapporteurs for their constructive work.
I like MrÂ Voggenhuberâs proposal that we refuse to be accessories to an undemocratic piece of decision-making.
Where is the Council?
Do they have problems keeping awake so late in the day?
It is because they lock themselves in their rooms.
If they were to open these up, they would obtain enough oxygen to last them until the evening so that they might take part in these debates too.
Why do they not open their doors?
Do not politicians welcome any chance to appear on television?
Why, I wonder, is the Council passing up the opportunity to do so?
Like the entire population of Europe, I wonder what they are doing.
There is an easy way of remedying the situation: open the doors so that we can see what is happening.
I am relying on MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m to lead the EU into the twenty-first century and wake the Council from its twentieth century sleep.
I feel it is important for us to remind the Council that, if they do now open up their meetings, it must not be in order to get together formally for just an hour and then to take a four-hour working lunch, in which case openness would become a chimera.
We are also relying on the Council to eat quickly and to take their decisions openly and over an extended period.
Â Â  â Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the right of access to documents is one of the most important rights enjoyed by Europeâs citizens.
The EU has made an increasing number of documents available to the public.
There have been a number of problems, however, particularly in relation to the inadequate implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/01.
Accordingly, Parliament has, rightly, repeatedly stressed the need for a review of this regulation, with a view to improving it and strengthening EU legislation in the area of transparency.
We have done so because it is crucial to stress the idea of the citizens belonging to and identifying with the European project.
For this to happen, there must be a decision-making process based on transparent, open negotiations, and proper cooperation between the institutions, without any unwanted secretiveness.
This amended regulation must also form the legal basis for establishing rules, good practices and inter-institutional agreements designed to improve the drafting of legislative texts and to ensure that final legislative texts are accessible.
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Cashman, who has once again done an excellent job, when he says that the fact that Parliament does not have a clear legal basis for access to classified EU information runs counter to the democratic principle on which the Union is based.
It is also regrettable that the institutions do not have a shared approach on how to manage, share and store various kinds of document.
Improvements have undoubtedly been made, but there is still no great coordination between the institutions, especially as regards documents relating to interinstitutional processes.
There should also be clear rules on access to administrative documents.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by turning to an issue that especially affects me as chairman of the temporary committee analysing the CIA flights.
I wish to express my regret at the omission of the issue of access to documents that the Member States classify and make available to the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, the UK Independence Party is probably going to be helpful for the first time ever, so it is nice to be able to make my one-minute speech.
We have repeatedly condemned the Council for its lack of transparency.
The remedy is very simple: to change the Councilâs rules of procedure, as Mr Hammerstein Mintz makes clear in his report.
Such a move would certainly ensure that in future the British people could see when British ministers renege on what they have pledged before entering such meetings.
But that is not enough.
The Commission will remain as the unelected government of the EU, formulating and dictating laws without any democratic mandate whatsoever.
Meanwhile, this Parliament continues farcically pushing through vote after vote on dubious shows of hands.
Above all, France and Hollandâs democratic rejections of the failed EU Constitution are viewed with complete contempt by the Council, Commission and Parliament alike.
So let us stop lecturing the rest of the world on democracy.
Throw open the Councilâs doors, and the Commissionâs too.
Â Â  Mr President, I warmly congratulate Mr Hammerstein and the Commissioner on their efforts finally to democratise the meetings of the Council, to open up the doors of meetings in which legislation is passed without the citizens being provided with all the necessary information.
I must point out that, in my country, Spain, which voted in favour of the European Constitution, that was one of the arguments most accepted by the citizens: the possibility of democratising the meetings of the Council and assessing all of that information.
I therefore support the rapporteurâs proposals, particularly with regard to the publication of all of this information, including everything relating to successive presidencies, on the Internet and in all of the official languages of the Community, preventing any restriction of communication.
There is little point in publishing all of the information, in opening up those doors, but just in two or three languages, as it appears certain institutions are currently suggesting.
Transparency also requires that what is communicated is understood, that it is understood by all of the citizens.
We must therefore urge all of the institutions that are in favour of the democratic transparency of the Council to do everything within their capacity to guarantee that transparency in all languages.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by making a few comments about MrÂ Knapmanâs absurd remarks.
He said that the Commission is an unelected government.
Of course, everybody knows perfectly well that it is not a government at all.
Would you like it to be elected?
Would you like it to be a federal Europe with an elected government?
Come on, which way are you facing, MrÂ Knapman?
Then he uses this ridiculous word: the Commission âdictatesâ laws.
It does not dictate anything: it gets its powers from the Council and Parliament.
Just tell the truth to the British public â that is all we ask.
I am going to abandon Mr Knapman now.
The ALDE Group is totally supportive of these reports and we want more openness.
Under the British Presidency we fought very hard to persuade Mr Blair to do something.
In his usual way, there were big words and promises but very little action in the Council of Ministers under the British Presidency, which was very sad.
We want the Council to legislate in public.
It is perfectly clear and simple: only North Korea and Beijing behave like the Council of Ministers in Brussels.
That must change if we want the public to understand what is happening in Europe.
Secondly, we want legal opinions drafted within the framework of a legislative process to be public, not just to parliamentary committees but also to the public, whom we represent.
I have run out of time.
However, we will all vote in favour â I hope even Mr Knapman.
Â Â  Mr President, having worked for six years at the Finnish representation and the Finnish Foreign Ministry â in other words, the Council â and three years in the Commission as a civil servant, I do not know if I am a liability or an asset in the discussion â probably a liability, and I address that to Pekka Shemeikka and all of his friends from the Council!
I have several points.
My first point is that we are dealing here with two separate but interlinked issues: access to documentation and openness in the Council.
If Mr Cashman will excuse me, I am going to focus on the latter.
Sometimes I have a feeling that we are a little hypocritical in the debate because, if we look at national parliaments, many committees are never open.
We are much more open than national parliaments, so we must bear that in mind.
My second point concerns the opening-up of Council meetings.
It is a long story beginning with the Trumpf-Piris report in 1999, then there were several Council conclusions in 2001, the Constitution in 2004, and a Council decision in 2005.
It is an ongoing story, but we are not getting it.
I personally think it is a fantastic idea to open up the Council meetings.
We all know how ministers use the EU as a scapegoat.
First, they tap each other on the shoulder in the Council meeting and say: âGood compromiseâ; five minutes after that they go in front of their national media and say: âWe could not do anythingâ.
We need to open up the Council when it legislates and the sooner we do it the better.
A separate point is that, having sat through hundreds of hours of Council meetings, I can say they are probably the most boring meetings that you can get.
Openness would liven up the debate in the Council, because people often come and read prepared documents.
It really is boring and if we open it up it would be a bit better.
My next point is about Coreper.
Let us be honest: I do not think that Coreper is ever going to open up and I do not necessarily think that is a bad thing.
I would like to finish with an unrealistic proposal, which is rather like Mr Voggenhuberâs proposal.
What we should have is the Council meeting in a chamber without assistants next to them and in complete openness.
That would be a truly open and transparent Council, and that is what we need.
Â Â  Mr President, a lively, public, political debate on concrete issues is the basis for creating a European political space.
By having one of our law-making institutions meeting and deciding issues in private, behind closed doors, we are denying the creation and the birth of that political space.
I do not underestimate the problems of communicating such a debate to a population of 450 million with over two dozen languages, but we do have the technology today: we have satellite TV, radio, webcasting, a vast range of communication tools which we can use, and I do not believe that cost should be used as an excuse, because the cost of not doing it, the cost of not having an open, public, lively debate in Europe is the failure to create a future for Europe.
On 22 April the Competition Council will be meeting behind closed doors to decide on the future of the Services Directive, a directive in which millions of European citizens have taken an active role and active interest.
That debate should be in public.
Â Â  I am glad that the European Union institutions are becoming increasingly open and transparent, but we must remember that providing access to documents and ensuring the openness of Council meetings is not a favour which European Union institutions may but need not grant to European citizens.
It is rather a legal and moral duty, in keeping with the basic principles of good management of public affairs, or what is known as good governance, because it will enable us gradually to overcome the Europeansâ alienation from the European Union institutions and their growing euroscepticism, and do away with the sort of jokes that say that all we deal with here is the symbolic curvature of the banana.
If the European Union is exporting and wishes to export its basic democratic values associated with the protection of human rights and the values of good governance, it must itself become the best example of these values.
However, speaking from the perspective of the post-communist new Member States, but also of states aspiring to democracy and states in transition, I must conclude with regret that, due to their limited transparency, European Union institutions are still not the best example to follow.
Therefore, we most certainly need new regulations which will particularise the duties of European Union institutions and will provide a clear and precise definition of the circumstances in which access to documents and to the records of Council meetings may be denied.
However in practice tracing most information represents a major problem.
To obtain access to a document, one needs first of all to know that it exists.
The next important aspect of ensuring the greatest possible access and openness of the meetings of European Union institutions is limiting corruption, conflict of interest and all ambiguities as well as accusations of lack of objectivity in decision making.
How often have we heard accusations of biased decision-making by the European Union institutions, of following unclear principles...?
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ultimately the debate on the openness of meetings of the Council is a debate on democracy.
I cannot but agree wholeheartedly with the recommendations by the Ombudsman and the proposals by Mr Hammerstein Mintz or my friend Michael Cashman.
The lack of information for voters on the positions defended by the representatives of their governments at European Union level is creating a grey area as to who is responsible for the decisions relating to their daily lives.
Governments find it convenient to blame the Union for decisions which are not in their interests and to claim the merit for decisions which benefit their country.
Democracy, however, requires knowledge, judgment and reaction.
The lack of knowledge about the positions of governments in the Council also deprives national parliaments of the facility to control the governments of their states on European issues.
Ultimately, the question of the transparency of the Council brings us to the fundamental question of whether or not we want a European public opinion, a public opinion capable of expressing its satisfaction and its displeasure, capable of sending a message to the European institutions and capable of forcing the Council, as the rapporteur rightly notes, into the collective responsibility of its ministers.
This can indeed be the course of European unification.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank all of the members of the Committee on Petitions â a very important parliamentary committee â for their help, in particular its chairman, MrÂ Libicki, and its vice-chairman, Mr Cashman.
In short, I believe that this debate has demonstrated that this House is clamouring for transparency.
Nevertheless, this demand is being met with deaf ears, an autistic response, and even no response at all.
There are plenty of words, but no deeds.
Reflecting on Mr Voggenhuberâs proposal, I am wondering whether we really have to go as far as a parliamentary strike in order to achieve a minimum degree of transparency in the European Council?
Or are we going to carry on holding these debates every year, every two years, with Parliament expressing a unanimous position, with no response from the European Council, with no firm initiative from the Commission, without the person on the street seeing it?
It is all very well that opening up the Councils was approved in October, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, but the person on the street has not seen anything, ministers do not appear on the television debating, there is no visible debate.
We must make European political debate visible, we must make the debate in the Council politically exciting, not just the debate in Parliament.
That is what we are calling for, and I believe that we must adopt concrete measures and proposals and not just fine words.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, please accept my apologies for only just having arrived, but the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has only just come to an end.
I am glad that this report has been produced, for it is an important step in the right direction.
We would not need to discuss this report if the Constitutional Treaty â in which this is one of our most important aspirations â had been ratified.
If policy is to be legitimated, then transparency is a crucial issue.
This means â no more and no less â that we have to answer the public when they ask who and when is responsible for what, when decisions have to be taken.
If one of the legislative bodies, namely the Council of Ministers, does not conduct its legislative business in the open, then we will end up with a problem.
One possible answer during the period of reflection in which we find ourselves might be to open the doors to the public.
I am of course well aware that there are limits â not least where COREPER is concerned â to what can be done in the open, and of the possibility of negotiations being hampered by being conducted in the public eye.
It may well be that the rapporteur and I do not agree on what these limits are.
I really do beg you, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, to join with us in taking this initiative and achieving progress in this area.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the European Ombudsman for the positive line he has taken in his report, for what sparked this off was a petition submitted â with help from me â by the North Rhine-Westphalia Young Christian Democrats, and we are glad that it is pressure from young people that has made possible a debate of this kind, one that will open the door to more transparency and more democracy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  We have already come a long way in opening the Council to the light of day, but we must go still further and I therefore welcome the thrust of this report.
The Council used to deliberate all the time behind closed doors, with no right of public access to documents, and did not even publish the results of its votes, thereby making it impossible for national parliaments to see how the ministers representing their country voted.
Over the last few years, that has changed significantly, thanks to pressure from the European Parliament.
Now, the Council at least publishes the results of votes, grants access to most documents and, thanks to the initiative of the UK Presidency last year, deliberates on codecision legislation in public.
It is now time to go further and to establish the principle that all the legislative activity of the Council should be in public, as it already is for the other chamber of the EUâs legislature, the Parliament.
Â Â  The Austrian Presidency must, as a matter of priority, throw open the meetings of the Council of Ministers to the public.
This House, as co-legislator, meets and votes in public, and all meeting documents are posted on the Internet.
This allows everyone, all organisations, media and national politicians to keep an eye on us if they so wish.
I cannot see why the Council cannot do likewise.
The Council conclusions of 21 December 2005 on this subject lack boldness in this respect.
It is precisely in those areas where the Council decides only by unanimous assent that it is important that both the vote and the debate take place in public.
Only in that way can we put an end to the backroom deals.
That is not difficult, since not even a change in the Treaty is required to open up Council meetings.
All that is required is a change in the Councilâs Rules of Procedure.
It is no longer appropriate for the Council to keep taking most of its decisions behind closed doors.
Moreover, access to documents of the institutions must be improved.
The European citizens who rejected the Constitutional Treaty in the summer of 2005 have demonstrated the need for a more transparent and more democratic Union.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0051/2006) by MrÂ Papastamkos, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the assessment of the Doha Round following the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong [2005/2247(INI)].
Â Â  â Mr President, we are sorry that the competent Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, is not present.
The weighing of obligations is an objective exercise and, in all events, the onus of it is upon the chooser.
We are, of course, delighted that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, is present.
The successful conclusion of the current negotiations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation constitutes a major challenge to the global community, given that it is expected to strengthen significantly the global economy, growth and employment.
It is also expected to make the international trade system fairer, more balanced and more effective, for the benefit of all trade partners.
Ladies and gentlemen, the agricultural sector has, so far, been at the epicentre of the negotiations.
Nonetheless, the Union continues to come under pressure, even though, as we know, it submitted a very important offer concerning market access last October.
Suffice it to say that the European Union is, globally, the biggest importer of agricultural products from developing countries.
The general framework of limitations on duties must be evaluated in conjunction with: firstly, the important offer made by the European Union to eliminate the Community export refund system, secondly, the drastic reduction already made to internal Community aid and, thirdly, the comparatively disadvantageous position of European farmers and producers due to their obligation to comply with stricter rules.
I believe that further unilateral EU concessions at this stage would clearly jeopardise the implementation of the reformed CAP and be of little or no benefit to those countries for which the development agenda has been designed.
Development should not be confused with the single-sided advancement of the interests of large agricultural exporters.
At the same time, substantial progress is needed in other important sectors, which are sectors of offensive interest par excellence to the European Union, third industrialised countries and developing countries.
On ÎÎÎÎ, the final agreement should guarantee new, real market access opportunities through substantial cuts in applied rates in both developed and dynamically developing countries.
In services, further substantial liberalisation is needed with, of course, full respect for national policies and the right of the Member States to regulate their public services.
Emerging economies need to take their share of responsibility and contribution.
It is precisely these countries that maintain the highest levels of protection and hold the key to the development of the poorer countries through the promotion of South-South trade.
The differentiation between developing countries is not only fair, but is also required for the benefit of the weaker developing countries.
The full exemption of all developing countries from the need to make commitments would operate as a disincentive for reforms and for addressing the endogenous factors behind their delayed development.
On the other hand, I believe that externalisation and the more active participation of developing countries in multilateral negotiations, commensurate with their level of development, would contribute to the more effective integration of these countries in the global economy.
Of course, the necessary precondition is the granting of adequate targeted technical assistance in meeting their new obligations and effectively implementing WTO rules.
Guaranteeing an ambitious and effective Aid for Trade programme is particularly important.
The failure of the multilateral negotiations and, by extension, the return to bilateral regional agreements could lead to an unequal process of liberalisation, uneven development and uncontrolled trade disputes.
The European Union is rightly remaining by its commitment to the multilateral approach of trade policy and its support for the WTO, as the organised expression of world trade governance.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Papastamkos, and pass on apologies from my colleague, Mr Mandelson, who would have preferred to be here personally, but came back today from Rio, where he spent a couple of days trying to come closer to a common understanding with his counterparts from the United States and Brazil, as well as with Mr Lamy, the Director-General of the WTO.
Mr Mandelson asked me to update you on how he sees the state of play on the round in light of this weekendâs events.
Unfortunately, the talks in Rio did not lead to a significant breakthrough.
However, they were an important further step to get a better understanding of each otherâs positions.
We need to understand the pressures on, and aspirations of, our partners.
It is not about forcing others to move to our position.
It is about understanding where everybody stands and then seeing how our positions can be brought to meet in the middle in a way that brings sufficient gain to all of us.
There are still differences, but key players are not talking over one anotherâs heads as much now.
There has to be simultaneous movement now.
As far as the timing and the deadline to agree on arrangements for agricultural and non-agricultural market access by the end of April is concerned, that is still a possibility.
However, the contours of the potential deal are not yet fully there.
Mr Lamy summarised the state of play after the Rio meeting by calling on Brazil to be prepared to open its industries to foreign competition and by calling for the EU and the US to sweeten their offer to open farm markets.
That shows that the European Union finds itself in a better position than it was before and in the immediate aftermath of the Hong Kong Conference.
Members now realise that an advance on the EUâs agricultural offer is not currently in the making and that the success or failure of the round cannot depend on that one factor, but on overall balance.
The equation to solve between the competing interests of the WTO members is not easy.
However, our objectives and our ambitions remain unchanged: creating genuine new business opportunities in agricultural and industrial products and services in developed and advanced developing countries, as well as contributing to development; restructuring trade in agriculture; and strengthening multilateral rules.
We can only attain our objectives through a broad and ambitious round.
We are paying into the round with proposed real reductions in agricultural tariffs, as well as trade-distorting subsidies, if these are matched by real cuts in industrial tariffs and genuine additional services liberalisation by those who can contribute.
We also need to preserve the single undertaking outside of agriculture and industrial goods.
In that respect we would to thank Mr Papastamkos for his excellent report.
We thank you for the support for an ambitious and a genuine development Round.
We agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur, who has underlined the need to make progress on all issues in this wide-ranging agenda, with a clear emphasis on the objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable development.
We very much appreciate the support of this House in pursuing them.
However, by referring to a genuine development round, let us not fall into the trap of simplification and generalisation that dismisses the fallacy that agricultural liberalisation would only be a magic recipe for development.
As laid out in an interesting study by the Carnegie Endowment, the bulk of the benefits of agricultural liberalisation are limited to developed countries and a core group of highly competitive farm exporters, especially Brazil, Argentina and South Africa.
Other elements should be taken into account such as the impact of preference erosion in poorer developing countries.
For all those reasons, the key gains for developing countries in the DDA lie not in agriculture, but in trade in industrial goods, especially in labour-intensive industries such as shoes and textiles.
Another fallacy which your report rightly breaks is that within the developing country group all countries are equal.
They are not.
If we want this round to truly deliver its development potential, then that needs to be taken into account.
Contributions to the round should be based on capacity to contribute.
Developing countries do not have identical interests and capacities in trade.
That is a matter of common sense.
We accept that developing countries should, as a general rule, contribute less in terms of market access than developed countries.
However, advanced developing countries should provide a meaningful contribution through genuine new market access in non-agricultural market access and services, albeit less than developed counties.
They should only do two-thirds of what we do. That is what we call the principle of less-than-full reciprocity.
As for other developing countries, we agree that they would take up fewer commitments in line with their level of development or, as far as least-developed countries are concerned, even no commitments at all.
We need to continue to work for trade justice.
One of the main achievements of the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference last December was the acceptance by other developed countries to follow the EU way of granting a duty-free, quota-free access to products originating in least-developed countries.
But, as you report rightly points out, it is to be regretted that the decision still allows rich countries to exclude 3% of tariff lines.
Since we are approaching the end phase in this round, we now need to deal with all negotiating areas simultaneously.
That requires an intensification of quiet contacts with key partners â like the meeting held last weekend in Rio â to map out potential final packages.
At the same time we must continue to reach out to the entire WTO membership, in particular the LDCs and the mid-range developing countries, to build multilateral consensus.
Mr Lamy has a crucial role to play there.
The final deal must serve the interests of all WTO members and especially the least-developed countries and the other weak and vulnerable members.
Even though this is becoming increasingly challenging, we will continue to work towards deadlines agreed in Hong Kong, such as that concerning agreement on the arrangements for agriculture and industrial tariffs by the end of April.
At the same time we will ensure that other issues in this round that will take longer, such as services, rules and geographic indications, remain part of the single undertaking.
We will continue to inform you and listen to your views on the major developments in this round.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Papastamkos on his excellent report.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the development component has been given the prominent position that is its due.
That trade can make a contribution in the areas of development, poverty reduction and achieving the Millennium Objectives is not a matter of dispute.
It does remain a tricky subject, though, because whilst the interests of the different countries do not always run parallel, law and order do remain important in world trade.
Everyone benefits from fair rules in trade.
That is why the multilateral trade framework remains of vital importance, particularly in the case of developing countries, and that is why we must make an all-out effort to finish this yearâs Doha round on a positive note.
I was hopeful of this, but am now growing increasingly worried.
We are nearly four months down the line and hardly any progress has been made, and Rio has not yielded enough results either apparently.
A great deal is left to be done in many areas, including, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, the working out of a special and differential treatment for support to the least developed countries, in particular, to enhance the trade and negotiating capacity with regard to trade-disruptive subsidies, such as internal support, etc. These topics need to be further negotiated and none of this should depend on a result in agriculture or Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) alone.
Mr Lamy warned us recently that failure to achieve the three key targets by the agreed deadline of 11 April is a recipe for the roundâs failure.
He mentioned in this respect internal support, market access for agricultural products and industrial tariffs.
Europe, the US and more developed developing countries should shoulder their responsibility in this respect.
I am still hopeful of a positive outcome this year.
Europeâs commitment is solid, but without efforts on the part of all key players, no result can be achieved at multilateral level that can make or break the weaker developing countries.
Let us continue to work for a successful round with a good result, especially for the sake of the poor countries.
Â Â  . As representative of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to point out that the report presented is more balanced than documents on a similar theme which have been debated previously.
However, regrettably, this report and frequently the talks themselves fail to devote sufficient attention to solving European Union services sector problems in trade, while the European Union services sector accounts for 70 per cent of the European Union's gross domestic product.
To emphasise this sector's importance and its importance for international trade services, I will just touch on two aspects.
This affects financial sectors in particular.
In developing countries, the lack of opportunity to take advantage of various progressive financial products, especially for small and medium business, where the largest proportion of these countries' populations are employed, hinders the modernisation of their economies and the transition of labour from agriculture to areas of higher productivity.
On the other hand, the institutions of the European Union cannot exploit the potential of the huge financial services industry.
We are very competitive in this area. And we are encountering problems when trading with developing countries in agricultural products.
That is, in truth we must strive to change the structure of trade so that it is easier to work and so that a more modern economy is a more modern global economy.
That is, we ought to encourage trade in financial services, which would allow developing countries to modernise their economies and would in turn make the international trade structure more effective.
Of course, this means that we must discuss the introduction of standards covering the regulation of trade, company management and the regulation of financial services.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to my colleague MrÂ Papastamkos for his report and for the clear and explicit views on what sort of result we would like to see emerge from the WTO.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, too, would like to see a successful conclusion to the Doha Round â but not at any price.
It is not acceptable that the few should get all the benefit while many others are left behind.
What we need is fair trading conditions.
I welcome the reportâs insistence on the necessity of a fundamental reform of the WTO.
It is not enough for the WTO to be given the main objective of extending trade.
Environmental standards, consumer protection standards, animal welfare standards and social minimum standards must also be laid down as goals for the WTO.
It is not acceptable that the ultimate winners from the WTO negotiations should be those who plunder nature and exploit people.
It is unfair that European farmers engaged in food production should be required to comply with one requirement after another, while such requirements do not apply to imports.
Helmut Kohl, the former German Federal Chancellor, once said that he would like to see apply to food imports what already applied in the case of the motor industry, with cars from Japan, the USA, and Korea being allowed to be imported into Germany, but allowed to be driven on the roads only if they comply with the high technical standards that are imposed here.
If foodstuffs meet the same high standards as we European farmers do, then we need have no fear of global competition.
We are perfectly happy to face up to this competition once we have an outcome with many, rather than the few, sharing in growing prosperity.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Papastamkos for the clear guidance he gave when in Hong Kong.
We can count ourselves fortunate that, in Hong Kong, a political framework was achieved that now, , determines the form that the negotiations in Geneva will take.
Politics has, after all, achieved something, but it is now for the experts in Geneva to work out the substance, and we can only hope that they do it as quickly as possible.
We know that that will not be easy, but we are under a certain pressure of time, without which, as a rule, solutions are not arrived at in this area.
For the small and medium-sized enterprises, of course, the primary concern is with the opening up of the market, which should be ambitious and, above all, founded upon mutuality.
I believe that it is in this area that the âdevelopment boxâ â a programme for SMEs, designed to bring together small family-run businesses in the developed world and in the least developed countries â would be a good way for both sides to be successful in the future.
For that, of course, we need the parliamentary dimension in the various WTO countries.
As we know, every parliament includes both government and opposition, and it is the opposition that could make very considerable headway where these issues are concerned, for, in the least developed countries, the opposition and, of course, the media, are of particular importance when it comes to making progress in negotiations.
Finally â and this, I believe, is not without significance â there is the trans-Atlantic relationship.
This is where talks are needed, particularly with regard to agriculture, and I can do no other than concur with Mr DeÃ.
We need a framework here that promises a winning chance for all.
We need the world market, and so may it be in future too.
Â Â  . Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Papastamkos on his report and thank him for the willingness and cooperation he has demonstrated with a view to maintaining this Houseâs coherence and the general approach it has taken since the beginning of the Doha Round.
Our group will propose a few minor changes and then support his work tomorrow.
The results in Hong Kong were modest â we debated this back in January â but a road map was drawn up, with established time limits, the first being this 30 April.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus my speech on our course towards Geneva.
It is encouraging that the negotiations have been rebalanced and that the discussions are no longer exclusively about agriculture.
Progress is being made in terms of NAMA, services and trade facilitation, and development issues.
We still want this Round to close at the end of the year with an ambitious and balanced agreement in all fields of the negotiation.
We fully support the Commissionâs strategy and we still defend the principle of the single undertaking.
Success essentially depends on the political will and flexibility of the big players.
The time has come to move ahead.
We are counting on the negotiating skill of our competent Commissioners to persuade the United States to present new proposals with regard to internal aid to their farmers and to the emerging countries, in particular Brazil and India, to be flexible in terms of their positions and to present proposals leading to a genuine opening up of their industrial markets.
With regard to NAMA, bearing in mind that the Swiss formula has been chosen, an appropriate number of coefficients should be defined and the principle of less-than-full reciprocity applied, in order to ensure that the developing countries can protect their fragile industrial sectors and that European industry can strengthen its competitive position in access to the industrial markets.
In the field of services, we must continue in the direction embarked upon in the recent plurilateral negotiations and the requests presented on 28 February must be accompanied by serious revised offers on 31 July, always bearing in mind that a balance must be maintained between the liberalisation of the markets and the member countriesâ full right to regulate activity in this sector, particularly in the field of essential public services.
Commissioner, in Hong Kong, we parliamentarians had a magnificent view of the bay, but we had to use binoculars in order to follow the work of the Conference.
There is a gorgeous lake in Geneva.
I hope that the same thing will not happen there.
We know that we can count on the Commissionâs support and logistics to ensure that the European Parliamentâs delegation is given its proper place and that it is fully involved and informed throughout the negotiation process.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by formally thanking MrÂ Papastamkos for the approach he has taken to this work.
His approach has allowed us to reach right across the Chamber in order to produce a very fine piece of work that I believe moves this issue forward for Parliament, the Commission and the European Union as a whole.
The WTO has taken concrete steps to improve the transparency and democratic participation in its decision-making processes, yet there remain basic flaws, which many of my contributions to this report have sought to address.
In Hong Kong some 450 meetings were organised, yet elected observers were invited to just a handful of them.
Only two featured the whole WTO membership and the majority were exclusive and secret âgreen roomsâ.
This may make for efficient negotiations, but leaves little opportunity for public oversight of the most vital institution in the global trading system.
This culture of closed decision-making is a major setback in the fight to peel back the layers of secrecy, one which parallels our own struggle with the European Council.
Whilst conference leaders congratulated themselves on a transparent and bottom-up process, there are no records or minutes of these meetings.
Who said what, which countries were invited or present, will never be known by the public.
These concerns only increase with the organisation of mini-ministerials and âsuper green roomsâ where the majority of developing countries are either uninvited or unable to attend.
Increasing membership and consensus-based decision-making, whilst seemingly more democratic, still does not compensate for the influence of industrialised countries compared with that of their developing counterparts.
Despite over three-quarters of the membership being developing countries, the WTO still pits heavyweights against flyweights.
Lack of access led to the collapse of talks in Seattle and Cancun when ministers exercised the democratic right and said ânoâ.
Yet lessons were not learned.
The 2005 talks were still structured so that discussions took place in different sites at the same time.
This benefits the large EU and US delegations, but leaves some developing countriesâ ministers â those unable to split themselves in two â feeling helpless, often knowing less than the omnipresent NGOs and corporate fat cats.
NGOs have forged a greater role for themselves in the WTO negotiations on the basis that they represent civil society, but do they?
Who are their constituents and how can they possibly benefit from narrow, single-issue-driven campaigns?
More importantly, how can democracy prevail when non-elected NGOs enjoy more privileged access to the key players than democratically elected representatives?
The Commission may have made conscious efforts to communicate with observers in Hong Kong, but that is no substitute for the direct input of elected parliamentarians to redress this clear democratic deficit.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Doha round was in essence about was the need for trade to support and promote development.
Making this a normative requirement was a milestone in the history of international trade relations, and it was and is the right thing to do.
What that means is that the continuation of the talks must be considered from the perspective of development.
This is what makes it all the more alarming that the renowned Carnegie Foundation should now come out with a report pointing out that the development content of the current round is virtually nil.
We must take this analysis, and this judgment, very seriously, and in the light of them it is incumbent upon the Commission, in the negotiations, to use what is termed âspecial and preferential treatmentâ as a way of finding and supporting flexible solutions for the developing countries.
What matters now is that what came out of Hong Kong should not be made any worse in the current negotiations.
That is why we Greens reject the proposal put forward by Mr Papastamkos in his report that the number of coefficients in the Swiss formula be kept as low as possible.
That, in essence, goes against the spirit of the Hong Kong compromise and would deny the developing countries greater scope for independent development, yet it is this flexibility that they need, and I call on the Council and the Commission to disregard proposals of this kind and to adopt a negotiating strategy that is favourable to development.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, wish to thank Mr Papastamkos for his report.
The large number of amendments tabled in committee testifies to the fact that there can be very different views of the value of accommodating differing interests and, of course, of setting a variety of priorities.
Turning to agriculture, it is clear that the common agricultural policy is in need of reform, although it must retain its multifunctional character, one of the consequences of which is that farmers in the European Union must continue to receive support, while care must, however, be taken to ensure that grants for socially and environmentally sustainable regional development must be put to work in rural areas rather than big agribusiness and the banks being given preferential treatment.
I might add that I do not regard the European Unionâs offer to abolish its export subsidies by 2013 as part of CAP reform as being particularly generous; indeed, it is no more so than the cautious reduction in internal support.
As for NAMA, I regard the Swiss formula for non-agricultural market access, as currently proposed, as utterly inadequate, for âequalâ is not the same thing as âfairâ.
All states, and developing countries in particular, must be accorded the right to industrialise themselves at a speed of their own choosing, which means that they must also be allowed to protect vulnerable industries.
Moreover, let me sound a strong warning of the negative economic consequences that the sudden breaking off of customs revenue can have for such countries, since customs duties are often a vitally important source of income for their state budgets.
As for services, the same applies to them, albeit to an even greater degree.
During the past week, no less a person than Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the World Trade Organisation, has once more confirmed that the GATS rules allow all states the free choice as to whether or not to liberalise their services markets, and, should they wish to do so, to do it as and when and to such an extent as they shall themselves choose.
Not even Annex C of the ministerial statement can, or should be allowed to, interfere with that in the area of services of public general interest such as education, culture, health, infrastructure and energy.
If I may move on to preferences, it is the case that the report addresses the problem of the erosion of preferences and the falling prices for raw materials, but this is where Parliament, in view of the expiry of the ACP/EU agreement, should additionally insist on greater emphasis being placed on the development goals in the course of negotiations on economic partnership agreements.
Then there is democracy: as regards the democratic dimension, what I regard as definitely necessary is greater consultation â not only within the Inter-Parliamentary Union, but also with this House, with national and regional assemblies and with the public.
TRIPS: I welcome the agreement on the amendment of TRIPS to give the developing countries better access to medicines, but I do not regard it as sufficient.
If all people are to be guaranteed access to medicines, then further changes will be needed in respect of mandatory licensing.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we are debating the report of Mr Papastamkos on the assessment of the Doha round following the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, which took place in 2005.
Even the preparations for the Conference and the action taken during that period by the Commission and the Council caused great concern in the European Parliament, especially in terms of the future of agriculture in the European Union.
I should like to draw Membersâ attention to two facts relating to that period.
Firstly, on 18 October, at the European Union Foreign Ministers Meeting, Commissioner Mandelson said that the European Union must make concessions to other countries during the WTO negotiations, because the European Union will gain more on the export of industrial goods and services than it will lose on weaker protection of agriculture.
This statement suggested that there may be a wish to sacrifice the interests of EU agriculture in return for vague gains in other areas.
Secondly, in December 2005, before the relevant reports were adopted by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council hastily announced a reform of the sugar market, which will probably not help the poorest countries exporting sugar to the European Union, but will deliver a painful blow to the European Unionâs sugar beet growers, especially those in the new Member States.
Those two facts demonstrate that before the Hong Kong conference took place, the Commission and the Council wanted to show the world their willingness to offer concessions during the negotiations, especially in agricultural matters.
As it turned out, other WTO members have shown no such far-reaching desire to offer concessions, and what is more, they have blamed the European Union for the lack of progress in the negotiations.
It seems therefore that during continued negotiations, which will take place in 2006, European Union institutions will have to abide by the following principles in relation to agriculture: concessions made during WTO negotiations must not undermine either the food self-sufficiency of the Union nor the European model of agriculture, nor its multifunctional character.
Offers of agriculture concessions must be conditional and must be withdrawn if there are no satisfactory offers from other WTO partners during the negotiations that follow.
Thirdly, because of the considerable reduction of duties on agricultural products, only products not associated with economic, environmental or social dumping practices should be granted free access to the European Union market, whereas agricultural products produced in conditions involving breaches of human rights and of international treaties on environmental and animal protection must be subject to additional charges or special protection clauses.
Since the costs to be incurred by European farmers in ensuring the appropriate animal welfare standards have been assessed at approximately EUR 10 billion, we must demand that animal products originating from outside the European Union meet similar standards.
Â Â  . Mr President, when all else was gone and Jack sold the last cow from what had once been his familyâs thriving farm, he at least got a handful of beans.
In the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference Commissioner Mandelson made significant concessions on European agriculture in exchange for, I suppose, the hope of concessions in non-agricultural market access from the other big economic powers but, as we know, they did not concede much.
In the exchange of agriculture for services, Irish sugar beet farmers have lost their crop, and we have now lost the last of our sugar factories, in Mallow, in my own constituency, which closed just two weeks ago.
Irish farmers are worried that beef and dairy will be sacrificed next, in an effort to get trade concessions in services.
Commissioner, when Mr Mandelson trades off the last Irish cow, what do you expect we will get?
So far I cannot see that we have obtained very much.
Â Â  Mr President, although the current round of multilateral trade negotiations has been going on since 2001, the ambition to conclude them this year looks increasingly unobtainable, certainly if we judge it by the incremental effect of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong failed to make any substantial headway on the liberalisation of the international trade in services or non-agricultural market access.
The EU got nothing that matters in return for its commitment to eliminate export subsidies by 2013.
This concession, which comes on top of the pain of CAP reform, involves sacrifice for Europeâs rural communities.
For example, in Northern Ireland our milk production industry is heavily reliant on export refunds available on whole-milk powder.
This concession should be taken off the table in a short period of time if there is no reciprocal response on non-agricultural market access and on services.
My second area of concern is the lack of real democratic control over what is negotiated on our behalf by the Commission.
As one of the terms of EU membership, each state surrenders control of trade policy to Brussels so that no Member State can independently negotiate trade agreements with any country anywhere in the world.
National interests are made totally subservient to what is perceived to be the EUâs overall interest.
That involves a massive surrender of national power, compounded in its folly by the lack of real control over what the Commission then does in our name.
Yes, we debate it here, but realistically we can change nothing.
There is no effective mechanism to hold Commissioner Mandelson to account.
Such democratic deficit is one of the design defects of this EU.
Â Â  Mr President, before I start, I find it quite amazing that first an Irishwoman says that Ireland has got absolutely nothing out of the European Union, and then someone from Northern Ireland said that trade policy has nothing to do with democracy.
It is quite astonishing.
It is quite clear that Ireland is the greatest success story of the European Union.
And yes, trade is an exclusive competence of the European Communities, but basically Member States sit around a table, make a decision by qualified majority, and give the Commission a mandate to negotiate.
Of course, if you wanted a federation, perhaps you would do things a bit differently, but I have not heard anything of that sort.
Anyway, I am sorry, I could not hold myself back.
I have several points.
First, I would like to welcome the report, which I have to do because Mr Papastamkos is sitting in front of me and if I do not he would turn around and punch me in the face!
I think it raises key issues.
I also think that globalisation is the best thing that has happened to us over the past 150Â years.
It has raised global welfare; hundreds of millions of people have improved their living conditions.
Our great challenge, within the context of the WTO, is how to find a key role for the European Union and how to get everyone on board.
Secondly, if Doha failed, we would probably survive in the short term; after all, we are a global trading power â over 20% of world trade comes from us, over 20% comes from the United States.
We could have some bilateral trade agreements with other parts of the world.
But in the long term I do not think it would work out.
In the long term protectionism works like an ostrich; you are trying to hide from reality in many ways.
Thirdly, and this is for Mrs WallstrÃ¶m â and through her for Mr Mandelson â I agree with those who say that we have already given many concessions, especially on agriculture.
I think the Commission is doing a great job, but the reality is that, at the end of the day, we will most probably have to make a few more concessions.
Finally, I believe that we need to finish these negotiations in 2006, because after that we are not going to have the United States on board.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of points I would like to make.
Firstly, of course, I have to thank Mr Papastamkos, but I would like to include in that expression of gratitude Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez, a member of my own group and its shadow rapporteur.
Both of them, along with all the other Members who have acted as shadow coordinators, have done excellent work in achieving â to some extent jointly â a good compromise and a credible report.
I have a couple of important points to make, which relate to the aspects that you, Commissioner, addressed.
We find ourselves in a very tricky situation.
London was not a success, Rio was not a success, and next comes Geneva.
Are you ready and able to say something about the prospects for these negotiations?
Will Geneva happen?
How will it work out?
A second point that we have raised with the Commissioner several times already is whether the Commission will, this time, be willing to acknowledge, in the final statement, the role of parliaments.
There is recognition already for civil society, but the role of parliaments is still passed over in silence.
Only if it is mentioned will it be possible to give better guarantees, in future, of the parliamentsâ involvement and of their ability to exercise a monitoring function.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Papastamkos on this truly outstanding report.
I know that he has put a great deal of himself into it and has been personally involved in the work on it, so I warmly congratulate him on this document.
There are two points to which I would like to draw attention.
The first is that of geographical indications of origin.
It is to be regretted that neither the Commission nor we Europeans as a whole have succeeded in resolving the issue of geographical designations of origin, important though it is, and we are talking here not only about places and names, but also about the knowledge contained in the products that come from these places.
In very many cases, Europe is the original that many others imitate, and we should make them pay us for that.
The second point I would like to discuss is the one that Mrs Mann, Mr Karim and others raised, which has, fortunately, had some influence on the report.
It is not acceptable that 130 parliamentarians from 80 countries should spend three days negotiating and then not be mentioned even once in the final , whilst there are six references to non-governmental organisations in the same document.
That is an invitation to put a question mark against this assembly's democratic legitimacy.
To whom, if not to democrats, should it refer?
Quite apart from that, I wish MrÂ Papastamkos every success in carrying this idea forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report that lays down important principles.
The first of these is that there is no alternative to the multilateral trading system.
Bilateral agreements always benefit the stronger party.
We must focus on the developing countries, which benefit most from straightforward multilateral systems that allow them to free themselves from dependency on the colonial powers.
Secondly, the report states that the EU must show leadership.
This means that we in the EU must necessarily accept that we are going to pay for the agreements.
We must get away from the quid-pro-quo principle and not focus on what we in the EU can get out of agreements in the short term.
Agreements that combat global poverty are of most benefit to us too.
Then there is agriculture.
The decision to phase out export subsidies is all well and good, but we must also look at the rest of the subsidy arrangements, including subsidies for rural districts.
According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), such arrangements are very problematic for the worldâs poor.
Finally, I want to say how gratifying it is that the report alludes to the ILO and environmental standards, even though it does so in unduly broad terms.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha Round has been reduced to a typical negotiation designed to increase liberalisations to the advantage of large economic groups and, as such, it is a failure.
Despite the fact that it has been labelled the development round, it is precisely developing countries that will end up being the main losers, as, moreover, it transpired from a report commissioned by the World Bank itself from an independent group.
Furthermore, the continuation, until 2013, of the European export subsidies for agricultural products and of the US subsidies for the cotton industry will cause a further social disaster in developing countries.
