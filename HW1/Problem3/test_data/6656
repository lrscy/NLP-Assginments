Mr SchrÃ¶der demonstrated again the logic of support for the third generation agreement in his contribution, as indeed did Mr Howitt who reflected the same view and again illustrated the dangers of taking the view that every issue is only either black or white.
I take very much to heart the comments of Chairman Brok; I only hope that the Council and the Commission will maintain a sense of balance should the third generation agreement be ratified.
I think Elmar Brok is correct in this particular viewpoint, which is the balanced one.
It gives us a basis on which we can engage with the Pakistanis.
The Presidency will not lose sight of the fact that there remain many serious negative issues in relation to Pakistan and we will certainly seek to ensure that the Union maintains pressure on the Pakistani authorities during the period of Ireland's presidency.
Equally, I have no doubt whatsoever that this will also be the position taken by successive presidencies.
Again I want to thank you, Mr President, and I want to thank the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, there have been some extremely good and passionate speeches in this debate, which indicate the extent to which honourable Members have thought carefully about the issues and have weighed the sort of arguments which MrÂ Cushnahan, Mr Howitt and others have put.
I would say to Mr Cushnahan, who made a storming speech which reflects his own passionate commitment to democracy, that it came as a modest surprise to me to be described as a 'puppet of Washington and London'.
This will improve my street credibility in certain parts of the House, but anybody who was in the Chamber this morning may find that a slightly outlandish description of your humble servant.
All is fair in love and war and I recognise that the honourable Member's speech was, as I said, a reflection of the passion that he feels about this subject.
One direct question was asked of me and â admirably, because it is not always thus â the person who asked the question has stayed behind to hear the answer.
I am not prepared â though I understand the importance of the issue â to agree to procedures for this agreement that we do not apply to any other, but I note that the agreement itself contains a suspension clause which both sides can invoke in the event of a breach of an essential element of the agreement.
Article 1 of the agreement on human rights and democratic principles is such an essential element.
The Commission is fully aware that this requires constant monitoring and this is, in fact, already being done.
There is an EU working group on human rights in Islamabad which produces regular reports.
It is perfectly possible for Parliament to debate those reports whenever it wishes.
Regular dialogue on human rights will be strengthened once the agreement is in place.
If the suspension clause is invoked by one of the parties, a consultation mechanism is provided for under the agreement itself, though I sincerely hope there will be no need for this.
Again, I would like to thank Parliament for what has been an interesting and passionate debate.
The issues raised are of great importance.
However, as I have said repeatedly â not least in the committee presided over by the honourable Member â on balance, now is the time for Parliament to vote in favour of this third-generation agreement with a country of considerable importance, both within the region and globally, and of considerable importance not least to our own geostrategic interests.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0270/2004) by Mrs Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on human rights in the world in 2003 and the European Union's policy on the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, my report deals with four topics which I shall summarise briefly.
First topic: the legislatureâs record where human rights are concerned.
This is a mixed picture.
Of course, the report welcomes the cooperation established with the Council and emphasises the influence Parliament has been able to exert in the struggle against all forms of discrimination and against the death penalty and in favour of womenâs rights and of freedom of religion and conscience.
It regrets, however, that too many of these resolutions are yet to be followed up and that the dialogue on human rights is, in some countries, without substance and of no effect.
Just one example: the tragic case of Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, whose conviction was confirmed today by the Turkish courts in an iniquitous ruling.
It may perhaps in the future be necessary to build proper control over human rights in partnership with the country in question, a partnership which respects the countryâs culture but which has specific objectives and timescales, as recently initiated in Bangladesh and as may be possible in the future in Morocco and Vietnam.
Second topic: terrorism.
The report unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism.
It stresses the need to organise the fight against this curse.
It also states, however, that this struggle must remain within the bounds of international and humanitarian law.
The report refers to infringements of this law which could, owing to the feelings of injustice and despair they engender, produce an even more fertile breeding ground for terrorism.
Third topic: reproductive health.
This is a little known area of health.
In the last century, of course, the talk was of shameful diseases and, in anatomy, the term shameful nerve was used to describe the nerve which passes through the genital areas.
What is shameful today is not that nerve, but the fact that, in the twenty-first century, men and women throughout the world are still deprived of sex education, access to information and effective means of contraception enabling them to choose and schedule the number of children they have according to their own wishes and to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS.
Looking at the terrifying spread of AIDS in Africa, in Asia, Eastern Europe and even, as you are aware, some of the candidate countries at the very gates of the Union, the urgent need for a response is clear.
Anyone who sees up close, as I myself have done, the sexual devastation in the camps for refugees and displaced persons âÂ remember that there are now 37Â million displaced persons throughout the world, 65% of whom are women and young girls, that these women and girls are frequently raped, infected with AIDS and compelled to sell their bodies for food and that many of them lose their lives undergoing back-street abortions âÂ will appreciate â and, in this regard, I appeal to MrÂ Gahler, representing the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â that contraception is a vital instrument for survival.
In fighting for reproductive health, I am not fighting against any spiritual leaders, whose right to lead their faithful I quite accept.
I am fighting against certain blinkered policies, such as that of President Bush, which, by slashing funds for the reproductive health programme, including contraception by means of condoms, is going to kill thousands and thousands of people.
I am in fact fighting for the right to life and human dignity.
Fourth topic: the rights of disabled people.
These people are trying to live full lives and their rights, as we know, are still being flouted in the countries of the Union.
What, however, is to be said, then, about the exclusion of disabled people beyond the frontiers of the Union, their marginalisation and, sometimes, even their confinement in institutions under inhumane conditions?
The PPE-DE Group, represented by Mr Gahler, has accused me of doing too much on this subject and of going into too much detail.
Is the fact that handicapped people represent 10% of the worldâs population and that this proportion is increasing alarmingly in the developing countries under the cumulative effect of destitution and armed conflicts a detail, MrÂ Gahler?
A detail, when the PPE-DE Group wishes to delete paragraphs 71, 72, 73, 77, 78, 79 and 80?
Are the rights to education, mobility and accessibility and the right quite simply to establish a family mere details?
Is it a detail, supporting programmes for the care of children suffering from mental problems during conflicts? Is the fact that paragraph 78 is to be crossed out with a stroke of the pen a detail?
These are details which will doubtless be fully understood by disabled people and the people defending them.
This report is characterised by conviction and is not designed to provoke.
It presents a broad view, I accept, of human rights throughout the world.
It is, however, a view bringing hope in a world torn apart. I should not like to finish without thanking all the groups which, apart from the PPE-DE Group, have supported me in putting forward this vision.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for allowing me to chip in before them and I would like to apologise to the honourable Member and to the House for the fact that I have to slip away leaving the Commission seat in the capable presence of my colleague, Commissioner Reding.
I have to go to Moscow for meetings with President Putin and Mr Lavrov and others.
I hope the House will excuse me of any discourtesy.
I would like to start by thanking Mrs De Keyser for her report, which illustrates yet again how the engagement of the European Parliament on human rights issues serves in my judgement as a critical stimulus to EU policy.
The Commission will, as usual, respond in writing to all the recommendations addressed to us in this report.
I should like, for my part, to reflect on some of the important themes which have been revised.
This subject of human rights and terrorism will unfortunately remain at the top of the international agenda for some time to come.
My position on the fight against terrorism is clear.
It has been set out several times.
I referred to it again a couple of times last night and again this morning.
I will reiterate it here.
The fight against terrorism must be predicated on respect for human rights, and not the other way around.
It is also my deep conviction that this alone is not enough.
Fostering human rights should be an integral part of the fight against terrorism.
The Commission will continue its efforts to promote and protect human rights in cooperation with our partners with all the means at our disposal: political dialogue, development cooperation and work with civil society in third countries.
Two human rights issues which have received much less attention are covered in this admirable report: the right to health â in this case reproductive health â and the pervasive discrimination which, despite their efforts, people with disabilities still face all over the world, and which is compounded in situations of conflict or poverty.
The ability of all people, especially women, to achieve reproductive health is an integral part of their reproductive rights.
The rapporteur is quite right in her account of the dire consequences if the right to reproductive health is denied and also in stating that reproductive health is not a 'women's issue' alone.
However, it is important to note that the social consequences of reproductive ill health can be most severely felt by girls.
For example, in many parts of Africa, female adolescents are more likely than males to be stigmatised for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, and they are also more likely to suffer disproportionately from such problems as unsafe abortion and infertility.
Since 1994, the Commission has become a major partner in addressing reproductive health needs in developing countries, in the framework of the goals agreed at the UN International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo ten years ago.
Between then and 2001, we committed over EUR 655 million in external assistance that was explicitly targeted at family planning, reproductive health, safe motherhood, HIV/AIDS and population policy and management.
Furthermore, in July last year, the Council adopted a regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries.
Under this regulation, Community financial support is given to specific operations targeting the poorest and most vulnerable populations in both rural and urban areas, designed to combat practices harmful to the sexual and reproductive health of women, adolescents and children, such as female genital mutilation, sexual violence, child marriages and early marriages.
The European Union has demonstrated its commitment to advancing respect for the human rights of people with disabilities through Community legislation which has been introduced on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty to combat discrimination in the field of employment, initiatives pursued as part of follow-up to last year's European Year of Disabled People and through its active engagement on a new UN Convention in this area.
The Commission has further undertaken a number of initiatives as part of our wider efforts to mainstream human rights in all aspects of our development cooperation, including the distribution of specific policy guidance on development and disability for the use of our delegations.
But there is still some way to go.
We think the best way of addressing this is through the provision of training for our staff and facilitating exchanges between representatives of disabled people's organisations and policy-makers, by raising awareness of disability issues in our dialogue with developing countries, and by including organisations for people with disabilities in the dialogue at country level.
Lastly, this excellent report highlights the anguish caused by one of the most pernicious causes of unnecessary disability in many countries, that is the use of anti-personnel landmines.
Here the Commission is committed to pursuing a vigorous policy to eliminate the threat posed by anti-personnel landmines and increasing its efforts to reduce the humanitarian, social and economic costs to mine-affected countries.
The strategy for mine action in the period 2002-2004 relates EU action to the goals set by the international community in the context of the Ottawa Convention.
Assistance for mine clearance and capacity building under the EC budget has been channelled to 33 countries and regions and in 2002 European Union assistance as a whole reached EUR 145 million.
I have been privileged to see the work we are doing in this sector from Sri Lanka to the Balkans.
It is enormously important and it is valuable, as are the other points made in this report, that the honourable Member has drawn this matter to the attention of the Parliament and to European public opinion as a whole.
We are extremely grateful for the report.
I apologise for having to dash to Moscow more rapidly that Napoleon managed and I am grateful to the presidency for making my dash possible.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Patten; we wish you a good journey to Moscow.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too welcome the opportunity to address the House in the context of this debate on human rights.
It is an important debate.
As I mentioned before, it is an issue of particular concern and interest to me.
Enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and the Council on human rights issues is very important.
It is an important focus of the Irish presidency.
It is very important that we should be close on this issue.
I want to thank Ms De Keyser for her very valuable report on human rights in the world in 2003 and the EU's policy on the matter.
The report will be part of a very important discourse.
We might disagree on some elements within it, but the reality is that this is a very good report.
The protection and promotion of human rights should be a constant yardstick of our international actions.
We adhere to the basic principle that human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and inter-related.
As Commissioner Patten just said, they are so closely related to the troubles we have in a troubled world.
I need not emphasise the close relationship between peace, security and stability on one hand and the respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy on the other.
The present debate in Parliament is timely, including for the reason that it coincides with the current sixth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is ongoing in Geneva.
I should like to say a few words about our relationship with the Commission.
The annual report of Parliament rightly makes reference to the large degree of congruence between the European Parliament's priorities as expressed in its resolutions and the EU action taken at sessions in the Human Rights Commission.
This is a concrete example of the implementation of the Council and the European Parliament working together more closely to achieve openness and transparency and the European Union's human rights policy.
Indeed this is one of the recommendations of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in their conclusions on 10 December 2002, concerning human rights and the democratisation of third countries.
The European Union has played a positive role at this year's commission in Geneva.
To date, on individual country situations the Union has successfully tabled resolutions on human rights situations in Belarus, Turkmenistan and in North Korea.
A resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories was also adopted by the Commission.
The thematic resolutions tabled by the European Union have also been successfully steered to adoption.
The Union's resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance, for example, has been adopted by consensus.
The resolution on the rights of the child was adopted by mere unanimity following a call for a vote by the United States.
I expect that the Commission will also adopt the European Union's resolution on the death penalty later this week.
All of that is to be welcomed.
However, a number of important United Nations-EU initiatives have fallen.
This is due, in significant part, to the composition of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
It also reflects the unwillingness of some regional groups to accept any condemnation of their members.
This has always struck me as one of the fatal flaws within the UN system.
An initiative from the EU on Chechnya was defeated and our resolution on Zimbabwe fell to a 'No Action' motion.
It is noteworthy that the number of votes that were cast against the draft resolution on Chechnya was, this year, significantly higher than those recorded on the same issue last year.
We will have to analyse this outcome and learn why this has happened.
We will also need to address the number of critical, country-specific resolutions that we table at the Commission.
Not least, we need to decide on whether our priority is to make Union declarations so that the world knows where we stand, or to see our texts in fact adopted by a majority of members of the Commission.
If I could lapse into less diplomatic language, it may be time that the European Union learned to 'box a little more cleverly' in its dealings on the Human Rights Commission.
If we want to be effective, as opposed to simply making declarations, we have to be strategic in our approach.
I want to deal with three priority areas that are mentioned in the report.
In her report, Ms De Keyser focuses on three main themes: first, trends in the international war on terrorism; second, the impact of the international situation on reproductive health; and third, the rights of disabled people, particularly in conflict situations or in extremely poor or developing countries.
In regard to disability, I was struck when reading the report by the reference to the fact that three-quarters of disabled people live in developing countries.
The incidence and intensity of disability in the developing world is aggravated by poverty and, as Commissioner Patten has said, by conflict.
It is a horrific fact that a huge amount of mutilation and disability flows from the use of landmines produced in so-called developed, civilised nations and then exported to the third world.
In recognition of the rights of persons with a disability, during the Irish presidency we will further progress work within the Union and at the UN-level to lead to an elaboration of a UN convention on the human rights of persons with disabilities.
In the context of reproductive health, the annual report highlights the worrying increase in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in eastern Europe and in central Asia, and the relationship between poverty and reproductive health issues.
The Irish presidency has recognised the importance of addressing the AIDS issue and it is way beyond the capacity of any one government to solve.
In February the presidency hosted a major conference in Dublin on the problem of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region under the title 'Breaking the barriers: the fight against HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia'.
On reproductive health in general, I want to state that the European Union will unstintingly work to ensure that the rights to reproductive health care and services accepted in all basic documents of the major UN conferences would be implemented.
The European Union and its Member States are committed to the specific reproductive health goal that was agreed at the Cairo International Conference. That is to make primary health care â reproductive health care â accessible to all individuals of appropriate age as soon as possible and no later than 2015.
This commitment is demonstrated by the regulation, adopted by the European Council in July 2003, on aid for policies and actions on reproductive health.
As for terrorism, Mrs De Keyser is quite right to emphasise that the danger of emotional reactions, such as fear, anger and a desire for vengeance, can lead to calls for repressive measures in the fight against this phenomenon.
This is a common theme that has run through so many of the debates in this House: we all are interested in a common fight against terrorism but we must also make sure that the fight is balanced with respect for human rights for democratic principles and for the rule of law.
In the period since September 2001, the fight against terrorism has become a global priority.
At the same time, that fight has posed new challenges for the promotion and protection of human rights.
Acts of terrorism can never be justified by any cause or ideology, and must unreservedly be condemned.
The indiscriminate slaughter of unsuspecting human beings, which is the hallmark of terrorism, constitutes first and foremost a flagrant denial of the most fundamental right of all: the right to life.
All states have a duty to protect their citizens from terrorist attack and to combat terrorism in all its forms.
Yet, in order to receive the widest possible support and to be successful in the long term, the fight against terrorism must be conducted in full respect of human rights and in full respect of fundamental freedoms.
Fostering human rights should indeed become an integral part of any fight against terrorism.
We must also address the causes of terrorism.
To seek to understand the causes of terrorism should not be understood as being in any way soft on terrorism or on the terrorists.
On the contrary, it is an essential step in the elimination of terrorism.
As the President of the European Council, Mr Ahern stated here in Parliament last month that any good physician will tell us that in treating a disease it is first necessary to tackle its causes as well as its symptoms.
All too often the simplistic response to terrorism is equivalent to addressing only the symptoms, not the disease.
In the context of combating terrorism, Mrs De Keyser also rightly notes the need not to use this objective as an excuse to suppress the freedom of the press and specifically not as a justification for attacks on individuals or individual journalists.
The European Union has traditionally attached great importance to the work performed by all human rights defenders, including those in the media.
Human rights defenders have become increasingly effective in ensuring greater protection to victims of human rights violations.
However, this progress has frequently been achieved at a high price and at high individual cost.
The defenders themselves have increasingly become the targets of attacks and their rights have been violated in too many countries.
While the European Union has attached importance to the protection of human rights defenders this has been largely done on an ad hoc basis to date.
The Irish presidency is working to produce specific policy guidelines in order to strengthen the European Unionâs support for human rights defenders.
These guidelines will shortly be brought before the Council of Ministers.
Let me again congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
On behalf of the Council, the presidency welcomes this collaboration with Parliament in further advancing our common cause of democracy and human rights.
The European Union is founded on respect for human rights, and this is true both of the internal affairs policy within the Union and it is equally true of our policy in foreign affairs.
Â Â  â Mr President, protection of human rights is, traditionally, one of the core issues for the European Parliament, and there is in fact political consensus on how to handle it.
The standards to be applied are to be found in the international agreements protecting human rights.
Those breaching these standards or negligently allowing them to be breached must come in for criticism from this House.
This yearâs report, however â in contrast to all its predecessors during this legislative period â has not been born under an auspicious star.
Our main point of criticism is that the rapporteur has laden down what is meant to be an annual report on human rights with an unacceptable amount of ideological ballast, and made her own hobbyhorses, not to say obsessions, its central point.
That, for a start, is why it lacks a general and uncontentious component, which has been introduced into the text only by dint of 70 amendments.
Let me reiterate, for the sake of absolute clarity, that such a report has to be about the big issues, that is to say, about questions like: where do we demand democracy, free elections, freedom of opinion, freedom of the press, freedom of faith and conscience, the removal of legal and practical discrimination against women, the protection of physical integrity and so on?
For what do we criticise the Council, particularly when, in its dealings with large countries, it pays only lip service to human rights?
It goes without saying that reference in such a report to the rights of â for example â the disabled is only right and proper.
Of course, their rights as citizens of the State with equal status must be enforced, and demeaning treatment in public facilities must be denounced.
Within the limits of what individual States can do, the human right to life also includes the right of access to health facilities, but you must stop dressing up detailed demands in health and social policy â desirable though they may be â as a catalogue of human rights and immortalise them in this report.
The fact is that those things that are guaranteed as human rights can be claimed as legal entitlements, and those who fail to provide them are violating human rights, but no single constitution, not one international convention â European or otherwise â declares the detailed demands you make here to be actionable human rights.
If they were to do so, the Mayor of Rabat or his counterpart in Lagos would be violating human rights by failing to comply with your demand that the cityâs buses should be equipped with doors that disabled people can use.
Failure to do so may well make him a bad mayor, but he is not violating human rights.
This shows just how false your approach is.
There is no human right to the distribution of free condoms either, but, in this case, it is a goal to be achieved.
The President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, may well have the wrong idea about how to combat Aids, but that does not make him a violator of human rights.
This House has before it Mr Mantovaniâs outstanding report on the situation of disabled people, and it is the proper place for all the things you enumerate, but then you would be able only to table amendments and the report would not carry your name.
Let me tell you, Mr Mantovaniâs report puts it all so much better; that is why we will be voting for his report and not for yours.
As for your other hobbyhorse, reproductive health, that belongs in the Committee on Development and Cooperation or in the Junker report on 10 years after Cairo â in fact, it is already in there â but not, in this form, in the category of guaranteed and actionable human rights.
From whom, then, do you intend demanding it?
This is where you and I are often not that far removed from each other; I too am against this Mexico City policy.
I am also the first to want Catholic mission stations to hand out condoms rather than anathematise them, but when you demand that we in the EU make up for the loss of funds from the USA, that, I think, is when others will get the idea of saving their money; after all, the EU will take over, will it not?
The consensus on human rights in this House has lasted for many years, but, as I see it, your report does nothing to help maintain it.
Â Â  Mr President, in Britain a man suffocated to death his 40-year-old brother who had Huntington's Disease.
He pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and the judge set him free.
In a residential institution in Belgium, disabled people have been abused by carers and health workers, physically beaten and their money taken and used by staff.
In a residential home in the Netherlands, five elderly people with dementia were hit, spat at, kicked and called names by three nurses.
In Spain, a 44-year-old disabled woman was confined by her parents to a cellar six feet deep from the age of four.
Social workers knew about this for 25 years.
In Bulgaria, children in a home for intellectually disabled people were tethered to their beds in winter and left to freeze at night when the heating was turned off to save money.
Fifteen children - a quarter of the residents - died.
A man from Venice in Italy with mental health problems was habitually locked in his home when his mother went out, leaving him alone.
When fire broke out he found the front door locked and died of suffocation from smoke inhalation.
In Germany a 55-year-old man with learning difficulties and impaired sight was attacked on his way to work by two skinheads and beaten and trampled to death.
The youths told the police that 'he was unworthy of life'.
As Mr Gahler has just stated, the members of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament voted against Mrs De Keyser's admirable report in committee and some threatened to oppose it in plenary, because they say that these examples of abuse against disabled people do not constitute a breach of human rights.
Shame on them!
Â Â  Mr President, will we ever achieve the level of civilisation at which large-scale human rights violations will be a thing of the past?
The most important reason for such violations is often the retention or indeed, conquest, of power at all costs.
Similarly, barbaric practices of sowing hatred for purely religious or ethnic reasons have by no means been stamped out; on the contrary, ever more innocent people are being killed on a random basis.
This week, we are commemorating the massacre in Rwanda.
The world community is collectively hanging its head in shame for its own passiveness.
Is this genuine?
Have we really drawn the correct conclusions?
For Europe, do human rights really weigh as heavily in practice as the solemn declarations would suggest?
Are we really prepared to give precedence to human rights over economic and strategic interests?
Unfortunately, this is still not the case.
Extensive violence, torture, structural violations, such as abuse of women, the caste system, are still a daily occurrence.
Luckily, Mrs De Keyser supports the appeals I made in my report last year to make the human rights dialogue with partner countries less non-committal and structure it more effectively.
The question is to what extent this has had an effect in practice.
Since my report, cooperation with the Council has considerably improved on a number of levels.
I expect that the Dutch Presidency will further improve relations with this House where these matters are concerned.
We on our part would do well to ensure that the human rights report is published on a set date every year, so that it is possible to include a verdict about the Council report and also about the solutions brought by the UN human rights committee.
In addition, our Parliament should follow up human rights violations where we have identified them more systematically.
It is unfortunate how the De Keyser report came about.
Despite this, my group supports the content, even where the rights of the disabled and reproductive health are concerned.
After all, it goes against any fundamental sense of justice that someone should die due to a lack of medical care.
Our Christian Democrat friends should agree on this, even if it involves non-enforceable rights.
Finally, I should once again like to highlight the increasing abuse of religions for political ends and radicalism.
Given the seriousness of the threat and the reality of Madrid, I would repeat last year's appeal that the European Union will need to map out the problem in all its dimensions and should draft a strategy to prevent this religious extremism.
It is also high time, in my view, that the EuroMed Foundation, which was decided on in Valencia in 2002, finally got off the ground.
The European Union prides itself on being a community of values.
That means that our human rights policy should become less non-committal; it also entails an obligation to work to propagate a level of civilisation at which large-scale human rights violations are a thing of the past.
Â Â  Mr President, the annual report on human rights is once again, unfortunately, the occasion on which we acknowledge that the world situation is becoming worse.
The law of the jungle and the option of repression and military intervention are supplanting the principles and values of international law.
The war on terrorism is seen as justifying all-out aggression, in many regions of the world, against individual and collective freedoms.
The list is a long one, and includes Turkey, where Leyla Zana and her companions have just been unjustly condemned, once again, for speaking out on behalf of the Kurdish people; Tunisia, where harassment and repression of any democrat are increasing, a phenomenon to which the European Union is indifferent; Morocco, where violations of the rights of the Sahrawi people are increasing in occupied Western Sahara; Iraq, where US occupying forces are causing real human tragedies, buying up the countryâs natural resources at low prices and taking upon themselves the right to behave like masters, and Palestine where, in the words of Avraham Burg, the former Speaker of the Knesset, the situation is so explosive that, âcrying out is a moral imperativeâ.
One could also mention the intolerable harassment of those who defend human rights all over the world.
According to the 2003 Annual Report of the International Federation for Human Rights Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, âThe present climate that focuses on security first and the implementation of arbitrary measures restricting individual freedoms undermines the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In this context, it has become more and more difficult to denounce the adoption of restrictive laws, to defend the right to a fair trial, to fight against the death penalty and to condemn torture.â
In some countries, journalists, lawyers, political opponents and trade unionists have become real targets to be shot down.
However, now more than ever, support and encouragement for these men and women in their struggle for democracy, justice and peace are proving to be vital to our common future.
Finally, respect and guarantees for fundamental rights such as the right to sovereignty, the right to food self-sufficiency, the right to health, and the right to live in dignity and not in misery, are also playing their part in the building of a better world.
In that sense I support the rapporteurâs action, particularly as regards reproductive health.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we can accept the changes in substance, despite the restricted emphasis on some details.
At the same time, however, I want more generally to draw attention to the methods that have been used, which this time have been scandalous.
Human rights must not be allowed to become hostage to short-sighted and often media-led day-to-day politics.
Thus, their implementation requires political choices to be made and it will also have a political impact.
They have intrinsic value.
Human rights work calls for an overall view of the situation and the systematic, sustained and consistent prioritisation of problems, both in thematic and geographical terms, that is based on its own system of logistics.
We welcome this reportâs overview of human rights work at the present time.
At the same time, however, we need to look to the future.
Unless we can improve the way we coordinate the EUâs internal and external human rights monitoring processes and put them on a par with one another, unless we are able to engage in more vigorous post-monitoring activity and disregard irrelevant political motives and hidden agendas, we will be leaving a sad legacy to the next Parliament.
Only if we can put our own house in order can we in any credible way demand that Member States and the Council give up their attitude to trade policy and other narrow views on what they might gain from a situation, and create a consistent and lasting policy.
In this sense human rights begins at home and that is mainly what the issue is now.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the speech we have just heard.
We too would have preferred a report that addressed the common core of the human rights culture stemming from the United Nations Universal declaration of Human Rights.
This is the direction we should be taking rather than using these reports for any other purpose.
I acknowledge that the report is better than the original version that was rejected in the parliamentary committee, but nevertheless, I wish to make some observations on my own behalf and on behalf of my group.
First of all, a few words on the Sakharov Prize and the three winners of this prize, who continue to be persecuted.
The resolution lacks balance, with the explanatory statement citing three cases in Turkey, Burma and Cuba whereas paragraph 23 of the final resolution ignores the situation of Osvaldo PayÃ¡ in Cuba.
This must be corrected, otherwise we could be accused of memory loss and of bias.
Secondly, where terrorism is concerned, we have still not achieved a properly balanced approach.
Above all, however, I wish to express my reservations as to the way in which the issue of reproductive health has been brought into this matter and especially as regards the link that is made between abortion and reproductive health â something with which I wholeheartedly disagree.
To quote only a few figures from the report, its explanatory statement claims that 100 abortions take place every minute and that 70Â 000 women die each year from unsafe abortions.
I have done some calculations and this means that 52Â 560 children die in non-leap years and 52Â 700 in leap years, in addition to these 70Â 000 women.
These are certainly worrying figures, but our slant on them is entirely different: we see them as confirming the right to life.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Veronique De Keyser for having for the first time in the history of this Parliament included women's reproductive rights in her report.
At the ICPD the international community placed reproductive health firmly in the context of human rights, and for a very good reason.
When human rights treaties are interpreted, the biological differences between men and women are not taken into account and this has drastic consequences, especially with regard to the AIDS pandemic, 60% of those affected being women.
Only 11% of women in a country like Zambia think that they have the right to ask their husbands to use a condom.
Up to half the young women and girls in developing countries say that they were forced into their first sexual experience.
They do not have abstinence as a choice.
They may be faithful but their husbands are not, and they do not use a condom either.
If fact married women have a higher frequency of HIV than unmarried women.
These women desperately need to know that sexual and reproductive health is a right.
I am appalled that some colleagues in this House want to deprive women of these rights in trying to suppress a chapter making them explicit in the human rights report.
This House should be very clear in its support to these women; we can do that by voting in favour of Mrs De Keyser's amendments and her report.
Â Â  Mr President, I get the disagreeable feeling that the rapporteur sees the fight against terrorism as just as big a problem as terrorism itself.
This remark was made repeatedly during the discussion of the report in committee.
It was emphatically denied, but the final version of the report has in any event not been able to take away this feeling.
Formally, terrorism is condemned â just as well â whereupon the report spends many paragraphs on the human rights of terrorists or those accused of terrorist acts.
Similarly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lacks any sense of nuance: Palestinian terror attacks and the construction of the security wall, for example, are bracketed together.
We in this European Parliament should seriously consider whether reports such as this one are useful.
Moreover, this is a report on human rights in the world, which means the world outside of the European Union, while we would perhaps do well to look closer to home.
Today of all days, the court in Belgium is passing judgment in a court case against the most important Flemish opposition party, the , a case instituted by a government body in which all the traditional parties have a seat, including that to which the rapporteur belongs.
What we are now witnessing in Belgium is the instrumentalisation of the fight against racism, or what should pass as such, in order to curb the right to the free expression of opinion.
With the elections only a few weeks away, attempts are being made to rob a democratic opposition party of its funding and even to have a court impose a ban on it.
You will appreciate that I have my reservations when someone who condones practices such as these is rapporteur today of a report on human rights in the world.
Â Â  Mr President, I am a great supporter of genuine human rights, but there is a danger that we are moving to an increasingly rights-based culture and that just about every human desire and social and health need is defined as a fundamental human right.
This approach is unhelpful from many standpoints, not least from the point of view of those who suffer genuine human rights abuse and whose cry is muffled by all the other competing demands.
I have another concern: at a time when international terrorism ranks among our greatest anxieties, we all too often see terrorists and their front organisations and political apologists abuse the human rights label for their own purposes as a political weapon and as a means of reducing the effectiveness of the security forces operating against them.
The report before us contains all of these faults.
It is a great improvement on the first draft, but still lacks sufficient focus on the real human rights concerns around the world.
Whilst swiping at the current targets of the left - the United States and Israel - it misses the opportunity to expose those corrupt regimes on many continents that keep their people in misery, and offers very little support to the victims of terrorism or those engaged in fighting terrorism.
In regard to the Israel-Palestine question, paragraph 46 of the report infers that settlement activity outside Israel's borders is somehow comparable to indiscriminate terrorist attacks on innocent civilians inside Israel.
Such comparisons are nothing short of abhorrent and it is most irresponsible for politicians to make such suggestions, particularly when all our peoples are faced with the threat of terrorism.
In regard to the issue of Guantanamo Bay, the report offers excessive comfort to those detained in Camp Delta, while ignoring the difficulties faced by our democracies in dealing with fanatics who are intent on menacing and murdering innocent civilians.
I would like to see a call for tough action by the EU and the rest of the international community to bring about real change in the countries that are the real human rights abusers, like Zimbabwe.
Let us focus on real human rights problems, not political whim.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is a very important report, which very nearly foundered on account of underhand political games on the part of the Right.
I shall concentrate upon two parts of the report: those relating to Israel/Palestine and to womenâs right to determine their own lives.
Let me first say, regarding the Pakistan debate, that, on this issue too, human rights, and not the economic aspects, must be central.
Legitimising a regime that, through a military coup, has seized power and does not respect human rights should be quite alien to the EU.
Yesterday, those of us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy were able to listen to the Geneva Initiative and representatives from both Israel and Palestine, confirming what is described in, for example, items 46 and 47 of this report but which the group on the Right now wishes to vote away.
Closing oneâs eyes to reality has never led to genuine solutions to problems.
Secondly, a word about reproductive health.
Womenâs rights are human rights.
Women must, of course, have the right to make decisions concerning their own bodies and so have the right to reproductive health.
Proposals 28â40 are important additions to support.
Every minute, a woman dies for reasons connected with childbirth.
Every minute, 100 abortions are carried out, half of them by people with no medical training.
Every year, 70Â 000 women die following unsafe abortions.
In the developing countries, reproductive problems are the most important cause of death and disablement.
In this situation, refusing to support organisations that provide advice on contraception and consciously helping bring about a situation in which hundreds of thousands of women undergo unsafe abortions and die prematurely and in which hundreds of thousands of women are infected with HIV each year constitute a profound violation of human rights and a serious risk to womenâs reproductive health.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the eyes of the surrounding world, the EUâs work on human rights is of very great significance.
Rogue states, which we condemn in our reports, despatch their ambassadors with a view to having references to their countries removed at any price.
Conversely, a resolution by Parliament sometimes gives hope and renewed courage to those throughout the world who are imprisoned, tortured and oppressed or who are engaged in struggle.
Committed people look to the EU to play an active role in working for a better world.
They are sometimes disappointed when we choose to close our eyes to serious crimes because trade policy or strategic interests come before such gross violations.
We must therefore never flinch from emphasising human rights in contacts with countries such as China, Iran, Cuba, Syria, Zimbabwe, etc.
Almost five years ago, I myself wrote a report on the annual report on human rights in which I drew attention to the subject of violence against women.
I think it logical that we continue down this road in the last report of this term of office.
The fact that, in 2004, we are having a debate about sexual violence, genital mutilation, the sex trade, the rape of young girls and the lack of AIDS medication not belonging in a report on human rights shows that we have quite a long way to go in this House too.
I do not agree with MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser regarding all the details of her report, but it is important and only right to highlight these issues.
It is very odd that there should be protests from the right wing about these issues not belonging in a report on human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, many people thought that the end of the cold war meant that we would finally have a world at peace.
Yet exactly the opposite has happened.
There has never been so much violence in the world.
It was in this climate of fear and interrogation that the Bush administration launched its anti-terrorist crusade, the sole aim of which was actually to ensure the economic, and therefore military, supremacy of his empire in a globalised liberal economy.
A new concept has been born, a concept full of tragic consequences, the concept of preventive war.
It is in the name of the fight against the private terrorism of his former agent Bin Laden that Bush is now legalising state terrorism, the first victims of which are the Palestinian or Iraqi people and the first accomplices of which are Sharon, Blair or Aznar.
It is always in the name of the fight against terrorism that a new arsenal of repression is being stockpiled throughout the world, which calls into question fundamental liberties.
What values could we possibly have in common with a government which has organised that camp of the living dead in Guantanamo Bay?
Far from weakening private terrorism, this arsenal actually tends to criminalise any opposition to the establishment of this new order, such as trade-union, associative or anti-globalisation movements.
Unfortunately, the European Union has participated in this undertaking, with a definition of terrorism which is fatal to liberty, by adopting the European arrest warrant or the many laws against immigrants, not to mention those governments which still, in Europe, dare to prohibit abortion.
The campaign to eradicate war and violence cannot be confined to pious hopes, which is something which Parliament has a habit of doing.
We must attack the root of the evil, a social system dominated solely by profit, which transforms people into commodities, a regime which destroys the environment and excludes billions of human beings from employment, from health or education systems, from housing, or even from the basic ability to feed themselves.
Capitalist globalisation generates the globalisation of violence.
Even now, however, we can take practical steps, for example by regularising the situation of illegal immigrants, prohibiting collective deportations on charter flights, insisting that the Council freezes the association agreements with Israel, reorganising the distribution of wealth, in particular by imposing a Tobin tax on movements of capital, or, finally, cancelling third world debt.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, today this House is examining the human rights situation and European policy in relation to third countries.
I have decided to devote my speech to Syria.
I am sure you will be aware of the fact that, in that country, the defenders of human rights and democratic freedoms are suffering constant pressure and harassment.
Several reports by NGOs condemn flagrant violations: people in prison because of their opinions, political exiles, repeated interrogations, interruption of speakers, arrests, torture, and sometimes disappearances.
Aktham NaissÃ©, Chairman of the Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, was arrested on 13 April by the military security forces.
He is being held in detention at a secret location.
He is not allowed to have his medical treatment, despite the fact that his state of health is giving grave cause for concern.
It even seems that he will shortly have to appear before the State Security Court.
Is there any threat to public order or act of terrorism in defending human rights?
Ahmad Khazen and Hassan Watfa were arrested on 15 and 16 March 2004 by the military security forces and sentenced to prison for having taken part in a deputation to the parliament, calling for democratic reforms and the lifting of the state of emergency.
To date, Syrian civil society has still not heard or seen any reaction from the European Commission.
Yet the Commissionâs delegation to Damascus has already witnessed several of these violations.
It is not a matter of interference, but rather of defending universal values for which we have a responsibility.
Allow me to remind you that we are currently in the process of negotiating an association agreement with Syria.
Agreements of this type are based on the rule of law, and Article 2 of such agreements clearly stipulates an undertaking, on the part of both parties, to respect human rights.
In Syria, a state of emergency has been in existence for 41 years, thus enabling martial law to be applied by means of military courts.
This is contrary to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms as guaranteed by international law and the Barcelona Declaration.
Exactly one month ago, on 22 March in Athens, we created the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, of which Syria is a member.
Such a partnership can only be constructed on the basis of certain requirements such as respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.
I should therefore like to ask you to intervene as a matter of urgency with the Syrian authorities, and ask them to guarantee the integrity of the people I have just referred to, to order their immediate and unconditional release, to put an end to the constant pressure and harassment, to respect international law and to comply with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the international instruments which have been ratified by Syria.
Our democracies have ways of exerting pressure.
If we do not use them to ensure that our universal values are respected we shall lose our souls.
There are many of us, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, who are waiting for a response from you, because no indulgence can be allowed when human rights are being violated.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur most warmly for what the report she has presented to us contains, and also for what it does not contain but what will, I hope, be the subject of a positive vote tomorrow, so as to re-establish what makes the vision which MrsÂ De Keyser has tried to bring to the dimension of human rights in the world such an original and specific one.
Like other Members, we Italian radicals actually pay a lot of attention to anything to do with reproductive health, to the whole dimension, this new dimension which our society increasingly has to take into account in the way in which it perceives the issue of human rights, including, for example, the right to health, which now means the new technologies, genetic research, and all kinds of possibilities which are now available to mankind but which are still a problem, a stumbling block, in many of our societies.
We shall therefore be voting in favour of all amendments along these lines tomorrow, in the hope of enhancing Mrs De Keyserâs report.
Having said that, I should like, in the context of this debate, to launch an appeal to Members, to our rapporteur, and to the coordinators of the various groups, in the hope that my message will be heard.
After the vote in committee had taken place, a dreadful massacre took place, and appalling violence was used against the indigenous mountain people of Vietnam.
These people form an aboriginal population, the oldest in Vietnam, which is suffering oppression at the hands of the regime in Hanoi.
That oppression became manifest, a few days ago, in the brutal police action taken in order to disperse demonstrators, as also happened in another country, as we have just heard.
Dozens of people were no doubt killed, and many others arrested and imprisoned.
We have no news of them.
I know that time has run out, but since we talk about indigenous peoples in this report, I should like, tomorrow, with the agreement of my fellow Members, to table an oral amendment with a view to inserting the briefest reference to the mountain people of Vietnam, so as to remind the authorities in Hanoi that the European Parliament has taken their situation to heart.
Mr Patten has often taken action on this matter, and some European countries have intervened too.
I believe that it would be to our credit to mention, when we vote tomorrow, the oppression being suffered by the mountain people of Vietnam.
Â Â  Mr President, However, there is a worrying undercurrent in the way human rights and terrorism have been addressed.
While I share some of the sentiments that have been expressed by my colleague Mr Van Orden, I am also worried from another point of view.
Centralised government, whether national or international, is very quick to take powers and set up mechanisms that help them in the fight against terror but which certainly erode the established rights and liberties of the citizen.
There is therefore a supreme irony that the counter-terrorism policies, which we all support, may do as much to restrict our freedoms as the terrorists do themselves.
Mr President, unless there is an electoral miracle in June, or a mass self-sacrificing resignation among my colleagues, this is the last occasion on which I shall have the pleasure to address this distinguished and honourable House.
May I, with your indulgence President, take this opportunity to put on record my sincerest thanks to the Members of this House, the staff here and in Brussels, and above all my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation for the generosity, kindness, help, sympathy and often-needed support that all have given me over the past five years.
It would be a lie if I said I was happy with my lowly position on my party's list in the South West region of Great Britain, but it would not be a lie to say that I have enjoyed these five years, perhaps more than I can say.
So Mr President, thank you and farewell.
Â Â  My Lord, I came close to joining in the applause, which I am not permitted to do.
Many thanks for this very personal farewell to this House; perhaps you will come back after all.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I had prepared a speech, which I decided to put aside after listening to the comments made by some Members from the Right.
I believe that as long as criticism is bandied around in this House â as if we were putting Galileo on trial â every time that we deal with the issue of womenâs rights, and as long as we use the word âobsessionâ when talking about rights, our debates will do no more than give work to the stenographers.
We would have expected greater severity and more passion from some right-wing Members when, for example, denouncing the legal gap that exists â which runs counter to all the rules of international law â on the status of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners.
We would have expected passion and severity in denouncing the arbitrary use that is, unfortunately, often made of the fight against terrorism to repress dissidents.
MrÂ President, we believe that the defence of rights should be sought and guaranteed, above all, in everyday life in order to stop the rights of the just becoming the rights of the few, and we really feel that such silence on this issue is obsessive.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that Mrs De Keyserâs report is very uneven.
There are some chapters which are interesting and which open up new prospects, in particular regarding reproductive health and the rights of disabled persons.
However, with regard to the central issue, to which Mrs De Keyser had wanted, in a way, to give preference, I think that she has dealt with it rather poorly.
I am talking about the issue of the relationship between human rights and the war on terrorism and, to be more specific, the challenge which the war on terrorism poses to democracy.
In the twentieth century, democracies were faced with the challenge of war.
Could we go to war and still remain democracies?
It was necessary to find solutions that struck a balance between the ideal and the constraints of reality.
Now we have to demonstrate our creative abilities again in trying to strike a balance on current issues.
We cannot place the rights of terrorists and the rights of the victims of terrorism on an equal footing.
We cannot allow the war on terrorism to take second place to the war on those who are combating terrorism.
Yet this, particularly with regard to the Middle East, is the unpleasant feeling produced by Mrs De Keyser, in seeking to put everything on an equal footing, whereas what we have to do is to invent a right of legitimate democratic defence against terrorism.
This is the central issue, and unfortunately she has failed to address it, a fact which I find regrettable.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to follow up on the excellent speech by Mr Van Orden and the very interesting point made by the Earl of Stockton in his valedictory speech just now.
At its meeting last week, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights failed to publicly criticise Russia and China for their human rights abuses.
It rejected resolutions on Chechnya, China and Zimbabwe, but adopted measures on North Korea, Cuba, Belarus and Turkmenistan.
This showed that powerful countries can still get away with murder, torture and the silencing of critics just days before news emerged about the discovery in Chechnya of the bodies of nine men who had been extra-judicially executed.
Torture and arbitrary detention remain rampant in Chechnya despite Russian Government claims that the situation is normalising.
The United States has sponsored a mildly-worded resolution on China that encourages the Chinese Government to make substantive progress in systematic reforms to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
However, China was victorious in a procedural initiative at the UN with a no-action motion to prevent the resolution from coming to a vote.
Over the last ten years, about 8 900 Chinese Christians have been arrested and detained, and religious activity that is not state-controlled is illegal.
China is increasingly branding harmless religious groups as dangerous cults.
In Zimbabwe, there is a chronic situation of human rights abuses, yet the United Nations is not taking any action.
It simply cannot be that countries with poor human rights records use a no-action motion to block discussion of their own human rights practices.
The UN Commission's purpose is to publicly air the human rights situation in any country, especially in the case of egregious violators.
It is time to put an end to the misuse of procedural mechanisms to keep violations off the table.
If the UN continues to be a puppet, we should cease funding its human rights activities.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this report, which is wonderfully comprehensive.
The sad thing is that we have to have it at all.
If only we lived in a world where we did not perpetually have to stand up and condemn the human rights abuses that occur throughout the world.
Let me mention what is happening in Zanzibar, with its criminalisation and arrests of homosexuals, and where the EU has a mechanism through which it can act - the Cotonou Agreement - but does not seem to have the political will to do so.
Similarly, when there have been breakdowns of the human rights clauses in our EU Association agreements and we have called for action, those calls have been ignored.
Let me also mention Egypt, where there is continuing arrest, entrapment and imprisonment of homosexuals.
I praise the Irish Presidency for its work at the UN in supporting the Brazilian motion on human rights and sexual orientation.
Sadly, this motion has once again been suspended, due primarily to lobbying by Egypt and Pakistan, the Vatican and the Conference of Islamic States.
We are talking here about human beings, about the destruction of individual freedom, individual hope and individual lives.
The dignity of any society is based on respect for the dignity of those individuals.
Finally, this report sends out a powerful message that what happens in another part of the world is as important to this House and the Member States as if it were happening in Europe.
Human rights abuses against another individual are human rights abuses against us all.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like to say thank you for an excellent report.
A free, independent and diverse mass media is a fundamental right.
That is even more important in the information society, in which information is the major factor in production.
It is good to remind ourselves of the situation in China, but we have problems right here amongst ourselves.
Information is a major industry that guides governments and nations.
It helps to fill the human consciousness, which could not contain anything more important.
The uncontrolled political influence that the big proprietors of the media have is something that is familiar to us all.
Italy now has nothing less than a system of perpetual motion: a huge economic power has bought the power of the media, which in turn legitimises political power.
There is also a new danger here.
Big companies in France are buying up the media to protect themselves, with the result that they are outside the scope of criticism.
Why do we not intervene in this, the way we do with regard to human rights violations?
This after all is a violation of the right to access to information, which is a fundamental right in the human information society.
Â Â  . Mr President, once again I thank the Members for their contributions.
To sum up, this debate underlines the value of our focus on enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and Council in the area of human rights.
It also illustrates once again just how broad this canvas is, and just how extraordinarily diverse the focal points have to be in terms of human rights and human rights defenders.
The contributions covered a remarkably wide range of topics and this is obviously an area where Members have not only a particular interest, but also very considerable expertise.
I hope that those people who criticise this Parliament will read today's proceedings and just for once come to the conclusion that this is a House worthy of their support.
I know the presidency and the Council will benefit greatly from exchanges that we have had here.
The work of the Commission on Human Rights is continuing in Geneva as we speak.
I mentioned earlier some of the resolutions that we have adopted in relation to the human rights situations in Belarus, Turkmenistan, North Korea and the Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Arab Territories.
Work on other resolutions goes on but we can be proud of the role the European Union is playing via the Commission and of the work of the Commission to date.
I have some good news for the House, which I will keep for the end.
Members are obviously very concerned at the human rights aspects of the progress of the war on terror.
Ms De Keyserâs report reflects these concerns and I want to assure the House that they have been noted by the Council.
I also want to thank Mr Crowley, who recently said at an interparliamentary meeting with US Congress that, in our actions against terrorists, we must be bound by the rules that terrorists flout.
That was a very valuable point made by a Member of this House and is a view shared by the Council â i.e. that respect for human rights must underpin our whole approach in the war on terror and it must underpin the whole approach of our allies in the war on terror.
Human rights are not divisible.
Human rights cannot be set aside for the convenience of the moment.
I believe it was President Chirac who said that it is in this way we uncover and analyse the roots of terror in order to sever them.
We must be conscious of all the issues touched on in this report.
I was very touched by Lord Stockton's farewell speech.
I wish him well.
Indeed, yesterday and today a number of speakers touched on the point that this was their valedictory part-session.
I wish them all well.
It is always a sad moment in the life of a politician when you see a parliamentarian moving on.
Mr Deva made a very interesting observation highlighting the serious problems that exist in the intergovernmental nature of the UN Human Rights Commission.
Those of us who are UN defenders - which means most Members of this House and certainly myself - may rightly praise the UN for the role it plays, but should also ponder the point that he made.
Mr Dell'Alba raised the issue of the Montagnards, the mountain people of Vietnam.
I want to assure him and the House that the situation of these people is an active concern of the Council and will remain part of the Union's dialogue with the government of Vietnam.
The representatives of the Union in Hanoi have received guidance in this connection.
I want to finish on a positive note.
I received some good news as I was making my contribution earlier, and am very pleased to be able to share this good news with the House.
Earlier today, the Commission on Human Rights adopted the European Union's resolution on the death penalty by 28 votes to 20, with 5 abstentions.
I would point out to the House that this is the best ever margin of victory in the history of this EU initiative.
That margin of victory is an indication of the effectiveness of the Union's policy of opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances.
It is also a sign of the growing trend towards the international abolition of the death penalty.
It also underlines the point I made earlier that if the Union sometimes has to come from the back of the field on issues of concern to it, then we should perhaps learn to box a little more clever and to be a little more strategic.
However, this is good news and I am pleased to share it with the House.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0279/2004) by Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 975/1999 laying down the requirements for the implementation of development cooperation operations which contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms (COM(2003) 639 â C5-0507/2003 â 2003/0250(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity to tell Parliament why the rather technical Commission proposal to which you will be giving a first reading today is so important.
The regulation which you are being asked to extend by two years, until the end of the present financial perspective in 2006, is one of the two legal bases for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
As you are well aware, the initiative is an extremely important element of the European Unionâs overall policy on promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries.
In 1999, the European Parliament itself was fully involved in drawing up the regulations underlying the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, moulding the objectives of the initiative and setting its priorities, as well as shaping the administrative procedures for its implementation.
I am very pleased to see now that the honourable Member's report fully supports the Commission in securing an extension of the initiative beyond the end of this year, subject to some amendments.
In the run-up to todayâs plenary and decision-making, the Commission proposal has triggered fruitful exchanges between a number of Members of this House and Commissioner Patten and/or Commission services.
These exchanges have focused essentially on two important issues: firstly, how to more effectively involve the European Parliament in political priority setting for implementation of the initiative and, secondly, how to further improve the performance and practical relevance of the initiative with a view to democracy building and strengthening human rights in the world.
We have welcomed these exchanges, as we welcome todayâs debate.
The Commission, like Parliament, has every interest in supporting proposals designed to make the initiative ever more effective and relevant.
As was stated at the February part-session, we have an open mind on the ideas that Members of Parliament put forward.
However, this does not allow us to disregard certain constraints imposed by respective institutional prerogatives, nor must we lose sight of the key objective of the Commission proposal before you today, which is to secure the continued operational availability of the initiative for the next two years.
The Commission has listened carefully to the views expressed by honourable Members and is ready to examine in a constructive spirit all ideas that have been put to it in order to ensure that what we do, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, is better focused and more effective.
More specifically, I would like to state that the Commission is committed to setting up a structured and regular dialogue on the initiative with the competent committees of the European Parliament, led by the responsible Commissioner and supported by his or her own services.
This will enable us to exchange views in good time on planned multiannual programming documents, annual programming updates and work programmes, or amendments to them.
It would, I hope, give Parliament ample opportunity to provide comments and input into the Commissionâs thinking.
It would also, crucially, be compatible with comitology rules and institutional prerogatives.
Moreover, the Commission will examine with an open mind the suggestion, contained in the report's explanatory statement, to create specific mechanisms to allow greater involvement of civil society and NGOs with a view to the promotion of democracy and human rights.
In this respect, I would simply remind you, however, that this suggestion has to be seen in the context of the Commissionâs recent proposal on the future financial perspective, which envisages a simplified architecture for the Communityâs external assistance and which therefore will also have significant implications for the future operation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
In conclusion, let me reiterate the Commissionâs appreciation of the constructive spirit shown by this House and its support for continued effective operation of the initiative beyond the end of this year.
Your positive vote on Mr Fernandez Martinâs report at first reading today should pave the way for an agreement with the Council, thus dispensing with a second reading and allowing the timely extension of the initiativeâs legal basis.
Given the political importance we all attach to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, this is a welcome outcome in everyoneâs interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate on the regulation amending certain aspects for the implementation of Community development cooperation operations which contribute to consolidating democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights has served to test, over recent months, the extent of our capacities and also to demonstrate certain defects in our procedures.
This is certainly a modest instrument in financial terms, but one which is very important in terms of its content and objectives, and highly valued by everybody, and particularly by the European Parliament.
I would point out that one of the budgetary lines funding these programmes was created on our initiative in 1994.
As Commissioner Nielson has just told us, we are talking about a proposed regulatory modification which, in the Commission's opinion, according to what the Commission services have told us, affects purely technical aspects - he did not mention this specifically â and comes closer to what Parliament believes has always had an unquestionably political content, if only because the intention is to extend by two years the duration and the operational capacity of an instrument which according to all the reports and opinions received, and which are mentioned by the Council's communication, is of very great interest.
Nevertheless, Parliament considers that, as proposed in the Council's draft, the participation of our institution in the different stages of the procedure does not meet our aspirations, particularly in an area which is subject to co-decision.
From the beginning, more than six months ago now, we have spent a great deal of time debating formal and procedural issues but, fortunately, as Commissioner Nielson has said, today I believe I can perhaps confirm that we will make it at the last minute, but on time, so that this Community initiative will not be interrupted or paralysed for some time as a result of the changes that will take place in Parliament and the Commission over the coming months.
Before dealing with certain technical comments on our proposal, I must point out, Mr President, that there is a technical corrigendum which the services of Parliament must be aware of at this point, which changes the order of the amendments we are proposing and which we will vote on tomorrow.
In the report I have proposed and which is supported by the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in agreement with the Council, we propose an amendment to Article 4(1) by means of which we introduce into the legislative text that âin cases of EU electoral observation missions and procedures, natural persons can receive financial support within the meaning of the present Regulationâ.
The experience of all of us who have participated in missions of electoral observers tells us that, despite all the restrictions we might wish to mention, the presence of international observers in elections increases trust in transparency and strict compliance with democratic principles in developing countries.
Parliament does not wish to give up its participation in the programming phase, in establishing priorities and in implementing initiatives.
In the explanatory statement we have included this desire on the part of Parliament in case, as a result of the current legislative framework, as Commissioner Nielson has mentioned, this is not possible at the moment.
We hope that the commitment adopted by Mr Nielson on behalf of the Commission can be confirmed in the future.
In my view, Amendment No 3, which appears in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, should be withdrawn by its rapporteur.
Otherwise, I recommend voting against that amendment.
This is the best agreement possible if our intention is to approve this report at first reading, as the Council, the Commission and Parliament wish, in order to respond to a widely shared demand.
Furthermore, it is particularly necessary for the strengthening of civil society in developing countries.
However, this does not mean, and should not be understood to mean, that Parliament is satisfied.
It is a co-decision procedure, an issue that affects human rights and fundamental freedoms, which this House has been very sensitive to for many years.
Parliament believes that when it is a question of establishing a new programme and not just an extension for the next two years, as in the case we are debating today, we will demand a greater presence and more active participation within the framework of the rules regulating the Unionâs institutional dialogue, on which those who succeed us here in the next legislature will have to establish a new framework which provides an equal basis so that this desire on the part of Parliament is fulfilled.
Â Â  Mr President, the bad news for the Commission and Council is that I expect to be back in the next Parliament and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the regulation covering third countries.
It is quite clear that the Committee on Development and Cooperation is content with the operations under the European initiative for democracy and human rights and it is understandable that two-thirds of the money should now be released for next year.
I am sure Mr Nielson is pleased about that.
On the other hand, the Foreign Affairs Committee, which actually began this programme some twelve years ago - it was 1992 not 1994 and I was the original rapporteur - is not content.
Its members have agreed that we should withdraw my report, which should have been debated today, to allow us time to put more pressure on the Commission and Council over the coming weeks to agree to two very simple requests.
The first request is that an advisory committee should be set up â outside comitology, composed of representatives of Parliament and the Commission and probably chaired by the High Representative â to deal with this fundamentally sensitive programme, which should not necessarily involve the developing countries but rather the countries nearer to us - the 'new neighbourhood' as it is now described.
The second request is that an independent study be conducted, and I await a serious offer from the Commission on this, not just 'we have an open mind'.
The Commission does not have an open mind.
It wants to keep the entire programme to itself.
However, there is a better way of delivery, as is shown by the Americans, the Danes, the Germans, the Dutch, the Swedish and the British, and that is to have a separate foundation that is reliable, flexible and expert to assist the Commission in the delivery of the programme.
That is our position and we look forward to some proper reaction from the Commission and Council to these suggestions in due course.
The Commissioner said that this result was welcome and in everybody's interest.
Is he talking about the hundreds of millions of people who live in the new neighbourhood, from Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, through the Caucuses and down through the arc of instability across North Africa to Morocco, into the Arab world?
Two hundred and eighty million Arabs live without democracy.
Is he proud of that?
I now have to address my remarks to the Press because we have an election coming up and in today's I write that 'Europe's power risks being so soft that it can hardly be felt by the people to whom it is addressed'.
Unfortunately, this welcome programme, brilliantly implemented in the former-Soviet bloc, is totally ineffective in today's world.
It is the Commission's responsibility to make it effective and I intend to press very hard to ensure that it does.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we must welcome MrÂ FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­nâs report and be glad that responsibility for the report was finally given to the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
The majority of the countries to which the regulation applies are in reality developing countries.
We have worked hard to achieve a compromise in the committee that could be accepted by the Council and the Commission, as well as by Parliament.
We understand the importance of getting this report through at first reading.
We therefore support the rapporteurâs request to vote against the third amendment by the Committee on Budgets, which is unacceptable to the Council.
Nonetheless, we have made some demands of the Commission to ensure that Parliament is able to follow the work on the regulation more effectively.
By asking the Commission to produce an annual report setting out programming for the coming year by region and by sector, we wish considerably to increase the transparency of the work on the regulation.
Moreover, reporting back to Parliament will mean our better understanding where implementation is most effective.
We are pleased that the Commission has accepted some of our most important changes.
It is important that the decisions taken on a human rights basis reflect the EUâs commitments to support democracy, international law and, naturally, respect for human rights.
The additional proposals initially tabled were aimed at ensuring that our decisions on human rights were based upon our own anxiety concerning the security of the European Union.
That would have been a tragic mistake.
We do need to protect ourselves, especially against terrorist threats, but the present trend espoused even by a number of senior figures in the EU, whereby aid should be tailored in such a way as to meet our security needs, is a very dangerous road to go down and a principle that should not be established.
We must protect human dignity when it comes to our measures concerning human rights, cooperation and the development of aid and ensure that the primary focus of these measures is always the consolidation of democracy, international law and human rights and the eradication of poverty.
Finally, this is the last time that I too am speaking in this House.
I shall be leaving it after ten years, and I wish to thank you for your very constructive cooperation.
Â Â  We are very grateful to Mrs Theorin for the extraordinary work she has done over these years.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the programme on democracy and the development of democracy in third countries is a programme of few resources â we are not talking about large investments in terms of the Community budget â but one that is very important in terms of content, because it is the only instrument that we have to implement a policy to develop human rights, to help women, to support democracy and to monitor elections, without necessarily going viabilateral relations with governments.
Since it is, therefore, the only instrument of this type that we have, we must ensure that it is efficient and we cannot always check the efficiency of our measures.
This is why I think that it is right that, whilst respecting the various prerogatives of the Commission and Parliament itself â because we are not the ones in charge â Parliament should have greater involvement, both in the planning phase for measures, and in the phase where the results are assessed.
Above all, the question is whether the instruments to implement this programme are as flexible as the situation requires because, clearly, the situation is not rigid and bureaucratic as our rules are at times.
This is why the amendments that we have tabled to this regulation are important and, above all, the discussion that we will be able to develop with the Commission will be important.
Commissioner Patten has written a letter to us about the other regulation, for which no codecision procedure is planned, in which he proposes involving Parliament much more in the new approach to revising these regulations from 2006 onwards.
I therefore believe that our amendments are just the beginning of a deeper involvement, which will reach its optimum level in 2006 or, at least, will result in more precise and effective measures than those we manage to implement today using this instrument.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr McMillan-Scott put a very clear and direct - but strange - question to me.
He asked whether I am happy that millions of people are living in countries without democracy or adequate human rights.
Such a clear question deserves a clear answer.
I hope the honourable Member will not be shocked by its bluntness, but the answer is 'No, I am not happy with that'.
The Commission supports the rapporteur's proposal to withdraw Amendment 3 from the Committee on Budgetary Control on the applicable comitology procedure.
The intention contained in this amendment, to provide for an advisory committee instead of today's regulatory committee, is unacceptable to the Council.
This is well-known.
Thus, maintaining the amendment would scupper our joint efforts and the objective of facilitating a first reading agreement under the codecision procedure.
The Commission proposed that a management committee is the appropriate form of committee and constitutes a fair compromise.
It is extremely important that we are now able to secure a continuation of this work.
I agree with Mrs Napoletano that our actions are not always effective.
One reason is that we are not effective ourselves.
Another is that in an area such as this it is very difficult to produce effective so-called solutions.
However, we have to try.
We do not do this because we know it works but because it is necessary.
That is the nature of this kind of activity.
This initiative has been important in practice and for sending a signal showing how we think in Europe about what we want to do in the world.
I thank Parliament for the constructive spirit in which it has been handled.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0148/2004) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ event for the years 2005 to 2019 (COM(2003) 700 â C5-0548/2003 â 2003/0274(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, we are going to begin with what I consider to be the soul of Europe, the most positive thing in Europe, which shows our citizens that they do exist, and which gives them a forum where they can express themselves in all their diversity.
I believe that the European Cities of Culture, now to be called European Capitals of Culture, have in that sense, over the years, assumed great importance in the European cultural landscape.
They are a shared cultural space.
They show our diversities at their best.
Of course, the formula has developed over time: the scheme was launched in 1985 on the initiative of Melina Mercouri, and cities were originally designated by means of an inter-governmental process.
We have come a long way since then, and the event has become a Community action following the 1999 decision.
The process is still developing, and it will go on developing.
What we shall be looking at and deciding on today will be one stage in that development.
Why will it be only one stage?
It will be one stage because we are on the eve of a historic event which will change the destiny of the European Union.
I am talking, of course, about enlargement, which ought to be taken into account when we are considering European Capitals of Culture, hence the Commission proposal which we are debating today.
The purpose of this proposal is to allow the rapid integration of the new Member States into the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ initiative.
That does not mean that we do not have to think quickly about other changes which might prove necessary.
Moreover, we are all in agreement on the fact that radical changes will have to be made to the current decision, and in any case we are already working on that.
A study is in progress involving the European Capitals of Culture for the years 1995 to 2004.
The results of that study, which will become known in the second half of 2004, will form the basis of our reflections and later, I presume, of the action we take to develop new rules.
However, today we cannot make the new Member States wait any longer. They must be able to participate, like the others, in this action, which is so much appreciated.
We must therefore give them the welcome that is their due.
They have already made great efforts in order to obtain entry into the present Union.
They cannot be kept out of the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ event.
The integration of the new Member States is already a priority, and it needs to be done very quickly.
That is why the Commission wishes to separate the stage involving the integration of the new Member States from the debate on the need to remodel the whole procedure.
The Commission therefore proposes, at this stage, simply to add the new Member States, by 2009, to the list drawn up by the decision, alongside the current Member States already designated, in alphabetical order.
That order had already been decided, moreover, by a joint agreement between the Council and Parliament in 1999, and it is on that basis that the cities in question are currently preparing for the years to come.
Thus from 2009 onwards, two capitals will be designated each year, one for the current Member States and a second one for the new Member States.
I can well understand Parliamentâs desire to see the procedure improved.
However, the way we are proceeding now is the only one which enables us to put the new Member States on an equal footing with the current Member States as far as the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ scheme is concerned.
We need to be aware that, if we omit this stage, and start straight away on a remodelling of the procedure, the new Member States will not be able to participate in the scheme until, at best, 2010 or 2011, or perhaps 2012, because it takes four years to prepare for the event, and the designations for 2008 will be made this year.
Moreover, it will be for the new Parliament to decide on how to reform the procedure, because that procedure will in future involve twenty-five Member States.
What is our position on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament?
The European Parliamentâs Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has preserved the purpose of the Commissionâs proposal.
However, it has expressed a wish to see, with effect from 2009, each Member State concerned, i.e. two per year, putting forward at least two cities as candidates for the title.
This is equivalent to a substantial amendment to the designation procedure and is therefore a change to the Commissionâs proposal.
That is why I cannot accept such a change from the point of view of the two-stage revision.
Such an amendment actually belongs in the second phase, at which point we shall have the specific data necessary to complete the remodelling of that decision, in other words it will come later.
In addition, the Commission feels obliged to reject Amendment No 2 by Parliamentâs committee and, as a result, Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 as well, since they are the result of Amendment No 2.
On the other hand, Amendment No 1, which is concerned with adjusting the budget in the light of the fact that there will be at least two âCapitalsâ per year, is acceptable.
In fact we shall have to take into account this doubling of the number of cities involved when we come to evaluate any proposal for a programme to carry on from Culture 2000 with effect from 2007 onwards.
Provision has, in fact, been made for funding in the context of that programme and not by virtue of the 1999 decision.
Nor is the Commission able to accept Amendments NosÂ 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 tabled on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
These amendments would also make very radical changes to the designation procedure, a debate which will have to take place later.
There, ladies and gentlemen, you have what seems to me today to be a position that makes sense.
I know that it was not easy to reach, because we would all like something better, including your Commissioner.
In politics, however, one must be realistic, and if we want to make progress sometimes we have to move forward in small steps in order, finally, to achieve our objective.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has the honour to submit for debate, and then to a vote here in this House, a report about which there has been much discussion.
It brings to a temporary conclusion an adventure which has been somewhat unhappy.
It is a report on which your rapporteur is in the minority, so all I can do is to tell you its history.
This is the first time, in the two and a half years during which I have been fortunate enough to work with Mrs Reding, that I find myself in disagreement with her â friendly disagreement, but very clear disagreement nevertheless.
She is well aware of this.
She has even alluded to it briefly.
The idea that every year one city in Europe should be the European Capital of Culture is an idea that originated with Melina Mercouri in 1985.
At first, Mr President, that idea had a brilliant future, at a time when fierce competition brought together a number of candidate cities in a contest to win a single designation, and when a jury of experts gave its verdict on the real European interests of each of the plans of the candidate cities.
In 1999, the unfortunate Decision 1419 was proposed by the Council, supported by the Commission and approved by Parliament, and it governs, until 2019, as Mrs Reding has just reminded us, the list of Member States which, at the rate of just one per year, are responsible for proposing the European Capital of Culture.
First of all, that decision takes no account of the fact that, even at the time, there was a prospect of the possible accession of at least ten new Member States, and the fact that it did not do so is unacceptable.
Secondly, it left itself open to criticism, if not scandal, in both legal and political terms, since it practically prohibits the European Parliament in the next two legislative periods, i.e. those beginning in 1999 and 2004, from exercising, for five years, its powers to contribute towards the annual choice of the European Capital of Culture.
Finally â and this is at least as serious â although some Member States have submitted to the European institutions and the jury a list of two or three cities, thereby enabling a real choice to be made between them on the basis of the dynamism, innovation and European dimension of the projects, not all have done so.
Member Statesâ recent choices have often related to a single city, chosen for reasons concerned with the local-election policies of the government currently in power, and without the city in question having shown any real interest in assuming this role.
This amounts to forced labour, all the more so since assistance from the European budget for these activities represents less than 5% of the expenditure that they involve.
What we need to do, Mr President, is to start again from scratch.
At the beginning of this debate, several months ago, my committee agreed unanimously with that.
MrsÂ Reding was aware of it too, and she knows it is true as well as I do, even though she has just told us again that this will be something for a second stage, in the autumn.
The evidence shows that we need to revise the list and change the order after 2008, because it possible, Commissioner, contrary to what you have just said, to integrate new Member States, provided that those Member States already designated for the years after 2009 would agree to a little delay.
It was perfectly possible and it was very simple because, Mr President, it is essential to realise that a city needs five years in order to prepare itself.
Obviously, therefore, it would be necessary to revise the list, change the order after 2008, reintroduce competition between cities and reinstate the importance of the role of the jury which, when there is only one âCapitalâ, obviously has no role at all and is no use for anything any more.
It has, moreover, said as much, in writing, with delightful diplomatic acidity.
However, the Council was watching and the Commission did not dare to confront it.
Therefore you now have a proposal for a decision which I would describe as astounding and which consists of deciding that, with effect from 2009 and up to 2019, there will be two European Capitals of Culture per year â one in a current Member State and one in a new Member State â and it will still be the Member States who will designate the candidate cities, without their being under any obligation to submit alternative choices to the European institutions.
Mrs Reding will even refuse an amendment by the PPE-DE Group, despite the fact that it was pushing in that direction.
To choose two European Capitals of Culture a year at a time when the procedure is almost stifled is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.
We shall simply make the dilution and obsolescence even worse.
The jury still has no significance and the next two Parliaments are not allowed to participate in the selection process.
The Commissionâs promise to submit to us, in autumn, a new draft decision amending this system, is merely a decoy.
If we adopt this draft now, Commissioner, I do not see how, in autumn, we can go back on the date of 2019, the order in which Member States are listed and, above all, the fact that two capitals a year will be designated, leaving that task to the two Member States in question.
I believe, moreover, that you will not be able to get the directive you have announced adopted, because you have become tangled up in the main substance of the problem.
That is my prediction.
However, the Council is watching and it has been using intimidation.
The three Member States involved in the crucial period of 2009 to 2011, which are Austria, Germany and Finland, have been afraid that their designation will be called into question, though no one was actually thinking of this.
The PPE Group has been taken in hand.
We are faced with a decision which serves the prestige interests of our Member States, but surely not those of Europe, which would have been to revitalise and give back the sparkle to what was an excellent procedure.
Anxious to keep the peace amongst us, and my personal friendship with Mrs Reding, I had proposed, and the Socialist Group had agreed with me, to accept our defeat at the committee stage and to decide not to put forward our amendments at the plenary session.
After all, my mother brought me up properly and I am still a polite boy.
However, our Green friends took up these amendments again, as is their right.
You are therefore faced with two sets of amendments which are entirely incompatible.
First of all there are the amendments of Socialist origin, though now supported by the Greens.
These amendments are aimed at going back to the old system and to committing ourselves for the future only as far as 2010, reserving the right of the next Parliament to ask the Commission to propose, in autumn, a new list of Member States including the new ones, and to order those who can to organise a broad competition between cities, so that after some candidates have been eliminated the final decision is left to the jury of experts, which needs to be given that role if it is to be of any use, and to the European institutions.
The other set of amendments, which comes mainly from the PPE Group, validates and sets out in detail the Commissionâs proposal which, in my opinion, makes any decision this coming autumn completely pointless.
This set of amendments, however, requires that those Member States which are able to should propose several cities â and, Mrs Pack, you have just heard that there will be no question of this, because Mrs Reding will be obliged, by the constraints under which she is suffering, to deny you this.
This set of amendments claims to encourage competition between cities but it does not explain how, because it does not deal with the problem of the numerous smaller Member States which have only one important city, which would call for a revision of the list of Member States, which is something which will have to be done in the autumn.
This opening up of the competition, however, has now been refused.
There you have it, Mr President: Members will vote according to their conscience.
Once again, I would like to say that the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, is not as much to blame as the Council of Ministers, which is stifling the emergence of any truly European spirit and imposing a system whereby Member States set out their stalls displaying their national heritage and talents, while at the same time resolutely denying the authority of this Parliament.
Faced with this situation, I have a feeling of relative sadness, but of course I am speaking as the defeated party.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would have been quite happy to applaud Mr Rocard had it not been for the unfortunate fact that not everything he said was in line with what I am going to say.
That is why I could not give him the applause I would have liked to give.
The fact is that I cannot act without thinking; I have to be guided by the facts.
The Capital of Culture that we are discussing today is something like a beacon of light in the small amount of cultural policy that we are allowed to deal with, so I am happy that we are carrying the torch onwards.
The idea has been around for a long time now; it originated with a Greek lady Member of this House, and I think we can take pride in it.
I also agree with Mr Rocardâs demand that the choice should be of at least two cities.
It was after all we who introduced this idea, and I think, Commissioner, that it can be put into practice right now.
In this Capital of Culture, European diversity ought to be much more visible than it has been up to now, and so I do not think that these amendments run counter to what the Commissioner wants to do.
I therefore ask her to consider whether she cannot perhaps incorporate this.
Secondly, I have to reiterate how much we all regret the Council of Ministersâ decision, none more than I, as I, back in 1999, was furiously angry about the Council of Ministersâ decision, seeing it as short-sighted and guided by national considerations.
At the time, the Council of Ministers knew as well as we did that the European Union was going to be enlarged, and it showed that it did not give a damn about it, by naming only Western European cities right up to 2019.
That is to the Councilâs shame and not to our own, for we were bound by their decision.
The decision has been made, though, and, as they say where I come from, !
That is why we cannot change the fact that, up to 2019, the countries in question will also be entitled to propose cities.
That is why, for the benefit of my German audience, I would like to say that Germany will be able to propose a city for 2010.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, though, endorse the Commissionerâs proposal for two Capitals of Culture, simply because the 10 new Member States cannot do anything about the shameless conduct of the old 15.
It is now for the Commissioner to remedy that; she can do so by giving two cities the opportunity to present themselves to the world, and I do not believe it is so terrible that we should be doing this, if, for example, in 2010, we have one city from Germany and another from Hungary.
I do not see that as such a bad idea.
The two countries have marvellous things in common and the rivalries between them have been productive.
Let me say one thing more: we may be 25 countries strong today, but there will be even more by 2019 â Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, not to mention the others.
If we are allowed to name only one Capital of Culture, that means that each country would have a turn only once in a generation, and we cannot expect the public to put up with that.
It is for that reason that I, like my group, support the Commissionerâs proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Reding, thanks are due to Melina Mercouri for coming up with the idea of a European Capital of Culture, since being the European Capital of Culture is a challenge to reflect contemporary artistic creativity; it promotes discussion and enables people to make their minds up; it promotes awareness of the values of our cultural heritage and leaves behind visible signs, such as, for example, the in Graz, which was last yearâs Capital of Culture, a building which, even though it is also very important that such signs should also reflect modern architecture, has been the subject of much debate.
I agree with my fellow-Members and with those who have spoken before me that the decision taken in 1999 was quite simply wrong.
However much it took lead times, procedures for withdrawal, and so on, into consideration, this decision went too far.
What was mistaken about it was not only its failure to take the future new Member States into account, but also the fact that it completely bypasses future Parliaments.
Competition is necessary and rules are required if the expert jury is to be given an area of activity and a definite mandate, neither of which it has, unfortunately, had to date.
If that is not done, the European Capital of Culture â at present a hallmark for cultural diversity and quality â will depreciate in value.
If we are in future to have two Capitals of Culture, that surely must not mean that, when giving them a financial basis, we split the existing grants in two, but rather that we double them.
Anything else would make no sense at all.
So I would urge that we do something about the financial basis, for two Capitals of Culture â if they are to put on a good programme â will need a great deal of support, quite apart from the enormous effort required of them and the amounts of money they themselves have to find.
Â Â  Mr President, I really want to support the proposals of the rapporteur and Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard.
There is no need to go into the appalling nature of the decision in 1999, which established selection entirely leaving out the ten countries that are joining us in less than a month.
The solution proposed by the Commission, which aimed to split the procedure in two, would mean that for much too long a period â until 2019Â â there would be two colleges, which is quite the opposite to integration.
Integration does not mean continuing with two colleges within the Union and its selection and decision-making processes made up of old and new Member States.
I think that this goes entirely against the desired objective, which we say is for them to become members.
Therefore, and also for other reasons, I think it is wise to stop this in 2010.
The other reasons are linked to the evaluation that is taking place, which you mentioned, Commissioner.
I think that the deviations that have been highlighted by Mr Rocard, which are linked to decisions that are far too motivated by self-interest, exploitative and for reasons of prestige or even less attractive reasons, even political reasons, have reduced the European quality of these events and that is what we need to discuss.
This is the quality that the new selection process, which we say we want, needs to reaffirm, definitely through competition, also taking into account the events that are taking place at the moment, such as Lille 2004.
The event is on the one hand very attractive and factual, with very interesting things to see, but at the same time there is a great frustration among those involved.
Artists and those involved in culture are quick to point out that this event, which is mainly focused around factual matters, could devalue their work as artists, break down the relationship that there normally is with the public and result in fierce competition between cultural structures.
These collective comments from a network of cultural players and artists in a city or region where the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ project is taking place, in Lille, should attract the attention and interest of the evaluation that is underway and encourage care.
We should await the evaluation and try to find a selection and competition method that will promote adding value to Europe, as this is the challenge, to ensure that culture is valued across Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Capital of Culture programme is one of the European Union's success stories.
It gets Europe out of Brussels and Strasbourg and into the hearts and minds of people right across Europe.
Cities compete to become the Capital of Culture - which is regarded as an accolade - and indeed they should.
In Britain, Glasgow's time as the European Capital of Culture in 1990 was a real success story.
Today it is the third most visited city in Britain.
Glasgow's urban renaissance provided a blueprint for others and I am sure that Liverpool - the home of the Beatles as nobody needs reminding - will have great success during its year in 2008.
As an MEP from the south-east of England, I am only sorry that our candidates of Canterbury, Brighton and Oxford were not chosen.
Any one of them would have been a great Capital of Culture.
As an English Conservative I have great respect for our French Socialist President of the Committee on Culture; I admire the first quality, I will excuse the second!
In this instance I believe the majority in the committee was correct.
It was too long to wait until 2019 for any of the accession states to have the opportunity to become a Capital of Culture.
By sharing the list from 2009, when Lithuania will be the first of the accession states to get the opportunity, we will not detract from the principle: we will introduce the opportunity of cooperation across Europe, putting Europe back into the concept.
That is something we can look forward to: cooperation is, after all, what Europe is all about.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I actually wish we had been able to have an open debate in this House on optimising the way in which Europeâs Capital of Culture is chosen.
Instead, we have to deal with what has to be called some kind of emergency solution or repair job.
It has been said, and quite rightly, that it was utterly egoistic of the Council to come to a snap decision to make use of all the present Member States by 2019, in the full knowledge that we would have unification to deal with, in the shape of enlargement.
Now that enlargement is imminent and it has dawned on some people that it cannot be right and proper to put these countries off until 2020 or even later, the Commission has now come up with this tandem solutionâ and a solution it is, although I have to tell you, Commissioner, that it does of course leave a disagreeable aftertaste.
I think you are aware of that too.
I will readily concede, though, that you have tried to make the best of it, and it really is a great shame that we in this House are in two minds about it and that opinions differ on it, with the result that the proposals Mr Rocard has made in his report on the qualitative improvement of the selection procedure cannot be discussed in isolation from the question of what actually happens if fundamental changes are made.
I am a German MEP.
In Germany, 17 cities are seeking to be the Capital of Culture for 2010.
We are told that nobody wants to interfere with this.
What legal certainty, though, is there for these cities if the procedure cannot be completed?
They have applied and are engaged in a contest that I believe can point the way ahead.
The only real recommendation I can make for the future is that a competition be held within the Member States, with the Member State making a qualitative decision, which would then be taken up to European level, where I would like to see a competitive selection procedure.
I hope that the new Parliament can do some fundamental new thinking about this.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Reding, we are in full agreement with what we have now heard, namely that the decision taken by the Council was premature and false.
Now, though, I think we should do everything possible to make the best of it, in the interests of the countries concerned and, above all, of European culture.
Much as I would, theoretically speaking, have preferred our Chairmanâs clear and purist solution, I nevertheless think it is now time to turn the tables.
We should now see this necessary solution not as an emergency measure but as a positive opportunity to set forth Europeâs cultural diversity by having not just one Capital of Culture, but â and why ever not? â two capitals for this great Europe of ours, embracing for the first time East and West and symbolising our cultural diversity.
There must then be no distinction between old and new Member States; there must be two equal cities, symbolising the cultural diversity of Europe.
What will then be important is that the concept, the vision, that underlies the concept of a European Capital of Culture should play more of a role.
This should not just be about cities depicting themselves and their splendid history, their past and their present, but about them putting on show the way in which European history has been made and todayâs Europe shaped by them.
From this point of view, I do see the resolution we are now adopting as being â if you go back to its origins â a great opportunity for Europeâs cultural diversity.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I start I would like to say that I have been a Member of the European Parliament for just 19 days and this is my first speech to this illustrious House, and perhaps the last, but I do not think it is audacious of me to talk about culture today, because for the last eight years I have been Managing Director of , a European channel which has observed and broadcast the activities of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, but which has also put an enormous amount of effort into observing and broadcasting European cultural activities, whether official or not.
And as a person from outside who can perhaps comment with fewer political implications, I would like to say that culture is very broad, it has many facets and that two European capitals is not excessive.
In sport we have two Olympic games, in winter and in summer, within the same year, and no harm is done.
Culture is perhaps even broader and we cannot deny the new countries which are going to join us the opportunity to organise and hold a European capital of culture in one of its cities.
I personally and my group therefore support the Commissionâs position of naming two cities as European capitals of culture.
On the issue of how to select them, we believe that competition should prevail.
This is provided for, to a degree, by having two cities from two different countries within the same year.
But we should also try to ensure that there is a degree of competition amongst candidatures from the same country.
We hope that the Commission can resolve this issue.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Vila.
I would like to say that you give the impression of having been an MEP for many years given your mastery of the situation.
We congratulate you on this maiden speech and we hope it is not your last.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, as I will not have another opportunity in this House, allow me to congratulate the Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, my colleague and friend MrÂ Rocard.
We have done some good work over the last few years.
I regret that it has to end on a disagreement.
We do not, however, disagree on the fundamental issue, because we have the same fundamental idea: to ensure that European capitals of culture continue to be real springboards for European cultures and diversity.
Unfortunately, the fact that the Treaties require unanimity in cultural matters does not allow us to go any further, which is what we really need to do.
This is why, while we hope to soon have a new treaty establishing majority decisions on cultural matters, which would help us enormously to make progress in many areas, we should propose a radical review as soon as possible of the way in which European capitals of culture are chosen.
There are two things that I would like to say.
The first is that I agree with those of you who have said that a repair solution may be an opportunity for the future.
Often, in the past, European capitals of culture have not been European enough.
If we have two capitals between which bridges are built, there could be a very significant strengthening of that European dimension.
I must also assure you that this Commissioner has his pilgrimâs stick ready to go to the cities when they are being prepared, to argue the cause of a more European programme.
I think that the last three examples, Graz, Genoa and Lille, to name but a few, show a remarkable effort to place the European aspect of culture on the agenda, transcending regional and national dimensions.
I am therefore optimistic, because I am speaking on the basis of what is being done.
There are even some Member States already doing what we want for the future: healthy competition in order to choose the best city.
What is happening is England, Germany and elsewhere is marvellous.
We are also aware, of course, that there are negative examples, but today I prefer to look mainly at the positive examples, because they are marvellous and they show us that the capitals of Europe are a good idea with a great future ahead of it.
I attach huge importance to the bridges to be built between the cities.
For example, look at the Luxembourg proposal, which raised a few problems, because it was not sufficiently developed.
The jury protested.
Luxembourg submitted a new plan which creates synergies within the big region of Europe, i.e. Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and France, and also creates synergies with a Romanian city which, historically, has a specific relationship with Luxembourg.
They even still speak Luxembourgian there.
This is to show you that if we are really doing our job and pushing the cities to be better, to be really European in their cultural choices, the result can be very positive.
I agree with those Members who have cited some cities to show how becoming European capitals of culture opened up new perspectives to them by directing them towards cultural industries, cultural tourism and cultural excellence.
This is the case of a city such as Glasgow, for example, which was not really oriented towards culture at the start.
The same applies to Liverpool.
These cities are experiencing a development that is not only industrial and social, but also involves citizens and culture.
If we work hard in the future, like the current Parliament, for whom this is the last debate on culture, has done over the last five years, I do not doubt for a moment, Chairman Rocard, that what your Committee wanted and what your Commissioner has always advocated will be put into practice in the cities of culture of the future.
I hope that the good examples of the past will be followed in the future, and I wish all citizens and all those involved in culture courage and pleasure as they meet in the future in the cultural cities of Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0247/2004) by Mrs Zissener, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a single framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences (Europass) (COM(2003) 796 â C5-0648/2003 â 2003/0307(COD)).
Â Â  Mr President, we are moving on from culture to education, professional training, competences and qualifications, and in my mind the two are linked.
On 17 December 2003, the Commission adopted a proposal aimed at rationalising the European situation in terms of transparency of qualifications and competences.
I am sure you are aware that this was a step forwards in the construction of the Europe of education and training.
It is also a major tool to benefit citizens and enable free movement.
Through this initiative we wished to provide real assistance to all those who want to have their qualifications recognised in another Member State, to give them more opportunities to find a job.
This initiative was explicitly requested by the Council in its resolution of 19 December 2002, and was well received by the Council and Parliament.
Several improvements have been made to the Commission proposal without any substantial objections, and I welcome this consensus on both the objective and the content of our proposal.
What is the proposal?
It incorporates five existing documents into a coordinated portfolio called Europass, covering qualifications and competences from a perspective of lifelong learning: the European CV, which concerns personal competences; the language portfolio, multilingualism, which we had advocated so strongly over the last five years, the MobiliPass, which replaces and extends the current Europass-Training; the Diploma Supplement, which concerns higher education qualifications, and its equivalent for professional training, the Certificate Supplement.
By mentioning these various documents, I do not want you to think that is the end.
Europass is supposed to be an open framework, and other documents may be added in the future.
I am thinking, for example, going back to our youth policy, of voluntary activities that citizens do during their youth or adult lives, and social and civic action, which should be taken into consideration, because they are part of the personality of a human being
Although we agree on our approach to this matter, a number of amendments have been adopted.
The Commission accepts them, with some exceptions.
Amendment No 7 is not acceptable in its current format.
It gives the national Europass agencies the additional task of making a guide to mobility available to every citizen.
This task is not part of their primary responsibilities.
Following the modifications proposed by the Council, a modification to this amendment was suggested, stating that Europass national agencies fulfil this task 'where necessary'.
With this addition, the Amendment would be acceptable.
Amendment No 12 is also not acceptable in its current form.
Firstly, the MobiliPass must be completed by the sending and host organisation and not by one or the other.
Secondly, the third language into which the MobiliPass can be translated must be a widely spoken language.
If it established joint responsibility between the sending and host organisations and did not confine itself to a third language or only widely spoken languages, the amendment would be acceptable.
Amendment No 5, which highlights the role of social partners in the development of future sectoral initiatives, is in principle acceptable to the Commission.
Following the changes proposed by the Council, a modification was proposed, removing the specification 'sectoral'.
This modification is also acceptable.
The same applies to Amendment No 8, which can be modified in the same way.
As you can see, Mr President, there is nothing insurmountable.
The important thing is that this proposal aims to implement a service for citizens to help them to have their competences better valued, and we agree on this point.
I therefore welcome the efforts made by Parliament and the Council to ensure that it is swiftly adopted so that citizens can use the tool from the beginning of 2005.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europass is the realisation of the type of policy that citizens expect from us.
I think that it is a good project and I thank you for your support.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is a key concept in European policy, and globalisation is making it more and more important.
The unfortunate reality is, however, that we have found, and are still finding, that Europeâs citizens are not yet as mobile as we would like them to be.
One of the main reasons for the fact that mobility has not yet been completely achieved is a lack of transparency of qualifications and competences.
The lack of transparency, as we all know, is the most important obstacle to mobility in terms of training and professional activity and a significant block to making the labour market in Europe more flexible.
The Commission has now submitted the proposal for a uniform framework concept for the promotion of transparency of qualifications and competences â in brief, the Europass â which has been long awaited and ardently desired.
This Commission proposal is an exceptionally good one, in that it makes it easier for citizens to gain access to opportunities for mobility.
The Commission has already said that in the new Europass portfolio five existing opportunities for mobility will be combined, namely the European career structure, the addition to the diploma, the existing Europass for professional training and references and, also extremely important, the European language portfolio.
As already mentioned, these instruments already exist.
However, they were not yet appropriately visible to the public.
That makes it extremely important that not only the existing instruments, but also the networks, be coordinated and rationalised.
An agreed portfolio of documents has a greater communication impact than a loose collection of separate documents.
The important thing, however, is that it is an open portfolio, and I believe there are two reasons for this.
In the first place, citizens can search for documents that are relevant to them.
Nobody has to wade through all five documents.
Secondly, this open system enables further documents to be included in the portfolio.
I have proposed here in my report that the next document to be included in this portfolio should be a certificate of computer competence.
At this stage, I would like to thank everyone, the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation, which has indeed ensured that this proposal can rapidly proceed through all the bureaucratic hurdles.
I believe that we all have an interest in ensuring that this proposal is implemented as rapidly as possible and that the Europass is made available to the public as early as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely pleasing that in the penultimate week of the session of this parliamentary term we will be adopting such a fine, interesting and new European project, a project that I thought could be passed without either conflicts or objections on the part of the Council.
This confidence must now be moderated somewhat, since I have heard, Madam Commissioner, that you do not agree with several of the amendments, including those proposed by me.
Perhaps the administration could once again go through various points with me this evening, so that tomorrow we will in fact be able to adopt something going further than what we had initially had submitted to us.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whom I have produced this opinion, has not only taken the project seriously and welcomed it, but we have also integrated it in our work.
We know that mobility and lifelong learning are today important components for professional success and that often up to now neither the economy nor policies have put in place the conditions for it.
This is now going to change.
For these reasons, we have made various proposals and additions, which we regard as important, for example the inclusion of third-state nationals â we regard this as a symbol of fairness â the inclusion of the social partners in order to make use of their know-how, the consideration to be given to social integration and, last but not least, more and better information for the public, providers of education and training and social partners, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
This is because the entire project will only be any use, will only be successful, if it is known about, if it is accepted by young people, by workers and also by industry and society.
So it will be necessary also to conduct a campaign of explanation and information.
Then, I think, we will be able to get this child onto the right track.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the run-up to an election and I, just like Mrs Weiler, am grateful that right at the end of this parliamentary term we have managed to create something for many young people, indeed for all young people.
This is because the Europass is something that really affects young people, even those who are entering their studies.
I think we have spent a long time looking for this, and I am glad that the Commissioner can get it moving at the end of her current period in office.
It would, of course, have been nice to pass this in the present legislative period, but we have to accept what cannot be done, and, if we manage to do this in September or October, that will not be too bad.
Although we should not overload the Europass with expectations of absolutely everything, we should at least expect it to make realities of those constant pious truisms, transparency and mobility opportunities.
These are the stuff of daily life for young people and workers; they are often affected by European laws and still cannot evolve as we would wish.
This means that there is a need for clear decisions on the European career structure.
We must say very clearly what is meant by the specialist competences of the individual.
It must be possible to include the language competence of individuals in a tested form.
We should also, as you have suggested, take into account young peopleâs voluntary service, for that is a competence acquired by a young person in the course of his or her life, and it should be more recognised than it has been so far, including by employers.
I also believe that there are very many opportunities to help young people to find their way in this huge labour market and in turn to be found on the basis of their qualifications.
It is often, today, impossible to assess exactly what a person can do, simply because what his references say is not translated and basically cannot be compared.
So I believe that in this Europass we have achieved clarity about training periods, the content of training and professional competence, and I believe that that is what we need, what young people need, in order to really experience Europe for themselves.
So let me say once again that my group is grateful that Mrs Zissener has taken on this report and we are delighted that in the autumn we will be able to get this matter going together â unfortunately with a new Presidency of the Council â in the interests of our young people and therefore in the interests of our children and grandchildren.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, with the start of the new generation of programmes in the area of general professional training from 2007 and the intensive involvement of the new Member States in them, it is becoming all the more important to attest, in a uniform passport, experience acquired abroad, and the capacities, competence and qualifications acquired there.
I believe that it will be extremely important that what we will be adopting tomorrow we should also be able to actually provide, and it is absolutely essential that this should go hand in hand with an advertising campaign.
Its use, significance and added value must be made clearly intelligible to every user and person filling in the forms.
As it is the purpose of the new generation of programmes, including the Leonardo programme, to achieve 150Â 000 trainees a year, it is absolutely vital that training providers should know about the Europass.
Since this document is a formal recognition of professional qualifications, I ask right now for the administrative costs to be kept as low as possible, as these are among the major obstacles for all young people.
I see the Europass as vital, provided that it is not only an opportunity for formal qualification but also for informal competence.
The really crucial factor â and let me stress this â is intercultural competence, because in future, with increasing globalisation, integration and interaction between different civilisations and cultures it will be necessary to have intercultural capacities and build on them.
The mobility pass, which comprises all learning-related and transnational knowledge from abroad, should also certify this experience.
Both in the learning process and in professional life, mobility is required.
For young people to be able to achieve an overview of this jungle of support and exchange programmes, the competent agencies, working with the Commission, should produce guidelines for mobility, making available exchange and support programmes, the names and addresses of people to contact, as well as links, so that the added value of Europe is evident to everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur for her work and also the Commissioner for the tremendous effort which has been put into this.
One slight note of caution: I was hoping that everything could be sorted out in the first reading on this report.
I am not certain whether that has finally been agreed.
I know that the Council presidency has been in contact with the rapporteur and others to try and achieve this result.
As the Commissioner, the rapporteur, the draftsperson and other speakers rightly said, this is one of the key elements with regard to which we in the European Union institutions can point to how we improve people's lives on the ground; how we make their lives easier, both at work and in education.
By putting together a single portfolio of all the qualifications and experience that citizens have, and allowing them to transfer that across different countries and different working sectors has to be an improvement compared with today's situation.
Since the late 1980s we have had this idea of a single market with free movement of people, goods and services, but the bureaucracy and the lack of recognition of qualifications and services was so great that there was no true free movement of people.
This single framework aspect as proposed by the rapporteur is a positive move towards that.
The issue of lifelong learning is one that continues to be of the utmost importance, not just because of people returning to education or to the workforce, but simply because of the technological changes which are taking place in the workplace and now in our everyday lives: whether it is about online banking, email or being involved in a technical process in the area in which you are working.
The one aspect of this proposal that will be of the greatest benefit of all is that employers, educational institutions and others will have a single document to look at, and this document will finally provide some idea of the equivalence of qualifications and experience across Member States.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner for her speeches and her work this evening and during the legislature.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the motion of censure on the European Commission (B5-0189/2004).
I should like to inform the House that Mr Borghezio, MrÂ Gobbo and Mr Turchi have added their signatures to the motion.
Mrs Muscardini has withdrawn her signature.
That brings the number of signatures to 67.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is usually the author of the motion for a resolution who starts the discussion off, so I suggest that we allow Mr Heaton-Harris to start the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, this motion is to censure the whole Commission.
Alas, we do not currently have the power in this House to censure individuals - we have only this nuclear option.
Perhaps in Eurostat's case this is the best thing.
The problem here is that the Commissioners are happy to make great political statements on policy but absolutely refuse to take political responsibility for problems that occur in their DGs.
Effective political control, proper communication, procedures and financial checks and balances were either not in place in Eurostat, failed to work, or were simply ignored.
In fact all the warning signs were completely ignored.
In this case, EUR 5 million went missing because of fraud and bad management controls.
Yet the only person to be arrested was a journalist - Hans-Martin Tillack - who chose to report this in and whose office was raided again today.
It is not amazing that OLAF can act with such speed involving police in trying to get the name of a journalist and checking his bank accounts in days.
However, if you compare this to the Eurostat case, where after more than a year of investigations we have basically nothing, it begs the question of the priorities of various individuals within the DG responsible.
During the discharge process for 2001, Eurostat was one of our rapporteur's key themes.
We now know that not all the information we needed at the time was made available to this House.
Many MEPs are now on record as saying that if they had been given all the facts at the time, they would have voted against discharge for those accounts last year.
If the Commission and the leaders of all the political groups in this Parliament had put half as much energy into solving the systemic problems shown up by the Eurostat case as they have in trying to block this motion from having an airing on the floor of the House, then all these problems could have been solved years ago.
This Commission deserves to be censured, and future Commissioners need to know that they will take political responsibility for the actions of their DGs.
Â Â  . Mr President, as my colleague Mr Fischler stated yesterday, the Commission took immediate action when it had evidence of the problems in Eurostat.
This has resulted in a thorough restructuring of the Eurostat Directorate-General and its operations.
In addition to the statement made by my colleague on behalf of the Commission, I would like to emphasise the measures regarding in particular the revision of the code of conduct, the improvement of the flow of information related to fraud allegations, as well as a revision of the legal framework of OLAF.
I would particularly like to point out the following measures.
Firstly, revising the code of conduct that governs relations between the Commissioners and their services and which emphasises the political responsibility of the Commissioner, as well as that of the Director-General or the head of service.
The new code includes specific procedures requiring the Commissioner to be informed about any fact, situation or question concerning management â especially financial management â the gravity of which could invoke the responsibility of the Commissioner or the college.
Secondly, putting in place measures aimed at facilitating the cross-referencing of any information related to fraud allegations, helping to ensure that the political level is kept informed and that any cases detected are properly followed up.
Thirdly, strengthening information circuits between the central services and operational services, especially in the areas of control and internal audit.
This involves a series of important measures that aim at fine-tuning financial management reforms that had already been introduced by the Prodi Commission.
These measures derive essentially from the recommendations which the internal auditor made in his report on DG Eurostat's contracts - informing and training staff about the different mechanisms in place for whistleblowing and revising OLAF's legal framework with the adoption of two new legislative proposals to be examined by the new Parliament.
These proposals aim to improve the information flows within the institutions of the Union and to reinforce the procedural guarantees.
Despite the crisis, Eurostat's functions in performing the essential statistical work of the Commission have not been interrupted.
A major reorganisation of Eurostat was approved by the Commission on 29 September 2003 and the new establishment plan has been in operation since 1 November.
The system of approval for commitments and payments was reorganised.
The financial circuits were more explicitly defined so as to bring into play the responsibilities of the delegated authorising officers at head of unit and directorate level.
The Commission's decision to end the contractual links with four companies required a significant amount of work in ending the contracts themselves and in ensuring that the potential for litigation was minimised.
Following on from the special audit undertaken by the internal audit service in September 2003, as well from the in-depth audit that had recently been concluded, a series of initiatives generated by the annual activity report were also undertaken.
There will be a radical new departure in the field of providing statistical information.
Based on the principle that European statistical information is a public service, all statistical data drawn up and collected by Eurostat should be available free of charge to users and should be available on the Internet.
Finally, the work programme for 2004 is strictly prioritised and intentionally realistic.
The emphasis is on the essential missions of Eurostat, namely the production of figures and independent statistics.
The Commission is keen to reduce its dependence on external companies and organisations and to ensure that the European statistical service remains a public service which is open and available to users and acts in the public interest.
The Commission has thus taken very concrete and swift measures to respond to the criticism made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 17 December 2003 on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2004.
This is also confirmed in the Commission's progress report of 9 February 2004 on completing the reform mandate.
The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, for having voted today by a large majority to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the execution of the general budget of the European Communities for 2002.
This vote confirms that the Eurostat affair is a very regrettable exception to the generally sound financial management of the budget of the European Communities.
However, the Eurostat affair also shows the necessity and the importance of the reform progress engaged by the Commission.
With regard to the political responsibility mentioned in the motion of censure that is going to be debated here tonight, I would like to confirm the position of the Commission as very clearly stated by President Prodi in his speech of 25 September 2003 at the conference of presidents of the political groups.
I also want to underline, as my colleague Mrs Schreyer did yesterday when answering a question from MrsÂ AvilÃ©s Perea, that the reform measures will prevent problems like those which occurred in Eurostat before 1999 from recurring, and that the Commission has learned its lesson with regard to the problem of inadequate information flows revealed by the Eurostat case and has taken appropriate action.
President Prodi and his whole Commission are committed to zero tolerance against fraud.
You know very well that this is not a guarantee that no fraud will ever occur but it is a guarantee that nothing will be hushed up.
Potential problems will be brought out into the open and appropriate measures will be taken.
As also stated by my colleague Mr Fischler today, the Commission remains committed to following up on actions taken to maximise the safeguards against fraud and it is grateful to the European Parliament for its substantial contribution and its continued support in this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate this evening is both regrettable and, in my view, dangerous.
It is regrettable because the signatories to this motion actually have no other objective than to sully the reputation of the Commission, which, although it can be criticised for its management of the Eurostat matter, certainly does not deserve a vote of no confidence from Parliament.
It is also dangerous, because this is an important time in the history of European integration with the unification of the continent on 1 May, the European elections, hopefully the adoption of the Constitution and the fight against terrorism.
The process can only be weakened by mediocre political manoeuvres that do not fool anyone.
I do not in any way wish to minimise the importance of the questions surrounding the Eurostat affair, but above all, I wish to understand the real reasons that led those who signed this motion of censure to do so.
Was it really their concern for transparency?
I do not think so.
Was it really their desire to shed light on the Eurostat affair?
I am sure it was not.
There are two reasons why I think not.
The first reason is the time that was chosen for this initiative, Parliamentâs last legislative sitting.
Some will naively argue that this is a coincidence, but I would like to point out that more objective observers will note the proximity of the European elections.
I would draw attention to the fact that the questions surrounding Eurostat were raised as long as two years ago.
If a desire for transparency was behind this step, the motion of censure would have come much sooner.
The second reason to back up my arguments is the list of signatories to this motion of censure.
Everyone is free to defend their convictions and undoubtedly the Members who support the motion of censure are doing so from their soul and their conscience.
The majority of them, however, have an anti-European soul and a merely national conscience.
Despite appearances, it is not the Commission that is being targeted, but European integration.
It is not a defence of the interests of European taxpayers, but a desire to destroy the reputation of a Europe, which, although it is not perfect, is an effective way for our people to live in peace and relative prosperity.
This motion of censure is the work of the âinward-lookingâ club of people who reject common policies, fight against European progress waving flags of fear, and reject the contract of trust that is the European Constitution proposed by the Convention.
I am not trying to offend anyone by saying this, because this is what they are doing by making people believe that Europe is a machine, a monster that regulates everything, decides everything, cheats and I do not know what else.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has chosen a different path to the signatories, because we talk about the future while others stay stuck in the past, because Europe is not built on fear, but on ambition and will.
It is true that everything is not perfect.
There is still a great deal to do, particularly giving real political meaning to what is a human step, because it is a human venture to welcome the ten new countries, which are a symbolic example.
With regard to the Eurostat affair, the PPE-DE Group as a whole has always publicly expressed a desire for light to be shed on the affair.
We have noted the measures taken by the Commission.
We want those responsible to explain themselves because we strongly suspect that major mistakes have been made.
Those responsible must, however, be punished in proportion to any mistakes that become apparent.
We owe the European people a sense of responsibility, respect for democratic procedures and a guarantee of the rule of law.
Inquiries need to be conducted, there needs to be punishment for the mistake, the punishment needs to be fair and there must be transparency.
This is what we have always said, this is what we are fighting for.
To claim, however, as the signatories to this motion of censure are doing, that the Commission has not fulfilled its obligations, to seek to blemish a Commission at the end of its mandate which has of course made mistakes but which has a commendable record, is not acceptable to us.
This is why the PPE Group will vote against this motion with determination and conviction.
Â Â  Mr President, when you announced yesterday that it is a coalition of British Tories and Greek Communists who have tabled a no-confidence motion against the Commission, I was reminded of the remark of Karl Marx that when history repeats itself it does so first as tragedy and secondly as farce.
When the Santer Commission fell 5 years ago, most of us Socialists allowed ourselves to be pushed up against a wall by, to some extent, defending the indefensible.
We have learnt from this.
Having, at the time, been one of the minority who voted in favour of the vote of no-confidence, I am now all the more convinced in speaking on behalf of my own group against the farce of a no-confidence vote, the only purpose of which would be to serve those newspapers of which it can be said that we do not know whether they are written for illiterates or by them.
To make one thing clear, that assessment is transnational, it applies to several countries and not just to one.
It is legitimate, even in this Parliament, to be against European integration and therefore against the Community institutions.
The question, however, is whether the systematic discrediting of the EU institutions should be allowed to become a means whereby political debate is carried out.
This question is not to be put to the Tories or to the European United Left, because they have a record of doing this, and will carry on doing so.
The question, rather, is whether those who are in favour of political integration in this House are going to leave these people without resistance.
I am in favour of resisting.
We are also defending ourselves against the abuse of Budget control for clearly political purposes.
Even you, Mr Heaton-Harris, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, have frequently made it clear that the reasons that led to the collapse of the Santer Commission do not apply in this case, whatever criticism may be levelled at the present Commission.
In contrast to the Santer Commission, the current Commission, despite all the mistakes, has not attempted to conceal information systematically from Parliament.
That is the decisive point.
Mr BÃ¶sch and Mr Casaca were two Socialists involved in a leading role in the preparation of the events surrounding Eurostat.
Using the Eurostat case as an electoral instrument is the best way to distract the incipient reform process and we do not wish to do this.
The bizarre nature of this circus act is now making two things clear, and they should be made public in this session.
The signatories of the motion for a vote of no confidence include a Member of this House who personally urged me several months ago to ensure that the Eurostat story was buried.
In his own words, his reasons were that the closer the elections come, the madder MEPs get.
He has now signed the motion.
