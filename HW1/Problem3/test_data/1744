The only task remaining to me is the pleasant one of thanking Mr Beysen and his shadow rapporteur for the outstandingly positive contribution they have made as rapporteurs to our discussions on this important topic, which has aroused such lively interest.
The Commission knows that Mr Beysen has devoted a great deal of time and effort to this task, which presented many difficulties to him and his committee.
The Commission is very grateful that we have finally managed to reach a satisfactory compromise, and hopes and expects that it will be passed when it is put to the vote, which I believe will take place tomorrow.
Thank you Commissioner Bolkenstein.
I too, along with the rapporteur and the Members, regret the way this important debate has been managed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0249/2002) tabled by Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the draft Commission regulation on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to state aid for employment [C5-259/2002 - 2002/2126(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation (EC) 994/98 contains the provision that the Commission should approve regulations on block exemption which exempt certain aid from the obligation to notify the Commission, employing a technique already used successfully in the field of anti-competitive behaviour.
So far, the Commission has approved the Regulations on SMEs, training and minimums, and now it is proposing a Regulation on employment aid.
I would like to start by making a series of observations.
Firstly, that the proposal we are currently analysing, although it is not being modified, improves the existing system.
There is currently no regulation on block exemption in this field and the guidelines on this type of aid are based on a series of diverse communications which are not regulatory.
The fact that certain aid with clear criteria is being exempted from the obligation to notify, although those criteria may be insufficient, represents considerable progress in terms of transparency and legal certainty, which we must not fail to recognise.
Secondly, I would like to insist that this does not mean that aid without the characteristics included in the Regulation will be considered illegal.
Not at all.
All it implies is that such aid will have to be subject to notification, in order to analyse whether or not it contradicts the objectives of the Treaty.
And we must not forget that these objectives do not just include maintaining a system in which competition is not distorted, but also the promotion of employment.
Thirdly, certain possible scenarios should be stipulated in order prevent the administrations who grant the aid - particularly the regional authorities in the case of Spain and also in other Member States - from being subject to long procedures involving notification when granting aid aimed at promoting employment, especially in sectors in which workers are most affected by unemployment.
To this end, and in line with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, we must propose support for the transformation of employment contracts into permanent contracts and greater flexibility in defining the different groups of workers who will benefit, as well as adapting them to the particular characteristics of each region, and the inclusion amongst the exempted aid of aid aimed at promoting the employment of women and, finally, extending the age range, so that young workers - or those who are in the final stage of their working life - can benefit from aid without the need for modification.
All these criteria, included in Amendment No 1 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are aimed directly at promoting employment in the least-favoured sectors, and their inclusion in the Regulation in no way distorts competition.
The comparison of the anti-competitive effects of this aid with other types of aid, if we analyse it soberly, is something of an insult to the intelligence.
We are not going to get into a debate here on public aid and its effects on competition, but, if there is any public aid worthy of being seen as compatible with the objectives of the Treaty, then that is the aid aimed at promoting employment.
It would not be good to give the European citizens and workers the impression that the Commission shows signs of flexibility when allowing other types of aid, while being extraordinarily strict when it comes to employment aid.
Furthermore, it would be appropriate to include the social economy sector - in a general sense - as an exempt sector.
As all the honourable Members know, social economy companies provide a significant cushion in terms of maintaining employment when there is crisis in a sector, and that reality should be reflected in the Regulation.
Finally, in the report adopted certain paragraphs have been introduced in relation to the preference for employment flexibility measures over aid for the promotion of employment.
I am not going to get involved in refuting this idea, which - like all ideas expressed in such emphatic terms - reflects a rigid and distinctly conservative approach, which I cannot agree with.
But, quite simply, the honourable Members will have to recognise that whatever the ideological position they hold, this is a strange and extravagant idea at this time, which should not appear in the report, since it relates to other issues.
To insist on it would imply an excessive interest in sending messages in favour of a certain action, which cannot be shared by important sectors, both in Parliament and in European society.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the quality of the report.
Given the employment situation in the Community, every aspect of employment represents, and must represent, an essential political priority.
I welcome Parliament's comments on this proposal, which seeks to reduce the administrative burdens on national authorities which employ State aid measures to respond to the challenge represented by employment.
I am all the more pleased to note the generally very favourable tone of the report.
As you are aware and as the rapporteur has just pointed out, the proposal concerns a fourth exemption regulation in the field of State aid, which follows on from the exemption regulations already in force in the areas of training, aid to small and medium-sized enterprises and de minimis aid.
The main aim behind all these regulations is to reduce the administrative burdens upon national authorities, exempting them from the obligation to notify measures which are clearly compatible with the internal market.
The proposal concerns the relationship between two essential Community objectives: employment and competition.
The need to find the right balance between these two objectives is clear - and let it be understood that in saying this I am in no way trying to suggest that competition and employment are two objectives which are incompatible. On the contrary, we are convinced that, worldwide, sustaining a dynamic market economy in which the forces of competition are free to express themselves will contribute greatly to increasing employment levels.
There are, of course, countless measures that the Member States can and, indeed, do take to promote employment.
Many of these do not constitute State aid, particularly when they are not selective but cover the entire economic activity of a Member State.
The draft regulation does not relate to these measures.
It must also be pointed out that, in many cases, State aid with different primary objectives also has the implicit objective of promoting employment. This is the case of regional investment aid, for example, and aid to certain sectors.
The regulation before us only concerns aid which is formally and explicitly linked to the achievement of employment objectives.
The text does more than just streamline the administrative requirements: it clarifies the fundamental rules which apply to employment aid too.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
He has worked very hard on this report and it is a good one.
The report and the underlying regulation seek to establish clearer and more transparent rules for state aid for employment.
Streamlined procedures for Member States wishing to aid employment schemes are to be welcomed and sensitivity to local circumstances is also desirable.
The report welcomes and expresses support for the state aid register, which the British Conservatives have made a priority.
It is vitally important that we keep track of the various Member States and their record on state aid.
In terms of general principles, we believe that it is vitally important to restrict the areas where state aid can be given.
I am not sure whether we would go as far as Mr Monti - I believe he has referred to state aids in the past as evil - but we certainly believe that it is necessary to restrict state aid in order to maintain economic efficiency and economic prosperity and a level playing field between companies in different Member States.
Having said that, this report and the regulation acknowledge that certain state aids are acceptable and indeed desirable in relation to employment schemes.
We are, however, very wary about the degree of extension that can be accepted even in this case, because of our suspicion of state aids.
But we believe the Commission has drawn the line at a sensible point.
That is also reflected in the report.
I would not go as far as Amendment No 1, as put forward by Mr Berenguer Fuster.
In particular paragraph (a) of Amendment No 1, which seems to specifically condemn temporary as opposed to permanent contracts, is not appropriate and should not be supported by the House.
I ask the House to remember that state aid, in this context, is rather like a Band-Aid or a sticking plaster being applied to a gaping wound.
State aid for employment, where it is permitted, as appropriate, by this regulation, can never actually solve Europe's unemployment problems.
It is appropriate to permit government state aid for employment schemes in restricted circumstances, but the real way to tackle the 18 million unemployed in Europe, to give people genuine job opportunities, is by labour market reform, by producing structural and economic reform and labour market flexibility, making it easier to hire people.
That is the way to deal with the serious and unacceptably high level of unemployment in the European Union.
So we accept this as a pragmatic and sensible measure.
Both the regulation and the report make sensible proposals, but it is vitally important that we address the key issue, which is labour market flexibility and economic reform.
Mr President, I should like to endorse the rapporteur's positive appraisal of the Commission's proposal for a regulation.
It is precisely because the private economy is failing to live up to its responsibility and create secure jobs that we need more aid to promote employment in the European Union.
You only have to think about current mass unemployment and the different situations in the regions to realise that this regulation is crucial, because it creates greater transparency, cuts red tape, provides legal security and improves comparability and, with it, we shall soon be in a position to judge how effective aid is.
It is interesting to note that national employment policies in the European Union have changed, gearing towards the common objectives of the employment strategy, with action plans being used as levers.
But what struck us in this context is that the current employment guidelines make no reference to growth or to the desirable or undesirable effects of employment aid.
We need to call for finishing touches to be put to the employment guidelines in the interests of mainstreaming and the coherence of European employment policies.
We need to clarify that the contribution of both sides - employment policy and competition policy - to the European employment strategy can be guaranteed.
I think that, in the proposal before us, the Commission rightly recognises the need to allow state measures in the form of employment incentives for companies, especially for certain disadvantaged groups.
This is not just a logical consequence of the objectives set in Lisbon.
Full employment is and always will be one of the most important objectives of the Lisbon strategy, Barcelona confirmed that.
Which is why we must call for finishing touches in the form of a more flexible definition of which groups are to benefit.
I think that the age limit of 25 should be raised to 30 and that the age limit for older employees should be dropped from 55 to 50, because society relies on both, young people entering employment and older people remaining in employment.
I should also like to call for special care to be taken to ensure that the differentiation which the Commission rightly makes in its proposal between small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies does in fact apply when this proposal is implemented.
Mr President, the point I should like to make is that we simply want to cooperate better with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
We have not reached a view on this report as we would normally do, partly because we received it far too late.
The same may also be true of other committees.
Against the background of the matter we have just been discussing, namely the Commission Communication on policy coordination between economic policy, which involves competition policy, and employment policy and other areas of social policy, we need to consider to what extent we can achieve a number of things that are very important in the fight against unemployment.
One example of a very important issue is a fourth exemption regulation.
If you are in a region suffering from severe problems and pressure, where subsidies are needed and the procedure for obtaining them is very bureaucratic - I myself come from such a region, but I know countless others - then this is very irritating.
In these circumstances it is great to see the social aims in existing legislation being given a chance, and that is what I meant just now when I was talking about exchange.
I hope that this base will broaden in the future, and that starting from the Spring summit in Athens we will pursue exchanges in an attempt to achieve common social and sustainability goals, considering what economic policy can contribute to this process rather than bringing matters which the Treaty describes as subordinate in line with economic policy.
Briefly, against that background I think that this is an excellent proposal and believe it important for competition rules in general - I am thinking for example of services of general interest, which I could list - to be re-evaluated and tested against what we want to achieve through social policy.
Looking at the Lisbon process as a whole, I think that a number of the assumptions contradict what we are trying to achieve with our employment objective.
Some objectives, such as the new economy for example, were quite unjustly selected in the Lisbon process.
We can see that now and realise the far-reaching consequences.
State aid based on those Articles 87 and 88.
Those articles are very important in rechanneling back to the objectives of social policy, and that is why we must avoid any misunderstanding.
Perhaps we now need to go a step further.
I believe that we must not only ensure that existing regulations are properly translated into social objectives but must also look at what social objectives we need, as formulated in the Treaty among other documents, and consider whether we should revise the Treaty, for instance to put social policy and economic policy on an equal footing.
Against that background, and considering the proposals contained in Mr Berenguer Fuster's report - and I should like to thank him and his committee for their work - I call on members to support Amendments Nos 1 to 4.
Support by the whole of Parliament for these amendments could well sway us to vote for this proposal as a whole.
Outsiders find European regulations a great and impenetrable mystery.
Many different regulations, varying requirements and conditions, masses of provisions and long texts create a forest of rules.
Citizens and companies are lost without expert help.
Thus, European regulations are not shining examples of clarity and comprehensibility.
Legal action taken and legal queries raised by local authorities, businesses and affected citizens shows that this can cause problems when it comes to applying for aid.
Parliament should therefore support the proposal to simplify and clarify the rules on granting aid in the context of employment promotion.
Simplification and clarification does not mean adding numerous new objectives and ideas that are difficult to implement.
It is in this context that I should like to make a brief comment on the first amendment.
The additions proposed in Amendment No 1 really belong to employment policy, and have no place in a resolution on granting aid on the basis of the EC Treaty.
As I see it, the Commission's regulation deals primarily with the financial side of granting aid.
After all, aid is granted only when necessary and when justified by the circumstances.
The additions mentioned in the first amendment are in my view also too broad for specific application in the context of granting aid.
I support this resolution, except for Amendment No 1.
I also agree with Mr Bouwman that the procedural handling of this report has been somewhat bizarre.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think that the Commission's draft regulation illustrates perfectly that the view held by many members that employment policy always plays second fiddle to economic policy is simply not true.
We need both, one presupposes the other.
There is no contradiction between competition policy, growth policy and the need to grant aid to certain sectors, as this regulation clearly illustrates.
We realise that aid has to act as an incentive and help bridge the way to self-help.
Aid is no substitute for economic policy and a well-ordered employment policy.
We still think the best way of creating jobs is to have a functioning internal market, to implement the stability and growth pact, to pursue the Lisbon objectives and to introduce the four freedoms, a deregulated and more flexible employment market and an education system which encourages lifelong learning, diversification of skills and continuing learning.
We welcome this regulation because it says yes to systemisation, simplification and bundling, yes to control and transparency, with the help of the aid register, yes to regulated employment aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, the pillars of European economic and employment policy, and because it says yes to greater coordination between the Commission's policy and the policies of the Member States and between ministries in the Member States.
We have already moved in this direction in Austria, for example, by successfully merging the ministries of labour and the economy into a single ministry.
I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for sending out a clear signal in your statements on aid and the floods that your aid policy takes account of regional differences in economic, competition and employment policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have to disappoint you.
Unlike some of my colleagues, I am not very enthusiastic about the regulation before us.
I am quite sure that if no changes are made to the regulation during the consultation process many Member States will have the greatest difficulty in achieving the ambitious objectives of the European employment strategy to which they committed themselves in Lisbon.
If we are to see 70% of the population of working age in employment by 2010, this also requires helping older workers, giving people without good educational qualifications access to employment and getting disabled people into jobs, all of which means that supportive measures will be needed.
I am sure that greater flexibility and structural reforms will not suffice to solve these problems.
However, Commissioner, the regulation focuses so much on competition that it will be almost impossible to achieve these objectives.
Just one example: the ceilings for support for vulnerable workers are set so low that from one day to the next all Flemish social insertion firms that provide meaningful work for the unskilled long-term unemployed will have to close down, unless we reclassify the workers as disabled.
Another point: I am still concerned that the Commission fails to recognise the institutional reality of some Member States.
In my country and in others, it is the regions that set support for employment programmes.
As the regulation is currently drafted, this responsibility comes under the specific measures, not the general measures, and must therefore be notified by the regions.
Commissioner, I think that we have found a number of arguments for the Convention to limit competition policy, but I do hope that when the Commission applies this regulation it will be able to show that, even without amending the Treaty, it is able to reach a balance between employment objectives and competition objectives.
And I should like to ask you whether it would be possible to ask the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in charge of monitoring the Lisbon objectives for its views on this regulation.
Commissioner, we support the draft regulation and also this continuing project of the Commission, which appears to be working on a sort of general initiative, of which this could be the fourth part.
You might wonder, since I support the regulation, why I am speaking at all, but I have taken the floor because we are confused about one fundamental matter.
This is my question: why is it that, in a regulation which seeks to reduce bureaucracy through a series of measures - and we have already mentioned the specific sectors - was it decided to exclude the transport sector?
I am taking as an example - most exceptionally - the domestic situation in Italy, where decisions have been taken over the years which have had debatable consequences, although it is also true that Italy is a country whose environmental conditions are very different from the rest of Europe.
In a regulation which regulates employment measures in sectors which already have a great many problems and which need to diversify and to retrain their workforces, singling out the transport sector for absolute exclusion from the measure would appear to be something that the Commission might want to reconsider.
Mr President, I want to welcome Articles 5 and 6 of the draft regulation, which give a positive signal to Member State governments to support special arrangements for so-called reasonable accommodation to promote the employment of disabled workers.
However, I want to ask Commissioner Monti, in replying to the debate, to address the 400 000 disabled workers, such as those at Remploy in Southend in my constituency - and in other workplaces throughout Europe - where the company employs more than 50% of disabled workers unable to work in the open labour market.
This is known as sheltered or supported employment.
I know the Commissioner has received representations from the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Trade Union and many others that the actual organisational, administrative and transport costs of such companies should also be exempted from the state aid rules.
I understand that the advisory committee on state aids has given an initial sympathetic response to this proposal.
Tonight I hope the Commissioner will reassure this Parliament and those many disabled people who are unable otherwise to attain a job in the open workplace that Europe will fully recognise their rights and their aspirations in its competition rules.
Mr President, it would seem from today's speeches that there is wide support for the rationale underlying the regulation, which can be described as follows. First of all, there is a basic coherence between competition policy and employment policy, as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out.
There are two reasons for this coherence. Firstly, in the long term, a competitive economic environment will certainly contribute to the creation of sustainable employment, and, secondly, competition policy is sufficiently flexible - as is shown by the regulation - to combine overall rigour with the possibility of state aid where there are sufficient grounds for this.
State aid - this is another aspect of the rationale which I feel today's speeches have picked up on very well - is, by definition, selective.
Our goal is to ensure that it is selective in a way which benefits enterprises and groups of workers which are encountering particular difficulties.
Aid for the creation of new jobs should, therefore, be granted to small and medium-sized enterprises - as Mrs Randzio-Plath pointed out - and to businesses located in assisted regions.
Further aid should be allocated to fund the employment of disadvantaged groups of workers.
This explains, amongst other things, why large companies located in non-assisted regions are excluded from the possibility of receiving aid for job creation.
This is not to be interpreted as a lack of appreciation of such enterprises: we are simply acting consistently with the desire to support other enterprises which are in situations which justify aid.
The rules are now clearer and the amount of aid granted no longer depends on complex criteria such as whether or not jobs are linked to an investment project, and, moreover, they are now consistent with the rules on regional aid and aid to small and medium-sized enterprises.
A number of speakers - Mrs Villiers, in particular - have also mentioned the value of transparency in the state aid register too.
I have to say that converting such a philosophy, which appears to be widely supported, into detailed, directly applicable provisions, is by no means a simple task.
There may be some room for negotiation as regards the precise provisions, and I note the amendments tabled in this respect.
I can tell you, for example, that we are considering the possibility of extending the definition of disadvantaged worker - I am addressing Mr Howitt, in particular - beyond that contained in the proposal published in the Official Journal in April.
That text already included a provision on women in regions where unemployment among women is higher than the regional average, as mentioned in Amendment No 1.

To move on to the subject of transport, raised by Mr Fiori, I have taken note of your suggestion, Mr Fiori, although, as you are aware, in terms of internal Commission responsibilities, this matter falls within the sphere of competence of Vice-President de Palacio, of course.
I will just say that there are specific concerns regarding the excess of capacity in certain parts of this sector, particularly in the area of road transport, and we are, in general, of the opinion that where there are problems of overcapacity, it would not make sense to grant state aid, which could, indeed, exacerbate these problems.
We will, however, give all due consideration to your comments.
I would also like to say - and here I am addressing Mrs Van Lancker, in particular - that we are considering providing the explicit possibility for Member States to notify measures benefiting workers who are not covered by the definition of disadvantaged workers.
Moreover, we intend to make provision for the special case of sheltered employment for workers with disabilities.
There may also be other cases in which we might be able to consider increasing flexibility too.
I would like to end by thanking the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, once again for their very valuable contribution.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0233/2002) tabled by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the mid-term review of the 2000-2003 Daphne Programme [2001/2265(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, in this report we are analysing the DAPHNE programme, its implementation, its achievements and its failings.
It is a programme to combat violence against women and children, essentially in the domestic environment.
This violence is a serious violation of their fundamental rights.
Violence against women results from the unequal relationship between men and women and the sex discrimination which exists in society.
The fight against violence requires an integrated approach which combines prevention, dealing with aggressors and support for victims.
The European Commission has carried out an exhaustive and rigorous mid-term assessment report on the programme, which allows us to make proposals for the future with a view to achieving the objective of 'zero violence'.
Violence against women and children takes place in all countries, regardless of class, race or level of education.
This violence is an obstacle to achieving equality and perpetuates inequalities.
We must point out the insufficient budgetary contribution to this programme, which has only allowed a third of the projects presented to be funded.
We must pay special attention to the prevention of violence, but also to the treatment and rehabilitation of aggressors in order to prevent re-offending.
It is essential to create teaching programmes aimed at preventing violence, to be used in schools and adult education centres.
We must involve all sectors of society in the fight against violence, and in particular the media, as opinion formers and instruments for the transmission of values, so that, by means of the media, a non-stereotypical image of women may be transmitted, also of children and of victims in general.
The way news about acts of violence is transmitted is also essential to the subsequent evaluation of them.
The NGOs have played an important role in the fight against violence, but the public institutions must also be involved - so far only 10% of the programmes have been implemented by them - as well as universities and study and research centres.
We need more information on real violence, since we only have knowledge of a small proportion of it.
We must have common indicators and a common database.
The Member States should update their legislation so that they have more appropriate instruments for combating violence.
In certain countries there already exists the right to remove the aggressor from the shared home, with the corresponding accompanying measures.
The victims must be protected and we must ensure that it is not they who have to flee and hide.
Better police training in this field would be of great help.
The DAPHNE Programme should continue after this one ends, since the problem unfortunately persists and we know that it is difficult to eradicate, and therefore actions taken to increase awareness in society and try to change the sexist mentality which still persists must be welcomed.
Amongst these measures we propose a European Year for combating violence against women and children.
Finally, I would like to point to the need to change the legal basis of the Programme.
This is the right time to do so, since the European Convention which is reviewing and updating the Treaty has the opportunity to modify it, and I would therefore affectionately ask Commissioner Vitorino, whose sensitivity towards all these problems we are well aware of, to insist, to apply pressure, to do everything humanly possible to introduce into the Treaty a legal basis which facilitates the fight against violence towards women and children throughout the European Union.
I am aware of the difficulties involved in this, but I trust in your ability to achieve it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea on the excellent report she has presented to this plenary sitting today.
I believe that the most important conclusion to be drawn from it is that the Commission and Parliament are agreed on uniting their efforts to combat the problems of violence, particularly problems of violence against women and children.
Parliament is supporting this programme with the resolution that has been proposed, a programme that is still - I admit - modest, but which the Commission is extremely proud to have created.
I particularly welcome the fact that the European Parliament acknowledges the success of the actions already undertaken and is warming to the idea that the programme must continue beyond 2003.
The Commission, for its part, is ready to present the text of the decision on the new Daphne programme, in line with the concerns expressed in the motion for a resolution.
In order to do this, however, I must address the issue that the rapporteur raised on the legal base of the programme.
The Daphne programme today takes as its legal base Article 152 of the EC Treaty on health protection.
The Article might appear to be far-removed from concerns about violence, but violence is clearly much more than simply a health issue, because it is also a health concern; involving both physical and psychological health.
I fully agree that violence against children and against women is an unacceptable breach of their rights as human beings.
Nevertheless, within the scope of the Treaties in their current state, the Commission has no alternative but to initiate actions against violence under Article 152.
This is the situation, regardless of the future position of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union, within the scope of the Treaty or outside it.
Nevertheless, the current situation must not prevent us from trying to improve it.
The Commission will shortly be proposing a directive on equality between men and women outside the workplace.
The directive will exclude action against violence, because its legal base, Article 13 of the Treaty, does not provide for actions in this area.
We must, for this very reason, pursue the discussion and I am pleased to note the suggestion of this House, which the rapporteur has just made, that the discussion of this matter by the Members of the Convention could focus on a proposal on violence, with its own specific legal base in the Treaty.
Since I am one of the representatives of the Commission in the Convention, I shall certainly support Parliament's request when the matter is discussed in the Convention.
Obviously, in a discussion of this type we will have to take into consideration and balance the various competences between the States Members and the Union as a whole.
In other words, if we - both the Parliament and the Commission - want a new Daphne Programme, which is ready to start at the beginning of 2004, the Commission has no alternative but to once again use Article 152 of the Treaty.
The success of this programme is clearly expressed in the large number of projects that have been submitted.
It must be acknowledged, however, that this sign of success is also a cause for concern.
It means that the number of violent situations and the number of cases of violence against women and children in the countries of the European Union is still very high.
Therefore, the rapporteur's request for an increased budget is in line with the observations made by the Commission, especially if we bear in mind the expected increase in work in this field, following the accession of the candidate countries.
In addition to the support given by this Parliament to the Daphne Programme, the suggestions contained in the motion for a resolution are useful and are fully in line with the discussions that have taken place in the Commission.
I am referring, in particular, to the idea of giving priority to prevention, for which civil society, non-governmental organisations and the public authorities with competence in the field must be mobilised.
I am referring to the concern to develop an ongoing educational programme in schools, and also in the media, to combat stigma and cultural prejudices that still predominate in our societies.
I am referring most specifically to the need for common indicators and to the need to undertake a more comprehensive collection of data on violence at European level, because this situation is often hidden from view and disappears in official statistics.
This is also a need felt by the Commission and future activity could be tied in with the current action of setting up a network of experts on fundamental rights.
In fact, following a request by the European Parliament, this new action to create a network of European experts in the field of fundamental rights under budget line B-5850 in 2002, which the Commission has already started to finalise, will enable a close relationship to be established between this network of experts and the objectives of the Daphne programme, in addition to emphasising something that is of considerable importance. This is the dimension of the breach of fundamental rights that all violence against women and children represents and which we shall continue to fight.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her broad-based approach to the problem of violence and its many expressions and for proposing that we continue and make better use of this programme.
Our mid-term report assesses how far we have come in raising awareness of the problem of violence and how to deal with it.
However, the painful truth is that violence persists in our society, forcing us to adopt more radical and efficient measures, such as introducing a legal basis in the Treaty or organising a European year on this topic, as the rapporteur suggests.
I, for one, am very keen to see a wide-ranging information campaign using every possible means and involving every agency in the overall campaign in the European Union and the candidate countries, which will reach small, particularly remote societies where, as we know, violence persists in the family, in schools and on the streets.
And, over and above this objective, we need to encourage the whole of local society to get involved, as the Commissioner has already said.
Taking stock so far, we can see that, although the programme is open to regional and local authorities, their level of involvement is only somewhere in the region of 10%, while non-governmental organisations working at local and regional level are prevented from taking part by the need to create internal links by finding partners in other Member States and by the complicated management of the programme.
It is therefore vital, I think, that the final report contain an in-depth analysis of the quantitative and qualitative involvement of the various agencies and the mechanisms they use to cooperate and of the impact which the programmes have on local society.
This will help us study and propose new ways of ensuring small agencies join the programme and areas in which little action has been taken so far, such as reviewing educational programmes which generate violence and educating teachers and journalists.
Similarly, if we are to make better use of the programme, we need to look at it in relation to other, similar programmes, especially national programmes to reduce violence and help victims.
Mr President, violence against women and children, despite having been condemned in successive UN and European Union resolutions for constituting an unacceptable and intolerable breach of their fundamental rights, is still a reality in our society, including in Portugal.
Especially domestic violence, one of the most common forms of violence, although one of the least visible, and which involves huge human, social and economic costs for all of society, in addition to being a threat to the safety, the physical integrity, the freedom and the dignity of women.
Hence the importance of an integrated approach enhancing the measures, actions and financial means which the Daphne programme provides for, but which are insufficient, as has also already been emphasised.
Furthermore, as the report states - and I must congratulate the rapporteur - in the European Union around 500 000 people per year, the majority of whom are women and children, are victims of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which also requires more effective measures in the fight against all forms of violence and in supporting victims, including increasing the financial means that are currently earmarked for this purpose.
I should also like to draw attention, however, to the field of prevention, by creating more high-quality employment, better social provision and support and by paying greater attention to education against violence, by providing more information and improving promotion of women and children's rights.
I therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take account of the proposals put forward by Parliament, capitalising on the experience gained since 1997 and presenting a new action programme with appropriate financial appropriations, and also counting on the full participation of the candidate countries and the creation of a common database to eliminate violence.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you know that this report has been unanimously accepted without amendments.
There are no contradictions in this report and in this revision of the Daphne programme.
Everyone is in agreement.
This initiative, instigated by the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, has been a great success.
Not only in Europe but also in many distant regions of the world, as my fellow MEPs have already mentioned.
Sadly, it cannot be regarded as an unqualified success, as the Commissioner has already indicated.
This programme may be drawing to a close, but I have heard many positive indications that it could continue although there may not be sufficient funds in view of all the associated problems.
One of the questions I should now like to raise is whether, in the case where certain projects have been approved by the Commission but cannot be funded, the Commission and your Commissioner could not recommend that the Member States, who are after all responsible for the projects, should take over a project.
This would mean that a project would be funded by a Member State instead of the Commission, encouraging the Member States to undertake high-profile activities in their own country, perhaps also involving NGOs and public bodies such as local councils.
The Spanish Presidency has selected violence against women as one of its priorities.
This led to a major study into the measures taken by various Member States and an examination of best practice.
The Danish Presidency continued along this path, but I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to one particular aspect which I think deserves more funding: violence within the family.
Why?
A survey conducted among the Antwerp police showed that 70% of all police work related to events directly connected with violence within the family.
This includes incest, attacks by children on their parents and vice versa. Violence against elderly relatives, psychological problems, physical and mental violence before and after divorce, when exercising visiting rights or in the case of a newly formed family unit.
I am not just talking about children who grow up in a violent family and so see this behaviour as normal, but also of a general blurring of moral standards.
Sometimes the reverse occurs: one of the parents grew up in a disruptive or violent family and wants to spare their children this experience at whatever cost.
This parent becomes over-protective and exerts too much discipline.
The other family members either accept this situation or feel oppressed and rebel.
In situations like this children may run away from home or attack their parents.
Or girls growing up in circumstances like this later on unconsciously choose a tyrannical partner and often become the victim of domestic violence.
Making all these problems a fit topic for discussion in our society opened up a Pandora's box.
We cannot abandon the victims to their fate, failing to provide support or a way out.
I'm thinking here not just of the traditional activities like helplines, reception centres and safe houses, but also of training projects.
Training and educational projects for people when they first come into contact with a possible victim and have the opportunity to help him or her out of their isolation: groups like doctors, teachers and police officers.
Because acting when violence first occurs also prevents escalation and is the most important step in prevention.
I should also like to stress just how important Daphne is.
It was a project undertaken by a number of NGOs in various countries together with an international organisation: the International Organisation for Migration.
They devised a project in the context of cooperation in helping the victims of human trafficking.
That project was very successful, which is why I see it as so important that the projects can be continued and further refined.
In fact, on 17 October the European Parliament will be holding a round table presenting a video, a brochure and a website where politicians like ourselves, police officers, journalists, researchers and students can obtain information.
I should just like to tell my colleagues how important this is.
Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea expressed it very well.
We need the International Year against Violence, and subsidies.
Perhaps we should put more pressure on our Member States to get involved.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her work, on the figures and statistics presented, which, although there is a lack of homogenous data, reveal that violence against women and children is an extremely disturbing phenomenon.
The most recent data on domestic violence and violence within the home, which reveal how one in five women is the victim of violent acts committed by her husband or partner, are incredible. These acts of violence are often never exposed and sometimes even end in the murder of the victim.
In the face of such tragic figures, we are astounded at the allocation of such an inadequate sum, even taking into account the increase of the 2002 budget by EUR 1 million.
We are also astounded that public bodies have only accounted for 10% of the participants.
The role of public bodies is, indeed, decisive, both in terms of training specialised staff and in terms of the provision of information on and prevention of acts of violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children.
In particular, we need to create or improve counselling and legal advice centres which will be able to guarantee and provide maximum protection for the victims, as well as free psychological and legal assistance.
It would be desirable to include teaching spaces dedicated to the prevention of child abuse and domestic violence in school curricula.
Lastly, my group fully supports the idea of a European year of action to combat violence against women and children.
However, I agree with my colleagues: if the legal basis is not changed, there is little of actual practical, effective use we can do to combat these terrible offences.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission because this is the result of perseverance and of having believed in something which had never before been dealt with.
Therefore, in recent years, during this legislature and during previous ones, a European awareness is being created of the problems of violence against women, against children and in the home.
I believe we should insist on this working approach despite the fact that it is difficult to introduce the credibility and importance of these ideas into the policies of the countries.
Let us consider what is happening in many European countries. Organised prostitution, domestic violence, the alarming increase in violence against children and the abandonment of many of them by their families, demonstrate that we are talking about an issue which must be dealt with through a system of shared competences.
In this regard, I fully support the proposals of Mrs AvilÃ©s and I very much agree with what the Commissioner has said.
To put it another way, Europe must create a minimum referential legal framework both for violence in the home and the obligation of the States to protect the victims and for trying to prevent the irreversible damage being done to children who are witnesses to horrors, minors who live in an atmosphere of fear and who cannot escape violence.
Furthermore, it is very clear, and I would like to stress this, that the majority of abandoned children and those who suffer horrors in their own homes are in this situation because the family has broken down or has never existed.
Consequently, their protection and education cannot be dealt with within the family framework.
Other protection and defence strategies must be put in place since sometimes the family is a repressive environment.
Furthermore, I have the feeling that we are getting used to so many cases arising.
In this regard, I would ask for the implementation of a right for children which is binding for the Member States and that this obligation be taken into account when discussing the countries which are to join the European Union.
It is impossible to carry on working without a basic legal framework, particularly when we know we are not protecting the victims.
Mr President, without doubt the DAPHNE programme was a very successful initiative on the part of the European Commission; but it was also brought about by pressure from the Committee on Women's Rights and the campaign which it started in 1997 under the slogan 'Violence against Women: Zero Tolerance', a slogan, Commissioner, which is as topical now as it was then, given that violence or, to be more exact, terrorism and the war against women are waxing rather than waning both in Europe and worldwide.
Horrendous reports from the numerous fronts in this absurd and merciless war reach our ears daily, especially from countries with which the European Union has concluded political and economic agreements, from Nigeria and Sudan, where fanatical Islamic courts condemn innocent women to death by stoning, from India, where little girls just ten years old are forced to marry, and from the Arab Emirates, where women still have no independence, i.e. political rights.
Reports of this savage war against women appear in the press daily, even if they do not make the front page.
In the European Union, as members have already said, it is estimated that over 500 000 women and children are bought and sold every day and yet Europol only has three officers working on this international organised crime against women and children.
A percentage of European women which, depending on the country, varies from 20 to 50%, has fallen victim to domestic violence, while rape and sexual harassment are a daily occurrence.
Communities of Islamic immigrants quote holy scripture and religious mores as an excuse for continuing their barbaric practices, such as the sexual mutilation of women, even inside the European Union.
Unfortunately, in the year 2002, millions of women in numerous areas and communities around the world are still treated as chattels rather than human beings.
Our committee considers violence against women to be a very serious violation of the human rights of half of mankind, a modern form of barbarism tolerated by patriarchal societies and institutions alike.
As the fight for sexual equality and de facto recognition of the rights of half the population on planet Earth steps up, so does violence against women.
This means that violence is a global political problem of the first degree and must be tackled as such.
Apart from its financial dimension - it must be said that the money is minimal compared with the size of the problem - the DAPHNE programme is of great political value, which is why it must continue beyond 2003, hopefully with a larger budget.
We trust the new Treaty will give a stronger legal basis to the fight against violence.
Our rapporteur, Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, has drafted a very valuable report and has tabled proposals on behalf of our committee which I ask you, Commissioner, to take on board.
Mr President, at the moment I can do little more than thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for this excellent report.
I also thank the Commissioner for his response to the report and his commitment to renew this programme.
I am a patron of an organisation in Ireland called Women's Aid.
It is a national organisation which has benefited greatly from the Daphne programme.
It provides shelter for women and children who are the victims of domestic violence.
It also provides advocacy and public education and research.
The problem we are dealing with here is deeply ingrained in our society, not just in far-off, distant societies which have particular religious views in relation to women.
In Europe also there is a deeply ingrained misogyny in our society.
It is not going to be rooted out overnight.
It will require education and addressing the culture that we live in; it requires addressing the attitudes of our media.
Our hope lies with our children and in trying to ensure that we inculcate in them a respect for the dignity of every human being, male and female, adult and child alike.
Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this debate and to emphasise the political visibility given to this issue by the Spanish Presidency, which created a momentum which, I feel sure, will be maintained by the current Danish Presidency, during which I hope that the framework decision on the trafficking of women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation will finally be approved by the Council.
We are extremely close to achieving this approval and I hope that it will be formalised during this presidency.
The only substantial answer that I should like to give at the moment concerns funding.
I believe that it is sometimes tempting to think that, when an activity is eligible for Community funding, Community monies can be a replacement for national funding.
In reality, however, the rules of our conception state that Community funding is additional to national funding in a task of this scale and of this political importance.
Hence the importance that the Commission attaches to the public authorities of the Member States also being able to apply for the Daphne programme, because this would create a situation that encourages the Member States themselves to participate in projects and to invest financial means in combating violence against women and children.
There is one problem, however, that I do not wish to ignore: the issue of the debate on funding is very closely related to that of the legal base.
A clear, explicit and solid legal base in the Treaty would provide another lever for the funding of a project of this nature.
As long as we have to work within the scope of Article 152 we shall continue to have problems.
I sincerely hope that, with this debate, we might reach agreement on the joint efforts to be developed in the Convention so that the future Constitutional Treaty of the European Union enshrines the fight against violence towards women and children as an objective of the Treaty on European Union itself.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0256/2002) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Legal Affairs, on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda [2001/2241(INI)].
The purpose of the annual scoreboard for the implementation of the social policy agenda is to ascertain how much progress has been made towards the objectives laid down in Lisbon and Nice.
The essence of these objectives is the creation of a European social model to eliminate poverty and unemployment, create high-status jobs, encourage lifelong learning, modernise the social security system and do away with all forms of discrimination.
The 2000-2006 period is a crucial time in this respect as changes in the economy, demographics and migration have rarely been as great as they are now.
It is therefore to be expected that Parliament, as the mouthpiece par excellence of what is of concern to the European population, should keep a close watch on assessment of progress.
The document put before us by the Commission gives us a first-class overview of the activities which have been undertaken and of what we can expect in the near future.
But what is missing - and this is my main criticism - is a six-year summary of what has to be done.
Parliament takes the view that the extent of annual progress can only really be judged in the light of the targets set for the six-year period in question.
Parliament expects more from the Commission than an annual report.
It requires a six-year programme containing initiatives to be taken and the instruments to be used for each initiative, such as legislation, open coordination or negotiations between social partners, and deadlines for the completion of these initiatives.
As part of its interim evaluation in 2003, the Commission must attempt to work out a different type of scoreboard and present it to Parliament.
Parliament already made this request last year and is repeating it this year.
This brings me on to my second criticism: the lack of Parliament's involvement.
The Commission knows full well that the European Parliament is the greatest advocate of the social aspect of European development, much more so than the Council of Ministers.
We have plenty of examples of this, starting with European legislation which Parliament usually pushes further than the Council of Ministers would like.
I therefore fail to understand why the Commission took so little trouble to involve Parliament at an early stage in devising the social policy programme.
The Commission's document is dated 19 February 2002 and was approved at the Spring Summit in March.
Parliament needs at least 2 months to produce a report through its committees and plenary sessions, and that does not give us much time.
I would therefore advise the Commission to ensure that it submits its next report by the end of December, so that a useful dialogue with Parliament can be organised.
It should be possible for this dialogue to progress positively and quickly if the Commission takes account of the comments made in Parliament's two previous reports.
Finally, a few words on one of the instruments of social policy, open coordination.
The success of this method lies in the fact that it has given us a way to coordinate the policy of the 15 Member States, to bring the 15 Member States behind a coherent set of objectives and to provide the 15 Member States with best practices to achieve those objectives.
And all this in areas where binding European Union legislation is not desirable or not possible.
The difficulty for Parliament is that its involvement is not, or not adequately, regulated.
The method has a high input from many groups outside this Parliament.
This raises the question of whether the use of the open coordination method and the participation of the European Parliament can be better aligned in the context of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference.
We hope the Commission will support us in this.
Mr President, I should like to make a point of thanking Mrs Smet for her report on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda.
As she quite rightly points out, the social policy agenda for the years 2000 to 2006 is the first common commitment adopted, including by the Council, and the first European charter of social commitments and actions.
The first year, 2001, was a special case which we discussed last year.
It was the first year we ran it and it had serious shortcomings and problems.
This year, we have our first detailed scoreboard, containing a step by step analysis of the progress made in this particular policy area.
The comment last year was that the description only applied to the Commission.
I think it is clear that, this year, we have a detailed description of all the agencies involved in each action.
One example is the proposal for socially sensitive restructuring in the business sector, which describes the role of the Commission, the European Parliament, the social agencies, the social partners, governments and civil society.
Of course I agree with Mrs Smet and her comment in the report that we should always look forward as well as back, i.e. not just to how specific agencies have been involved but also to the objectives they have set for the following stages.
The following stages will be examined to a certain extent in the first mid-term review in 2003.
The period from 2003 to 2005 is also important.
There will be an initial progress report and we shall be able to make any changes deemed necessary.
I should point out here that the European Parliament will be fully involved in this mid-term review because as Mrs Smet says, and I am sure no-one disagrees, Europe's basic ally in all social policy proposals is the European Parliament.
It is more often than not Parliament which is the driving force behind the European Union in social policy.
I should like to comment on three points which I feel are instrumental to the debate.
First that, with cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament, most of the social policy agenda initiatives planned for 2000 to 2002 have been brought to a successful conclusion or are under way.
Secondly, as has already been mentioned, we have found a modus operandi with the method of open cooperation between the Member States and, to a certain extent, a way of including the role of Parliament in this method.
Of course, this is a first step and what we need to do is identify the basic, fundamental role of the European Parliament and this is something the Convention will need to address.
The third point is that, as with the European Parliament, we need to find a legal basis for involving civil society in discussions in the Convention.
I should like to make a point of thanking the European Parliament for its constructive cooperation.
We look forward to receiving your individual comments.
Mr President, the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda is obviously extremely valuable because it allows us to draw conclusions as to the progress made.
I have had the honour of drafting the relevant opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights.
To be perfectly honest, I had little to add to the very detailed report drafted by Mrs Smet, who also happens to be an active member of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights.
The importance and value to women of implementing this agenda is obvious, given that, over recent years, most increases in employment have affected women.
Around two-thirds of the new jobs which it is estimated will be created between 2002 and 2010 will be filled by women, which is why I was especially pleased, Commissioner, with your communication a short while ago about the new initiatives which you have taken on behalf of the Commission to coordinate economic policy and employment policy.
The procedure for assessing progress, despite the shortcomings pointed out by Mrs Smet in her report, is without doubt a very useful tool, especially at a time of economic recession, when the pressure is on to relax social policy and to abandon efforts to reduce economic inequalities and combat social exclusion.
We therefore welcome the initiative taken by the Danish Presidency to highlight the problem of social exclusion and the various repercussions that social exclusion has on the two sexes.
Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Smet on her excellent work.
The scoreboard on the application of the Social Agenda must allow the progress made in terms of the application of that Agenda to be monitored, but it must also act as a rapid alarm call when there are delays in the implementation of the measures announced.
I believe that the rapporteur has been able to harmonise both aspects in her report.
Furthermore, in its application, the Social Agenda should not, in my humble opinion, be treated as an unaltered or unalterable programme.
Designed by people for people, I see it as an evolving programme which demands subsequent adjustments, as the mid-term assessment of the progress achieved, to be carried out in 2003, will demonstrate.
Commissioner, much has been done in terms of the development of the European social model, but I would venture to say that there remains much to be done, and in different fields. Sex equality policy, measures to combat social exclusion and poverty, policies on the integrating of disabled people socially and taking advantage of the capacities they do have, and opting for life-long learning and training and, with it, the need to adapt to the new forms of work and the reconciliation of work with family life.
In any event, there is a demand which I would like to highlight and draw the Commission's attention to.
I am referring to the new forms of work, with the new risks inherent in them and therefore the concern about the forms of participation in productive processes by means of productive externalisation or decentralisation - subcontracting, the presence of freelancers, independent workers - in the field of the risks of the contracting company, etc.
Hence the need for the application of measures aimed at preventing risk - inherent in all forms of work, but sometimes imperceptible and blurred in the context of these new forms of production - being converted into work accidents.
I believe that these measures would be viable for all workers, employers and society.
Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on this report and indeed congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her very excellent work in this area of social policy.
A major step forward was made for the European Union at the Lisbon Summit, in its commitment not only to a competitive, dynamic economy but also to a society which is cohesive and based on full employment.
Too often we hear spokesmen from the various political groups talking purely about the idea of a competitive economy and ignoring the balance we need to ensure within the European Union in terms of modernising and deepening the social model that we have in Europe.
The Nice Summit also took a major step forward in adopting the new social agenda.
If we had had a referendum in Ireland on that, rather than on the Treaty of Nice, it would have received 100% support.
Unfortunately we do not have to vote on these issues at this stage.
But it was an important advance.
I have to say, however, that progress seems to have considerably slowed down since then.
I have no doubt there are forces or elements in the European Union - both in the Commission and in the Council - which are deliberately seeking to slow down progress on this agenda.
It seems to me to be short-sighted.
If we are serious about creating a European Union which has the support of the citizens, we must give a balanced commitment to the development of a social Europe.
Even for the centre right it makes sense.
If they are serious about Europe and creating a Europe of states and peoples, then we must ensure that equality, cohesion and solidarity rule right across the Union.
I feel there are inadequacies in the scoreboard itself.
Not all the progress has yet been measured.
I welcome the idea of a mid-term review for early next year and I look forward to participating in it.
I hope that in the years ahead, particularly in the Convention and the subsequent IGC, we can succeed in ensuring that the commitment that began to be developed in Lisbon and subsequently in Nice can be incorporated and deepened in a constitution for the European Union which guarantees that we have not only a competitive Europe but a Europe that cares equally for all of its citizens.
Mr President, I too should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Smet on having, as usual, done a sterling job.
In my own country, Sweden, a national election campaign is under way right now.
Those in Sweden who belong to the same political group as Mrs Smet usually maintain that the social agenda is not something for Europe but that social policy is a matter only for the individual Member States.
I usually put forward Mrs Smet's view.
Despite our belonging to different political groups, we are in complete agreement about the need for national social agendas.
A European social agenda is also needed, however, as something which is becoming more and more important.
Like Mr De Rossa, I approve of what happened in Lisbon.
Incredible progress was made, and we succeeded in broadening and deepening the social agenda.
At the same time, I am rather uneasy about the signals which have been produced in the course of last year and which I see in terms of attempts to throw the Lisbon process off balance.
The talk now is simply of companies and of competition between companies, and the social dimension is forgotten.
It is therefore good that there are MEPs who wish to go beyond party boundaries in promoting the social aspects, and I wish again to congratulate both the Commission and Mrs Smet on their work.
I also share Mrs Smet's views on the scoreboard, namely to the effect that it must be more forward-looking and strategic and be based upon the conclusions from the spring European Councils.
I hope that the Commission too will take that view on board, as well as the open coordination method, which is something to which we have returned time and again.
We have debated this on many occasions, and I am myself a proponent of the open coordination method.
It has meant that we have been able to develop cooperation in new areas.
If the open coordination method is to be successful in the long term, it must not however be applied behind closed doors.
If the method is to be employed for a long time, it must be subject to democratic control and be debated both here in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments.
We must hope that the Convention will get to grips with this issue so that the open coordination method is taken account of in the Treaties.
The social agenda is important in another perspective too, namely people's willingness to take the EU project to heart.
The social agenda concerns precisely those questions that people consider to be important - the fight against poverty, together with increased employment and a more just society - and that is why the social agenda is important.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Social Policy Agenda is a dynamic programme and, therefore, likely to be adjusted.
Hence the importance of the annual assessment panel, enabling the European Parliament to monitor and control the implementation of the Social Agenda, analysing the past and programming the future.
The rapporteur, Mrs Smet, has presented a magnificent price of work, which criticises the Commission communication and lays bare its weak points, as well as making clear and lucid contributions to the future implementation of the Agenda.
Employment is the European Union's number one priority.
In 2000, the employment rate reached 63.2%.
Despite the creation of around 3 million new jobs, it is still 7% below the Lisbon Summit objective for 2010 and the number of unemployed still persists, at 14.5 million European citizens.
The low employment rates of older workers, the disparities between men and women, both in terms of the employment rate and of remuneration (18% and 14% respectively) the high levels of unemployment - around of 8% of the workforce - and regional differences in employment constitute structural weaknesses that require attention and active measures.
The committed involvement of the social partners is crucial.
Poverty and social exclusion are other issues that deserve increased attention.
More than 60 million people are living at risk of poverty.
This phenomenon varies, as is known, between Member States, but we are not mistaken in considering the fight against poverty and exclusion and their eradication to be the greatest challenge facing us.
Therefore, the Commission must speed up the works that are underway in the aim of understanding and assessing the phenomenon, paying particular attention to women.
With regard to promoting equal treatment between men and women, this Commission assessment panel still lacks an overall strategic approach.
Consequently, the Commission must propose measures to improve the situation of women and, in parallel, to adopt initiatives to promote their full participation in decision-making in the workplace.
Mr President, I share the regret expressed by Mrs Smet in her report about the delay in submitting the contents of the last scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda.
The social agenda, as we all know, is not a set of social policy proposals, it is a strategic plan to modernise the European social model and face up to future problems and challenges.
A single annual scoreboard would create a strategic mechanism for evaluating progress in policies and any adjustments deemed necessary.
Now we see that the scoreboard method falls short of these ambitious aims.
The report looks more like a routine job than a fundamental approach.
It tends towards the superficial and hardly looks like an integrated tool for analysing the current situation, allowing a proper appraisal of progress, programming future action in areas broached by the European Commission, such as integration of the disabled, involvement of the elderly, worker mobility and outstanding legislative proposals, or suggesting new topics.
Another comment I have to make is that it does not highlight the entrepreneurial aspect of social development plans, even though our new perception of European policy includes this aspect.
Then there is the outstanding question of cooperation with and the involvement of the social partners and the Economic and Social Committee and the subject and results of social dialogue, although I was pleased to hear the Commissioner refer to efforts to start up a dialogue with civil society.
So we need to make more of an effort with the form and content of the mid-term review, which the European Parliament expects to receive before the next spring Council because, as you know, Commissioner, it wishes to play a part in shaping social Europe, and rightly so.
Mr President, I should like to extend my special thanks to the honourable Members for their interventions, which we shall take into account, as we did last year.
I should just like to reply to some of the Members' comments.
Obviously the report reflects efforts which have either been completed or are under way and legislative activities which have either been completed or are at the consultation stage.
However, all it can do is reflect the Commission's possibilities under the Treaty, as far as Parliament's and the Council's proposals and possibilities at later stages are concerned.
I say that because topics such as the disabled or the elderly, which Mrs ?ratsa mentioned, and other special social policies are, as we all know, purely national policies at present.
The debate at this stage of the Convention is extremely tense and I think that all of us who support the need for a European dimension to social policy have a huge political opportunity, at this stage of the game, to bring about change, including at the Convention.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
. (PT) We welcome the fact that on an issue as sensitive and as topical as the definition and harmonisation of operational standards to make air navigation safer, a broad consensus has been reached between the actors involved, resulting in an agreement between the various operators on limiting flight times and crew rest requirements.
We therefore share the rapporteur's conclusions, because they reveal the urgent need for the gradual adoption of technical standards guaranteeing increasingly high safety standards and in the aim, furthermore, of enabling passengers to have the utmost confidence in European air transport.
. (PT) As the rapporteur states, 'The oversight and enforcement of the implementation of EU environmental law is already very unsatisfactory'.
In fact, in a field which is increasingly important to Europe's citizens, who are already aware of the importance of managing, rationalising and protecting their environment, we are still seeing on a regular basis, brutal attacks on what is everyone's cultural heritage. This betrays an inadequate legislative framework and unsatisfactory coordination between actors and the Community authorities.
In order to end this state of affairs, better monitoring and practical and firm action are required on the basis of the reports sent by the Member States to the European Commission every three years.
Incidentally, we are seeing worrying levels of delay in implementing infringement procedures.
Everything must be done, therefore, to enable the Commission 'to come up with a coherent picture of what is happening over a whole sector of policy - as with waste management', thereby responding to the increasing and increasingly insistent concerns of Europe's citizens.
Hence my vote in favour of this report.
Iraq
The first item is the Council and Commission statements on Iraq followed by a debate.
Mr President, I should like to say thank you for this opportunity to discuss this particularly topical subject.
The debate occurs at a time when growing international attention is being paid to Iraq, and the situation is one about which practically all the media are speculating on a daily basis, this morning too, as we have no doubt all seen.
It is important to emphasise that the EU and the countries of Europe do not have any quarrel with the Iraqi people.
Historically, Iraq has contributed to the region in many ways, and the Iraqi refugees who at present live in Europe mostly make positive contributions to the countries in which they live.
In 1990, the Iraqi regime chose, however, to invade the small defenceless neighbouring country of Kuwait.
A broad coalition of countries from all around the world stood shoulder to shoulder in repelling this aggression.
After the international community, headed by the United States, had liberated Kuwait, Iraq agreed to a ceasefire involving a list of conditions aimed at ending the war over Kuwait.
Iraq agreed, among other things, to give up all its weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.
As soon as the UN is able to confirm that Iraq has complied with its obligations to destroy existing stocks of weapons of mass destruction and to stop developing new weapons of this kind, it will be possible to lift the sanctions.
Unfortunately, the Iraqi regime has chosen over the last 12 years not to cooperate fully in phasing out the country's weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.
In 1991, the UN Security Council set up its first commission of inquiry, UNSCOM (United Nations Special Commission), which was offered completely unacceptable working conditions by the Iraqi regime, culminating in the regime's refusal, in 1998, to give UNSCOM further access to Iraqi territory.
Through Resolution 1284 of December 1999, the Security Council set up a new supervisory committee, UNMOVIC (United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Committee) to replace UNSCOM.
UNMOVIC too, however, was refused permission by the Iraqi authorities to enter Iraq under conditions that would enable it to carry out its tasks.
In recent years, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made a sustained effort to convince the Iraqi regime to allow the weapons inspectors to fulfil their task so that Iraq is able to comply with the ceasefire conditions laid down more than ten years ago.
So far, these efforts have been fruitless.
Iraq continues to make new demands and to lay down further conditions and it still refuses to give the weapons inspectors free and unconditional access.
The economic and social situation in Iraq has become worse and worse since the Gulf War.
Infant mortality in central and southern Iraq is at present twice as high as in the period before the Gulf War.
Malnutrition is generally more severe.
The school system suffers from a lack of materials, and the infrastructure and water and sewage systems are in urgent need of renovation and development.
Iraq has gone from being a relatively wealthy country enjoying economic growth to being a country with a shrinking economy and a humanitarian situation of critical proportions.
The suffering particularly affects the weakest groups - women, children and the poor - together with those groups that do not support Saddam Hussein's regime.
Very significant humanitarian aid is therefore being provided to Iraq.
The EU's emergency aid programme, ECHO, is the biggest single donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, but the UN system, the International Red Cross and associated donors are also active in the humanitarian sphere.
To counteract the consequences of the sanctions for the civilian population, the Oil for Food' programme has been set up, allowing Iraq to supplement its own production of food and medicine with imports funded from the country's oil income.
The Security Council proposed the 'Oil for Food' programme as long ago as 1991 but, because of reluctance and delay on the part of Iraq, the programme was not implemented until December 1996.
The UN revised the 'Oil for Food' programme by means of Security Council Resolution 1409 of 14 May 2002.
Income from the 'Oil for Food' programme is to be used for food and for medicine and other health sector resources, as well as for materials and supplies for civilian purposes in Iraq, including equipment for maintaining the oil sector.
Under the revised 'Oil for Food' programme, most goods can be exported to Iraq without any problem, at the same time as there being tighter controls on goods that may be used for producing weapons, including weapons of mass destruction.
The UN Security Council is dealing with the international community's position on the Iraq issue.
The UN Secretary-General has been in contact with Iraq's Foreign Minister on a number of occasions this year in efforts to end the present deadlock.
The latest contact took place yesterday.
These efforts have not yet produced practical results, however.
The EU's position is clear and was most recently expressed in a declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the EU on 20 May 2002, stating that:

'The European Union welcomes the meetings between the Iraqi foreign minister and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the question of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, through full implementation of the Security Council Resolutions and compliance by Iraq with its disarmament obligations.
The European Union reaffirms its attachment to the unconditional observance of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions.
It calls on Iraq to comply with the Resolutions without delay, in particular by agreeing to the return of inspectors to Iraq in accordance with Resolution 1284.
The European Union unreservedly supports all efforts on the part of the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The European Union welcomes the Security Council's adoption of Resolution 1409 of 14 May 2002 which significantly eases the United Nations sanctions on Iraq.
The new 'Oil for Food' programme will allow Iraq to import civilian goods more freely, while maintaining strict control on dual use goods.
Such control remains necessary owing to the continuing concern of the international community regarding the potential use of these goods in mass-destruction or conventional weapons programmes.
The European Union calls upon Iraq to cooperate fully with this new sanctions regime, which should help improve the humanitarian situation and above all benefit the Iraqi people.'
There has been much speculation in the international press during the summer about a possible and imminent American attack on Iraq.
The American President has said that the United States wants to see a change of regime in Iraq.
That is something quite specific.
The President has also said that it will consult its European allies and partners.
That is something we are convinced will happen, if the occasion should arise.
Mr President, I do not simply want to repeat or parrot what the Minister has just said in his comprehensive speech about what has led up to the present situation.
So I will discard some of my remarks that would otherwise have been rather repetitive, which should allow even more honourable Members to take part in this exceptionally important and, I think in terms of procedure, almost unique debate.
Over the past few weeks Iraq has figured more and more prominently, as the Minister just said, on the international agenda.
The situation appears to be evolving day by day.
What is plain, whatever else may be doubtful, is that the risk of a very grave new crisis is increasing.
Many important voices have been raised, not least in Washington, about how to deal with Iraq and with the problems linked to its possession and development of weapons of mass destruction.
Positions have been expressed by many key players, including European governments.
I note from this morning's papers what was said only yesterday.
Against the background of this tumult of speeches and articles, I would like today simply to concentrate on the things we know with certainty and on which we should all be able to agree.
First, as pointed out by Baroness Nicholson's excellent overview of the present situation in Iraq, which we discussed in this Chamber last May - and I agree, incidentally, with everything the Minister said about our concern for the people of Iraq - we can have no doubt about the evil nature of the regime led by Saddam Hussein.
That was made manifest in the excellent report that we discussed in May, albeit, I have to say, with slightly fewer people in attendance than is the case this morning.
Terrible events have occurred throughout the 23 years of his rule: wars, aggression and brutal internal repression, including the use of chemical weapons against his own people.
There is, in his country, a total absence of basic human and civil rights and I have no doubt that the Iraqi people would be better served by new and different leadership.
Indeed, I would be surprised if anybody thought that they are best served by this leadership, not just the Iraqi people, but the Middle East region and indeed the whole world.
His is not the only regime that the world would be better off without - there are a lot of others as well - but it is certainly as high on the list as any.
Secondly, following the departure of UN inspectors in 1998, a UN Security Council Resolution, No 1284, which the minister referred to, was adopted in December 1999, establishing a new arms inspection entity, UNMOVIC, and setting out what Iraq has to do to have UN sanctions lifted.
Notably, it had to cooperate with the inspectors 'in all respects'.
This means that Iraq should give full unrestricted access to UNMOVIC inspectors to any site, area, equipment and installation at any moment without any conditions.
Yet Iraq never complied with this Security Council Resolution - just as it failed to cooperate with the UN throughout the 1990s - there were nine Security Council Resolutions - either refusing entry to UN inspectors, or imposing unacceptable conditions on their operations.
This House has always been absolutely clear about the importance of the UN in securing better global governance of our troubled planet and I do not think that you can exempt Iraq from those considerations.
According to the UNSCOM report of January 1999, there are legitimate suspicions that the Iraqi regime is developing weapons of mass destruction.
It is not the Commissioner for External Relations who is saying this, UNSCOM is saying it.
At this point in time, no clear evidence has emerged, although it should be noted that the Iraqi Government has not facilitated the task of the UNSCOM inspectors to gather evidence about this.
Whenever I think about this issue, one question crops up again and again. If the Iraqi regime has nothing to hide, why do they bar access to the UN-mandated inspectors?
It is not an unreasonable question to ask.
I think two conclusions stand out clearly, from whatever point people come to this argument and this debate, which is going to cause a great deal of passionate discussion in the next few weeks and months.
First, we must continue to press for full Iraqi compliance with the UN resolutions.
Is there anybody in Parliament who disagrees with that?
Good!
We have a consensus.
The situation may not quite exist in other countries yet, but at least we can begin in this Parliament with a consensus on that point.
The EU Presidency declaration of 20 May reaffirms European Union support for United Nations Security Resolution No 1284 and unhindered access for UNMOVIC inspectors.
Second, we must recognise that efforts to force Iraqi compliance are more likely to succeed if they are backed by a coalition of concerned parties as broad and effective as that which was put together with great diplomatic finesse in 1991 and which helped to secure the expulsion of Iraqi armed forces from Kuwait after the unprovoked invasion of that country.
We should also be looking for as broad an international coalition to secure UN compliance as possible.
Again, that seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable proposition.
We must all respect the authority of the United Nations and of international law.
The Security Council has charted the way forward in dealing with this intensely difficult problem and every nation should act within the framework of the decisions and resolutions issued by the United Nations.
Finally, the plight of Iraq's population - and this was a subject that we certainly discussed at some length on the basis of the honourable Member's report back in May - has highlighted the difficulty of dealing with a regime which is as ruthless as it is reckless.
Since the Gulf War in 1991 the EC has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq.
We have contributed over EUR 270 million.
Over the last three years we have provided assistance of some EUR 10 million annually.
In 2002 we shall provide around EUR 13 million.
Yet the impact of our help is reduced by the limitations placed upon it by Saddam Hussein's regime.
That is why we strongly welcomed UNSC Resolution No 1409, to which the Minister referred last May and which introduced so-called 'smart sanctions' intended to limit Saddam Hussein's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction while also limiting his ability to inflict hardship on his own population.
Meeting at Elsinore last weekend, Europe's Foreign Ministers called for full implementation of the UN resolutions and a resumption of inspections without excuses, without prevarication, without 'ifs' or 'buts'.
That is obviously the best way to proceed.
I would like to make a couple of personal remarks.
I hope that, as the debate on how to achieve these shared objectives continues in the coming weeks, it will shed light as well as generate heat.
We need to consider how we can best limit the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
We have to look at how we can continue successfully the international campaign against terrorism on as broad a front as possible.
We have to promote the end of violence in the Middle East, the restoration of a peace process and the establishment of a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel.
That is what Foreign Minister MÃžller in the office of presidency is trying to do this week in the Middle East, taking to the region a roadmap which suggests extremely convincingly what Europe thinks is the way to get back to peace talks and to get away from violence.
We have to prevent a gulf opening up between the democracies of Europe and North America and the Islamic World.
We have - and this may not be popular everywhere these remarks are heard - to encourage the development of participative democracy, civil society and the rule of law in all countries, including those which comprise the Arab World.
We have to think constructively about what can and should justify intervention by the international community in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
We have to think equally constructively about whether the global rule book that has by and large governed our affairs for the last 50 years is still valid or whether it requires some changes, how it can be reinforced and strengthened.
It is important that on all these issues, which are going to shape the sort of world we live in for the next decades, Europe's voice should be heard.
(Applause)
I would just like to offer one last thought: it is perhaps ironic that the debate on these far-reaching issues at the beginning of a new century is triggered by the question of how we should deal with a dictator whose rule exemplifies much of what was worst in the last century.
I just wish I were as certain about some of the answers to these questions as are many of those whose voices are currently raised so loud.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for this debate here and the debate in the international community is Saddam Hussein's dictatorial and criminal regime.
The focus of evil is in Iraq, not in the United States.
As both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have already pointed out, Saddam Hussein already has a history of using weapons of mass destruction against his own people and against Iraq's neighbours.
He invaded Kuwait.
If he is still stockpiling and producing weapons of mass destruction, that is a threat both to the Middle East and to the international community as a whole.
Anyone who wants to prevent a war must prevent Saddam Hussein from being able to use biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.
The way Saddam Hussein is flouting international law is quite unacceptable.
He is obliged to permit unconditional and unfettered checks by UN arms inspectors in Iraq.
That is what we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are calling for.
Saddam Hussein must comply with the demands of the United Nations.
That is why we must maintain pressure on this Iraqi dictator.
If we in Europe are not united, he will exploit that.
That is why it is unacceptable - and I am saying that very calmly - for the Federal Chancellor of Germany to talk about a German approach to this issue.
That will only encourage Saddam Hussein and weaken Europe's unity and solidarity.
We in the European Union will only have any influence if we act jointly.
There can be only one European approach.
America's President Bush has promised the allies close consultation.
We call on our American friends to share all the information they have with their European allies.
The use of force can only be justified if all other means fail.
The United Nations should have a monopoly when it comes to making decisions and taking action.
Military means should only be used if all other means fail, but even in that case the following questions need to be answered.
The first question is whether the coalition against terror that President Bush so impressively assembled after the events of 11 September will survive.
The second question is what the plan for the Middle East is after that.
I can only emphatically support what Commissioner Patten said when he told us that we need a peace plan between Israel and Palestine, we need a Palestinian state and an Israeli state that can peacefully coexist.
The third question is what the consequences are.
What consequences would military action have for our relations with the Arab and Islamic world, with whom we want to coexist in partnership and - if possible - in friendship?
I know just how important an answer to this question is at the moment, because I have just visited Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Qatar.
These questions need to be answered, and on all of them we need to establish a joint position with the United States.
People are also wrestling with these questions in America - it is not as if there is only the position of Vice-President Cheney and the position of the Secretary of Defence, Mr Rumsfeld, there is also the position of the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, the position of the former Secretary of State, James Baker, and that of the former Security Advisor to the President's father, Brent Scowcroft.
That is why there is absolutely no reason for anti-Americanism in this debate, because exactly the same debate is going on in America as here in Europe.
What is important is for the United States and the European Union ultimately to establish a joint position.
I want to request and call upon our American friends to resist the temptation of unilateralism and not to act alone.
This does not just relate to Iraq, it also relates to how we deal with the International Criminal Court.
I also call on all parties, on all the governments of the European Union, not to take unilateral action, but to follow the lead of the European Union as a whole.
I also call on our American friends to consistently act in unison with Europe on other issues, such as Kyoto, just as in the present case with Iraq.
I have the impression that our American friends see their relations with Europe more in terms of their bilateral relations with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and other states, than in terms of seeing the European Union as a single entity.
President Bush made an important speech to the Bundestag in Berlin.
We can agree with nearly everything he said, but he did not mention the concept of the European Union once in that speech!
That demonstrates how important it is to strengthen our dialogue with the US Government.
I would very much welcome it if in the foreseeable future we could also invite the US President to address this House, because if my memory serves me correctly, the last US President to address the European Parliament was President Reagan in 1986.
All these things would help to strengthen our relations with America, with our American partners and friends.
We need to step up our dialogue with America.
We need to act together to avert the threats posed by Saddam Hussein, and above all we in Europe, the Member States of the European Union, and the European Union itself need to act together and in unison.
I say that because if we are not united, Europe cannot hope to have any influence.
That is why the top priority is for us to act jointly on the world stage through the European Union.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr Haarder, I was going to congratulate you on your application of the Spartan rules of European Parliament terseness as a representative of the Council, but you have taken them to the extreme by omitting to tell us what happened in Elsinore.
Allow me, therefore, to ask you what Mr Patten asked the Members of this Parliament: is the Council unanimous?
Do you agree with the account of the Elsinore meeting given by the Vice-President of the Commission?
These questions are very important for this debate.
I say this because we have observed a verbal escalation on the part of the President of the United States over the summer, which, on this highly sensitive subject, comprises obvious risks.
I think we need to distinguish between two subjects: one is our judgment of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.
There is no defence for this cruel, tyrannical dictatorship, which does not hesitate to use genocide against its own people, through the suppression of both individuals and groups.
We must also, however, take account of something else.
You mentioned long-term sanctions.
These are counterproductive.
Similarly, we must take into account that we in Europe have managed to overcome the nationalism that did us so much harm in the past.
Here, too, President Mitterrand used to say that nationalism is war.
We Europeans have overcome it, but the Arab world is in a different cultural dimension, and nationalist sentiment, pride and confrontation, where necessary, make sense.
We must therefore pay close attention to what President Mubarak said, which is that unilateral intervention without the support of the United Nations would certainly have a devastating effect throughout the Middle East.
Our progress in resolving the conflict is therefore extremely important and there I believe the Danish Presidency has made an important proposal with regard to the creation of the Palestinian State.
It would be useful if the Presidency explained this to us.
We must take this into careful consideration if we are to avoid being accused of applying double standards in this situation.
With regard to the philosophy of the current American Government, I believe that Bush junior should pay greater attention to what his father did 10 years ago, for one reason: President Bush senior achieved a very broad coalition and acted in accordance with the United Nations mandate.
I am not going to talk about the debate underway in the United States, but it is odd, and it has already been said, that here civilians seem for the first time to be launching a military coup against the military forces, since those who have had military responsibilities, including in this field, are the most cautious when it comes to dealing with this issue.
Let us hope that all this remains a purely verbal escalation.
With regard to our relations with the United States, I think it would be useful for President Bush to come here, but we must also talk to the US Congress. About this, about the International Criminal Court and compliance with the application of WTO Panel decisions and resolutions on such important subjects as the Foreign Sales Act.
Although these are not the subjects of today's debate, it is important for us to talk to the US Congress, as our interlocutor.
On the subject of Iraq - and I am anxious to hear your explanations - my group endorse the position voted by Parliament on 16 May 2002, four days before the Council adopted it.
We think that peace and stability in the region, in a region as fraught as the Middle East, can only be ensured within the framework of the United Nations.
I hope your explanation on the position reached at Elsinore will be along these lines.
We think it is very important to maintain humanitarian aid and we hope that the United Nations, under the leadership of Kofi Annan, will be able to make Iraq comply with its international agreements and allow inspectors back into the country.
We believe this is the best way forward.
Mr President, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein poses a real threat.
He has used weapons of mass destruction in the past to oppress his own people and in seeking to draw Israel into a wider Middle East war.
The international community has a responsibility to stop Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction.
Yet the consequences of war are potentially so serious that, for my group, it should be only a last resort.
Avoiding war does not mean letting Saddam Hussein off the hook.
Those who urge America not to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iraq are not appeasers, as Donald Rumsfeld implies when he compares George W. Bush to Winston Churchill.
To my mind that comparison is more absurd than Dan Quayle comparing himself to John F. Kennedy.
If I may paraphrase Senator Lloyd Benson I would say 'Donald, George W. Bush ain't no Winston Churchill'!
The real lesson of history is this: Churchill correctly identified the Nazi threat at an early stage but when he acted it was not unilaterally and pre-emptively.
He drew a line in the sand.
He acted with moral authority and international backing when that line was crossed.
Churchill did not bomb Berlin and try to overthrow the Nazi regime based on his suspicions of Hitler; he acted in concert with his allies when it was clear that he had right on his side.
For the ELDR Group the issue today is about getting United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, not about George W. Bush settling an old family score with Saddam Hussein.
The Iraqi Government must comply with UN resolutions and must let weapons inspectors back in unconditionally.
Once in, those inspectors must be allowed to go wherever they want, whenever they want.
Only if Iraq refuses to readmit inspectors, if it unreasonably obstructs their work or if those inspectors find evidence of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction would the international community be justified in taking further action.
European governments must make clear their support for UN-backed military action in those circumstances.
If it comes to war it must be the international community that acts together, not the United States unilaterally.
A UN resolution needs to be approved setting a deadline for Iraqi compliance.
A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations.
Frankly, as the Commissioner said, our task would be a lot easier if the US showed the same focus on resolving the crisis in the Middle East, as it does on removing Saddam Hussein.
We also need to think seriously about how to rebuild stability in the region after any strike.
The international coalition, including America, must commit resources to nation-building.
Unless we rebuild its economy and society and help to develop viable political institutions, an Iraq devastated by war would risk imploding and posing an even greater danger to the stability of the region.
We cannot postpone the debate much longer by claiming that no decisions are imminent.
I would say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: Mr Haarder, it is no good saying the European Union's position is clear while referring to a statement of 20 May.
The Union's position is as clear as mud.
If it were clear, Ambassador Burghardt in Washington would not lament how Member States are jealously guarding their own access to the American Administration rather than acting as a common front.
Just as at the UN Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union will have influence only if it acts as a United States of Europe.
That is your job.
Consensus needs to be built about how to tackle the threat, evidence of weapons of mass destruction needs to be published and - most importantly of all - any strike needs to be backed by international law and the moral authority of the international community.
The world cannot afford the instability which would come from a unilateral and pre-emptive military adventure in Iraq.
Mr President, I am sure we all agree that the regime governing Iraq is without a doubt dictatorial, that it tramples all over human rights, and that in the past it has waged criminal wars using chemical weapons against Iran and Kuwait, and even against its own people.
Mr Haarder, I find it rather striking and not just an academic question that just now you only mentioned the war against Kuwait.
Why did you not mention that war against Iran, which involved a far greater number of deaths?
I think the answer is obvious: the war against Iran was a war which at the time suited the West very well.
It was the West that armed Hussein and even paved the way for him to have chemical weapons.
The war against Kuwait was fought for this dictator's own reasons.
If I say that this is not an academic issue, I say that that because we are seeking difficult answers in a very, very complicated situation.
If we want to get to the roots of war and aggression we need to ask ourselves how such situations arise in the first place.
There is also another point of view.
Hussein is an unsavoury dictator whose military position has now been clearly undermined.
There is very little to choose between him and some of our allies in the war on terror.
In Iran we have a regime that uses torture and has nuclear arms, and a nuclear arms strategy little different from that of the United States.
Quite remarkable!
Last week President Bush was virtually paying court to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the representative of one of the most reactionary regimes on this planet.
Surely it weakens the credibility of our human rights policy and of our security policy if such people are our allies?
I anticipate that my group will conclude that anyone who really wants to guarantee democracy, human rights and security cannot call for a war to secure them, and can certainly not indulge in hypocritical power politics that demonstrate the absurdity of our stated objectives.
That is the key issue for my group.
We are unreservedly against this war, come what may.
However, I welcome the fact that - whatever the underlying motives may be - there has been very wide-ranging criticism indeed in this House of these preparations for war.
That is far more important.
With regard to the most recent Council of Foreign Ministers, I would like to say that I have come to respect you very much here in this Parliament, but what I have heard from you today demonstrates to me that you are totally trapped in your current position.
That is unsatisfactory as far as I am concerned.
I believe that a common European policy in this area would be valuable in its own right in view of the dangers of the present situation.
I agree with Mr Poettering on that - a policy of this kind is urgently needed.
But where is it?
I believe that we are facing a serious crisis as regards the Common Foreign and Security Policy in what is a vitally important international relations situation.
However, this community of interest cannot just be arbitrary.
I think that it involves alternatives to the US approach, to a unilateralism that I find ever more threatening, and which I think is in any case counterproductive for the United States.
So, as far as I am concerned, putting forward an alternative is anything but anti-American.
We believe not only that this war should be unreservedly rejected but also that the inhumane and politically counterproductive embargo should be lifted, with the exception of arms exports, so that Iraq's exclusion from democratic development can be lessened.
Thirdly, the UN inspectors should go back, but on the basis of the existing mandate.
My fourth point is that we need multilateral cooperative relations and not unilateralism.
And my fifth point is that we finally need to return to disarmament.
You cannot say that you are willing to go to war to force others to disarm and at the same time rearm yourself without expecting weapons of mass destruction to proliferate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody has come here this morning to support the regime of Saddam Hussein, and I do not believe there is any point dwelling on the noxious aspects of this regime.
Personally, I would like to take up two or three points from this morning's debate and I would like to make a point of my own.
Firstly, I will make my point: common foreign and security policy does not exist at European Union level and, for the moment, we have little or no influence.
For the time being, only the governments of the European Union are in a position to intervene in order to try to make the United States see sense.
I notice, however, and I am not alone, that there is currently no unanimity. I note in particular that the United Kingdom is systematically aligning itself with the United States, which consequently considerably undermines any initiatives we might be called upon to take.
Secondly, I will take up the points from this morning.
I would first like to mention what Commissioner Patten said, which is that if we wish to avoid potential disaster, it is absolutely crucial to promote a very broad alliance so that action by the United States could only be taken within the framework of the decisions of the United Nations and the Security Council.
Secondly, it is vital to try to acknowledge and take account of the position of Arab countries.
The United States does not know a great deal about Muslim countries and Muslim reactions, and our fellow Member Mr BarÃ³n Crespo reminded us, just a moment ago, of what Mr Mubarak said.
There is no doubt that unilateral action determined by the United States, outside the framework of the decisions of the United Nations Security Council, with complete disregard for the domestic situation of Arab countries, would lead to disaster.
President Mubarak said himself, and I believe he is right, that in this situation, no Arab state leaders would be able to contain the outburst of feeling in their own countries.
It is obvious that we in Europe are directly affected by what could happen.
I would like to add another point: if you still doubt the will of the United States to take action, just watch CNN and you will be transfixed, because the people of the United States are being systematically conditioned everyday.
I believe that the decision to take action has been made.
It is therefore high time the governments of the European Union did something to make the United States see sense, otherwise we will face unimaginable and potentially tragic consequences.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I welcome this timely debate on Iraq, because the potential threat that is emanating from the current regime in Mesopotamia causes me great concern.
This threat is the culmination of two worrying trends.
First of all, Iraq has been boycotting the UN's inspection of its military materiel for nearly four years.
This particularly applies to banned weapons of mass destruction.
Secondly, President Saddam Hussein's regime is strongly suspected of maintaining close links with Islamic terrorist groups.
This suspicion dates back to the 1993 bomb attack on the World Trade Centre in New York.
Since 11 September of last year, this suspicion has, politically speaking, become more topical than ever.
In the current confusion about the West's attitude towards Iraq, I should like to ask the Council a few questions and make some suggestions at the same time.
Why does the EU, with or without the US, not prescribe a clear deadline within which Baghdad must allow the actual and unconditional resumption of the UN weapons inspections?
I would, however, add that desired inspections of this kind will not rule out the danger of biological weapons arsenals.
After all, Saddam Hussein is a completely heartless man, and weapons that are easy to conceal are right up his street.
Secondly, why does the EU not visibly step up the political pressure on Saddam by entering into talks with the Iraqi opposition?
In the final analysis, this is exactly what is being done by the Russian Federation, which is, after all, a country that has so far been on more than just speaking terms with Iraq.
In short, I urge Europe to actively look for a political alternative to Saddam's 'republic of terror'.
Finally, I would ask the Council to launch initiatives for an in-depth summit with the US administration right away.
The topic of this meeting should be a joint position on Iraq's persistent, destabilising international role.
The launch of a European peace proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is simply incompatible with tolerating a sponsor of Palestinian terror.
Mr President, one of our objectives is certainly to prevent war, to do everything possible to ensure that war is avoided, but the problem is not just defining our position for or against a possible armed intervention: the problem is seeing what Europe, the European Union, can do not just to try and avoid armed conflict but to try and stop the massacre of the Iraqi people by the dictator, Saddam Hussein, too, to do everything in its power to stop what is, in all probability, Saddam Hussein's build-up towards the development of weapons of mass destruction, with the genuine possibility, the real danger that these weapons will be used.
This is a danger against which the United States, under the Bush administration, has decided to take a stand, adopting a position which, although erroneous , is quite clear, quite cut and dried.
If there are alternatives - and we must do everything in our power to ensure that there are - they must be developed vigorously and resolutely.
In other words, Europe, the European Union, must be the vehicle, the place, the centre where alternatives to conflict are developed: the alternatives of international law, the alternatives of the UN, the alternatives provided by what is known as multilateralism.
These alternatives must be developed with determination and must not be a smokescreen to hide ambiguities or conceal a policy which is directly or indirectly benefiting Saddam Hussein.
As the European Union, as the Union which has fought so hard to set up the International Criminal Court and other instruments imposing and promoting the rule of law and democracy, we must, of course, think back to Churchill's Europe and consider what has been said in this Chamber today, but we must also make every endeavour to prevent Europe regressing to the situation under Chamberlain.
Mr President, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a villain who has committed atrocities against his own and the Kurdish people. There is no doubt that we can well do without leaders such as Saddam Hussein.
It is worth remembering, however, who it was who helped promote him to high office. It was the same country which now wants to take the lead in bringing him down, namely the United States.
Yesterday's friends are tomorrow's enemies.
How long is this to continue?
In the fight against terrorism, we have now become friends with the mullahs of Iran who still to this very day permit the stoning of women.
We are friends with the House of Saud, where democracy is a completely unknown concept.
These are today's friends. Are they also tomorrow's enemies, however?
What would be the consequences of a possible attack on Iraq?
I know that the American Congress has discussed this in detail, but where is the discussion in Parliament not only of our views and opinions concerning the United States and Saddam Hussein but also of the consequences for the whole region of a possible attack upon Iraq?
It is already a very unstable area we are talking about.
I think the European Parliament should be involved in getting such an inquiry under way.
Moreover, I should like to ask whether there is agreement in the Council on the policy in relation to Iraq.
I should like to know, for example, whether the Danish Presidency is sticking to its own traditional policy, to the effect that we do not say anything until we are asked, irrespective of the fact that the Danish Defence Minister is of the view that we should ideally attack Iraq right now.
Is the Danish Presidency in favour of a common policy on this issue?
Is there agreement about the policy, and does this include demands for a UN mandate and for clear evidence of Saddam Hussein's possible involvement in the attack on the World Trade Centre or collaboration with al-Qa'ida?
Mr President, first of all I welcome this debate this morning.
It has come at an opportune time.
To a large extent the problem we face in Iraq is the unfinished business of the Gulf War.
We have to recognise that before we begin.
Mr Watson referred to the previous President Bush and the fact that to some extent the most recent President Bush maybe hopes to resolve some of his father's failures.
The truth is, and we have got to face it, Saddam Hussein has effectively made fools out of the international community ever since that time.
Time and time again he has led them forward by the nose and time and time again they have allowed him to get away with it.
Yes, the United Nations has done sterling work but with no success for weapons inspection to date.
I welcome Mr Blair's statement this morning, whatever it means.
No doubt he will not be able to tell us everything but perhaps he could throw some light on the situation.
The weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed to protect the free world.
Yes, Saddam Hussein has ruled Iraq with an iron fist, he is an evil dictator.
We must ensure that Iraq is approached in a multilateral way.
There must be no unilateral approach.
I believe there must be a wide-ranging international coalition supported by the United Nations resolution.
This is not a resolution for doing nothing, as many Americans would say, but assures widespread support for that action and much of it has been outlined here this morning.
We must engage Congress as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said, but I have to tell this House in my experience Congress is thinking of the November 5 elections and is not all that much engaged or wanting to engage in discussions with the European Parliament.
However, we in the European Union must be central to this.
Mr President, we seem to be very much in agreement on this score.
Saddam Hussein's regime, which we all regard as dictatorial, is being denounced by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists alike.
For the past 23 years, he has systematically killed his own people and the leaders of his Stalinist regime.
Moreover, we denounce the US's unilateral action as well.
In addition, we have noticed that Europe is still not speaking with one voice to a sufficient degree.
We would, in fact, urge the Council to take an active part in this debate in the United States now, because it is clear that there are different currents in the US.
What we could do with right now is a display of commitment to the United States that is not anti-America but pro-America by taking part in that debate now.
But that requires that we speak with one voice and take a clear stand.
I would like to say to the Security Council that this is not, therefore, a licence to launch into unilateral action.
We need the UN Security Council if we want to exert pressure on Iraq to reinstate the weapons inspections.
This also means that if we ultimately want to act and threaten with violence, we must have proof.
This proof must be clear and public.
This also means that we must at the same time be prepared to act smartly.
Mr Lagendijk of the Group of the Greens used the term 'smart sanctions' which are, of course, a reality. By using them, we can hit Iraq and its leadership harder and help the population at the same time.
What Commissioner Patten said here this morning is crucial.
It could be very detrimental if we unilaterally adopted the same stance in the Middle East, but we can also use this stance to enlist support for a new peace initiative along with the US.
It is essential that the Council take action in order to decide on the two-state solution.
Peace in the Middle East now, by addressing the issue of Palestine and Israel, is the key.
There is a real downside, of which President Mubarak has warned us, in fact, namely that we may head in the wrong direction.
Europe is playing a pivotal role.
Instead of neglecting this role, we must take action now.
I would ask for your support in this.
Mr President, yesterday, our group held an extensive debate on the situation in Iraq in the presence of the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs Ana De Palacio.
It was striking how unanimous our group was, and Mr Hans-Gert Poettering's outline fits in perfectly with this debate.
I should like to underline three points.
We have established that Saddam Hussein is without a doubt one of the most dangerous people of our time, with his chemical and biological weapons, which apparently he is also willing to use.
After all, he did exactly that against his own people.
We have also established that if an intervention proves necessary - but a number of conditions will need to be met first - this can never be done without UN support.
This is truly what our group unanimously believes.
Thirdly - and this is an appeal to the Commissioner and the Minister - Europe must speak with one voice and must join forces.
If this ever proved necessary, then surely now is the time.
I also have a few questions that relate to what Mr Van den Berg said a moment ago.
It appears that Europe does not have all the information that the Americans have.
In my view, if Europe is to receive support and resources, it is extremely important for all this information to be available, particularly also to the political forums and parliaments.
My second point is one of concern.
In all the comments that we make in this matter, we should also consider the situation of Israel.
If we treat the entire Arab World in the same way, this could rebound on Israel in a big way.
We must therefore, as a matter of key importance, also get the Arab world behind us in this matter.
Finally, a strategy must be developed in order to boost support in Europe, for not all citizens, by a long chalk, are convinced of the need for intervention.
For this strategy, we need a European plan, and I think that Mr Patten and the Minister will need to play an important role in this.
Mr President, we run the risk today of fiddling while Rome burns.
At any moment the current low-intensity aerial defence of southern and northern Iraq - which has been carried out at considerable personal risk by pilots from the USA, originally from France, and also from the UK, to whom I pay tribute as they have saved countless lives - may be stepped up to considerably heavier military action, which I believe will have support from a wide number of countries which are at present silent about their opinions.
The EU voice must be heard.
We must no longer stand on the sidelines, wringing our hands and repeating like a hopeless prayer 'Iraq must comply with UN conventions and the weapons inspectors must go in' because this leopard will not change his spots.
We have ample evidence of the use of weapons of mass destruction.
I have first-hand personal evidence of the use of such weapons: chemical warfare against the southern Iraqi people in the late 1990s.
I have talked to the victims who stumbled choking from clouds of yellow smoke that must have been mustard gas.
We have evidence first hand of the destruction of the environment, the water, the degradation of life in the marshes of the deep south, for example.
We talk in Johannesburg about the need to bring water to millions more people, yet we have allowed Saddam Hussein to take away the water from over half a million Iraqi people.
We have stood silent.
We have first-hand evidence of that.
We have been overflying the south since 1994.
On human rights and genocide: as Max van der Stoel said when he was human rights reporter on Iraq for the United Nations: 'Genocide has been carried out against the Marsh Arabs and the Iraqi people'.
We have evidence of that; I personally have had evidence at first hand.
On weapons of mass destruction: surely our quarrel is not precisely about having weapons of mass destruction - quite a number of countries sadly have such weapons - it is what you do with them that counts.
We have the continuing threats of Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait and Iran.
I have seen the mined borders and the tanks just over the borders from Iran.
We have that evidence available.
What can we do?
We can set up the Office of Inquiry for Human Rights Violations that was recommended in our report, which the Commissioner so kindly referred to just now.
We had a full house - an 85% majority for the vote on that report.
I call upon the Commissioner and the Council of Ministers to set up that office today.
(Applause from the centre and the right)
Mr President, because time is short I will start by saying what we need to do.
In the first instance we need to engage with the United States at every level.
We need to engage with the Americans on a country-to-country, a union-to-union, a party-to-party, a committee-to-committee basis, at whatever level we can, not only in relation to Iraq, but in relation to the extremely dangerous unilateralist philosophy they are currently developing in regard to so many areas of world concern.
We should not ignore the fact that the current attempt to undermine the International Criminal Court has implications far wider than simply excluding American forces engaged in international conflicts.
It is a direct challenge to the European Union and is part of the attempt by the United States to establish superiority in every region throughout the world.
The only response that the European Union and its Member States can make to this and to the current attempts by the United States to generate a war psychology in relation to Iraq is to stand together.
I know it is difficult and there are differences between the Member States on this, but there is a much wider concern for the future which has to be borne in mind.
I was quite impressed by the Commissioner's speech in which he identified the need for reform of our international law in relation to how, when and who should intervene in other states.
It is a matter which is coming to the fore more and more, particularly now that the Cold War is over and the dust is settling.
However, as far as our experience with the International Criminal Court is concerned, it is not yet opportune to start dismantling the current protections that exist under the United Nations Charter.
Mr President, Mr De Rossa can talk about United States unilateralism; perhaps we should better refer to the United States shouldering responsibilities which are ignored by others.
What a pity it is that other countries have not joined in enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq over the last ten years, something which has been referred to already.
Responsibility has been borne by the United States, by the United Kingdom and in the early days by France.
This is the sort of allied coming together that we should be seeing.
It seems to me that there is too much speculation about the nature of some sort of attack on Iraq while our concern should really be the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime being in possession of weapons of mass destruction.
It would be a dereliction of duty by any of our governments if they were aware of a threat to our security and chose to do nothing about it.
We must take effective action against Iraq and it is most important that we show allied solidarity.
Perceptions are absolutely vital here and it would be fatal if Saddam Hussein misread the intentions of the West, of the European Union and of other allies and if he thought that he was able to create divisions among those allies.
We must send a very strong signal to Saddam Hussein that we stand together on this.
This is a signal of solidarity.
If there are any differences among allies it is time for those differences to be sorted out behind closed doors and not in public discussion.
We need to send the right message.
We started to misread the intentions of Saddam Hussein in early 1990.
We almost made a mistake then.
We regarded him as a rational man, we rather thought that he would not invade Kuwait at that time.
In fact he is an irrational leader in control of very dangerous weapons.
We must show the solidarity to take the necessary action to remove those weapons from his hands.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are discussing can basically be reduced to two different concepts.
Can we respond to international threats by using international law and the mechanisms it provides?
Even if these mechanisms are in need of reform, as Commissioner Patten has said, they still exist and they could be implemented in their present form.
We believe that when it comes to dealing with international threats from states like Iraq - and there is no need for me to repeat what kind of threats we could be talking about - the only way to implement international law is through the United Nations.
The alternative is to respond to these threats on a unilateral basis, which is the approach currently being adopted by the US.
Mr Poettering is quite right in saying that there is an urgent need for this process to be completed, because there is also an internal debate, although a consensus is evidently starting to emerge around President Bush.
The question that needs to be answered next is where Europe stands on this.
The answer is that we do not support unilateralism, as we have already heard, as Commissioner Patten asked how we could stabilise the international coalition against terror.
We will certainly not stabilise it if the United States undermines it by adopting a unilateral approach.
That is where there is a really great danger, because what we are actually fighting - and I would like to remind Mr Van Orden that Mr Brie has already referred to this - is the Iraqi Government, which has been so heavily criticised here, yet where did they get the technology that has enabled them to constitute such an enormous threat today?
From the United States - in the days when Iraq was still an ally in the battle against Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, which also demonstrates that the governing Baath Party in Iraq is not an Islamic fundamentalist party.
We all know that the Muslim Brotherhoods that are persecuted in Iraq have been granted political asylum in Europe.
I only wanted to remind you about that to make it clear how complicated and dangerous unilateralism is in practice.
That is why, Mr Van Orden, we in Europe are united in saying 'no' to unilateralism and 'yes' to the implementation of international law.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, as you said, we have a consensus and a desire in this House to prevent the crisis that is looming, a crisis that has been triggered by the actions of Saddam Hussein.
I would like to say to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that no one knows better than the armed forces, both here and in the United States, that the use of force to prevent this crisis can never be clean.
There is no such thing as a clean war.
Despite progress in technology, man does not yet have the means to kill all evil people at the touch of a button, if only because it is impossible to separate the good people from the bad.
In these circumstances, war or the use of armed force may be a lesser evil.
In that case, all political and diplomatic avenues must have been thoroughly explored with a view to achieving the political objective otherwise to be pursued through the use of such force.
That is why we fully endorse the Union's current approach which is to maintain pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow weapons inspectors to return to do their work.
Secondly, if this decision is taken, it must have a chance of achieving its aim, yet it has been made very clear to us that the objective now is to overturn the regime of Saddam Hussein.
There are two questions being raised here. The first concerns the assessment of the threat.
Mr Poettering and Mrs Maij-Weggen emphasised that we are eagerly awaiting the details promised by the British Prime Minister, which should arrive in the next few minutes.
Commissioner Patten said in his speech that he doubted whether any evidence at all would be available.
It is very important that we have this evidence.
Secondly, we must have a chance of winning.
In Afghanistan, we were sure that the Afghan people themselves were ready to bring down the Taliban regime.
Is there any chance, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqi people will help, in the event of military action, to topple the regime?
That is a genuine question.
Mr President, much has been said of the evil and immoral behaviour of Saddam Hussein and rightly so, but I want to focus on the European Union and indeed on one Member State in particular, my own, the United Kingdom.
Mr Blair made it clear yesterday that he will support the US in a war on Iraq, without waiting until other options have been explored and without seeking a fresh UN Security Council resolution.
In a press conference yesterday, he implicitly backed the principle of pre-emptive action on Iraq, saying that the simple restoration of weapons inspectors into Iraq may not be sufficient to avert war.
We cannot enforce international law by breaking international law.
A war on Iraq in these circumstances would be immoral, illegal, dangerous and wrong.
Much has been said about the importance of the EU having a common front and a common voice and I agree with that.
In that case I urge the Commission, the Council and all other EU Heads of State to do all they can to help us restrain their fellow EU Member State.
Mr President, UN Resolution 678 and the 1991 US Congressional resolution predicated the whole Gulf War ceasefire agreement on the undertaking that Iraq would dispose of all weapons of mass destruction, but instead UNSCOM inspectors were expelled accused of being American spies.
Saddam Hussein still possesses huge quantities of biological and chemical weapons and three years ago he attempted to buy weapons-grade uranium from Serbia.
He has been negotiating with North Korea to acquire ballistic missile technology.
Therefore he clearly poses a global threat to oil supplies, and, were he to become a nuclear power, could hold the whole world to ransom.
Let us also be morally consistent.
Nobody in this House asked for UN resolutions to attack Milosevic's Serbia, and human rights violations alone were deemed sufficient.
Surely Saddam Hussein's violations of the rights of the Kurds whom he has gassed, the Marsh Arabs and the Shias whom he has tortured and killed, and the Israelis, where he has paid the families of suicide bombers to kill innocent victims, are much worse than any of Milosevic's crimes, - not to mention the British and the Americans whom he has sworn revenge against for our participation in the Gulf War.
I remain sceptical about neighbouring countries' concerns about military intervention, as some fear democracy in Iraq and others giving the Kurds autonomy in the north.
I welcome foreign minister de Palacio's support yesterday for the British and American position.
I also hope that China and Russia will not veto any requests in the UN Security Council for further resolutions on this matter, should America so request.
In the West, we should support our American allies' quest to complete the unfinished business of ridding the world of this extremely evil man.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of making a personal comment, because I have worked with you for a very long time and because I have always very much appreciated the open and honest way in which you have expressed your views.
It seems to me that in the course of the ten-metre journey from here to where you are sitting now you have been struck dumb.
You have not told us what happened in Elsinore, but instead you repeated what the Spanish Presidency achieved in this area in May.
I suppose that is better than nothing.
I would like to comment on Commissioner Patten's two questions.
I can assure you, Mr Patten, that we are all in favour of observing UN resolutions.
However, the United Nations is not an organisation where you can pick and choose - we have to comply with the United Nations Charter and we also have to comply with international law.
The United Nations Charter stipulates the cases in which military means are possible and permissible, and the procedure is also laid down.
The UN Charter does not make any provision for a pre-emptive war or for a war to remove an undesirable government, and we cannot ignore that.
Anyone who wages such a war in spite of this is himself an aggressor and is himself in breach of international law.
The second question was about the broad coalition.
On that point, I can assure you that that should in fact be the European Union's sole objective.
But we are not the ones who have split the broad coalition; no, it has been undermined by American unilateralism.
My question to you is: how can we re-establish this unity, this broad coalition?
Mr President, Saddam Hussein is evil.
His regime is evil. His deeds are evil.
We have seen what he can do to his people, and we fear what he might do to the wider world.
He is totally defying the international community.
As Commissioner Patten said, the world would be a much better place without Saddam Hussein and with a different regime in Iraq.
Achieving this, however, is easier said than done.
Furthermore, it is fraught with enormous complications and very, very great risks.
Even the Pentagon has reservations about a possible attack.
We must, of course, use all diplomatic and political means in order to get Saddam Hussein to comply with UN resolutions and allow the inspectors in and in order to solve this issue.
There must of course be evidence, to which we all have access, of the existence of weapons of mass destruction and possible collaboration with al-Qa'ida.
The EU must, naturally, stick together and insist that any attack must be subject to a UN Security Council decision.
What happens, however, if we fail to find a political and diplomatic solution, if Saddam Hussein continues to defy the international community, if we do obtain proof, and if we manage to get a common decision in the Security Council?
What discussions have been taking place in the Council?
What forward planning has there been?
I do not mean military planning. Rather, I am wondering what preparations have been made to support the forces of democracy, the Iraqi opposition and the Kurds in northern Iraq and to look after our relations with the wider world.
I am absolutely convinced that these issues were discussed in Elsinore, and I would therefore be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could say something about them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the British and the Americans want to wage war on regimes which do not respect human rights, they certainly have their work cut out for them.
If they wish to wage war on undemocratic regimes in the Middle East, they must wage war on Saudi Arabia.
If they wish to wage war on regimes which do not respect the United Nations' resolutions, they must wage war on Israel.
If they wish to wage war on countries which have acquired weapons of mass destruction, they must wage war on India, Pakistan, China and North Korea, which have - of this we are certain - atomic weapons.
If they wish to wage war on countries which serve as a breeding ground for terrorists, they must destroy London and Hamburg.
This is the reality of the situation.
I am obviously being ironic, because the reason for this military action is clearly not Saddam Hussein's regime, which is an authoritarian regime, of course, but also a secular regime which respects the right of Christians and of women.
This military action is about weapons of mass destruction.
So far, we have not yet been given any evidence whatsoever that they exist in a country that is dying on its feet, where light bulbs can no longer be found, where there is no lead for schoolchildren's pencils because these are made of graphite and where even a number of UN observers condemned the role that they were being made to play.
I shall end with an anecdote: three years ago, my brother, a Catholic priest, visited Iraq.
Whilst there, he was almost killed by a bomb and, in truth, he does not know if this was an American or British bomb.
One might well ask which international law allows Iraq - which, it is true, was defeated and which, as a result of its defeat, agreed to visits by UN inspectors for many years - to be bombed on a daily basis and to continue to suffer from sanctions.
Mr President, there are two extremely sensitive issues of concern to the public of the Arab countries, including what are known as the moderate Arab countries, and they are the Palestinian issue and the impact of the embargo on Iraq.
It is the international community, not the dictator, which will be blamed for the impact of the embargo on Iraq, we must be quite clear about that.
I do not feel there is any division here, as has already been said, as regards condemnation of Saddam Hussein and his regime.
However, the repeated announcements of unilateral action by the United States - which were not the invention of the international press but have been repeated on several occasions by the President himself - are having two, extremely negative consequences: on the one hand, the interests and fate of the dictator are becoming linked to those of his people once again - you saw, even yesterday, Saddam Hussein's declarations, 'we will resist, we will win' - and, on the other, there is a build up of opposition to this action.
I therefore believe that the European Union must pursue the path of international law, the path of the United Nations, resolutely, and that a much, much clearer link must be established between the readmission of the UNSCOM and the end of the embargo on the Iraqi people, for this will enable us to start to dialogue with the people of Iraq. Otherwise it will be extremely difficult to make any impact on Saddam Hussein.
Moreover, the West's task is hardly to replace Saddam with an ayatollah, for example.
We must introduce democracy into this and other Arab countries, and I believe that, if Europe genuinely believes in this position and is united, then it will be able to make a contribution.
Mr President, a speaker on the left side of the Chamber said that we must oblige the United States to act in accordance with Europe.
I believe it is naÃ¯ve to believe that we can put the United States under an obligation.
The United States does not act in order to achieve world domination. It acts only because we are exposed to the threat of a development worse than war.
If Europe cannot decide, the United States will hopefully act alone.
It is as if we have forgotten that it was the United States that rescued Europe in the First and Second World Wars and that saved us from Communist takeover.
It is naÃ¯ve to believe that the United States would act without evidence.
The United States would not make large sacrifices if there were less risky alternatives.
Prime Minister Tony Blair stated clearly yesterday that they had evidence.
It is Tony Blair's and the United Kingdom's position we should emulate, and I would call upon the Presidency to work towards a situation in which the EU is united in rallying to the cause of combating dictatorship.
We should not of course be infringing international law by toppling a vicious dictatorship which is threatening its own people and world security, and the approach based on the UN model has of course been fully tried and tested.
The weapons inspectors were turfed out, so what is the point of bringing them back?
Saddam Hussein has been given every warning, but he is quite clearly unreceptive to our demands, and we are merely signalling our own weakness.
Our duty towards the people of Europe is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in this fight against a dictatorship that is threatening world security.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the debate about the situation in Iraq and possible military intervention is of course also a debate about the nature of solidarity.
When some Members of this House, Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock, talk about solidarity, they chiefly mean solidarity with the United States.
For me it chiefly means solidarity within Europe.
That is why I am concerned that the United Kingdom, but also Spain and Italy, are going down a path that suggests that this solidarity could be undermined.
What particularly concerns me is the yawning gap between the United States' and Europe's conceptions of international world order.
The US seems to be increasingly drawn to a theory that international agreements and organisations have, as it were, a merely substitutional role.
