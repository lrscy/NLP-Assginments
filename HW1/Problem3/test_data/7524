We have a problem; you are aware that there are differences of opinion on this matter, and particularly that in our view nuclear energy and renewable energy cannot be placed on the same footing â they are two different things.
We acknowledge the fact that there is nuclear energy on this continent, but we cannot believe that this is an energy of the future for our continent, partly because â and this is not a minor consideration â we still have to import uranium, whereas we do not have to import sun or wind!
This is an important point, at least from a conceptual point of view, and nuclear power should not be placed on the same footing!
We have to understand, very clearly and very specifically, that we cannot depend on nuclear power.
Nuclear power today meets only a part of our requirements and it is certainly not an option for the future.
In addition, on energy issues, there is still a gaping hole in the Commissionâs strategy: its silence on the transport question.
Seventy per cent of our dependence on oil relates to transport.
Even in this Parliament we have not been able to help very much, I agree, with regard to an innovative transport policy, but I believe that the Commission ought to help us on this matter.
I would like to end, MrÂ President, by saying that there is another priority which is being ignored in this area, and that is our cities.
Cities are an opportunity not only as a kind of laboratory but also for Europeâs use, and currently insufficient use is being made of them both from the viewpoint of financial support and from the viewpoint of major strategies.
Perhaps it is better to start with cities rather than with major infrastructure, which in any case will not be financed by Europe either.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the major question raised by my political group lies not solely in the policies for which specific provision is made for 2007, but also in the doubts which are being created in our mind in connection with the broader strategic direction being given to the European construct as a whole.
It is unacceptable for us to become witnesses every day to the tempestuous concern and protests which have been stirred up by the new anti-grass roots employment laws in France; we have frequently become witnesses recently of citizens' reactions to various directives.
It is unacceptable when the Union buries its head in the sand by following through on policies which promote benefits not for the workers but for large companies.
It is following through on the Lisbon Strategy which, in a bid to disorientate the workers, is now allegedly a 'reformed' strategy.
Has it perhaps been reformed or changed in substance since when it was first decided or has it managed to promote the development of a social policy agenda designed to safeguard basic social standards, quality employment and the reconciliation of work and private life?
No, it has not.
In the name of competitiveness, workers rights are on the receiving end every day of the fire of capitalist Europe.
Working times are being extended, wages are being cut, collective agreements are being abolished, unemployment and unequal pay are increasing and the welfare regime is being swept away completely.
The first to suffer are young people, the people on whom we are calling â and that is the irony â to build a Europe with a future.
At the same time, policies are being promoted which allegedly oil the wheels of immigration.
How can that be, when their objective is once again the criteria laid down to safeguard the economic interests of Europe, when immigrants and people who need international protection are being kept on European territory under conditions of detention when their only crime has been to seek a humane life?
European resources should be used not to finance policies to strengthen closed borders, deportations and repatriations, but to remedy the real causes of immigration and to promote human rights in a substantial manner within the framework of a mutually beneficial neighbourhood policy, far from the philosophy of the reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank and from the philosophy of military intervention.
Â Â  . In order to reduce the gulf between the European Unionâs Lisbon targets and reality, the Commissionâs programme of work for 2007 needs to be ambitious.
Action by the Commission ought to cover all spheres, and at the same time it should choose as its priorities those initiatives that are important not only in one specific sector but also for the overall development of the European Union.
In the Commissionâs programme, the launching of the space programme and the regular evaluation of strategy were among the most important measures mentioned for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in 2007.
While not contesting the importance of these measures, I believe that specific measures to foster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of the services sector would offer broader support to the Lisbon process, but such measures were not included in the list.
Although the development of small and medium-sized enterprises appears among the priorities listed, this priority is not reflected at all in the list of principal actions.
It is the development of this sector, however, that can actually make the most rapid contribution to achieving the goals of employment and growth.
Although the development of the services sector is and remains one of the main instruments for implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the Commissionâs strategy for 2007, no specific measures for the development of the services sector are mentioned.
We hope that it was not as a result of a deliberate move, but of a failure to coordinate the strategy established with operational measures, that the reform of the services sector was not included in the Commissionâs policy strategy for 2006.
The adoption of the Services Directive in 2007 will also clear the way for new initiatives by the European Commission in sectors that have been identified for liberalisation of services.
The creation of one-stop agencies would be one specific move in this direction.
2007 will be decisive for debates about the future of the European Union.
One of the main criteria according to which the European public will judge the European Unionâs viability and future prospects in 2007 will be the concrete results of action taken by the European Unionâs institutions, including the Commission.
This specificity ought, however, to be already apparent in the setting out of priorities and tasks, by defining the measures planned for 2007 not only in terms of continuing work already begun but also in terms of achieving concrete results.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commission has broken a clear pledge to present a full annual programme, setting out all proposed legislation and its legal bases.
As yet, we have received details of only a small selection of the laws and regulations produced by the Commission.
We have not been given precise information about the legal bases, so we cannot see whether the Commission is proposing voluntary coordination or binding rules.
It is difficult to debate strategic guidelines in the dark.
Does the Commission want more power, centralism and Byzantine regulation, or does it want to inspire the Member States to pull together in the interests of job creation and to encourage countries to compete in doing things as best they can?
The Independence and Democracy Group wants greater freedom for the Member States and less power centralised in Brussels.
The Commission must be open with people.
Tell us who is giving good advice in your 3Â 000 secret working parties.
Let us see what is behind the advice.
Tell us how you use taxpayersâ money.
Give the EUâs auditors, the ombudsman and the European Parliamentâs Committee on Budgetary Control full access to investigate all expenditure.
Put your mail on the Internet so that we can study all approaches from lobbyists.
Show some confidence in people.
Give us the information we request, unless there is, exceptionally, a sound argument for excluding public discussion.
May I also thank the President for quoting Montesquieu.
He too was in favour of the threefold division of power, although not in a way that corresponds fully to the Commissionâs mix of legislative, executive and judicial powers.
It seems to me that Machiavelli was more of an inspiration than Montesquieu when the Commissionâs powers were designed.
Â Â  â Mr President, President of the Commission, 2005 will unfortunately be remembered by Europeans as the year in which the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in two of the EUâs founding Member States.
This should serve as a warning to us politicians that we are paying insufficient attention to our citizens.
The European Union has not yet managed to become unified following its most recent enlargement to include 10 new Member States, and yet it is already preparing for the future accession of Turkey.
The year 2007 could be a year of opportunity in terms of achieving a more unified Europe that demonstrates more solidarity if the old Member States open up towards the new Member States, particularly as regards liberalising their labour markets.
Unfortunately there appear to be few countries with the courage of Spain and Portugal, which know from their own recent experience how difficult it is to be a second-class citizen in the European Union.
I propose that any future enlargement of the European Union should either be full, or that it should not happen at all.
I hope that in saying this I am also reflecting the will of the people of the Netherlands and France.
It is not yet too late to deepen European unity by ensuring that it has a budget that lives up to its ambitions.
2006 has drawn the attention of Europeans to the problem of energy supplies.
Today more than ever, Europe needs a common energy policy.
This would provide a good opportunity to improve the prospects of farmers, particularly in the new Member States, who could become involved in biofuel production.
The worldwide process of globalisation is inevitable.
Europe should regard it as a new challenge and as a development opportunity.
It is our duty to help developing countries, but also to enhance our European social model and to care for those of our citizens who are least able to look after themselves.
Â Â  Mr President, as already stated by other Members of our Group who have spoken before me, we welcome the ideas concerning Commission policy for year 2007.
I welcome them both in respect of the procedural issues and their content.
In respect of procedural issues, I am pleased about the initiative that had already started last year as a result of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the European Commission, ensuring that the European Parliament, including its committees, will have a greater involvement and opportunity to participate in the drafting of the annual policy strategy and legislation programme.
I hope that the difficulties experienced last year will be eliminated this year.
The content of the document submitted by the Commission, too, has undergone a significant change compared to previous years, and it points in the right direction.
Paradoxically, we could also say that the fact that the document does not contain budgetary specifications due to the absence of financial perspectives has had a positive effect on it, as it enabled a better concentration on the political goals and tasks facing the European Union.
At the same time, we should not forget the context in which this plan has been created, either.
Over the past years, we have felt on several occasions that Europe is not moving forward, but backwards, and it does not take necessary steps.
In the course of last year, we managed to take a few tentative first steps in the right direction, but we have a huge number of unfinished projects.
Let us have a look at them, one by one.
One such project is the Constitution, which I think we need to complete as soon as possible.
If we want to avoid a European Parliament full of Euro-sceptic groups, we should make sure that the Constitution is routed in the right direction before the start of the European Parliament elections.
We do not have a financial perspective, either.
Therefore, the goals that are correctly formulated in this seven-year budget are not in place and do not have a firm foundation at the present time.
We have made a correct step in the right direction in this respect, too, but we, here in Parliament, are not currently satisfied with the budget.
When we talk about 2007, we also talk about enlargement, because Romania and Bulgaria will most likely become Member States of the European Union by then.
While we feel that the tensions that had arisen in the European Union in relation with the last enlargement, due to a decrease in solidarity, are still unresolved, let us step into year 2007 in such a way that we work on the tensions that had come into existence in the course of the last enlargement.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Barroso, I would ask you to give more thought than you do in your paper to how you might better communicate to the public the contents and objectives you so rightly define.
Mr Barroso, competitiveness is one of your important themes, it is one of our important themes!
I nevertheless see many citizens who believe it has nothing to do with them, that it is a matter only for industry, for big business.
No, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social system in Europe, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social model of Europe.
It is much the same with education.
Education is not something of interest only to an elite.
Education must reach broad sections of the population if we want to achieve one of Europeâs essential objectives, namely to prevent the exclusion of people or groups.
Education is especially important, too, when we consider that we are a continent of immigration.
It is most important for the integration of new immigrant citizens that we develop the education sector accordingly.
So far as the Globalisation Fund you mention is concerned, we will in fact only be able to finance it if we also increase our competitiveness so that we do not risk having to call on this Globalisation Fund too often.
A second example I would like to take, because you place a great deal of emphasis on it in your paper, is energy policy.
I do not want to anticipate what the Members who will speak after me will have to say, but one important subject that you touched on is security of energy supply.
I am very pleased that you visited Moscow recently and â from what I have heard â not without success, even though it is in many respects still up to Russia to take decisions, on the Energy Charter in particular.
Finally, I have also heard that you have said we should also talk about nuclear energy.
You are right and I am very pleased that we shall be hearing from the Commissioner responsible for energy shortly.
Although I am sceptical about nuclear energy, we must still talk about it, and also about the risks it entails.
If we are discussing proliferation these days in connection with Iran, then more nuclear energy also means more dangers unless we ensure, jointly and multilaterally, that the associated risks are minimised as much as possible.
I think more ought to be said about this subject in particular, both by you and in the Green Paper.
That is particularly the case, too, for infrastructure development.
Because without more infrastructure â pipelines in particular, but in other areas as well â we will never be able to give this continent energy security and we will not give Europe the corresponding new technological boost.
I fully support you on that.
I wish you more strength and courage, however, in putting these decisions into effect.
You mentioned Montesquieu, and someone else wanted Machiavelli.
I wish you the wisdom of a Montesquieu, but also the strength and cunning of a Machiavelli, to get your programme through.
Â Â  Mr President, President Barrosoâs quotation from Montesquieu prompted me to search the annual policy strategy for a clue as to what the Commission proposes to do with the Constitution.
There are no clues.
A policy strategy that fails to address the principal political blockage in front of the Union should be assessed fairly critically.
Without the Constitution, the Union will fail to have the capacity to act to fulfil the Commissionâs ambitions for it.
Public opinion will remain sceptical about the European project and, without the support of public opinion, the Commission will lack the necessary clout inside the Council.
The classical function of the Commission would be to broker an agreement between the warring partners in a crisis.
I hope that Mr Barroso, when he addresses the parliamentary forum on 9 May, will be able to lay out a comprehensive Commission strategy towards finding a way out of the crisis.
For all the value we find in Plan D, the best way to boost trust through action will be to salvage the Constitution.
Perhaps it is now time for Plan B.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Barroso's intentions are certainly innocent.
However, I fear that you will not be able to implement them, precisely because you do not have the money.
There is no way, nor is your policy a policy which will allow Europe to flourish.
There is not one, not one European citizen who this year will be better off financially than last year.
Factories are leaving Europe for other countries.
Women buy handbags with French labels which are made in Morocco.
Your leather jacket is by a European designer, but it was made in Turkey.
What does this mean?
It means increased unemployment.
It means increased redundancies.
It means that we are all becoming hostages to industry, which imposes policies like those in France, a policy which you did not rebut.
It therefore means a worse life.
It means increased prices.
Nothing of all that you have in mind can be creative unless we get off the hook of the Maastricht indicators.
Unless Maastricht is revised, Europe will develop into a poor neighbourhood.
Â Â  â I like Portugal and the Portuguese.
Mr President, Commissioner, may I give you a very deeply felt piece of unambiguous advice?
Starting in May 2007, when Portugal will probably have the Council Presidency, history is once again offering you a historic open window for the European project.
Yes, I am talking about Mr Duffâs Plan B and a lot more besides.
You will have another chance to fit this European thing we have in front of us together in a meaningful way.
I mean the very big thing.
You may be able to lift it and go down in history with it, or you may fail completely.
But please look now at the contributions that are really being made to the debate on the Constitution and the positioning of the European Union.
Try to get out of the old thought patterns that got us into all these problems.
Look across the wide ocean!
Think a little like Vasco da Gama â and I am not talking only about Chindia â and then fit it together so that we can really take advantage of this historic opportunity, which will present itself again, before the European project simply falls flat or implodes.
I am curious to see what you will be able to say to us after May 2007.
You ought to be telling us now that you will have something to say then, because otherwise it will be the same old trick again and that will quite certainly result in failure.
Â Â  Mr President, when I spoke on the Commissionâs policy strategy at the end of last year, I commented on the fact that we had no sense whatsoever of priorities in that strategy.
We have 62Â priorities in this splendid new document.
I also see that we have now proceeded from âmoving up a gearâ to âboosting trust through actionâ.
I am not sure whether Mrs WallstrÃ¶m is still there, and I do not know whether she is responsible for inventing these wonderful phrases, but we need a much more structured and practical strategy approach from the Commission than these gimmicky words.
I also observe in here, Mr Barroso, that you are going to âtake delivery up to cruising speedâ!
Well frankly, that means that at the moment things are proceeding at a walking pace.
We want some take-off from the Commission, not just cruising along.
The problem with your strategy is not that we are short of new ideas or new initiatives, but we are actually short of real delivery of the policies that are going to create the jobs and growth of which you are so fond.
Where is there a sense in here that you are putting some real resources and priorities into sorting out the problems of the internal market?
There is a little paragraph in here that you are going to streamline the regulatory approach, that is great, but where is it in your priority actions?
You used a great phrase â and I applaud you for it â about putting out the red carpet for small enterprises.
There is not one single priority action, President Barroso, that mentions small enterprises.
So, it is very welcome that we are having a debate about this, but we need better-quality material; we need material that is much more focused on real strategy and resource utilisation, rather than on these gimmicky words that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m appears to be giving you.
We want something with a real sense that you are putting priorities on delivering the real foundations of the European Union and making the internal market work better, and not just coming out with a whole set of uncosted priorities that look good on paper but in respect of which there is no idea as to whether they are really going to work in practice.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, today I should like to concentrate on some of Europe's priorities for 2007 from the perspective of European enlargement.
It can now be said that the 2004 enlargement has been a great success for Europe, from a political, security, economic and social point of view, and I am sure that 2007 will see that success continue.
In 2007, the first new Member States are set to enter the euro zone.
In this regard, I should like to challenge the Commission to be proactive in helping those countries to prepare for the arrival of the euro, and strictly to monitor compliance with entry requirements, the so-called Maastricht criteria.
I am convinced that meeting the criteria, whether of Maastricht or of the Stability and Growth Pact, is crucial to preserving the political, financial and community credibility of the single European currency.
In 2007, the new Member States of Central and Eastern Europe will also become part of the enlarged Schengen area.
The scrapping of internal border controls between Member States, enabling genuine freedom of movement within the Union should under no circumstances mean enabling freedom of movement for all manner of criminality, illegal migration, and so forth.
The fight against crime and violence in Europe, along with the launch of the second generation of the Schengen system should, to my mind, form part of the EU's clear and practical priorities for 2007.
Lastly, 2007 should also be the year of the next enlargement, with the accession to the Union of Romania and Bulgaria.
In this regard, I should like to call on the Commission to help these two countries to prepare for accession and to ensure that they fulfil their entry requirements in every respect.
Romania and Bulgaria must be as properly prepared for accession as were the 10 accession countries in 2004.
I believe that this is extremely important for the credibility of future enlargements and if the European public is to accept this process.
Â Â  I would like to inform Members that MrÂ Barroso, President of the Commission, is obliged to leave and has therefore requested permission to bring forward his speech in order to furnish some replies and clarifications.
I give him the floor now, and immediately after his speech we shall resume the debate.
Â Â  . Unfortunately, I have to leave shortly, as I have an official engagement with the Belgian authorities.
I did not expect the sitting to carry on as late as it has, following the first part of proceedings in the Chamber before the beginning of this item on the agenda.
Come what may, the Commission will be present until the end of the debate.
I will still be able to answer some of the questions.
I should first like to express my gratitude for the comments, which were for the most part in favour of our programme.
There is obviously the underlying question of the financial perspective, which I shall discuss in a moment.
In general, however, I feel I can say that the Commission's objectives for 2007 have been received positively.
More specifically, Mr Watson asked why we put objectives relating to energy conservation and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity and not that of prosperity.
Of course, they could and should come under the heading of prosperity, but we put them under solidarity in order to highlight their enormous importance, given that the term âsolidarityâ refers to solidarity with future generations.
The struggle for a clean environment and for sustainable development is of direct relevance to our future as a whole.
This was what led us to put environmental issues under the heading of solidarity, in terms of presentation.
As regards immigration, Mrs Frassoni said that we have never given our opinion on the issue of illegal immigration and the tragedy of the many Africans who die in the Mediterranean.
I am sorry, but this is not true.
There have been a number of clear Commission positions on this issue, expressed by Mr Frattini, and the truth of the matter is that we are fighting to achieve a joint approach, where possible, among the Member States on these issues.
Mrs Frassoni also asked about the absence of any mention of transport in the context of energy policy.
I am sorry, but the Green Paper says that we have proposed the following possible actions to the Member States, and I quote, from page 11 of the English text:
âa major effort to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector, and in particular to improve rapidly urban public transport in Europeâs major citiesâ
Of course this is only a Green Paper, for consultation purposes, but that line is there.
When it comes to energy efficiency, we feel that the transport sector is crucial.
Let no one be in any doubt about this.
One of the honourable Members mentioned the opening up of labour markets in Europe.
You know that the Commission is in favour of this.
On the back of our report, a number of Member States â not only those mentioned, namely Portugal and Spain, but also Finland and the Dutch Government â have announced their intention to promote the liberalisation of the labour markets in Europe at the earliest opportunity.
This is moreover the case in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden.
I gather that others are also considering facilitating the free movement of workers in the EU.
Mr Swoboda asked how this can be better explained to our citizens, or, in other words, what we can do to explain Europeâs added value, which is a very important question.
This is easier on some issues than others.
Today, in fact, we announced a very important measure, the air safety âblacklistâ, which is the first piece of legislation adopted by this Commission, with the support of Parliament and the Council.
This is an issue on which the advantages of Community-level action are abundantly clear to the citizens.
On issues such as these, we need to go the extra mile to provide explanations and argue our point of view.
This is indeed the Commissionâs job, but I should like to add, if I may, that all of us are responsible for doing this: it is also the responsibility of Parliament, the honourable Members, national parliaments, of all those who have Europeâs interests at heart and those who feel the necessity to explain the added value that Europe brings.
On the nuclear issue, Mr Swoboda, our position is very clear: we respect the subsidiarity principle.
This is a tough question in Europe; there are Member States in favour and others against.
The way forward, as far as I am concerned, is not to avoid debate.
Mr Swoboda mentioned my meeting with President Putin.
I wish to tell you that, despite Russia's wealth of natural oil and gas resources, President Putin has stated that one of Russiaâs main priorities in the future is to develop nuclear energy.
This is therefore an issue that we cannot avoid; it is an issue that is on the agenda and that must be discussed frankly.
The Commission is not taking sides in the nuclear energy debate.
What we are promoting is the principle whereby each Member State finds forms of long-term, sustainable energy in its energy âmixâ, whilst ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle.
Mr Duff and others raised the question of the Constitution.
This is not what we are discussing here today, but I should like to confirm that the Commission remains devoted to the principles and the values enshrined in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and we are working on this issue.
We are thinking of bringing some ideas on the future of the European debate to the June European Council. Hopefully these ideas will make a worthwhile contribution.
Although the Constitutional Treaty, as the name suggests, is an intergovernmental Treaty, the Commission is committed to honouring its responsibilities and will thus want to make its own contribution to this period of reflection.
I do not know if it will be a contribution to rival the explorations made by Vasco da Gama in terms of ambition, as suggested by Mr Martin, but in any case it will be our contribution.
In any event, I was happy today to hear Montesquieu, Machiavelli and Vasco da Gama mentioned in our debate, which shows that the level of debate in Parliament is moving ever upward.
And now I shall make some comments in English â I always speak in English when I speak about money!
I got used to it during the British Presidency.
So, now some remarks in English about the financial perspectives.
My understanding is that real progress was made yesterday between the institutions.
On the basis of compromise texts presented by the Commission, a third trialogue took place yesterday afternoon with the Austrian Presidency, the negotiating team from Parliament and the Commission.
Our understanding is that the outcome of the meeting was largely positive.
On the interinstitutional agreement itself, there is almost full agreement, including on the idea of adding a new Part Three on sound financial management.
Subject to final technical verifications, texts have been agreed on important points such as the Financial Regulation, certification by Member States and the review clause.
When I say âagreedâ, I mean agreed between the delegations.
They are agreements .
All these points have been considered key elements in various resolutions adopted by Parliament.
I am pleased to see that the three institutions have been able to reach consensus on them and I am proud of the contribution that the Commission made to that agreement.
As regards figures, Parliament and the Council have exchanged their views and evaluations based on the ceilings agreed at the December European Council.
Let us be frank. There is still a big difference between the figures proposed by Parliament and those proposed by the Council.
I want to be clear about this.
The Commission supports the most ambitious possible agreement.
The question, frankly, is: how far is the Council prepared to go?
I therefore appeal for a compromise to be reached as soon as possible.
If there is no compromise, it will be negative for all of us in the European Union, in particular for the new Member States and those Member States and regions that really need our solidarity for their development.
The solution could be to find the appropriate mix between three elements: flexibility, ways of mobilising the funds on the various flexibility mechanisms and, finally, the overall ceilings.
There is light at the end of the tunnel!
A final trialogue is scheduled for 4 or 5Â April 2006 in Strasbourg.
It is my firm conviction that an agreement can be reached at that meeting.
In the meantime, the Commission will continue to play its active role in seeking the most ambitious position, but, in the end, we need ambition with an agreement.
Therefore, I approve of ambition but with realism and responsibility, trying to bring all the institutions on board.
I know that the Austrian Presidency is actively seeking an agreement with all the Member States.
Let me tell you that at the various meetings I have had with the Heads of Government â and this week I have had several â I urged them, both publicly and privately, to accept an increase in overall expenditure.
I quoted, in particular, the need for education and culture: the Erasmus and citizenship programmes.
There, at least, we should make a real effort and some progress is possible.
Let us all work hard towards reaching a good agreement and then, if we have good intentions, a good strategy and good policies.
Let us hope that we also have good instruments in terms of the financial perspectives.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is very important that Parliament should have the opportunity to hold a debate on strategy.
2007 will be a crucial year for the future of the European Union.
In order for a strategic debate to take place in Parliament, choices need to be put to the House.
The President of the Commission has not explained the choices open to the Commission, even though politics is the art of choice.
In first place is the constitutional question.
Does the European Commission believe that the Constitution will be adopted in 2007, and does it have the opportunities and methods necessary to achieve this?
In second place is the important issue of employment.
Is the answer to unemployment economic growth and reliance on economic freedom and the free movement of labour?
If not, why not return to Colbert and economic protectionism, which was once called economic patriotism?
In third place, the issue of the Lisbon Strategy is a key problem for the future of the European Union.
The matter has been reduced to rhetoric, as on the one hand we claim that the future of the European Union depends on the Lisbon Strategy, while on the other hand, when deciding on the budget and on budget cuts, the first cuts are made to scientific research and the education system.
The European Union has the ability to make Europe a place of innovation and a global partner, but to do this it needs a strategy.
It is my belief that todayâs debate is evidence of the importance of Parliament, and it would be a good idea if all the other European institutions took Parliament seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, I have read all 15 dreary pages of this document and believe it to be a report of the past rather than a document for the future.
The phrase that comes to mind is one often seen on a schoolboyâs report: âcould do betterâ.
Indeed, if your dream is to change the minds of the people of the European Union, it is a âmust do betterâ.
We are treated to terms like âstrategic objectsâ, âpolicy strategyâ, ânew directionsâ, âeffective communicationsâ and âgenuine dialoguesâ.
We are promised that more money will be spent on regional funds, cohesion funds, social funds, globalised funds, fisheries funds, etc. â all this to gain the trust and commitment of the citizens.
But where are the words âfreedomâ, âchoiceâ and âthe individualâ?
George Orwellâs comes to mind â except that I believe he got the year wrong, but it is just around the corner; then it will be âcontrol, control, controlâ of the individual.
Given the referendums on the EU, or even the elections, the true sentiments of the people will show that most want to say ânoâ to this bureaucratic nightmare.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry that President Barroso has been summoned by the Belgian authorities.
I am sure if he parks his car more carefully in future he will be able to stay until the end of our debates, but no doubt the message will be taken back to him.
I welcome the title of this document: âboosting trust through actionâ.
Sometimes you boost trust through action, and sometimes by non-action.
Sometimes it is by withdrawing action, by sunset clauses, by reviews, and it is always by checking the small print of the proposals.
We do nothing to boost confidence among our electors by having silly stories as we have had in the United Kingdom this week about church organs, and the European Unionâs intention under the WEEE Directive to ban church organ repairs and building because of the lead content.
That is daft and I hope if there is any threat of that there will be a swift telephone call from the Vatican to say that StÂ Peterâs Basilica will not stand for such nonsense.
However, that is the small print.
I believe we should be reconnecting with our constituents, we should relocate that purpose of our European venture and we should communicate it to the public.
You do that for example by the next debate on energy, by showing that we are working together in solidarity to face any threats that there may be.
Montesquieu has been quoted.
As Dumas wrote, âall for one and one for allâ: we need the European grid of energy which can resist any attempt to pick off any one of our Member States.
It is also about working on health to make sure that we have the collective work done on the flu pandemic preparations.
We must take up the Austrian proposal for a diabetes framework; we must work hard on the Commissionâs own proposal on mental health.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m will agree with me that we must work hard to convince the public that we can get it right on chemicals and on pollution issues, eco-labelling and all those other things which would make sense to the public.
They would see it as value added by the European Union and then we will not have the same problems that some of our Member States had recently in terms of voting in referenda.
Â Â  Based on my own country's experience of reforms, there is only one thing I can say with confidence: economic and political programmes are impossible to implement, unless there is reform of the actual institutions.
I find it hard to imagine why the European Commission, which declares the simplification of regulation as its aim, is not changing its own structures, not reorganising the work of its institutions, which after all create those complex documents.
These things are simply incomprehensible and inconsistent.
Let me give you a simple example.
Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit.
They went around various directorates hoping to acquire information on the work of a directorate.
Everywhere they were given the same information.
And the Commissioner who came to our Budget Committee even said that not all funds are used for public relations and publicity campaigns.
But all work is duplicated.
The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished.
We absolutely must do something with the reform of the European Commission's work.
The European Parliament at least is showing some initiative and aims to reform its work, so that we can implement those ambitious goals.
I always regret the fact that we do not draw upon the experience of the new countries.
We, the new countries, really understand that, first of all, we must reform our institutions.
I trust that the European Commission will present a reform programme for its government structure as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make three points.
The first point is that I am actually playing the âgood copâ as opposed to the âbad copâ like Malcolm Harbour.
I think this strategy is quite good.
The Commission is coming forward with this at a very opportune time, when there is an atmosphere of nationalism and protectionism.
As a matter of fact, unlike many of the strategies that you have provided before, Mr Barroso â I would call them ânatoâ: no action talk only â this one has a lot of action.
However, I agree with Mr Harbour that you might want to come up with an alternative name.
You call this document â not necessarily very aptly â âboosting trust through actionâ.
Perhaps you should seek some advice from an advertising agency before you come up with the next branding.
It is a tough thing to do but that is not going to do it.
The second point is that I agree with the focus on communication.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, you of course play a very important part in doing that.
We do not have a democratic deficit, we do not have an information deficit â we have almost too much of it â but we have a communication deficit.
The paper that you put forward on European communication is quite good.
We have big problems: John Bowis was talking about church organs a second ago and of course we know that it is utter rubbish.
However, when respectable broadsheets like come up with headlines like âEU forces you to recycle dildosâ, then you are in trouble.
It was about a directive on electrical appliances: if you take the appliance back to a store, it must be recycled.
However, it is this type of communication that we really need to get rid of.
The final point I wanted to make is that the EU is very often used as a scapegoat.
Everything that is bad comes out of the EU, everything that is good comes from the Member States.
Therefore, I would encourage you, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, to focus more on communication on the Constitution.
It is a good Constitution, we need it; keep it alive until spring 2007 and let us see what happens after that.
Â Â  . Mr President, we bring this document and annual policy strategy to the European Parliament in order to receive your input and ideas on how to improve it.
We therefore listen to you very carefully.
We have already heard a number of points that would improve our paper.
The same goes for the discussion I had with the Conference of Committee Chairmen.
This will give us a lot, since we are able to have a truly political discussion about our priorities, the balance we want to achieve and the messages we want to send.
I think we are coming back to the fact that we want to achieve results and we want to win trust.
These are basic and core conditions for us in order to build a stronger European Union.
Whatever title we choose, there will be linguistic or other problems with it.
I am not sure we will ever be able to find something on which everybody agrees.
However, our aim is that, by showing good results and by delivering on our commitments, we will also be able to build trust.
If we engage in a democratic discussion and debate with citizens, it will also be easier to explain why we need constitutional reform in order to achieve those good results.
That is the way we have to go: we have to engage with citizens in a democratic manner.
I am very happy to have the opportunity to tell all the people in the UK that church organ pipes are not covered by the directive on electronic and electrical waste.
You can fill all your churches with as many leaded pipes as you want.
The Commission will not interfere with that.
Just make sure that now and then the poor people in the UK hear the truth, as they rarely receive correct information.
You can rest absolutely assured that the directive does not cover church organ pipes.
I also hope we can open up the Council meetings.
The Finnish Presidency is now preparing to make that a reality, and this will definitely help to end the blame game.
If citizens can follow what their ministers do in the Council â the kinds of positions they take and statements they make, if they are there at all â it will help to end the blame game.
Acting in partnership, we will all have to explain what the European Union does and what it is.
Perhaps we can make some progress.
I hope that during the Austrian Presidency we have made progress, because this is also a concern of yours.
Definitely under the Finnish Presidency, where we can take it a step further, we should make progress.
Thank you for all your wise comments on the annual policy strategy.
I will definitely take all your comments back with me and pass them on to all the other Commissioners.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the oral question to the Council (O-0007/2006 â B6-0009/2006) by MrÂ Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the security of energy supply.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am delighted to be putting this question on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
It follows the question that was debated in January on the subject of security of supply of energy.
The world has moved on a little since then.
We have now the Green Paper from the Commission and the conclusions of the Council meeting last week.
Both of those are of great interest and show clearly that many of the points raised in debate previously have been taken on board.
I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate the Council for doing that.
It is also welcome that energy matters have risen to the top of the agenda.
This is an issue crucially about import dependence on a range of fuels.
Therefore, our question asks what the Commission will do in order to react appropriately to developments and changes in the geopolitical, strategic and diplomatic situation.
However, I wish to emphasise that I feel those aspects are more within the purview of our colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I am very happy for some of my colleagues who will follow in this debate to make those points.
The most important point to make about security of supply is the essential requirement of diversity: diversity of fuel, diversity of source and diversity of technology.
This is absolutely essential.
I should like to make the point that I was a little disappointed in the Green Paper â which we look forward to debating in full and due course â because perhaps not enough recognition was given to the crucial role of nuclear energy in providing the largest share of electricity in the European Union.
Parliament recently adopted an amendment seeking an ambitious but realistic target of 60% of electricity in the European Union coming from ultra-low or non-carbon-emitting sources.
This is only possible with a combination of renewable energy sources and nuclear energy.
I note with great pleasure that the Council conclusions refer to âsustainable and efficient energy systemsâ.
Nuclear energy springs to my mind in that context.
However, there are other energy sources that we must remember.
Since the EU enlarged, our proportion of dependence on imports of coal has gone down from 50% to 35%, because one particular Member State is a significant producer of coal.
We should not lose sight of the benefits and potential of clean coal technology when we have this significant indigenous energy source.
The motion for a resolution attached to this oral question places emphasis, among other things, on greater efficiency in the transport sector.
It places emphasis on the importance of researching and developing future energy technologies and it looks to proposals for improving energy efficiency in buildings.
We have given the Commissioner four questions and we look forward to hearing from him in due course.
We want to know what we can do about reducing our dependence on imported oil and gas.
We want to know what other sources he thinks we may develop.
Perhaps he has some thoughts on gas supplies, management of gas stocks and storage facilities for gas.
Finally, we look to the Commission to weave into this issue of security of supply the related question of climate change and how we adjust our energy policy in a post-Kyoto era to achieve our three aims of sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Chichester for the question.
It comes at a good time.
As a matter of fact, the Austrian Presidency was exactly eight hours old when the point was driven home to us that energy is a European problem, a problem for all of us, because at 8 a.m. on the morning of 1Â January 2006, the gas conflict between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova actually began.
It became evident that we needed to address this problem, despite it not being entirely new.
However, its importance has become evident, especially during the course of this year.
It is quite clear that for Europe, energy supply is a question of the highest importance.
This is why the European Council meeting tomorrow will deal with this matter as one of its priorities.
We also convened an additional extraordinary Council meeting of energy ministers, to which you have alluded, in order to prepare for the European Council meeting in the best way possible.
That meeting of energy ministers came up with very useful and helpful suggestions which will be discussed tomorrow and the day after.
It also became evident that, in connection with the gas dispute between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, the question of energy supply is not only a question that we can discuss among ourselves.
When I had the pleasure of reporting to the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday it was very much stressed that this is a question of the foreign policy of the European Union. This is because we need to cooperate with our partners and with our neighbours in order to take their problems into account.
It is important for us to emphasise the political and economic stability of the transit country, for example.
We also need to include countries of supply and consumer countries in our debates.
This is why we have intensive relations in this connection with OPEC, Russia and other important countries such as China and India.
We are also active as regards international instruments.
I will just mention very briefly the International Energy Agency, the International Energy Forums and Euromed, which plays an important role.
There are other important international agreements, such as for example the energy agreement with south-east Europe.
I hope, MrÂ Chichester, that we will get the agreement of this House very soon, as we hope to receive this before the Ministersâ meeting in June.
There are of course also other important aspects to the security of energy supply, such as the question of the diversification of our energy sources, especially to include domestic energy sources, in particular, too, the question of renewable energy sources.
Demand management, including improving the efficiency of energy use, is also of highest importance in this connection, however.
In talking to its partners, the Council regularly emphasises that adequate investment in infrastructure and exploration are also crucial.
For this reason, the Council also considers it of the highest importance that the resolution of the European Parliament and the Council on trans-European energy networks should be adopted soon, since it will be impossible to diversify supply and hence have greater security of supply without resources to expand the European energy network.
So far as the security of supply in particular is concerned, the Council has in the past already adopted legal provisions, which I will not mention in detail now for reasons of time.
I will refer briefly also to the Directive on measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, which was adopted in 2004.
Turning now to your question about alternative energy sources, Mr Chichester, the Council believes that two main components of energy policy deserve particular mention here, and I have already referred to them briefly: the question of diversification of fuel sources and energy efficiency.
As has already been said in todayâs debate â energy was a key element in the debate you have just concluded, and rightly so â the Member States must themselves decide on the energy mix they will choose as an expression of their national policies.
Whatever the Member States decide, diversification of fuel sources naturally includes â and I think this is particularly important â diversification of supplier countries, so far as energy imports are concerned; but renewable energy sources are also particularly important here.
In this connection, the Council can also point to a whole series of instruments, which I shall mention only briefly here.
Regarding the diversification of fuel sources, especially through the use of renewable energies, the Council and European Parliament have already adopted a Directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in 2001.
I would also like to draw your attention in this connection to the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.
In December last year, agreement was also reached with the European Parliament on the draft directive on energy efficiency and energy services, which I hope can be adopted in the next few months; we are working to that end.
So much on the question of energy saving.
I would also like to point out that the âIntelligent Energy for Europeâ Programme is already making an important contribution here as part of the sixth Framework Research Programme.
The seventh Framework Research Programme and the âIntelligent Energy for Europeâ Programme currently under discussion as part of the CIP Programme will also contain an appropriate and relevant priority.
There are also measures in the non-legislative sphere; only last year, for example, the energy ministers made a contribution to the 2005 Spring European Council.
The Council is currently looking very urgently and attentively at the Biomass Action Plan, which has a high priority for us.
Mr Chichester, I would like to conclude by referring to your question about Kyoto post 2012, the security of energy supply and the competitiveness of the European Union and saying that in our view this effect may be fundamentally positive.
It seems to me particularly important to say that we are convinced that a well-designed environment policy will have a positive effect on growth and employment.
Measures to promote energy efficiency lead to ecological innovations and environmental technologies, and demand for such innovations is growing steadily all over the world.
This is also creating opportunities for our economies.
By diversifying energy sources and especially by promoting renewable energy sources, we also want to make a contribution to the security of energy supply and at the same time to stemming climate change and increasing the competitiveness of the EU as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, the previous debate on the Commissionâs work programme focused a lot on energy.
I am very grateful for this and for the question that was put to the Commission and made this debate possible.
In a way, the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy has given the answers as to how we should proceed in addressing the challenges set out in your question.
We should also realise that this is a global challenge: the tightness of supply and demand, climate change, import dependency and investment needs in the energy sector are all global challenges.
The response from the European Union is a common energy policy.
We have significant support from citizens.
In a recent opinion poll, 47% of European citizens supported action at European level.
We received a lot of support from many Member States and national parliaments after the publication of the Green Paper.
It is clear that the main added value of this Green Paper lies in this common approach where we stress that security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability cannot be separated in our energy policy.
All three should interact.
At the same time, it is also clear that we cannot find a silver bullet and there is no silver bullet.
It means that in the area of energy policy we should focus on a set of measures in specific areas.
Firstly, it is important for security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness to provide a really competitive, open, transparent EU internal market.
That is also crucial for security of supply.
We provide for some actions that really provide for not only stronger competition but also cross-border trade: cross-border energy transactions.
This is an extremely important area and I expect support from this House in the future on these issues.
The second issue, which is extremely important â as the President-in-Office indicated â is solidarity.
The Union is strong when there is solidarity.
Solidarity means, firstly, being ready for extreme situations; secondly, it involves the solidarity mechanism and, thirdly, it involves a lot of information on what is happening on the energy markets.
I agree that diversity is the most important issue, but to use this diversity in the best possible way we need a lot of information and a lot of transparency.
We provide for such measures by revisiting the oil stocks directive, placing more focus on the security of supply of electricity and gas and looking for new mechanisms that really correspond to the needs of our citizens, who would like to know that should an extreme situation arise, we have a mechanism and reserves in place that could be used in such a situation.
Then there is the issue of the energy mix.
That should be the responsibility of each Member State â it is a question of subsidiarity.
However, we know that action in one particular Member State influences all the other Member States, at least the neighbouring Member States.
That means that we should take action taking into account our neighboursâ energy policies and try to boost the best possible actions.
A strategic EU energy review, which would allow us to revisit these issues continually, is necessary to provide the best approach in terms of each stateâs energy mix.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy development will definitely be on the rise in deciding an energy mix.
However, at the same time, I also believe that the nuclear energy that is now in the energy mix will be used in many Member States.
It is important, however, to ensure that this energy is used in a safe and sustainable way.
I also believe in the diversity that could bring us new technologies and in clean coal, carbon sequestration and so on.
We now have a good example with the Shell and Statoil project involving carbon sequestration and post-combustion.
This is not a demonstration project: for the first time, a real industrial project involving 860Â megawatts is bringing new possibilities for a diversification in the energy mix that corresponds to the objectives of our energy policy.
Some people have indicated that there is not enough focus on energy efficiency.
I disagree, as there is a lot of emphasis on it.
Parliament has debated the Green Paper on energy efficiency.
We will propose a very ambitious European action plan on energy efficiency, which will place a lot of emphasis on transport.
However, the focus on energy efficiency will be continued in all Member States through their national action plans and this is extremely important.
Regarding technology, I mention just one example: Europe is able to provide for new technologies, but we should use all the possibilities in a coherent way.
I believe that the European strategic energy technology plan really could make a difference.
Last, but not least, the areas I should like to bring to your attention are international.
The best response for security of supply is not only diversity, but also lies in global, transparent and competitive gas and oil markets.
This is the vision that could provide the necessary diversity.
For this to happen, we need to stabilise the countries that have gas and oil resources.
We should build infrastructure that allows us to bring more gas from different regions in the world, because only in this way can we provide security of supply in gas and oil.
We should promote our vision of the market to the near neighbourhood.
The energy community should be expanded.
Tomorrow, the European Council will have the opportunity to debate these issues.
I believe that the momentum created by the Green Paper for establishing a European common policy in energy will be continued.
I am very grateful for the debate and I look forward to working with this House towards establishing a European energy policy that corresponds to the basic needs of our citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, for several months we have been in the middle of a new strategic debate.
We see the conflict with Iran, and the war in Iraq, but we also see conflict with OPEC countries where we would not have thought that such developments would occur.
We see that China is making strategic purchases on the energy markets; we see that Russia is moving away from a continuous, reliable policy; and we see that world markets are undergoing very dynamic developments.
We therefore need to stand by our goals, the goals of the Lisbon Agenda.
We want growth and employment.
Therefore, energy policy â and I should like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for putting the focus on energy efficiency â is a top priority.
This could open up whole new areas of business to our small and medium-sized enterprises.
It creates jobs in craft trades, and small business cycles that give us energy security.
On the other hand, we must not forget the competitiveness of our energy industry.
In this respect, I call in particular on the Commission to look closely into the impact of the Kyoto Protocol post-2012 on our energy-intensive primary industries, such as the steel and aluminium industry and many other sectors, and on our generation of energy.
I think that we also need to look at the environmental aspects of sustainability, with particular reference to competitiveness.
I call on the Commission and MrÂ Barroso to make use of the various services of the Commission â be it with regard to communications strategy, taxation policy, external economic relations, foreign policy, competition policy or environmental policy â in taking on this important task, which is hugely significant for our future in Europe.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we live in a world that is increasingly starved of energy.
The main consumers â the Americans and Europeans â cannot deny the Chinese, Indians and others the right to strive after our living standards and to consume more energy.
With an increasing global demand, the consumer countries must unite in the face of markets that are organised into cartels with the aim of influencing the level at which prices are set.
In a context such as this, energy savings and increased energy efficiency are the main priority.
The International Energy Agency has calculated that if computer manufacturers were simply forced to reduce the amount of energy consumed by computers in standby mode to one watt, instead of the current ten watts, this would save the equivalent of twenty 1Â 000 megawatt power plants.
We need to make more use of renewable energy sources: Brazil produces 700Â million litres of ethanol, a by-product of its sugar industry; Mauritius saves 20Â 000Â tonnes of oil by burning fibrous waste in its power stations; Sweden is going to force all of its service stations to offer biofuels; and, in Fiji, diesel engines are being run on copra oil.
That being said, renewable energy sources cannot totally replace traditional energy sources.
Technological breakthroughs are needed in relation to solar energy, hydrogen cells and so on. Even wind power, for which Europe has significant offshore potential, requires substantial investment to make the networks secure.
The world will not be able to give up coal and nuclear power in a hurry.
These choices are the responsibility of the Member States, which must freely decide what their energy mix will be.
Europe will have to invest more in research on energy efficiency, on renewables, on carbon sequestration, on clean coal, on nuclear safety and on fusion.
The Union will have to implement a more united energy policy.
It must complete its internal market by preventing a situation whereby the markets are divided up to the advantage of oligopolies.
I will conclude by saying that the Spring Council must make a decision: a Europe without a common energy policy will be nothing other than a weak power.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, representatives of Austria, ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to conceive just how incredibly dependent Europe is on imports, and that puts us in a very worrying situation.
We need to overhaul production and distribution and to regulate the market in such a way that it operates properly.
In other words, consumer rights and transfer capacity need to be regulated, and the dominant position of the big energy companies looked into.
We are not using existing technology.
We are reducing research appropriations in the ongoing budget negotiations, and industry is not being given the clear signals it needs if it is to dare to invest and to do so on a long-term basis.
The Member States themselves choose their energy mix, and that is all to the good.
We are now at a stage at which the Green Paper has arrived.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the Green Paper and find it extremely constructive, as, too, we do MrsÂ Kroesâ work on the issue of competition.
MrÂ Winkler, you began, however, by saying that, at eight oâclock on 1Â January, Europe was given a shock where energy was concerned and that we were given it by Russia.
In this situation, many heads of national governments are now getting nervous and wish to re-regulate.
They want to see protectionism within the energy sector, a development that would be diametrically opposed to what the Council has previously said it wanted to see and to what the Commission and Parliament want to see.
That is a disgrace when we are at a stage at which, by siding with them, we can help the new Member States obtain stability where the supply of energy is concerned and at which we can solve major environmental problems.
It is a disgrace to put forward these arguments when we can also create so many jobs in Europe.
I am sorry to say that our own Swedish head of government, GÃ¶ran Persson, has today said that he wishes to re-regulate the Swedish energy market.
If you go on doing what you have always done, you will go on getting what you have always got, as the saying goes.
We cannot, however, afford to have such a situation in Europe any longer.
We need extremely tough decisions to be taken, and Austria, which will chair tomorrowâs meeting of the Council of Ministers, has a heavy responsibility.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the Heads of State or Government will meet tomorrow for an energy summit.
Will they discuss energy?
I fear they will not; tomorrow MrÂ Berlusconi will put on a big show, and Enel will announce that it is going to take over Suez.
In other words, it will be a show for the Italian elections, and MrÂ Villepin and President Chirac will use the whole affair to paint themselves once again as national heroes in a French government that is falling apart.
These are all just smoke bombs over the internal market.
What is the real issue in the EU's internal market?
As it currently operates, it is the biggest economic mistake that Europe has ever experienced.
Enel fleeces Italian consumers, Endesa fleeces Spanish consumers, Suez fleeces Belgian consumers and E.ON fleeces German consumers.
And now we are supposed to be discussing whether we have national champions or â as MrÂ Barroso says â even bigger European champions that are even more dominant in their markets and put consumers and competitiveness in Europe at even greater risk.
No, that is not the question!
The real question is this: will we ultimately win through politically, and be able to regulate appropriately and independently and separate the networks from everything else?
Transport policy must be central to energy policy, and, until it is a central element, all of these documents are just paper tigers.
The most important contributions we have to make by means of our policies are long-term goals, renewable energy, efficiency and CO2 targets â otherwise there can be no security of investment.
What this debate is lacking, it seems to me, is a new methodology.
We have not so far managed to achieve good coordination at all levels.
In other words, we need new partnerships.
And what is MrÂ Barroso doing, going around like a bull in a china shop as usual?
He is putting energy, an issue that divides European citizens more than any other, at the centre of the debate!
Is it even possible to act with less political sense that MrÂ Barroso is currently doing with regard to the press?
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we know the large oil companiesâ forecasts.
They say that by 2030 approximately 80% of the worldâs energy will still be produced from fossil fuels.
History shows that these forecasts are credible, even if we were to do everything possible to save energy, improve energy efficiency, support the use of alternative forms of energy and use biofuels, and even if we were to build more nuclear power stations while decommissioning the old reactors.
It is a well-known fact that there are no longer any major oil deposits in the EU countries and the gas in our region will also be used up over the course of the next 10 years.
According to the Green Paper just out, EU import dependency as a whole will have risen to 71% by 2030.
If the oil companiesâ predictions that our energy needs will mainly be met by using fossil fuels come true, there will be fiercer competition for these fuels.
The EU wants to satisfy all of the growth in its energy needs by using gas.
The development of the liquefaction of gas will aggravate the situation, favourable to the EU countries, whereby the majority of the worldâs gas reserves are on the Eurasian continent at the end of pipeline connections.
The availability and price of oil and gas are crucially influenced by competition for the same natural resources by China and other countries in the Far East, resources which hitherto have been almost exclusively used by the OECD countries.
Our group supports the Commission in its search for alternatives.
There is no other solution which is as simple.
If we continue with a policy of burning fossil fuels, the EU will need to establish good commercial relations with Russia.
Finally, let me say a word about âEuropean solutionsâ.
A policy that results in the price of electricity rising in some countries in order that it can come down in others is unacceptable.
For some countries, this is a form of solidarity that is too expensive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, what has happened in recent weeks with the Suez-Enel case and what is happening at the moment regarding E.onâs bid for Endesa, which has been blocked by the Spanish Governmentâs decree increasing the powers of the national energy council, confirms a regressionist tendency of the Member States with regard to the principles and rules on which the European Union is based.
Only yesterday, MrÂ Barroso said, âI hope that the heads of government will answer the question: do they have the political will to find European solutions to European problems?â
The energy problem has been examined by the Commission in all its aspects in a valuable, almost point-by-point analysis, which I do not want to go into here because it is well known to all.
In the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group concerns are voiced that all European citizens today share, and solutions are put forward that a majority of citizens and Member States would like to see.
On one point, however, the proposal is deficient, and that is in relation to the decision-making centres.
How many are there, and which are they?
In yesterdayâs statement, again, MrÂ Barroso spoke of the existence of 25 different energy markets and 25 different policies in the sector.
In addition to this devastating statistic with regard to the hoped-for converging policies of the EU, there is the need to guarantee the physical security of Europeâs energy infrastructure against the risks of natural disasters and terrorist attacks, as well as its security against political risks, including interruptions of supply.
The question I put to each and every one of us is: âCan Europe be governed by 25 different governments, or has the moment perhaps been reached when European strategy regarding foreign policy, security and energy should have a single decision-making centre in order to be able to deal in a timely and consistent manner with the challenges now thrown up by the fast-moving modern world?â
Â Â  Mr President, recent interruptions to the energy supply have resulted in a renewed awareness of the vulnerability of imported energy.
Energy is essential to every country.
What lessons can we learn about security of supply?
It is now a fact that energy policy and foreign policy are inter-related.
The European Union has to beware of pressure from energy-producing countries, and if it is to do that, then greater diversification of energy suppliers is a political necessity.
Furthermore, the crisis situation involving Russia and Ukraine has made the option of importing liquid natural gas from other regions a live issue once more.
The fragile functioning of the internal market is also demanding our attention, and recent debate on the creation of national champions should not distract us from that.
The Member States already possess powerful instruments to deal with issues of security of supply; in addition to drawing on a wider variety of sources of energy, they can also call more upon their emergency reserves.
Such measures, as well as enhanced cooperation between the Member States, enable us to move forward in ways in which a detailed European energy policy does not.
Caution is also a prime requirement in concluding an energy agreement with Russia.
Critical distance is preferable to further integration in the energy sector with countries with which our relations are less than stable.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europeâs dependence in the energy sector is worrying, as the Commissionâs Green Paper shows.
Italy is even more dependent in the energy field, as Enea and Istat data irrefutably confirm.
Italy has an energy production capacity of only approximately 30 million tonnes of oil equivalent and has to import energy from abroad, and its dependency has grown to about 85% in 2005 as against 83% in 2001 and 81% in 1995.
Within the European Union, only Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal are more energy-dependent than Italy.
Italyâs energy needs are therefore strongly dependent on oil, which comprises 45%, and gas, comprising 32%.
The rise in energy prices translates for everyone into greater expenditure on petrol and on electricity and gas bills, and environmental concerns also influence choices in this field, to the extent that the nuclear option is becoming topical again.
In order to combat energy dependence we have to make the supply system more flexible, rationalise the use of energy, distribute energy locally both with small conventional facilities and with renewables, and invest more in research: it seems that it is no longer possible to delay thermodynamic solar power, geothermic energy, the use of biomass, the introduction of new combined gas cycles in electricity generating systems and, lastly, the revival of nuclear power.
These are the issues and the challenges of the future, but we need to ask ourselves why Italy and Europe are still losing ground to Russia and, above all, to China.
Gas and oil from Iran to China and Russia, energy flows and resources in which European companies have for decades invested a huge amount of research capital â all this has been wasted for the sake of servility to non-EU interests.
This means that Europe is once again missing a great opportunity for development, security and social well-being, and is increasing its dependence in terms of both energy and politics.
Europe must find the courage to make geopolitical choices appropriate to its interests if it truly wishes to secure a future for its peoples.
This is the kind of revolutionary action, above and beyond existing directives, that Europeans expect from the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, energy, as we have recently witnessed, is also sometimes treated as a weapon for exerting political influence by states which enjoy a quasi-monopolistic position, as in the Russia/Ukraine case.
That is what really triggered this sudden interest in energy policy.
The problem should therefore be considered as a foreign and security policy issue and so, besides Commissioner Piebalgs, I would willingly address Mr Solana and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner.
It is essential for the EU to develop a true external security policy dimension in relation to gas and oil deliveries, which is distinct from energy policies .
We should not mix them up.
The question is, what added value can the EU offer in the event of politically motivated cuts in energy supplies?
Proposals, as included in the Green Paper, go in the right direction, although they are still too modest.
Solidarity, as one of the main principles of European integration, creates an obligation to assist all those Member States which are in difficulty.
We must extend this solidarity principle to problems related to energy supply shortages caused by political action.
What is needed is cooperation and solidarity, not competition among Member States in securing external energy supplies, as happens today.
The forthcoming Spring Council should, above all, consider three issues of utmost importance: first, mutual assistance among Member States in case of energy supply cuts; second, mutual consultation mechanisms among Member States for major gas and delivery contracts; and third, the inclusion of an energy security clause in all EU treaties with third countries, which are either a source of energy or a transit country.
An energy security clause should impose an obligation to follow a certain code of conduct and to promise not to use energy delivery as an instrument of political pressure.
The time has come to move beyond declarations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, energy policy has a clear external dimension, which emerged dramatically in the January crisis between Russia and Ukraine.
For its part, the European Union has in recent years put in place policies such as strategic cooperation with Russia, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, the Neighbourhood Policy and the agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
These relations involve the main oil and gas producing countries.
The energy issue has been tackled in a disjointed manner: from liberalisation of the markets to security of supply, efficiency and better use of resources.
To date, all this has not looked like a structured policy.
The European Council meeting tomorrow and the day after will tackle these issues, but European governments seem divided over whether we need to have a common policy or whether we should continue with bilateral relations based on historical, geographical or political factors.
As the European Parliament, we support the Commissionâs efforts and at the same time ask for more.
This will not be possible, however, without answers to some major questions.
Are we intending to reduce overall dependence on fossil fuels?
By how much?
Are we able to estimate future needs on this point?
Are we setting ourselves the target of coordinating demand with other importing countries, above all developing countries?
Will we submit a single, unanimous proposal at the next G8 meeting in Saint Petersburg?
The answers to these questions presuppose something very like a European energy plan.
The Green Paper constitutes a first step, but there is a lot more to be done and the European Parliament naturally wishes to be fully involved in this policy.
Â Â  This resolution is a very important and timely document, expressing the European Parliament's position on the changing situation in the European Union energy sector.
The resolution marks the beginning of the debate on the Green Paper for a safe, competitive and harmonious energy policy.
Alongside energy consumption efficiency, the variety of energy sources mentioned in the resolution is the fundamental factor in reducing European Union states' dependence on the supply of energy resources from third countries.
Significant attention is paid to the area of nuclear energy, as nuclear energy is an inseparable part of the European Union energy sector.
It is very important for Lithuania and other states, which have insufficient wind, solar and geothermal power or other alternatives to gases and oils.
It is right that initiative to develop nuclear energy should remain the prerogative of Member States.
Legislation must be laid down so that part of the funding allocated to agricultural policy is available for biomass growth, production and energy needs.
The principle of energy solidarity between Member States is extremely important.
It is important in talks with the wider world.
When planning energy sector projects, Member States should assess the consequences these will have on other countries.
Therefore, I believe we should focus on revising the annexes of the TEN-E.
The project list contains conflicting views of what I would call the political Northern Pipeline in the Baltic Sea.
Unfortunately, it fails to mention any of the projects which are important for the Baltic countries and Poland, such as the âAmberâ pipeline or electricity connections, allowing the isolated Baltic region to be quickly switched into the European area.
Â Â  â Mr President, I greatly fear that the Commission proposal on natural gas, which comes in the wake of the Russian/Ukrainian crisis, is not commensurate with circumstances or requirements.
It is inadequate.
If we want to achieve the objectives set by the Commission, we need to invest more and more in drastically strengthening renewable sources of energy, in saving energy, in developing energy networks.
With the budgets that you are preparing, these objectives cannot be achieved; we cannot make serious progress in constructing a common energy policy, we cannot achieve cheaper and better technology for renewable sources and energy savings with the money provided under the 7th framework programme for these objectives and, with the steps that you propose for the common energy policy, we cannot combat the practices of the cartels that rule â live and rule â at the expense of consumers and of a unified Europe in energy matters.
One more thing: renewable sources of energy are one thing and nuclear energy is another.
Do not try to put everything in one basket and use renewable sources of energy like a big curtain to cover the truth, which is that a large proportion of European citizens feel anything from reservations to opposition to the use of nuclear energy and that cannot be made to disappear with a magic wand.
Â Â  â Mr President, the reliability of energy supplies to the European Union is dwindling with each passing month as our reliance on imported energy grows.
The only thing we can afford to lose in this respect are unreliable and unpredictable partners.
Their role on the European energy market should be kept within safe boundaries.
To the surprise of many â but by no means all â European countries, Russia has recently proved to be one such unreliable partner.
Russiaâs supplies have recently become restricted because of climatic conditions in Siberia, the lack of security for pipelines in the north of the country and the uncontrollable urge to use energy as a means of exerting political pressure on the countryâs western-oriented neighbours.
For this reason energy cooperation cannot be confined to countries within the European Union.
Our energy problems come precisely from outside the European Union.
However, some of the solutions also lie outside the European Union, for example the Norwegian oil fields, which is why not only energy policy, but also trans-European networks should transcend the boundaries of the European Union.
This is why an enhanced neighbourhood policy should incorporate energy, and this is why the Polish proposal for an energy pact based on solidarity, and boldly transcending the boundaries of the European Union, should be the subject of more serious discussion at the coming summit.
Energy security is above all a matter of foreign and defence policy.
It is naÃ¯ve to pretend that new sources of energy or the imposition of restrictions on industry, such as climate agreements, are the solution.
For a long time to come, renewable sources of energy will remain an expensive addition to our energy resources.
Imposing excessively severe restrictions on European industry, often on the basis of dubious scientific assumptions, is a factor restricting our competitiveness.
Â Â  Mr President, the EUâs shambolic liberalisation of the energy market has already resulted in gross distortions.
Good Europeans, like Britain, diligently liberalise their markets but bad Europeans, like France and Germany, have refused to do so.
Liberalisation has directly resulted in enormous increases in the wholesale gas price in the UK.
The EU has added more than GBPÂ 200 per annum to the average UK gas bill.
Now the EU wants a common energy policy so it can get its hands on what remains of Britainâs gas and oil reserves.
Mr Chichester asks how the Council and Commission will react to developments in the world energy market and how supplies will be secured: it is the right question, but it has been put to the wrong people.
He should be putting it to the British Government.
The Conservative Party, in the form of Mr Chichester, is yet again inviting the European Union to meddle further and deeper in Britainâs affairs.
Britain should follow the example of France and Germany and protect its own national interests and those of its domestic energy consumers.
Â Â  Mr President, over the coming days, the Heads of State or Government will debate the possibility of launching a common energy policy.
Both the governments and the citizens have become aware of the seriousness of the situation, of the vulnerability of our system of supply, of our dependence on imports and of our urgent need to take measures which are a match for the circumstances.
The European Parliament fully shares the citizensâ concerns and we in this House must therefore send a clear and strong message in favour of energy independence for the Union.
To this end, we must support a complete energy mix, with a prominent role for emission-free energy sources, such as nuclear and renewable energy.
The time has come seriously to consider the possibility of investing in alternative supply routes, in order to reduce the impact of situations such as the recent crisis between Russia and Ukraine.
On the supply side, we must place the emphasis on improving energy efficiency at all levels of consumption and production.
In this regard, the dissemination of information and good practices is crucial.
We must take a firm position in favour of a genuine free internal energy market, improving infrastructures and interconnections and leaving behind once and for all the outmoded notion of great national champions.
We are in the 21st Century, in an increasingly integrated European Union, and this is not the time to move backwards.
Let there be no mistake: protectionism does not just harm our economies and our competitiveness, but above all it harms the consumer.
In a globalised world, the national giants are minnows at world level, and Europeanist speeches are of little use if, when it comes to making decisions, words have not been followed up with concrete actions.
I shall end, Mr President, by calling upon the Council not to miss this opportunity.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are caught up in a persistent energy crisis.
The reason is obvious: the gap between consumption and supply is so narrow that almost anything can make prices soar.
This can happen, for example, as a result of a storm on the other side of the ocean, and many other things.
We have a good solution to this problem: energy cooperation within the Union.
That, however, is being prevented by an âanti-solidarity movementâ on the part of certain Member States, which has actually grown among the founding members.
They do not permit competition in their own countries, but they buy up energy companies in other countries using this idle money.
Nothing is achieved this way.
They also did the same in the telecommunications sector, when the telecom markets were to be opened up. As a consequence, we had buyers from abroad once again.
If we in the European Union do not show solidarity, we can forget about the energy solutions which are being discussed here.
One condition of a common energy policy is to have shared objectives, which our leaders commit to and which they do not simply take advantage of, as is now the case.
How should this be achieved?
I suggest that Finland should hold an energy summit, where government leaders can agree on a .
By doing this we can steer a path away from a situation in which we are continually crisis-prone.
Finland could organise the meeting as a favour, especially since the question of Russian energy is very relevant there, something that many Members have alluded to.
We have long experience in this area.
The Russian energy dialogue, which has made rather poor progress and is fairly secret because the Council hardly ever participates in it, could be linked to the summit at the same time.
That way we could kill two birds with one stone and increase solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased the joint resolution is balanced and not a knee-jerk reaction.
Energy has shot up the political agenda, but geo-political initiatives are only one part of tackling the security of supply problem.
The way forward still lies largely in our own backyard.
We need to tackle the demand side of the equation by putting real effort into implementing energy efficiency measures and by developing indigenous sources of energy, particularly renewables.
This is underlined by the paragraphs on sustainable energy sources and amplified by a number of amendments which we in the ALDE Group will be supporting.
Even on the issue of gas supply, much of the answer lies close to home.
Heavy industrial users in the north-east of England have had to fight to get hold of gas supplies even at inflated prices because the market is simply not working.
The Spring Council tomorrow needs to bite the bullet and name and shame those Member States who have failed to open up their gas markets.
Â Â  â Mr President, the supply of energy and the use of all sources of energy are a political option which must aim to take a combined approach to all grass-roots requirements, such as reducing energy dependency, saving energy, ensuring residents are safe, protecting the environment and safeguarding energy products as a social â not a commercial â commodity.
The European Union is promoting the policy of liberalisation by sacrificing the satisfaction of grass-roots requirements to the profitability of private investors.
The Green Paper comes within this framework of competitiveness and the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy and even uses renewable sources of energy as a vehicle for introducing private capital into the energy sector.
Citing environmental protection is hypocritical and conceals the spiritual objectives of the European Union concerning the speeding up of liberalisation, the promotion of the relevant Community products and the restriction of dependency on imported fuel.
A way out could be found through a single energy agency which would belong to the people and would function within the framework of an economy with nationalised basic means of production.
This would address the crucial issues and ensure that energy is a social, not a commercial commodity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Poland is particularly susceptible to policies that exploit supplies of natural gas and crude oil to the country as a means of exerting political pressure.
Such policies are implemented by the main supplier of these fuels, namely Russia.
That is the reason behind the Polish Governmentâs initiative, which has been submitted to the European institutions and which would enable us to implement a solution to the problem of energy security based on the principle of âone for all and all for oneâ, or in other words the principle of solidarity.
Unfortunately this initiative was received rather coolly by the largest EU Member States, as most of them are trying to push through solutions that benefit themselves, even if it is at the cost of other Member States.
A perfect illustration of such a policy is the construction of the northern gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, following an agreement between Russia and Germany.
Although this will indeed greatly improve Germanyâs energy security in the future, it will threaten the economic interests and energy security of countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and others outside the European Union, such as Ukraine.
What is required is therefore concerted action by the Member States, or in other words a common energy policy.
This is why the Polish initiative I mentioned earlier merits serious debate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office, I want to talk, not about energy policy as such, but about the foreign and security policy actions associated with it.
In view of the fact that Russia, it seems, is using energy as a political weapon this winter, and in view of the situation in the Middle East, we need to realise that the issue of security of energy supply is an extremely problematic matter, more so than we have experienced in a long time.
For this reason, we need to develop and implement a number of things in close cooperation between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and your committee, MrÂ Chichester; for example, we need to call on Russia to finally settle the Energy Charter and to ratify it, in order to guarantee energy security.
We must make it clear â perhaps through foreign policy measures, but also by promoting competition â that there must be a difference in ownership between the producers and the suppliers who own the pipelines, in order not, for example, to make Gazprom even more likely to be not only the biggest producer but also to control the supply chain and thus to hold all the trumps.
I think we need to work much more closely with Ukraine and the southern Caucasus to modernise and develop energy networks.
In particular, though, I think that we need networking within the European Union â networking that is not aimed against anybody, that is not an 'Energy NATO', but instead forms an internal network ensuring that, if someone wants to cut a country off, that country is automatically supplied by all the other countries.
Why would those countries then not be cut off? Because this would be too expensive for the country of supply, particularly as it would then have no revenue at all.
I think that solidarity clauses comparable with the NATO Treaty are the wrong way to go; what we need is a network of solidarity that is not aimed against others, and it is through such networks that we need to organise internal solidarity in practical terms.

I would therefore quite particularly like to say that the previous German Government's decision to construct this pipeline under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Poland and the Baltic states, was a poor one.
As an example for such networking, we need to ensure that there are branches, for example going to Poland, so as to ensure security.
Looking at the situation of the Baltic states, they too need to be given the opportunity for secure energy supplies, in case there are no more supplies from Russia.
We need to resolve this internally, too; this is something we need to discuss.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Winkler and CommissionerÂ Piebalgs for their contributions.
I agree with you that it is absolutely essential that we follow a true common energy policy.
The question should be not whether, but how we can realise a European energy policy that meets the aims of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.
One part of this â as some Members have already mentioned â is an internal market for energy with truly fair competition, and we know that we are still a long way from achieving that.
I had actually expected a rather clearer statement from you in that respect.
(Can I just ask why the clock is not running?
I cannot tell how much time I have left.)
You both emphasised the need to further develop renewable energy.
I wholeheartedly agree with that.
At the same time, though, I had hoped for some more specific proposals.
As you know, we currently have targets only up to 2010: targets for electricity, for biofuels and for energy as a whole.
As you also know, the European Parliament has called for a target of 20% by 2020.
The Commission's Green Paper raises the question of whether new targets should be set at all.
If I understand correctly, the Council is currently discussing a new target of 15% by 2015, which is clearly a step backwards.
It would be more important to take a really good look into ensuring that we can achieve our target for 2010 â 12% of total energy consumption coming from renewable energy.
It is therefore very important and necessary for what you, CommissionerÂ Piebalgs, announced to Parliament to happen, namely for a directive on heating and cooling from renewable energy to be proposed, as it is precisely in this area that there are deficiencies.
This is of the utmost importance, if we are to move ahead on energy security.
Germany's example makes it very clear: Germany's phasing out of nuclear power means that 33Â billion kilowatt hours will have to be replaced by 2010.
According to current forecasts, by 2010 51Â billion kilowatt hours will be produced from renewable energy sources.
To date, reality has always exceeded the forecasts with regard to renewable energy sources.
Therefore, to those who say that atomic energy is so important, I say this: we have the opportunity to replace this energy source.
We also need to do so, because it is a non-renewable source and we are completely dependent on imports of uranium.
In addition, it is vital to use energy efficiency.
You both referred to this, and I really hope, CommissionerÂ Piebalgs, that the energy efficiency plan you will present will be an ambitious one.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is definitely time for Europe to have a comprehensive, complete strategy for energy, in which, MrÂ Piebalgs and MrÂ Winkler, we would ask for Parliament to have a central role.
An essential part of this strategy is the creation of a single European market and a consistent EU policy.
Today, liberalisation has arrived in the individual national markets, but that is not enough.
In the energy field some countries have gone beyond the monopoly philosophy but others have not.
If we restrict ourselves solely to calling for the completion of individual national markets, we will end up with an asymmetric and therefore weak European market.
It will be internally weak, in other words incapable of correcting those distortions that are well known to us, those limitations that have been analysed in our reports.
It will also be externally weak, because it will be incapable of having any bargaining power with consumer countries.
In addition, there is also a great risk that it will become a victim, as an amendment to our resolution puts it, of new oligopolies that may form among the worldâs producing areas.
The second vital point is that, in the energy mix that we must achieve, we must determine not just national choices but European objectives and corresponding reference indicators on energy saving and efficiency.
We expected the Council to be bolder in its choice of objectives and infrastructure as well as research policy.
These are European objectives of a Community energy policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to mention a couple of technical points after the political comments that have been made.
Energy crises always arise in Europe because of a shortage of supplies of two energy sources, namely gas and oil.
We are not self-sufficient in these, which leaves us with two options.
The first is to create more of our own European sources of energy, and the second is to diversify supplies.
Creating more energy of our own requires above all research and development, greater energy efficiency and more renewable energy.
We forget that Europe has vast reserves of lignite and hard coal.
I cannot understand why clean coal technologies have been completely ignored in our parliamentary resolution.
Others have had research and commercial programmes in this field for years.
Nuclear energy is another necessity, especially with the threat of the greenhouse effect.
More resources for research and new technologies should be a clear demand of the European Parliament.
The second issue I should like to address is the diversification of supplies.
We have not yet made use of the vast resources of one of our neighbours, Ukraine.
Yesterday evening, not far from here in Solvay, the Ukrainian Government gave a presentation of the countryâs potential â the largest natural gas reserves in Europe and gas and oil transit pipelines from Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea, which are independent of Gazprom.
All this could be the subject of cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine.
It means leaving Ukrainian pipelines in the hands of Ukrainians.
It requires investment, construction and repair of pipelines, and we, the European Union, must help Ukraine in these tasks.
We have the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, trans-European networks and an enhanced neighbourhood policy at our disposal to do so.
We would become more secure and demonstrate greater solidarity, and we would have a firm base for a common energy policy for the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the EUâs energy policy has two dimensions: the external or geopolitical dimension, and a domestic dimension, because energy security also means the rational use of energy.
At present, Europe needs to organise its own energy potential and to improve the use of this latter by increasing thermodynamic efficiency.
Examples of how this could be achieved include modern thermal insulation of buildings and other structures, modernisation and a more widespread use of diversified sources of heat and electrical energy, particularly in the new EU Member States which have vast cogeneration and energy conservation potential, and sensible use of renewable energy sources, especially biomass.
At the same time, however, I believe that the use of biomass to generate electricity is a mistake.
By building cross-border networks, the enlarged European Union can tap into the considerable time differences between its easternmost and westernmost borders in order to ease peak loads on electricity networks, and it could also exploit seasonal temperature differences along its north-south axis.
The energy used to generate national income also needs to be further reduced, and this must be reflected in customs policy.
It is therefore incomprehensible why a customs duty of 6% should be levied on highly energy-intensive primary aluminium.
Importing such aluminium is tantamount to importing energy, which the European Union would then save.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the new situation since the beginning of this year has made it clear to everybody that energy is important not only for economic development in Europe.
It is also increasingly clear that we are short of energy and that political dependencies are developing that obviously were not foreseen on this scale by a large part of society.
However, this crisis also provides us with a huge opportunity, in that we are now finally discussing energy issues objectively and sensibly, and we might be able to come down from our trees, put old battles behind us and stop parading dogmas.
That does however mean â and this is where I have a lot of questions about what the Commission has put forward â that we need to stand back and take stock.
What is the situation, what opportunities are there, how much is there, where is it, where are the risks, where is the potential?
I am more or less certain that we will not find an answer with one single solution.
It will not be the case, and it never has been.
But we must make a combined effort to discuss all the issues openly and to find broad-based solutions.
We cannot, as our fellow-Member from Poland has just said, do without current coal resourcesÂ âÂ that is out of the question.
We do need to consider how we can use it cleanly, but we absolutely cannot do without it.
We cannot ignore any potential sources â including renewable ones.
However, we must also be honest enough to recognise that there are limits to their potential and that they will not solve our supply problems.
I therefore also think that we cannot get around the fact, to be honest, that we cannot do without nuclear power.
Our motto cannot be 'no coal, no nuclear power, but everything CO2 free and environmentally friendly'.
I believe we need to stop debating on the basis of dreams and dogmas.
We need a realistic and sensible debate.
We owe it to our children to ensure that they will still have energy in the future, and enough of it, because it is a vital precondition for prosperity in our countries in Europe.
I also think it is immoral that we are buying up all the energy potential in the world, because we have the resources to do so, when we could be leaving the countries that do not have the resources â by which I mean the developing countries â at the end of their tether.
We have a duty also to use modern technology.
The use of nuclear power is, for us, a matter of moral obligation.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is no longer any doubt as to the importance of Community subsidies in new and more energy-efficient technologies for renewable sources of energy.
Moreover, by promoting differentiation as to the types of energy source, including wind and solar energy, the countries of origin and the passage through countries, we shall help to bring about new conditions for development, finding employment and strengthening sustainable development.
I should also like in this direction to highlight and emphasise support for the production of biomass by drawing up national action plans which will safeguard the economic and entrepreneurial certainty and confidence of investors and producers and, at the same time, provide a way out of agricultural production.
It should also be emphasised that the harmonisation of the internal market in the energy sector should target the protection of consumers and not impose more costs on them.
These are policies which cannot be safeguarded from the operation of oligopoly concentrations.
Finally, I should like to say, in connection with strengthening investments in new, more environmentally-friendly forms of energy, that the promotion can be achieved of a green tax, a tax in which nuclear energy is not and cannot be included.
Mr President, Commissioner, throughout the ages and even now, major conflicts and wars have taken place for two purposes: firstly for energy and secondly for water.
Europe must stand and confront this international problem with stable policies.
Â Â  Mr President, energy security and diversification of the source of supply has dramatically risen up the political agenda this year following the use of the âgas weaponâ by Gazprom against Ukraine and Moldova over the New Year period.
It is no longer a technical matter confined to technocrats and has become as much a part of the CFSP as the remit of energy ministers.
As rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy, I was very conscious that many of the member countries â e.g. Algeria and Azerbaijan â were producers of oil and gas, and others were central to the pipeline transit systems of fuel to western Europe, such as Ukraine.
I have repeatedly made a case for a stable Kazakhstan to join the ENP, as it is eager to get away from the risk of economic and political dominance by Russia and China and could indeed supply not just oil and gas but also uranium to the European Union, as we will inevitably have to build more nuclear reactors to satisfy Kyoto and not be over-reliant on unstable regions of the world âsuch as the Middle East, Venezuela or Nigeria, to name but a few â for fossil fuels.
I respect the anti-nuclear countries, such as Austria and Ireland, but new technologies such as transmutation, will, I believe, one day solve the long-term, high-radiation waste concerns of the general public.
Obviously, a lot also needs to be done by the Member States â preferably through intergovernmental cooperation â to work towards more energy efficiency, to develop more technologies in the form of renewables, but also to interconnect their electricity grids in a pan-European system, which will drive down prices and allow spare capacity.
There is also a need to connect the existing oil and gas pipelines between the EU Member States.
Spain is apparently virtually self-sufficient but isolated in this respect, and the Baltic countries are too reliant on connections to Russia, but have now agreed, much to their credit, to a new nuclear power station between themselves.
I also believe Russia must be encouraged to join the Energy Charter to prevent it from stopping third countries using its pipelines.
There is also a clear gap in that the International Energy Agency allows only for strategic oil reserves, not for gas reserves.
Some Member States of the European Union seem to have no reserves at all.
Â Â  First of all, I would like to remind us all why this matter is being discussed here today.
At the beginning of this year, the gas dispute which flared up between Ukraine and Russia demonstrated how very vulnerable the European energy system is, and more importantly, how energy can be used as an extremely powerful political instrument.
The Ukraine-Russia gas dispute showed that if a country has a suitable leader, such as Lukashenko, it will get cheap energy from Russia.
If the countryâs chosen course does not suit Russia, as in the case of Ukraine, then it will not get cheap energy.
The effects of this policy have sent shockwaves through the entire European energy system.
As long as the European Union lacks a common energy policy, and as long as each Member State or head of government tries to secure for itself the best possible deal with a company in a large country outside the European Union, we will remain dependents, and victims of deals made on the side.
Europe needs a common energy policy just as we need our common trade policy, which makes the European Union extremely effective in negotiations.
Just imagine what position Germany or France, not to mention my own small country of Estonia, would be in if they were to be on their own in negotiations with the USA or China at the WTO.
The present state of affairs, however, in which each country is responsible for its own energy supply and concludes bilateral agreements, is no different from that situation.
In addition to all of this, there is the fact that the two gas pipelines which are planned to be built between Russia and China could threaten supply altogether.
If you owe the bank 100Â 000 euros, the bank owns you.
If, however, you owe the bank 100 million euros, you own the bank.
The same applies to energy.
With a disunited energy policy, we depend on the political whim of one countryâs state monopoly.
A common energy policy, however, would be decided by Europe itself.
Â Â  In relation to EU geopolitical strategy, IÂ would like to point out the important (albeit well-known) fact that most of the new Member States are totally dependant on supplies of oil and gas from Russia, and in this respect differ from many of the old Member States, whose fuel supplies are more diversified.
In this context, I am sure it will not be necessary to recount the recent negative consequences of dependence experienced by Ukraine.
The new member countries observe the handling of fuel supply security issues with particular sensitivity.
In the rush to catch up with the economic performance levels of the old Member States, security of energy supply is becoming an ever more pressing issue.
With regard to electricity supply in particular, a number of new Member States have inherited an energy supply mix dominated by nuclear energy generation.
I, for one, think that the subsidiarity principle should apply to the development of this type of energy.
However, I cannot disregard the solidarity principle, which should enable individual Member States to develop this type of energy without at least being exposed to negative external interference.
IÂ welcome the Commissionâs initiative to support research in this area aimed at improving further the safety of nuclear power generation, for example through research into recycling or nuclear fusion technologies and other related fields.
IÂ must, however, emphasise that the new financial perspective lacks sufficient funding for this research in particular.
The Green Paper on energy policy focuses more on renewable energy sources.
I have no major reservations with that.
However, the Commission must act responsibly and accept the fact that some Member States would like to continue developing nuclear energy in the future, for two reasons in particular.
Firstly, the potential for developing renewable energy sources is not great in those countries, and as such it is not possible to count on the long-term sustainability of these sources; secondly, those countries have had very positive experiences with nuclear energy, which is safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable in the long run.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this resolution as a recognition that there is indeed an energy crisis in Europe.
I can tell you that, as a MEP representing the United Kingdom â where gas prices are three times the price of gas in the Netherlands and where factories have been warned that they may have to close for a while due to gas shortages.
The single European energy market does not work.
The answer is not to retract into narrow nationalism, but to cooperate and make the system work better.
We need to develop the common European energy policy.
Hurricane Katrina and Gazprom/Russiaâs recent behaviour are two major incidents which have forced our hands on this issue.
Since the encouraging noises that we heard in Hampton Court, I am afraid we have seen some disappointing new moves from the Member States: their continuing failure to implement current existing legislation in this field; price-fixing in the energy market; new protectionism and the establishment of new national champions.
None of this bodes well for the forthcoming meeting tomorrow where we hope we do not see more back-pedalling by the Council.
This is the first time that we in Parliament have had a chance to comment on the Green Paper.
Our first initial reaction must be one of disappointment: there are no new targets and no concrete proposals to establish a common energy policy.
There is no way you are going to get investment of one trillion euro without more long-term planning.
This paper entirely ducks the issue of transport and aviation and their contribution to the energy debate.
It needs a lot of work by Parliament.
I hope that we will be able to cooperate in this field and that we do not need a third serious incident to make the Member States realise we have to act in this field.
Â Â  Mr President, security of supply as a formula for a real problem should contain concrete eventualities of insecurities, which should also be listed specifically.
We should provide measures on how to cope even if there is a bombing of pipelines or electricity transmission wires.
Both have been experienced recently by Georgia, where nobody was in any doubt about the political masterminding behind these acts.
There are also categories of natural catastrophe able to interrupt supply.
The document on the security of energy supply in Europe avoids mentioning Europeâs preparedness for such disasters, let alone any blasts in oneâs mind affecting supply.
A potential attacker when eager to use energy as a weapon may be stopped only by the knowledge that his move brings no political gains and only drawbacks for himself, while the targeted state is immediately assisted and compensated by actions of communal solidarity of the Union.
That is what we should work on without any delay.
The resolution omits this.
As we are now debating security versus insecurity, there is also the real environmental insecurity related with building a pipeline and supplying the West in such a vulnerable way as via the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
There is a strange silence about chemical shells and bombs from World War II lying in huge quantities, rusting and waiting for their own Armageddon.
As the clock is ticking this mechanical work of building of pipelines may move ever faster towards an enormous disaster.
Who would suffer?
Nobody, but some unimportant smaller nations on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.
Who is giving guarantees to us Baltic nations about both energy and biological survival?
Germany?
Commissioners of the split Union?
We have a right to expect proper policies and concrete European guarantees.
Only then will Europe have the reason to use the word solidarity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in relation to our common European task where energy policy is concerned, there are two things that are important to define and that I think we have to clarify.
The first is that one of our obvious joint tasks is to guarantee that the internal market operates properly.
There are now already a lot of obstacles to its doing so.
We have to do everything from ensuring that companies can grow together across borders to making sure that the internal market can operate both legally and technically.
We need common networks because they offer a way of achieving many of the objectives we have in common.
Through common networks, we obtain more competition and lower prices.
If renewable fuels are to be given scope to develop, we need a larger market where they can also be marketed and developed on a commercial basis.
Through common networks we can reduce our vulnerability and, at the same time, have the opportunity of obtaining access to safe and cheap electricity.
The second joint task where energy policy is concerned obviously relates to matters covered by both foreign policy and trade policy.
In these areas, too, I again believe that, when it comes to solidarity between our countries, it is crucial for us to have the common networks.
We can talk about solidarity and solidarity clauses however much we like but, basically, the fact is that it is only through common networks that it will be possible for countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania â or any other country that may be exposed to political blackmail - successfully to achieve solidarity in practice.
Such solidarity will then become a reality and not just a set of political objectives.
In foreign policy and trade policy, any cooperation with Russia must be based on clear and transparent conditions governing trade and distribution.
The EU must support a policy that leads to Russia undertaking to deliver energy sources under secure conditions to each individual Member State.
In that way, we should obtain a sound energy policy, solidarity and a better Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is too dependent on fossil fuels.
The last few weeks have made it clearer than ever that this has to stop.
Prices are increasing dramatically for industry and for private consumers.
There is no real security of supply, and there is no guarantee that our current energy supplies are sustainable in climate terms.
This morning, MrsÂ Morgan spoke about Katrina.
There have been a whole series of other hurricanes, and the scientists tell us that this is very probably a symptom of climate change.
That is why we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
I think three things are decisive.
The first is nuclear power: we must not shut down safe nuclear power stations just for political reasons.
I therefore advocate adopting the amendment proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on this point.
I find it regrettable that the German Chancellor, MrsÂ Merkel, could not say so in her speech this morning because we are in a coalition with the social democrats, but I am pleased that the social democrats here in the European Parliament are beginning to reconsider; perhaps in a year's time MrsÂ Merkel will be able to defend nuclear power on behalf of the entire Federal Government.
There is a range of other points that MrsÂ Merkel and all of us can support, and she will do so in her main speech at tomorrow's summit: we need energy efficiency.
Energy is being wasted in Europe, and we cannot let it continue.
We need an efficient expansion of renewable energy. It is vital that we use more renewable energy, but we need to do it without long-term subsidies.
I would therefore point once again to this Houseâs demand for a directive on heating and cooling.
This is an area in which there is a very great deal of potential, and in which costs are relatively low, and we should therefore move towards the delivery phase quickly.
I support this resolution because it contains these demands and because it encourages the Commission and the Council to move more quickly on this matter.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, in order to create a common energy policy the Commission must first of all bring to completion the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market.
Enough of asymmetry, enough of rogues.
The Commission must combat all measures designed to block the free circulation of capital, avoiding all forms of distortion of competition caused by governmentsâ protectionist support of ânational championsâ; your own credibility depends on it, MrÂ Piebalgs.
Energy, as is well known, is both a production factor and a consumer good, and both are essential for the development of our economy and for maintaining high standards of living.
The common energy policy, together with a common foreign policy, are the tools with which to achieve these goals in our enlarged Europe.
This is the political question â will we be able to do this?
Europe is divided into two camps: those who trust Russia and those who are hypercritical of it, even though we depend almost exclusively on its energy resources.
In the European energy market Russia is an unavoidable supplier, to which we should not, however, remain too tightly bound.
Diversification of energy supply is, therefore, essential, and it is vital to find European solutions in the supply sphere.
In short, we must speak with one voice â will we be able to do this?
Diversifying supply sources seems a mandatory response, just like improving the networks for transporting energy, the gas pipelines and the ports.
It is important to develop an energy dimension in the European Unionâs strategy and security and to increase public and private investment in alternative energies and renewables.
Will we be able to do this?
In brief, an energy policy as a fundamental component of the new Europe â this is the message to give to our citizens; will we be able to do this?
Â Â  Mr President, when the lights went out in California, in Turin and even in my own home town of Wexford â not to mention the recent Gazprom incident â there was a sudden concentration of minds on the security of energy supply, which is of critical importance to us both strategically and economically, particularly with energy import dependency and costs growing exponentially.
As the recent Green Paper on energy policy tells us, unless we can make our domestic energy more competitive in the next couple of decades, 70% of the Unionâs energy requirements will have to be met by imported products, compared to a figure of only 50% today.
Most of this is from regions threatened by geopolitical instability.
This figure, however, masks the higher energy import dependency of peripheral and geographically isolated energy markets such as the Baltics, Ireland and other island communities.
In Ireland, we have gone from 65% dependency on imported energy in 1990 to over 90% dependency today, and rising.
Our indigenous fossil fuel supplies â peat and natural gas â have been rapidly depleting since 1995, while record economic and industrial growth has pushed up demand.
While the energy mix must continue to remain a Member State competence, in a single market, an attack on one is an attack on all in energy terms.
Solidarity within the EU will be vital in securing equitably distributed supplies from outside our borders, through the completion of a competitive, integrated, internal energy market.
This cannot happen without additional physical capacity, in the form of trans-European energy networks, to connect us all to a European grid.
Within each Member State, effective âunbundlingâ of network and supply activities in gas and electricity must be made a reality: in Ireland this has yet to happen.
Through EU-level and Member state incentives, we must seriously target the development and mainstreaming of the 21 types of renewables, not least because of our obligations in relation to climate change.
I get the impression that, especially where biofuels are concerned, there is no lack of interest: the research and investment communities are circling, but afraid to take a leap in the dark.
Talk, goodwill and interest are not enough; we need serious financial and regulatory catalysts to increase research and roll out the development of pilot projects using cutting-edge renewable technologies.
The decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption and the whole story of demand side management cannot be ignored.
World energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise by 60% by 2030.
By increasing energy efficiency measures alone by 2020, we can reduce demand by over 20%.
Commissioner, do not wait until the lights go out again!
Let us act now and keep energy security at the top of the political agenda in peacetime.
Â Â  â Energy is fundamental to our activities, and is central to our success in the implementation of the policies we have set out.
The situation in the field of energy will determine in no small measure how we accomplish the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and indeed whether we accomplish them at all.
Commissioner, you are aware of this state of affairs, which is why you brought things forward and published the Green Paper on a common European Energy Policy earlier this month.
It is indeed high time that we sought answers to these questions: how do we ensure secure and adequate energy supplies at competitive prices, and at the same time care for the environment?
How should our energy mix be formulated in the future?
How stable are the areas from which we can import energy resources?
What is their current cost and how much will they cost in the future?
How does their use affect the environment, and so on?
Our answers to these questions must be a realistic assessment of the contribution of primary energy sources in the overall European energy mix, and an honest evaluation of the effectiveness of existing technologies and the potential of new, evolving technologies, and the natural resources of the Member States must also be considered.
The time has come for us to avoid political rhetoric and to face up to the real state of affairs.
I would particularly like to point out that nuclear energy cannot and should not be a taboo subject in the European political arena.
Right now nuclear energy produces no greenhouse gas emissions, it allows us to import uranium from a variety of countries, including those that are politically stable, and it is for this very reason that it enjoys a stable and competitive price.
Future research and development work is expected to improve its efficiency, reduce the amount of radioactive waste and increase safety.
It must now occupy a place commensurate with these factors both in European strategic documents and in the taking of concrete measures.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate today was a very important one in view of tomorrow's Council and in view of the very intensive discussions on the issue of energy that the Heads of State or Government will be having tomorrow, and I should very much like to thank all those who have taken part in it.
I do not have the time to respond to everything that has been said â and some very important things have been â but I would just like to mention a few points by way of conclusion.
MrÂ RÃŒbig was quite right to say that a more comprehensive debate is needed on this problem and that all fields of activity in the European Union must concern themselves with energy.
The Presidency is aware of this, and is of course working together with the Commission in this respect; at this point I should quite particularly like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his cooperation right from the start.
I think he was the first Commissioner we worked closely with, and I am very grateful to him for that.
However, the Member States also need to get involved, because only a joint effort will bring us to our goal of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability, which must be the main focus points of European energy policy.
Europe must speak with one voice to third countries when it comes to energy policy.
That has been stressed by a number of speakers. MrÂ Brunetta said it, as did MrÂ Brok, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
That, too, is particularly important and is a task to which we must apply ourselves.
MrÂ Goebbels and CommissionerÂ Piebalgs both referred to solidarity.
Solidarity is indeed a quite essential factor, and tomorrow the Heads of State or Government will acknowledge this in their declaration and in the conclusions they adopt.
MrÂ Goebbels called for a , and that is a good phrase.
MrÂ Turmes has already anticipated what the Heads of State or Government will say tomorrow.
I have to admit that I do not know: perhaps others are better informed.
But there is one thing I can say: tomorrow's energy debate has been thoroughly prepared, including by the energy ministers and the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Of course, we do not know what the text adopted by the Heads of State or Government will ultimately look like, but it will â I can assume â contain some very important things.
It will not be a declaration of national interests; rather, a European energy policy is going to be adopted tomorrow.
That much we can already say.
Mrs Ek mentioned the need to maintain competition.
I would like to refer you, first of all, to the debate ten days ago in Strasbourg, where I, on behalf of the Council, along with the Commissioner responsible for competition, mentioned very clearly that we are very much in favour, and that we need to maintain the rules of competition, especially in the field of energy.
I would like to mention a small paragraph on the energy policy for Europe.
The paragraph dealing with exactly what you asked about points out that in fulfilling its main objectives, the energy policy for Europe should ensure transparency and non-discriminatory markets; be consistent with competition rules; be consistent with public service obligations and fully respect Member Statesâ sovereignty over primary energy sources and choice of energy mix.
Much of that has also been said here, and I can only confirm and emphasise it.
MrsÂ Rothe called for specific targets for the expansion of renewable energy sources, and on that I totally agree with her.
The Austrian Presidency is very committed, and very ambitious.
As this debate has shown, however, there is a lack of agreement on many points.
A coherent, consistent energy policy for Europe cannot be built overnight.
It is important for the Heads of State or Government to give a significant stimulus tomorrow, and for the Member States, the Council and the Commission then to build on the principles drawn up and adopted tomorrow, so that we ultimately achieve what we all want: security of supply, greater efficiency and constructive dialogue with third countries, so as to guarantee the use of clean energy in future and for future generations.
Â Â  . Mr President, after such a challenging and interesting debate, I would like to take the liberty of speaking a little longer than usual to end the debate.
In the situation we are currently facing, we would usually look to history for courageous decisions which have been taken on energy policy.
So far I have found one: it was before the First World War, when Winston Churchill, who at the time was responsible for the Navy, decided to change the fuel for the British Navy from coal â which was domestically produced in Wales â to oil.
When asked about security he said that diversity was the answer.
We face as big a challenge as he did.
However, we should also have courage.
Neither OPEC nor Russia hold the ace in our poker game.
We do.
I believe that, in the current challenge, the most competitive advantage will be that part of the world will not only be energy-efficient, but will also be capable of managing demand.
This is the key to success.
Otherwise, even with the best diversification, we will not be sustainable.
This is a key challenge that we have to face.
The second important issue is that, if in a more complex environment â not just one in which we switch from coal to oil â we would like to be successful and achieve the goals we have agreed on, we should be aware that we are able to achieve them, just as we have been able to achieve our previous goals.
This is crucial.
Solidarity is extremely important.
However, we should all understand that solidarity imposes some âhomeworkâ on us to prepare for this, and that there is a price to pay.
We should believe that, for example, the power bridge between Lithuania and Poland is not only a commercial issue, but also one of solidarity.
It should be built, but not on the basis of commercial arguments.
I heard a lot of sceptical remarks in relation to markets.
However, the market actually provides the strength of the European Union.
There is a lot of emotion about national champions.
However, each case will be judged on the basis of European competition law.
If there is a need to strengthen the law, that is a different story.
