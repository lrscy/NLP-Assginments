That decision is still in force and, therefore, Turkey is to be treated as a candidate country in line with all the other candidate countries.
The biggest requirement of a candidate country is, as MrÂ Oostlander said, that it fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria.
It is to be a society based on the rule of law with democratic stability and respect for human rights and for minorities, it is to have a well-functioning market economy, and so on. Turkey does not at present meet all these conditions, but it is on the way to doing so.
We have seen much progress, and we must not, therefore, here and now reject the possibility of Turkey's becoming a member of the EU.
There is no doubt that it is precisely the EU's demands that have contributed significantly to the democratic progress that has taken place in Turkey, and a signal from the European Parliament that Turkey cannot become a member of the EU, or that Turkey must be given special status would undoubtedly put a stop to this positive development.
On the basis of the Commission's papers, the Heads of Government are now, in December, to take a decision on accession negotiations with Turkey within a more precise time-scale and on more precise conditions.
With MrÂ Oostlanderâs thorough, balanced and comprehensive report, the European Parliament must, however, here and now send a signal to the European Council that Turkey is to be treated like all previous candidate countries.
This is something we owe to our Turkish neighbours, and we must tell the Turks that they are well on the way and that they should continue along the path upon which they have embarked, for the benefit of Turkey, the EU and stability and growth in our part of the world.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to take the opportunity to draw attention to the Turkish human rights organisation, HRFT.
Last weekend, the president of the HRFT, Yavuz Ãnen, received an award at the national congress of the June Movement for his and the organisation's courageous struggle for human rights in Turkey.
The HRFT is threatened with closure as a result of several court cases against members of its leadership, including Yavuz Ãnen.
The HRFT has five centres for the rehabilitation of torture victims, and a thousand active volunteers.
Its closure might have serious consequences for the treatment of torture victims in Turkey, since noÂ one else can take up the HRFTâs work.
The many victims of torture would be left in the lurch.
Torture takes place routinely in Turkish prisons and at Turkish police stations.
The state and the authorities constantly try to harass the centres in their work on court cases, and doctors are threatened with losing their jobs at the public hospitals if they work for the centres.
Yes, the centres have, in fact, by no means been made legal, but they have so far won all their cases against the state.
I call upon Parliament and the Commission carefully to monitor the ability of the Turkish human rights organisation to carry out its very necessary work for human rights in Turkey.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Oostlander report wisely concludes that Turkey is not ready to join the European Union because, and I quote, âTurkey does not yet meet the Copenhagen political criteriaâ.
To tell the truth, when we read the report in detail, it contains precious few points that might honestly be regarded as arguments in favour of accession other than references to the meritorious efforts of the Turkish Government, and even these are by no means sure to have any genuinely profound social impact.
The values of Turkish society are still far removed from those of the European Union in numerous fundamental areas, such as relations between the state and religious communities, as detailed in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Oostlander report, which I would urge everyone to think about.
We can always hope, of course, for more rapid constitutional development in Turkey towards democracy, pluralism, public freedoms and the dismantling of the parallel military state.
These objectives, however, have yet to be achieved.
Even if they were achieved, how long would it then take for Turkish society to fall into line?
Besides, do we not have reason to fear adverse reactions on the part of certain social groups and undesirable effects which, as Europeans, we would be powerless to control?
Accordingly, ladies and gentlemen, it would be irresponsible of us to offer Turkey anything but a privileged partnership designed to support its development without leading the EU down a dangerous path.
It would be better to say this clearly, and we should have done so long ago. My main criticism of the Oostlander report is that it does not convey this message.
Â Â  Madam President, I join with others in thanking the rapporteur for giving us an excellent basis for our debate on this very sensitive subject this morning.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having come from Switzerland late yesterday evening to inform us of the situation regarding the talks with Cyprus, which is intimately linked with our debate this morning.
Two weeks ago I attended the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee, and while there was little optimism, there was a real desire for the two communities to be united on 1 May.
We hope very much that this will take place.
On Turkish accession to the Union, Mr Verheugen gave us a very detailed analysis of the political and economic reforms that have been made.
I welcome, as others have, his belief that a clear objective assessment should be made on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria.
I have a copy of the Copenhagen criteria of 21-22 June 1993 in front of me.
It states that: 'Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.'
However, then it states: 'The Union's capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries.'
Much has been said in this debate about the great progress Turkey is making, but very little has been said about the Union's capacity to absorb a country of the size and nature of Turkey.
Therefore, we need now to look not only at Turkey's ability to join the Union, but also at our ability to absorb it.
When coming to the question of the big picture â which Mr Duff mentioned â many in my political group believe that this involves the ability of the Union to absorb Turkey on the one side and the Turkish ability to meet those criteria on the other.
We believe, therefore, that there should be a fundamental assessment of the institutional capacity of the Union to absorb Turkey and that this should be part of the Commission's report in October.
So we should have the courage to look at the situation in a very clear and reasonable manner.
Therefore, with 25 Member States from 1 May, 21 languages, no post-2006 financial perspective in view until 2005 at the earliest, and doubts about whether a Constitutional Treaty will be agreed and ratified, the most sensible thing would be to say that there is real uncertainty in the Union's current political situation, and to be extremely cautious before giving Turkey the green light at this stage.
Â Â  â Madam President, Helmut Kohl was recently asked on German television what he thought about the accession of Turkey.
His answer made reference to the Copenhagen criteria.
Even after the reporter put many more questions to him, he did not say ânoâ to Turkish accession.
I think he was right.
As Turkey has been promised accession for 40 years, anything else would only unsettle the people on the Bosphorus and the overall political climate in Europe as well.
Parliament should therefore not adopt anything that would constitute an obstacle to the accession option; it follows that several motions that have been tabled should not be allowed to pass.
Quite clearly, the ball is in the Turkish court.
The Turks must demonstrate compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
We can see that much has been done, but not yet enough.
There is still a long way to go on the road to democracy, to the rule of law, to freedom, and, as regards the last of these, our express concern has been for Turkeyâs minorities, especially the Kurds.
Much has been set down in black and white, but it is not yet working in practice â in schools, in television, or when it comes to the use of their language.
I get letters from members of the public, complaining about the arbitrary treatment they receive from the police and the justice system â a grim business to which Turkey must put an end!
Their police and justice systems are not democratic; there is much still to be done here.
I also believe that all power must be in the hands of the civil institutions, and that the armed forces must go where they belong â to their barracks.
It cannot be acceptable that the armed forces, the National Security Council, should have the upper hand when decisions are taken in Turkey.
I agree with Commissioner Verheugenâs assessment that Turkey has made a start on a major project of reform.
For an Islamic country, a constitution based on democratic and liberal principles is also a major experiment, and something that we should support.
So, instead of saying ânoâ, we should leave the door of opportunity open to further reforms and vote accordingly later on.
Â Â  Madam President, the Oostlander report deserves all our respect.
Many, if not all, speeches have underlined the fundamental problem, which is that of the respect for human rights and principles of freedom on which our Union is founded.
The question is, does Turkey fulfil the requirements from this point of view?
We would answer in the negative.
In this connection, I would like to report that yesterday something very serious happened in the chamber of the Italian Parliament.
The leader of the Lega Nord-Padania, MrÂ CÃš, was prevented from speaking because he dared to utter a phrase â â(thieving Rome) â which was censored.
This is a very serious precedent.
I therefore call on the European Parliament, as the guardian of the freedom of all European peoples, to show solidarity concerning the violated right of the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Padania â who have no fewer rights than the Kurds â to be able to speak freely, in particular in the parliamentary chambers of a founding member of the European Union.
I would reiterate that this is an extremely serious precedent concerning censorship of a political party that wants independence and federalism and is, therefore, against statism.
This seems more typical of Turkish style democracy than that of a country that is undoubtedly democratic and was a founding member of the European Union.
The phrase does not indicate racism against anyone, least of all the Roman people.
Being against âthieving Romeâ means being against centralism and being against those who oppress our freedom.
We are against thieving Rome for the same reasons that we say ânoâ to the accession of Turkey to Europe.
Down with thieving Rome, down with thieving Rome!
Here I can say it freely and no one, thank God, will silence me: down with thieving Rome!
Let them hear it in Rome: Padania is against thieving Rome, it is in favour of freedom.
Long live freedom!
Long live the European Union!
Long live the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination!
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in four weeksâ time, the European Union will be experiencing its biggest enlargement so far, an event that will bring about long-term change in Europe, and one that must be a popular success for the European Union.
There can be no doubt about the fact that the enlarged EU will need time to consolidate.
The public can scarcely understand that an event of this magnitude does not happen all at once, and that we need, at the same time, to set in motion a process to speed enlargement up.
It is with these things in mind that the debate on Turkish accession must be conducted.
I do not suppose that anyone in this House is unaware of Turkeyâs geopolitical significance, or does not welcome its steps towards democracy and human rights.
Nor, though, can there be anyone who would deny that there is a gulf between what legislation presumes and what has actually been implemented with regard to all these issues.
Reference has already been made to the fact that Turkey is one of the countries producing the most asylum seekers, and Austria, for example, grants asylum to more Turks than to anyone else.
I nevertheless believe, as does the delegation to which I belong, that, in concentrating on purely political criteria, the report on Turkey takes too narrow a view.
That is why my delegation and I endorse all the motions aimed at securing a broader basis for this debate.
There is no reason why the Commission should not produce a study on the effects of Turkish accession on the European Union, whether as part of the report that is due in October or as a separate study.
Consideration must be given to the repercussions on structural policy, on the common agricultural policy, and on the institutions of the European Union.
When the report is produced, in October, the options for Turkey should also be set out, and these should not focus solely on accession; we have to offer them alternatives in good time.
That we owe to ourselves and to them.
I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to Mr Oostlander, who has, as rapporteur, been magnanimous enough not to inhibit discussion, and has remained sensitive enough to keep faith with himself.
What this report on Turkey now presents us with, though, is the opportunity to send an important political signal and to put the debate on a broader basis.
It is not acceptable that we should limit ourselves to political criteria in the narrowest sense of the word.
It must also be possible to examine and assess the likely effects on the European Union.
If that is not done, the voters will never forgive us.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank MrÂ Oostlander for his wise words to us, as always.
The fundamental problem with enlargement is that we will see a large expansion of the Union from 1 May, and that will be much more problematic than earlier rounds of enlargement, while at the same time the Unionâs ability to receive new members is not as great as it was before.
The EU is now more demanding and involved, and enlargement is not a machine or an animal: it is the most complex human creation of all â the European Union.
We must, however, treat Turkey just as fairly as all the other countries seeking accession to the EU despite the fact that our ability to receive them has weakened.
A lot of progress has been made in Turkey in a short time.
There are new laws representing civil society and there is democracy.
The status of women and the Kurds is now being openly debated, although I have no conclusive knowledge of where military power ends and civil power begins.
The significance of the status of the military is a very big problem.
The Copenhagen criteria have not been fulfilled, by which I mean the establishment of the rule of law and human rights.
There is still work to do regarding this.
The judiciary is not independent and Turkey should sign the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
We face a familiar problem: just laws are passed, and a lot of decisions are taken, but whether or not they are implemented in practice and this implementation is monitored remains a big, murky problem that we have been unable to solve, and this is in the hands of the Turks themselves.
Can they do it?
That is the question this time round, and we will only answer it afterwards.
Â Â  Madam President, I too should like to congratulate MrÂ Oostlander, who managed to produce a report that was approved by both the advocates and the opponents of Turkish accession in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
This is no mean feat and is due to the very reasonable and balanced line of argument he follows from beginning to end â well, almost from beginning to end, but more of that in a moment.
I should like to say that Mrs Stenzel speaks with the voice of wisdom when she points out that we are not seeing the whole picture if we only assess Turkeyâs progress but do not examine the state of readiness of the European Union, in its various fields of political activity, to receive Turkey, and this is no trifling matter.
The point I should like to pick up, Mr Oostlander, is that of secularism.
Paragraph 32 of your report seems to me to proceed from a slightly jaundiced view of the secularism which is perhaps the most valuable part of the legacy of Kemal AtatÃŒrk.
The separation of church and state is not an archaic formula but a recipe for the future of our Union.
The fact that the government of a country whose people are mainly Muslim is trying to put this separation into practice is, I believe, an asset for which Turkey deserves credit, not an obstacle to progress.
Â Â  â Madam President, I want to pay tribute to Mr Oostlanderâs report and to him for seeking compromises.
There is absolutely no doubt in this House that Turkey is an important partner and that it will remain one.
Partnership, however, does not automatically mean full membership of the European Union.
Mr Leinen mentioned the 1963 Association Agreement. This puts it in explicitly negative terms, stating that: âthe possibility of accession to the European Economic Community at a later date is not excludedâ.
Those â no more and no less â are the words used.
After two decades of absolute standstill, Turkey has at last got down to the task of changing its laws.
As it progresses towards more democracy and more human rights, that can surely be seen in a positive light.
Even though the Turkish Prime Minister has announced his intention of amending another 15 to 20 paragraphs of the constitution in April and May, these changes take no account as yet of important demands made by the European Parliament, for such things as freedom of religion and the repeal of the 10% clause in order to protect political minorities.
We have therefore tabled motions highlighting the possibility of an alternative to deciding in favour of or against full membership, that alternative being a privileged partnership.
Let nobody assume that the decision on this will be for the Council alone.
The next Parliament to be elected â which will sit from 2004 and 2009 â must possess in full the prerogative of saying âyesâ or ânoâ and of devising alternatives.
I therefore ask the Members of this House to treat the amendments we have introduced on this subject as the dignity of this Parliament and of our position require.
Let me say one last thing about the Copenhagen criteria: important though they are, they are not enough.
The Turks must bear in mind that the criteria cover not only the Cyprus issue, but also the question of whether the European Union is itself in a position to welcome their country into membership.
We cannot allow ourselves to get involved in a risky undertaking that would test to the utmost the EUâs political and economic capacity to act.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would like to thank, very warmly and most sincerely, all those Members of this House who have spoken, most of whom make the same speech in every debate on Turkey, in order to make it plain that they do not want Turkey or Turks in the European Union.
I am grateful for five years of cooperation and for your having tolerated me, a Turk, in this House.
I really am very, very grateful.
Thank you: your great achievement does credit to this House!
I came to this Parliament as a German, have worked very hard as a German MEP for five years, but it is as a Turk that I leave it.
Many of you have made me into a Turk, for I am ashamed of the speeches that really can only be described as hypocritical, of these speeches that really have nothing honest about them.
Others may take pride in bravely defending the Christian EU against the Turks, and may perhaps find some voters to support them, but I am ashamed; such is not my European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, both the Commission's latest interim report and the opinions of the different committees of this Parliament demonstrate that Turkey has made important steps in the direction of the Copenhagen criteria.
That country has made enormous progress over the past years.
By way of example, I would mention the abolition of the death penalty and the change in attitude towards the Kurdish minority.
This is all happening under a Turkish Government of which it was feared at the time that it would turn Turkey into an Islamic state.
Fortunately, reality is different.
Without hesitation, the Turkish Government calls for good governance, more transparency and equality between men and women.
The experiment which the AKP Party is conducting is unique and of worldwide significance.
As the European Union should not leave these signals without a response, it should offer a concrete prospect of joining as soon as possible; otherwise, we would soon run the risk of having to face the threat of an Islamic-fundamentalist state, no longer open to dialogue, by the back door.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I want to say about Turkey is that I regard the Copenhagen criteria as a fundamental precondition, and believe that they are indeed, as regards the protection of human and minority rights, not being fulfilled in any sense in which we understand them or should understand them, as a community of values.
I am thinking here of the Kurds, but also of the religious minorities.
To Mr Ceyhun, who spoke earlier, I would say that there was much in his speech that I did not understand.
I am sure that he was not merely tolerated; we enjoyed very good neighbourly relations, being immediate neighbours here in Strasbourg.
Such neighbourliness can be built on, and I believe that a privileged partnership constitutes a third way between members and non-members of the European Union and those who have a privileged relationship with the European Union and must also have a space for the future.
We have different conceptions of the future of the European Union; ours is that this Europe, this European Union of ours, must have borders, and that is why we conclude special agreements with our immediate neighbours.
With this in mind, I believe that Turkey, be it for reasons of history, geography or culture, would not fit in as a direct member of the European Union, and I hope that we will go on along this third way with the courage it deserves.
Here too, the Commission and the Council should exercise greater imagination, rather than simply pointing out that the way is, in any case, already mapped out.
Â Â  Madam President, what have we been able to observe since 1963?
Progress, of course, but at the present time it is easier to list the points of divergence than the advances that have been made.
The constitution, adopted under a military regime, is not a basis on which the rule of law and fundamental rights and freedoms can be guaranteed.
Another matter that needs to be raised is the recognition of the genocide perpetrated against the Armenian population.
Let us not forget that the European Parliament affirmed this in a resolution adopted on 18Â JuneÂ 1987 and has subsequently repeated it on several occasions.
Turkey continues to deny the atrocities committed by the authorities of that time, and the European Parliament has already voiced its concern about the circulars from the Turkish Ministry of National Education enjoining primary and secondary schools to take part in a revisionist campaign to deny the oppression of minorities in the course of Turkish history, especially with regard to the Armenian community.
It is hard to see how a country that will not face up to its history and its errors can join the European Union.
We therefore expect Turkey to exercise its memory, and we shall reiterate this at every opportunity.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over and again, particular concerns are brought to me in my capacity as chairwoman of the European Parliamentâs delegation to the countries of the Southern Caucasus, among which Armenia is included.
First, let me thank Mr Oostlander for his report, which was a very fair one, and also for the way in which he handles Turkeyâs problems with its neighbours, particularly with Armenia.
There are two pre-eminent problems, and the first of them is Turkeyâs economic boycott of Armenia.
The closure of the Turkish-Armenian border has meant that the transport of goods to Armenia is more expensive, and this frustrates the European Unionâs economic aid to that country.
This also constitutes a grave breach of the Balladur Principles, which apply to all present and future candidates for accession, and according to which EU Member States must not be engaged in border disputes with neighbouring states, but must, on the contrary, maintain good relations with them.
The second problem is that what has historically transpired between Turkey and Armenia has still not been worked through, and this hampers mutual understanding and prevents the development of mutual trust.
Most recently, and unfortunately, Turkey has ensured that Armenia has had no part in the negotiations on energy transport and on the construction of pipelines from the region around the Caspian Sea, which is rich in natural gas and oil, and that these will not go through Armenia.
All these things are justified causes for complaint by the Armenian people.
It has not, so far, been possible to resolve these conflicts, which are obstacles not only to Turkeyâs goal of joining the European Union, but also to that of the European Union itself, of stabilising the South Caucasus region.
Â Â  Madam President, Turkey is taking great pains over meeting the political criteria and has already taken various reform measures.
MrÂ Erdoganâs government is doing its utmost.
That is positive, but a great deal has yet to be done before the negotiations can be opened after December.
Torture and the curbing of various civil freedoms remain a problem and the gap between theory and practice remains too wide.
It is not only we, in the ivory towers of Brussels and Strasbourg, who are concerned about this problem; the ordinary citizens in Europe are too, and we must therefore be absolutely certain that we will be taking the right decision when the time comes.
I am therefore rather surprised at Mr Lagendijk's comment that he thinks that Turkey should negotiate with one arm tied behind its back if it does not need to meet the political criteria first, and that this can be done parallel to the negotiations about the .
That puts everything back to front, and seems to suggest that we are doing something unsavoury when we ask an accession country to meet our fundamental values first.
In that respect too, we should adhere to what has been agreed.
Turkey will soon need to be judged fairly on the basis of the political Copenhagen criteria.
I have heard Commissioner Verheugen use the term âzero toleranceâ, and I find it an appealing one.
The Turks deserve this, and so does the population in the European Union.
In short, the setting of a date for negotiations in December is not yet a .
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to draw attention to something which I believe to be extremely important.
We are looking at the issue of Turkey from the point of view of fear, the extraordinary fear of a partner coming closer to us, one with a large population, which at the same time is rather different from us.
Nevertheless, the reality is that, over the last two and a half years, nobody could have imagined the changes Turkey is implementing in order to come closer to Europe.
Apart from the first revolution in the thirties, which changed the language and created a secular country â if only all the Arab countries had this view of a State in which civil power is separated from religious power â in the face of the increasingly powerful theocracies we have in the Islamic world, it seems incredible that we do not understand that this is a great experiment in democracy.
Now, we are in the habit of looking at others arrogantly and we do not realise how small we are.
And why are we small?
Because, if we look at the international context and what is going to happen in the future, the great China, the great India, the United States ... all of these will be great powers and Europe will have a very minor role to play; it will be one of the world's small provinces.
I do not, therefore, see any problem with a country which has a structure of government, a degree of capacity building, which must be developed, but which is greater than other European countries, which has State structures and is therefore capable of doing its duties, as it is doing, progressing under a moderate government which is striving to establish democracy and implement political reforms, I do not see why we cannot give it the opportunity to be a partner which is close to us and which can set an example for the Arab countries.
Let us look at demography.
The demography of the Mediterranean, of Turkey, of Azerbaijan and of other countries, stands in contrast to our own.
Let us think of the future and develop the approaches and analyses we need.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I beg leave to speak under Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure.
The debate on Turkey has taken up the entire morning, which has meant that the scheduled debate on the European Capitals of Culture could not take place.
We are not disputing the fact that Turkey is a matter of prime importance.
Nevertheless, this is the fourth time since I became chairman of the Committee on Culture that the discussion of cultural matters has been postponed, either to the late evening or to a Thursday afternoon, despite the importance of the subject.
The first consequence of this situation is that we cannot vote on this draft, even though it is on the agenda. The second consequence is that, since we are now preparing for the election campaign, everyone will have left by the time we come to deal with this afternoonâs business.
I therefore ask that the debate be rescheduled for 20Â April, the Tuesday of the next part-session in Strasbourg.
This request has the approval of my own group â the PPE-DE â and the Verts/ALE Group.
I apologise for not having had the time to consult the other groups, since we have only known about this for half an hour.
Â Â  I put to the vote the proposal to postpone the report on European Capitals of Culture until the April part-session.
Â Â  Mr President, last night the Working Group of Parliament set up by the Conference of Presidents voted very narrowly to send two contradictory reports to the Conference of Presidents on the issue of EU funding to the Palestinian Authority.
Can I please ask the Conference of Presidents to act on these reports?
I would also demand a full debate in plenary before the Commission and Council to draw some conclusions from these reports.
Â Â  The Conference of Presidents met this morning.
I do not know if the issue that you raised was discussed.
I did, in any case, listen to your speech and your suggestion will be duly assessed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I agree with MrÂ Tannockâs request to add to the agenda the debate on the report adopted in the Working Group yesterday on funding to the Palestinian Authority.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to express the Commission's appreciation and satisfaction with the very good reception given by the European Parliament to our new College member, Mr Dimas.
The exchange of views that Mr Dimas had last Tuesday with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs took place in a very constructive and cooperative manner.
The Commission acknowledges the political importance and significance of this exercise, to be placed, as you know, in a different and special context as compared with the interinstitutional procedure defined by the legal provision of Article 215 of the Treaty.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I would ask you to apply Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure in this case, which lays down that, in the event of an initiative being rejected, it should be referred back to committee.
I am making this request because yesterday in this House Commissioner Vitorino announced two substantial amendments to the initiative, which I believe should be subject to further analysis in committee and, furthermore, this is laid down as an ordinary procedure in the Rule I have mentioned.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am now somewhat surprised at the remarks by MrsÂ TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­, who yesterday evening said something else entirely.
I am against a referral and I would like to ask you to allow the vote on the legislative proposal.
Â Â  The Council is not present and we cannot, therefore, hear its opinion.
I put to the vote the rapporteurâs proposal, which consists of putting the proposal for a legislative resolution to the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to express the Commission's disappointment at the position proposed in Mr Lisi's report and voted.
In fact our proposal implements the political guidelines in the Mediterranean action plan which was welcomed by Parliament and adopted by Council.
Several of the critical comments made are simply not correct. I would like to make a few points here.
Firstly, the Commission proposal give flexibility to Member State managers when deciding on different options to manage fish stocks in the Mediterranean, so we take into consideration the characteristics of Mediterranean fisheries.
The proof is that national administrations can establish national management plans and these plans may allow derogations from certain common provisions precisely because of the different situations in different parts of the Mediterranean.
Secondly, we are well aware that the fisheries sector is opposed to our proposal.
We have received similar reactions to the recovery plan for cod in the northern waters of the Community.
The difference here, however, was that both the sector and the European Parliament had been open to dialogue with the Commission and we adopted an acceptable plan in the end.
And it is precisely this spirit we also need for the southern waters.
Thirdly, the alleged poor consultation of the sector does not correspond to the truth.
The sector has been consulted on several occasions before and after we presented our proposal.
Fourthly, the Commission agrees with Parliament that we need to work with other Mediterranean countries, and that is why we took the initiative for the Venice Conference in November 2003 when the Mediterranean countries, ranging from Morocco to Lebanon and Slovenia, agreed with the European Union that we must agree on common measures in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean to preserve our fish stocks.
Finally, I would like to make one thing very clear. The disastrous social and economic costs Mr Lisi mentioned in his report will be the result if we do not take prompt and effective action as proposed by us, because the state of many Mediterranean fish stocks is already quite poor.
We cannot, therefore, accept your request to withdraw our proposal, because there are neither scientific nor political justifications for Parliament's request.
Â Â  In short, the Commission upholds its proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I listened carefully to the Commissioner.
Our Committee feels that this was not a good proposal, we had repeated visits from and consultation with the sector, particularly from Italy and France, where leaders of the fisheries sector explained that the Commission proposal would have destroyed their jobs and would have done little to save fish stocks.
I would appeal to the Commission in these circumstances to think again.
We are going into the election period and the Commission would have an ideal opportunity to conduct further consultations with the sector throughout the Mediterranean basin, and come back in the new mandate with a reworked, revised proposal, which this House may then find acceptable.
It should not endeavour to send the proposal back to our committee, because under the Rules of Procedure, we would then be required to deal with it within a period of two months.
Clearly, it is impossible for us to comply with those rules, given that the mandate is coming to an end.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the chairman has already spoken about the adequacy of the responses given by the Commission.
I will not give my opinion, I will just point out that it has confirmed its defensive position and unwillingness to enter into dialogue with the citizens, whom we merely represent.
It does not, therefore, want to understand this message that we are continuing to send out: âBe reasonable and negotiate.â
I merely want to ask, in line with the Rules of Procedure, that is to say with RuleÂ 68(3), that the proposal for a legislative resolution is not voted upon and that this text is referred back to committee.
Then, in the time that this parliamentary term allows, we will tackle the issue as soon as possible.
Â Â  There is in fact no need for a vote because the Rules of Procedure provide for the report to be automatically referred back to committee if the Commission maintains its position.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would simply like to point out that my report is the last report from the Committee on Fisheries to this House during the present mandate.
Therefore it is appropriate that it is probably the most important report for fishermen in the last five years.
Fishermen are finally recognised as valid partners who will in future be consulted on all fisheries matters that directly affect their livelihoods.
There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen.
Therefore, for their sake, throughout the Community â not least in Ireland â I would invite you to vote massively in favour of the report.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me quickly clarify two points.
Firstly, there has been no technical correction of recital I, which states that the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has approved the budgetisation of the EDF; this is not the case, because the ACP document is due to be transmitted to us very soon.
I therefore ask for the deletion of the passage referring to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Secondly, since the PPE-DE Group was not present at the debate yesterday evening, I should like to point out that I accept Amendment NoÂ 1 to paragraph 11, tabled by MrÂ Deva.
On the other hand, I am opposed to MrÂ Devaâs Amendment No 2 to paragraph 39, because it would allow the backlog of eleven billion euros that we owe to the ACP countries from the last three EDFs to vanish without trace.
This is their money, and the only reason for the accumulation of this residual amount is delay caused by the cumbersome administrative procedures of the European Union.
Â Â  . Conservative MEPs opposed the confirmation of returning Commissioners from the former disgraced Commission in our election to the European Parliament in 1999.
We do not doubt the ability of Stavros Dimas as Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs but cannot participate in confirming the appointment of the whole Commission as we are currently obliged to do and therefore we have abstained in the vote.
Â Â  .â Given the existence of an internal market with free movement of goods and capital, closer cooperation between the Member States is needed to combat smuggling and tax fraud.
This regulation is part of a package of regulations that aims at strengthening mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States, in this case in the field of excise duties, in which tobacco smuggling is particularly significant.
The rapporteur regrets, however, that the time is not right to take Community legislation forwards with regard to the harmonisation of indirect taxation, and thus considers cooperation to be a temporary solution.
I could not disagree more, because cooperation is an effective method of combating tax fraud and organised crime, not only in relation to excise duties but also to VAT and other indirect taxation.
Above all, it is a method that preserves national sovereignty.
Harmonisation would result in other economic and tax revenue problems in the Member States.
The idea of decentralised cooperation is therefore a good solution.
Â Â  .â The European Parliamentâs position on the initiative regarding migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean merits my full agreement.
It gives the green light for the European Union to accede to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.
This convention falls within the objectives of the policy on the conservation and sustainable management of resources, which the EU follows and promotes.
The Central-Western Pacific area accounts for 60% of world tuna resources, which are of special interest to Community tuna vessels and longliners.
To enhance the capacity of its fleet and the available resources, the Union has concluded several bilateral agreements with coastal states in the region, thus gaining access to new exclusive economic zones.
By acceding to this convention, the European Union can play an active role in the regional fisheries organisations (RFOs), the most appropriate multilateral instrument for the effective conservation and management of fish stocks and for combating illicit fishing.
I support Parliament in urging the European Union to become a member of all the existing RFOs in which the European industry has a legitimate interest, in order to promote responsible fishing and to protect the interests of the fishing industry.
Â Â  .â The purpose of this proposal for a Council decision is to approve the accession of the European Community to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.
By establishing a Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the convention aims at ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the highly migratory fish stocks in those areas.
The importance of the zone of competence of the WCPFC to the Community fleet speaks for itself.
The area covered by this regional fisheries organisation (RFO) accounts for 60% of world tuna resources and five large Community tuna seiners currently operate there, producing an average catch of around 15Â 000 tonnes per year.
Moreover, the growing importance of RFOs has often been acknowledged by Parliament, âas multilateral fisheries management bodies and ideal forums for settling disputes between parties and ensuring responsible management while combating illicit fishingâ.
Indeed, I agree with the rapporteur that it is in the interests of the Member States for the European Union also to become a full member of this RFO in order to protect the interests of the Community fishing industry in these areas.
Â Â  .â The Community programme on the conservation of genetic diversity in agriculture expired at the end of 1999.
The Commission is now putting forward a proposal to set up a new Community programme on the conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture.
In 2001, Parliament and the Council rejected the previous proposal, which sought the financing of national measures in this area, which was unacceptable and removed the strategic importance of ensuring the maintenance of biodiversity, particularly in view of the Communityâs commitments under the various relevant international United Nations conventions.
This is even more difficult to understand in view of the threat to biodiversity posed by a possible raising of the moratorium on genetically modified organisms.
The genetic diversity and variety of food crops in Europe have to be preserved, taking account of local and regional differences.
To this end, local measures are needed to support farmers in preserving their traditional varieties and breeds and bringing products derived from them to local and regional markets.
I regret that the financial framework proposed for this programme is too limited, in view of the needs already highlighted by the Member States and Parliament itself.
Â Â  .â I am aware of the political and economic situation in Guinea-Bissau and therefore understand the urgency in approving this amended protocol as a signal in support of the efforts being made by the Guinea-Bissau authorities to stabilise the country.
I also understand the state of the fish stocks off the Guinea-Bissau coast, due to overfishing and the lack of control measures and resources.
I thus believe that the objectives of the amendments agreed in May 2003 to the Protocol currently in force, concerning a reduction in fishing effort and support measures for sustainable fishing, are acceptable.
Without wishing to jeopardise approval for the proposal before us, however, I have strong reservations regarding the fairness of the proposal across our fleets.
The fishing opportunities allocated to the Portuguese fleet have been reduced, with its shrimp trawler GRT cut by 65%, well above the overall average cut in GRT.
In addition, one surface longliner permit has been lost, as only four longliners are covered by the agreement.
I therefore cannot see what socio-economic impact assessment the Commission carried out for this proposal and what compensation measures it intends to adopt.
This is something I shall insist on.
Â Â  . Normally the Verts/ALE Group would vote against an EC Fisheries Agreement for reasons laid out in the past.
However, we have voted for this agreement for the reasons set out below.
My report calls for improvements in the fight against illegal fishing in several ways.
If EU Member States fishing in Guinea do not provide reliable and detailed data on what they catch, Parliament wants the Commission to begin legal proceedings against them and even to revoke their right to fish under the agreement.
Fishing rights for EU vessels must be re-evaluated according to the most recent scientific analyses conducted by the regional fisheries organisation of west Africa.
The increase in fishing foreseen in the agreement must also be dependent upon unequivocal and independent scientific justification, which must be made available to the Parliament.
Â Â  .â I want to express my total support for the European Parliament report on the amendments to the fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau.
The waters of Guinea-Bissau, which used to be abundant in fish and crustaceans, have suffered from overexploitation of their resources.
Furthermore, the countryâs political instability has allowed corruption and a lack of control measures to affect fishermenâs livelihoods.
In addition to extending the current agreement until 2006, the amendments especially involve reducing the fishing effort of essentially non-Community fleets, making better use of Community funding, and strengthening control measures.
With these changes, the Guinea-Bissau authorities will finally be able to modernise the fishing industry so as to improve the surveillance and patrolling of the sea and thus put an end to overfishing.
I join the rapporteur in calling for more information for Parliament on how this bilateral agreement is to be managed, so that a general evaluation can be carried out.
Finally, I hope this fisheries agreement will be a modest contribution to improving the economic and political situation in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.
The European Parliament is thus sending out a positive signal in support of the Guinea-Bissau authoritiesâ efforts to stabilise the country.
Â Â  .â I have been following social and political developments in Guinea-Bissau with great concern.
I recognise that the acting political authorities have tried to adopt measures to improve governance of the country, in contrast to the obvious breakdown that occurred during the presidency of Kumba Yala.
In this context, and in view of the fact that this is a country with few resources and many needs, the income from fishing is of particular importance and therefore deserves special protection.
Aid to Guinea-Bissau is essential so that it can modernise the industry to improve the surveillance and patrolling of the sea and put an end to overfishing.
I share the rapporteurâs understanding of the need for the European Parliament to give out a positive signal in support of the Guinea-Bissau authoritiesâ efforts to stabilise the situation in the country.
Despite recent reports of unrest and disturbances because of the current electoral process, I believe that this African nation will be able to recover its stability with European Union support.
This is my sincere hope.
I voted in favour of the report, of course.
Â Â  .â In the wake of the strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture presented in September 2002 as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission has considered it necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 on the FIFG, which contains specific provisions supporting development of the Community aquaculture sector, in order to clarify the definition of aquaculture, increase Community aid to extensive fish farming, promote techniques reducing environmental impact, fund applied research, and guarantee financial aid for shellfish farmers where harvesting is suspended.
Although at first sight the proposals seem positive, especially with the improvements introduced by the rapporteurâs amendments, I have serious reservations regarding two issues.
First, the boost given to the development of aquaculture not as an activity complementary to the fisheries sector but in place of extractive fishing merits serious reservations.
We should not encourage the erosion and cessation of an activity as a matter of course, for the sake of gradually moving from catching fish to fish production, which creates other problems for the environment, food safety and coastal management.
Hence the need to invest in research as well.
Secondly, the Commission could have taken the opportunity to carry out a general review of the regulation and increased the maximum amounts of individual aid payments; this is something that Parliamentâs amendments attempt to address, even though they do not go far enough.
Â Â  The injustices committed against our fishermen are compounded by the injustice done to our oyster farmers and shellfish breeders in the Thau Basin and BacarÃšs Pond in the Aude .
They are effectively footing the bill for the massive pollution caused during the summer by the thousands upon thousands of camper vans parked there by tourists from Northern Europe, who daily empty their waste water, infested with phosphates and even pathogenic bacteria, into the ponds of the Languedoc and Catalan regions.
For the Mediterranean and for our fishermen, oyster farmers and shellfish breeders, Europe means restriction and pollution without compensation.
Â Â  .â Parliament has once again been called upon for its opinion on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture, as part of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy.
In theory, the objectives sought by the Commission are commendable: protecting the environment, creating long-term employment (in regions dependent on fishing where there is no alternative), giving consumers an assurance that the products are safe, and promoting research.
In practice, however, this subject is of the utmost importance, since it deals with the procedures and conditions for Community aid to the aquaculture sector.
Granting aid to shellfish farmers where harvesting is suspended because of toxic algae enjoys my support.
The Commission denies this aid, however, in cases of recurrent contamination, and thus creates unjustifiable discrimination among producers.
I also reject the proposal that the minimum length of time for harvesting to be suspended in order to qualify for aid should be six months, even at times when selling is intensive.
This seems too long to me.
Finally, I once again regret the fact that representative professional organisations are excluded from work involved in applied research into the industry.
Â Â  .â In 2003, the Council approved conclusions on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture, the main objectives of which are to create employment and to make quality products available within the context of environmentally balanced production, particularly through the redirection of FIFG public aid towards measures in the fields of training, monitoring, research into new species and the promotion of clean aquaculture techniques.
While in general I support the proposal that the Commission has now submitted to Parliament, there are, however, two important proposals that the rapporteur succeeded in including in the report and which helped to confirm the way I would vote.
One relates to the reduction of the six-month period (proposed by the Commission) for harvesting to be suspended because of toxic algal contamination before shellfish farmers are awarded compensation.
The second is the fact that this review of the regulation has been used to include an amendment, unrelated to aquaculture, for a 20% increase in the maximum amounts of individual aid payments to fishermen, and removal of the requirement for them to have permanently ceased their activity when recovery plans or emergency measures are adopted.
Since both were approved, I voted for this report.
Â Â  .â The strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture centres on aspects such as protecting the environment; creating long-term employment, particularly in regions dependent on fishing where there is no alternative; giving consumers an assurance that aquaculture products are safe and available while ensuring high animal health and welfare standards; promoting research, in particular by providing for appropriate funding in connection with how aquaculture interacts with the environment and, for instance, with master cultures.
To take account of, and implement, the recommendations under the strategy, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) â that is, Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 â has had to be amended.
Positive aspects include: the clarification of certain definitions; the proposed increase in Community aid for extensive fish farming compared with a reduction in Community aid for intensive fish farming; the funding of applied research; the promotion of techniques reducing environmental impact; and support for traditional aquaculture activities (such as mollusc farming) in order to maintain the social fabric in regions where there are no other alternatives.
Like the rapporteur, I think the Commission proposals are moving in the direction of more research and technological development and greater respect for the environment, within a framework of sustainability.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .â I agree with the rapporteur when she states that, although allocating money towards improved control is an essential part of the common fisheries policy, it is but one side of the coin, the other being the active involvement of fishermen in the management of fisheries.
Without the support of fishermen, huge allocations of money towards improved monitoring will not put an end to serious infringements of the CFP.
This Commission proposal aims at extending (by two years) and amending the system of Community financial support for establishing control structures (which expired in 2003), until a decision is made on the joint inspection structure, which the Commission expects to be operational in 2006.
This proposal, however, intends to restrict access to funding just to the new Member States and, even then, with a contribution rate of only 35%.
Since an increase in the Community contribution for fisheries control heavy equipment is one way to help to strengthen control capacity at sea, we agree with the rapporteurâs Amendments Nos 8 and 12, which aim at extending the measure to all Member States and increasing the contribution rate to 50%.
It should not be forgotten that Portugal has the most extensive EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) of all European Union countries and has a large number of vessels to monitor.
Â Â  .â I have already had occasion to express my concerns to this House regarding the ineffectiveness of fisheries controls.
Illegal, illicit and undeclared fishing is a daily reality in Portugal.
This initiative allows Member States to request a Community contribution to the financing of certain projects that aim at improving fishing controls.
It is just one more brick for constructing a sustainable fisheries policy.
In this context, I support the establishment of cross-border exchange of information, as this is a simple, useful way of imposing sanctions across the EU that are effective, proportionate and, most of all, dissuasive.
Moreover, the varying levels of sanctions imposed across the EU for the same infringements are also of great concern.
The problem is even more serious because there are no indicators for assessing the controls that have been carried out.
The EU has, in fact, no information on numbers of inspections, infringements detected, infringement procedures opened, etc. I also agree with the rapporteur that monitoring should be performed not only on board vessels but also on land.
Lastly, Community incentives for Member States to acquire fisheries control heavy equipment should be strengthened.
At the same time, the initiative to simplify and tighten up the allocation of funding is commendable.
Â Â  .â The adoption of the regulation on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources broadened the objectives set out in the common fisheries policy and necessarily created new rules for enforcement.
These include not only the development and implementation of effective fishing control measures but also occupational training and technical and administrative cooperation among all the sectors and institutions involved.
The Commission now intends to extend and amend the existing system for two years, so as to strengthen and standardise monitoring and control resources and methods across the enlarged Union and to prepare for the new Community inspection body to start work.
The problem lies in access to Community funding for control activities requiring the acquisition of âheavy equipmentâ, which the Commission did not wish to consider in its proposal, intending instead to restrict access to the available funds just to the new Member States.
This is a particularly sensitive matter for Portugal, since it has the most extensive EEZ in the Union and a large number of vessels to monitor.
There has to be a chance, therefore, for Portugal not to be excluded from access to this funding, or at least part of this funding.
As the report addresses this main requirement, I voted for it.
Â Â  .â Regulation (EC) NoÂ 3069/95 establishes that observers should be placed on board all vessels operating in the Northwest Atlantic, regulated by the regional organisation NAFO.
To date, the Commission has been responsible for implementing this regulation on Community fishing vessels operating in these waters and has, quite rightly, borne all the costs involved with the observers.
The aim of this proposal, however, is that, as from 1Â JanuaryÂ 2004, the Member States should themselves be responsible for the observers and bear all the associated costs, which does not strike us as acceptable in any way.
Although the latest revision of the common fisheries policy establishes that inspection is the responsibility of the Member States, we are talking about inspection within their EEZs, which does not invalidate Community financing of inspection measures.
I therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  .â The fact that I voted to approve these regulations must not be confused with the opinions expressed by the rapporteur.
With regard to the circulation of euro coins, it is essential that the public should be protected against any kind of fraud, in this particular case that arising from confusion with similar medals or tokens.
Since the euro changeover, there has been a growing number of cases of fraudulent use of fake euro coins in coin-operated machines.
These regulations define the level of similarity to euro coins that should be banned for medals and tokens.
This is one more way to combat the counterfeiting of euro coins and notes.
Although we are all in agreement so far, I utterly reject the rapporteurâs subjective opinions on the success of the single currency or Parliamentâs âfull-heartedâ support for the âhistoric project of Economic and Monetary Union and its single currencyâ.
This is not just because practical problems with the introduction of the single currency are beginning to surface as time goes on, such as its inflationary effects and the increase in bank charges and commission.
I also reject it because, at the level of economic and monetary policy, a serious assessment is needed of the effects of the euro on economic growth and employment, particularly in the less developed Member States such as Portugal.
Â Â  .â Two years on from the introduction of the single currency, it is time to assess the state of the euro and to provide solutions to certain problems that have been diagnosed.
The aim is, above all, to protect the public from any kind of fraud and to safeguard the currency.
The fact is that there has been a growing number of cases of fraudulent use of fake euro coins in coin-operated machines, and current national and Community law has not proved effective enough to address the problem.
As the number of Member States in which the euro circulates is set to increase, it is becoming more urgent and necessary to adopt measures in this respect.
The proposal bans certain levels of similarity in medals and tokens similar to euro coins, and also sets out guidelines for those companies producing such medals or tokens.
Industry representatives have been widely consulted and are in favour of the proposed regulatory framework.
At the same time, the scope of the regulation is to be extended to those countries which have concluded agreements with the EU on the use of the euro, such as Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  I concluded my speech on the Marinho report yesterday evening by observing that the draft resolution, like many before it, seems to ignore the acute problems facing our societies because of abuses of the right to asylum and confines itself to proposals for minor adjustments, accompanying them with almost mantra-like repetition of the need for âfull, comprehensive application of the 1951 Geneva Conventionâ (relating to the status of refugees).
The fact is that this Convention, drafted in the wake of the Second World War in order to deal with cases of political persecution, is no longer a suitable instrument to deal with todayâs refugee problems, caused by the mass migration of populations driven by famine, poverty, disease, chronic insecurity and the absence, in their native countries, of governments worthy of the name.
What is therefore needed is a radical reassessment of our legal instruments.
This is at odds, however, with what the European Union seeks to achieve by rendering the provisions of the Geneva Convention sacrosanct by virtue of the reference to the Convention in Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it intends to incorporate into the draft European Constitution.
In my view, this was one more reason to reject the Marinho report, which advocates the constitutional approach.
Â Â  On the pretext of trying to simplify asylum rules and procedures, Brussels is in the process of creating a whole legal arsenal designed to overwhelm Europe.
This draft contains a whole litany of proposals, each more pro-immigration and subversive than the one before.
They want to make it easier to gain legal access to European Union territory for nationals of non-EU countries for the purposes of employment and family reunification, to make it impossible to authorise collective expulsions, to provide for joint management of migratory flows and for distribution of the (immigration) burden within the European Union, and so on. In other words, we are being asked to allow the Commission to impose immigration quotas on each Member State!
We are surely in agreement on one point, namely the need to reform our asylum laws.
Throughout Europe, the present asylum system is in the throes of a crisis.
France, Britain, Italy and Germany have been inundated by the mass influx of asylum-seekers fleeing their countries of origin for economic reasons and not because of political persecution, as provided for in the Geneva Convention of 28Â July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees.
The solution does not lie in a broader and more permissive redefinition of the right of asylum; quite the contrary.
Let us not offer impossible and dangerous dreams to all these unfortunate people who seek a hypothetical El Dorado.
Â Â  I wish to clarify a point concerning my support for MrÂ Marinhoâs report regarding more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems.
I voted in favour of the report, which contains many good points about the Unionâs future asylum policy.
I am, however, concerned about one item in the report and would gladly have voted against that particular item.
Item 8 of the report means that Parliament now goes in for an exclusive system, which could, in the worst case, lead to great variations in immigration policy, according to the current labour market situation in the various Member States.
Although current legal immigration policy is inadequate in the Member States, Parliament shows a lack of consideration in drawing up, as a solution, a tighter and more exclusive policy, the basis of which is not humanitarianism and human rights, but the needs â defined by whom, may I ask? â of each Member State in terms of its labour market policy.
I also wish to express my hope that the interpretation of Item 9 of the same report will be that abuse within the family should also be included as grounds for seeking asylum.
Just like the grounds at present specifically mentioned in Item 9, abuse within the family also constitutes grounds for seeking asylum, and these must be fully recognised.
Â Â  .â I congratulate Mrs Maes on the report she has drawn up, to which I give my support.
Her work deals with a subject of vital importance: enhancing the safety of third countriesâ aircraft using Community airports.
I therefore welcome the joint text at third reading, which contains three items that I consider essential, namely:
- the need for inspection procedures to be implemented uniformly across the EU, thus preventing third-country aircraft from being diverted to Community airports with less rigorous controls;
- the importance of public access to information on airlinesâ compliance with safety standards;
- European authorities must be able to inspect an aircraft and ground it whenever there is reason to suspect that it does not comply with safety rules.
Â Â  . In its communication on air safety, published last year, the Commission expressed concern at the link between the number of air accidents and the increase in air traffic.
The Council had already attempted to draw up a directive in this area, but the longstanding conflict over Gibraltar proved to be an obstacle to achieving the desired result.
Solving this problem allowed substantial progress to be made in this field.
Whilst fully complying with the SAFA (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft) procedure, which involves the systematic monitoring of aircraft likely to present risks in terms of air safety, the Commission consequently adopted an initiative in the field of air safety in an attempt to ensure three fundamental aspects: gathering and disseminating more accurate information in the field; on-site inspections of aircrew and aircraft from third countries in Community airports and adopting appropriate measures to remedy any shortcomings found, which could even result in the aircraft being grounded.
Bearing in mind the tragic events that have occurred in recent years, I believe it is crucial to increase air safety, by means of closer and more effective monitoring of third-country aircraft and so I voted in favour.
Â Â  . We voted against this report on the funding of the new Regulations for Parliament staff, given that the funding set aside falls in line with the Kinnock reform, which undermines the status of Parliamentâs employees.
There is to be an overall reduction in the number of employees with the status of officials and an increase on fixed-term contracts, not to mention the hundreds of workers already in precarious working conditions, such as sub-contractors and workers forced to work part time.
New recruits will be on lower salaries and will have a lower status than has until now been the case.
Pensions will undergo similar cuts â Parliament staff will retire later and receive a lower pension.
In this respect, Parliament is falling into line with the decrease in levels of social protection in the workplace throughout Europe. This is ample evidence of the value of the EUâs declarations of intent on jobs and working conditions.
Â Â  . This report forms part of the process of adapting the workings of the EP to the increase in the number of official languages, as of 1Â May, with the entry of ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.
Whilst stating that the issue is to provide service of equivalent quality to all its Members by using its existing human and budgetary resources to the best advantage, it actually reduces current rights, even though the rapporteur tries to compensate for this to some extent.
As we have already pointed out, confirming and effectively implementing the principle of establishing all the languages of the EU countries as official and working languages is all the more important because we are now seeing a trend in which some languages â those of the most populous countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy â demonstrate a real and ever-growing preponderance, to the detriment of the languages of the other countries that make up the European Union.
This situation must be countered, by means of ongoing action.
Â Â  . This report proposes that the EPâs Rules of Procedure should be amended to take account of the arrangements for multilingualism currently in force in order to address the difficulties that are expected to arise as a consequence of enlargement, in terms of recruiting a sufficient number of interpreters for certain languages.
The solutions proposed are to be welcomed and confirm the obligation for multilingualism established by the Treaties, although it is stipulated that this obligation can only be ârelaxedâ with the explicit or implicit support of the Members concerned (with regard to some committee or delegation meetings): ArticleÂ 117(3)(a): âAt committee and delegation meetings away from the usual places of work interpretation shall be provided from and into the languages of those members who have confirmed that they will attend the meeting.
By way of exception, these arrangements may be made more flexible by agreement with the members of the committee or delegationâ.
It is only because of its provisional nature â it will expire in December 2006 â that we can accept the insertion of a provision setting out that: âExceptionally, in applying RuleÂ 117, account shall be taken, with regard to the official languages of the countries which will accede to the European Union on 1Â May 2004, as of that date and until 31Â December 2006, of the availability in real terms and sufficient numbers of the requisite interpreters and translatorsâ.
For these reasons, I have voted in favour.
Â Â  . In order to be able to address the difficulties that are expected to arise as a consequence of enlargement, in the field of recruiting a sufficient number of interpreters for certain languages, this report proposes a transitional amendment of the Rules of Procedure as regards the multilingual arrangements in force in the European Parliament.
The obligation for multilingualism established by the Treaties is confirmed and it is recommended that this obligation could be ârelaxedâ; with the explicit support of the Members concerned and with transitional arrangements for the new Member States while there is a shortage of interpreters.
This is an extremely delicate matter and no transitional law is really required â a different interpretation would suffice.
Any derogation to the multilingual approach, even if transitional, represents a risk for the future.
I voted in favour of the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which definitively limits the transitional nature of the arrangements and I voted against the report in the final overall vote.
Â Â  Despite promising attempts, current fisheries policy still involves the EU buying the right to abuse the natural resources of the poor.
It is a modern form of colonialism.
A real reform of fisheries policy and a complete change in view of our relationship with poor countries are necessary.
We have therefore chosen to vote against the above report.
Â Â  , . I share the criticism made repeatedly by the Portuguese Government on the unevenness and inequality created by this fisheries agreement on the agreements concluded with the âcountries of the Southâ.
The criticism centres, more specifically, on the disparity between the real fishing opportunities and the level of financial compensation, on the fact that fitting out a vessel is not included in the costs inherent in the workings of the agreement and on the fact that unused quotas cannot be transferred between Member States.
I therefore welcome the results that have been achieved and the commitment given by the Council to ensure that the relationship between the EU and Greenland, after 2006, based on a broader partnership for sustainable development, includes a specific fisheries agreement, negotiated in accordance with the general rules and the principles that underpin these agreements.
I voted in favour of the report, since the fundamental political issue concerns the transfer of unused fishing opportunities between Member States, in order to streamline their use and since the report proposes that the Commission can do this by adopting the necessary measures to ensure that the Community fleet makes the planned catches without jeopardising the principle of relative stability between Member States.
Â Â  . Now that analytical data has been compiled on the fisheries agreements between the European Community and Greenland, it is proposed to amend the Protocol on the fishing conditions that have been provided for.
An amendment of this nature is fully justified by the poor take-up of the fishing opportunities allocated to the Union, and this holds all the more true because the financial compensation that is paid does not vary according to the take-up rate.
To this end, it is proposed, specifically, that the following measures, with which I agree, should be adopted: setting fishing quotas in line with the real situation, including new species likely to be caught, stepping up research in the field of fisheries and the possibility of increasing Community fleet fishing opportunities to 50% for new species, if fisheries resources allow.
I welcome in particular the rapporteurâs suggestion that a solution must be found to the problem of transferring unused quotas between Member States, which would compensate Portugal in particular.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . Î€he horrifying events in Madrid gave the European Council an excuse to speed up the application of anti-democratic measures already legislated and to move even closer to the USA and ÎÎÎ€Î.
Apart from strengthening mechanisms for prosecuting, putting on electronic file and controlling (in other words, hunting) the persecuted seeking refuge on our continent, controls will be carried out on charities, to make sure they are not financing terrorists and, of course, on extreme religious and political persuasions.
The real causes of terrorism remained outside the interests of the Council, for obvious reasons.
In the economic sector, having confirmed that capitalist restructuring is not going all that well, they again call on the workers to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the profits of the monopolies.
The systems of social protection will have to be âmodernisedâ, the elderly will have to work, everyone will have to be at the mercy of employers on minimum terms, in insecure, part-time jobs.
Every country will be controlled and recommendations will be made to any which do not comply.
Thus we shall acquire âmore and better jobsâ!
Knowing that their conclusions will cause a new wave of grass-roots fights, they call on the Member States to âbuild Reform Partnerships involving the social partnersâ.
Even if a few bought-out leaders assist, we are certain that grass-roots resistance will strengthen.
The peoples have the power to ruin their plans.
Â Â  . Parliament has just welcomed the last European Councilâs commitment to reaching an agreement by 17Â June on the draft European constitution, giving âpractical expression to what is a fresh start for our continentâ.
It would indeed be a fresh start, as it would represent a decisive leap towards a super-state, and a move further away from the plurality of sovereign states that has always characterised Europe.
More precisely, the compromise plans that are circulating at the moment, aimed at reaching a final agreement, suggest that the principle of âdouble majorityâ in decision-making at the Council will probably be accepted, which means that a criterion will be introduced that weights the votes of each country according to the size of its population.
We would thus be moving towards calculating an overall majority without taking account of national borders, as though there were one single unified people in the EU.
Such a step, which is already to be found in the Thucydides quotation at the top of the draft constitution, negates the pluralism of Europeâs nations.
It is at the root of peopleâs feelings of alienation; people do not feel part of the current institutions.
It is essentially for this reason that I am opposed to the draft Constitution.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the motion for a Joint Resolution on the outcome of the European Council of 25-26 March 2004, despite having many doubts as regards the recommendations on the Middle East.
I did not, therefore, support the general opinion of my group, in particular on items 41 and 43 of the motion.
In the separate vote, I expressed my disagreement on these points when I had the opportunity to do so.
Â Â  . Two months away from the elections to the European Parliament, there is perhaps no better proof of the collusion between the Portuguese right wing (in the form of the Social Democratic Party) and social democracy, (in the form of the Socialist Party), than this litany of agreements:
- from the blessing given to the so-called âEuropean constitutionâ which would further subvert Portugalâs sovereignty and independence,
- to what is termed the âfight against terrorismâ â which involves stepping up security measures and their use to remove powers from States or to militarise international relations;
- from the âLisbon Strategyâ â with its umpteenth reaffirmation of the Stability Pact, and of liberalisation (labour, health, pensions), now with the added ânoveltyâ of mechanisms that are binding on States,
- to the Middle East â accepting the âstatus quoâ in Iraq and giving it legitimacy through the role of the UN or unjustly holding the Palestinians jointly responsible for the situation in Palestine.
As to the Intergovernmental Conference, it appears that, in this framework, Spain and Poland will (re)join the group of those âin chargeâ.
In practice, the major powers are gradually imposing their control, with the other governments playing a subservient role.
Examples of this are the recent replacement of one Spaniard by another on the Executive Committee of the ECB or the imposition of a Frenchman as the âEuropeanâ candidate for the presidency of the IMF.
Â Â  .
At the Brussels European Council of 25Â and 26Â March, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Madrid, we might have expected fresh democratic and social impetus on the part of the Heads of State or Government, but no such thing was forthcoming.
Much to the contrary, the Fifteen put the neo-liberal and militaristic draft European Constitution back on the agenda. They opted to pursue the Lisbon Strategy, a veritable war machine that makes jobs less secure and privatises public services.
Finally, in a touching show of unity, the Fifteen re-launched the war on terror and undermined our civil liberties by calling our bluff with the State lies told by Bush, Blair and Aznar.
At the European Council, we might have expected to hear the whole truth about the illegal and illegitimate war in Iraq.
The European Union could have demanded the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the transfer of sovereignty back to the Iraqi people. It could, similarly, have called for the construction of the wall between Israel and Palestine to be halted and for the settlements to be dismantled.
We might have also expected a new social and democratic Europe to be put in place, as a challenge to the hegemony of the markets and of eurocracy.
This new joint resolution, however, drawn up by the conservatives, the socialists and the liberals, concerning the outcomes of the European Council, serves only to back up the duplicity and hypocrisy of European integration.
We voted against it.
Â Â  . I wish first of all to offer my congratulations to the Irish Presidency on the way in which it has managed the issue of adopting the Conventionâs Draft Constitution.
As usually happens, it took the presidency of a small State to demonstrate the necessary intelligence and pro-European approach to attempt to solve such a significant problem.
I say this despite the fact that, as a Member for a Stateless nation, Galicia, I must disagree with the constitutional text where this still fails to recognise Stateless nations, which are a fundamental part of Europeâs political, historical and cultural diversity.
Having said this, I wish to focus on the section of the motion on the outcome of the Brussels European Council last week that deals with the terrorist attacks in Madrid.
As I said in the amendment that I tabled through my group, I wish to express my admiration admiration I know we all share at the exemplary behaviour of the people of Madrid and of Spanish society as a whole following the terrorist attack that took place on 11 March.
I must highlight the remarkable public-spirited and humanitarian way in which the citizens acted, the efficiency of the rescue services and the assistance given by all the institutions to the victims and their families and I would underline the fact that no xenophobic attitudes or attitudes rejecting any particular religion or country have been expressed.
Â Â  The Swedish Christian Democrats want a solution to be found for the planned European Constitution that takes account of the following considerations, among others:
1) that the EU not be given the right to tax our incomes and pensions;
2) that the rotating Presidency of the Council continue and that a newly established, centralised office such as that of EU President not be created;
3) that Europeâs biblical and Judaeo-Christian heritage be recognised in the Preamble as an historical fact concerning our spiritual heritage, in the same way as humanism is specified as the only named philosophical current;
4) that ArticleÂ 51 remain, stating that the EU must conduct a regular dialogue with churches and other religious communities and associations;
5) that each Member State be entitled to a Commissioner with full voting rights;
6) that, in the future too, defence issues be dealt with on the basis of the principle of unanimity;
7) that the ambiguous clauses concerning the passerelle and transitional mechanisms be removed; these, it is proposed, should give Heads of State or Government in the Council the right unanimously to extend the EUâs legislative powers at the national parliamentsâ expense and to abandon the right of veto/principle of unanimity in favour of majority decision-making â and this without each countryâs parliament being required to give its approval.
Â Â  . Mr van den Bos (ELDR, D'66) has declared that he has voted against joint resolution Nos B5-0165/2004 B5-0182/2004 B5-0183/2004, in which the Council is once again urged to reconsider the association agreement with Israel.
Now that Prime Minister Sharon himself calls for withdrawal from the occupied territories and dismantling of settlements, the EU must support fresh policy in this direction.
A boycott of Israel would further restrict the already minor impact of Europe on that country and seriously hamper communication.
Additionally, Mr Van den Bos considers the text under No 40 unbalanced, because it does not condemn the terrorist attack on Ashdod, while the assassination of the Hamas leader been condemned.
Â Â  . The arguments underpinning the proposal to reject this regulation, as expressed in the report, are extremely important, because they could apply in other cases, such as Portugal, which has the largest EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) of any country in the Community.
The first argument concerns respect for the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean in all its aspects: the characteristics of its fleet, of its socio-economic fabric and of the types of fishing.
The second argument hinges on the need to involve fishermen in the decision-making process, making use of their experience and heeding their concerns.
Lastly, dialogue and cooperation must be enhanced with neighbouring third countries in order to involve them in the commitment to ensure sustainable fishing.
The proposal for a regulation does not guarantee these conditions which, bearing in mind the international dimension of the Mediterranean, are sound guiding principles for the common fisheries policy.
Lastly, there is the link between these conditions and the need for a serious evaluation of the current state of fisheries resources and of the appropriate measures to ensure the conservation of these resources, an area in which issues of liberalising access and the underlying contradictions are to a large extent echoed in the situation in Portugal.
Â Â  . For 20 years now the Commissionâs political strategy in the area of fisheries and with regard to our fishermen has been clear; place limits on our boats, on our nets and on our catch.
The justification appears to make sense; fishery resources, such as cod, are dwindling, so in order for stocks to be saved and for a sustainable recovery to take place, our fishermen have to reduce their fishing effort immediately.
This has given rise to the measures that we have seen, which place restrictions on net size, on driftnets, on boat power, on building new boats and on total allowable catches (TAC), all of which forms part of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP).
Unfortunately, while our fishermen are hamstrung and their vessels in a state of disrepair, factory ships from Japan, Russia and elsewhere are plundering the fishery resource in French waters.
In the waters off SÃšte and the coast of Languedoc-Roussillon, vessels smaller than 12 metres have been refused permission to modernise, on the grounds that this would breach the kWh limit, thereby jeopardising their safety.
Meanwhile, France is buying more than EUR 2 billion worth of fish and seafood that Brussels bans us from fishing.
Â Â  . As happens with other common policies, in other areas, with other Member States of the European Union, with the common fisheries policy and, in the particular case of fishing in the Mediterranean, the European Commission continues to fail to pay due attention to the specific characteristics of individual cases.
As regards the specific case of the Mediterranean, the major socio-economic role it plays in many areas and its strategic importance have not been enough, despite the strong calls made by the European Parliament, to ensure that its specific characteristics are respected and that there is an attempt to adopt flexible measures.
The European Commissionâs proposal for a regulation, which is examined in the report now before us, upholds a management approach that is totally at odds with the real situation in the Mediterranean and, furthermore, fails to include any flanking measures that would be capable of offsetting the disastrous socio-economic impact which it would have.
The rapporteur, therefore, rightly proposes both rejecting the proposal for a regulation and asking the European Commission to submit at the earliest opportunity a new proposal that takes due account of all suggestions and proposals that may emerge from thorough and in-depth consultations with all interested parties.
Because I fully agree with the rapporteurâs ideas, I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . The rapporteur takes the view that, unlike what was set out in the Green Paper on Reform of the common fisheries policy, this proposal fails to give due consideration to the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea.
The proposal falls in line with an approach similar to that adopted in the measures that have been implemented to date; measures that have proven to be inadequate and which, given the failure of this management policy, have highlighted the need for a change of direction, as stated in the Green Paper on the CFP.
Furthermore, and by way of a warning about the importance of involving fishermen to ensure that the rules are observed, the rapporteur suggests that their experience and the problems facing them have been ignored and that, in the type of legal framework that is proposed, this would push them to the outer fringes of the law.
No attention is given to the countless examples of good practice in recent years, by both fishermen and shipowners which, given the lack of any meaningful contact between the interested parties, does nothing to augur the success of the management policy suggested by the Commission.
I agree with the rapporteur and voted against the proposal for a regulation and supported referring the matter back to the Parliamentary committee.
Â Â  . The report confirms a fundamental principle that we have always argued for â the good governance of the common fisheries policy - which ârequires proper involvement of all the fishing industryâs professionals in the decision-making process for framing and managing the policyâ.
Furthermore, âthat involvement should occur as near as possible to the start of the processâ.
We have, therefore, always argued for the need to decentralise the CFP.
For this reason, the Commission proposal makes a significant contribution by proposing the creation of regional advisory councils.
We broadly agree with this report, which improves on the Commissionâs original proposal.
It highlights the importance of involving all actors in the sector, particularly share fishermen and small-scale fishermen, through their unions, and coastal fishermen operating in 12-mile territorial waters.
Creating subcommittees is another interesting proposal, because it seeks to ensure closer cooperation in every area.
Furthermore, the report proposes that the funding of the spending and workings of these Councils should be more effectively guaranteed.
Nevertheless, we have reservations about the potential transformation of these regional (and, therefore, supranational) councils into councils with real management powers, which would undermine Member State sovereignty.
Â Â  . The reform of the CFP contained a proposal to set up RACs, and British Conservative MEPs today voted to support that proposal.
We nevertheless believe that the EC has already relegated these bodies to the sidelines in respect of fisheries management by starving them of adequate funding and insisting that their role be purely 'advisory'.
We fear that meaningful stakeholder involvement will therefore be restricted to the role of mere 'talking shops', with Brussels continuing to take all the management decisions.
This is not good enough, and cannot resolve the problems which have resulted in the failure of the CFP.
Thus, although we regard the creation of RACs as a tiny step in the right direction, we remain resolute in our view that UK withdrawal from the CFP, returning management to local and national control, remains the only real way to safeguard the future of the UK fisheries sector and fish stocks.
Â Â  . I have on various occasions repeated the view in this House that fishermen and shipowners should play a more significant role in reforming the common fisheries policy, especially when it comes to drawing up plans for recovering species through bans and restrictions on fishing efforts.
I believe it is quite unrealistic to seek to impose effective measures to conserve resources without consulting the main players involved because they are precisely the people who are most affected, on a daily basis, by decisions and policies on fisheries management.
This is precisely the aim of this initiative to create Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), but although there is consensus on setting them up, there are disagreements over their composition and funding.
It is my view that, without an appropriate budget, this measure will be meaningless and, without the majority representation of the fisheries industry in the RACs, the rights of the main players will suffer.
Only at the end of a transitional period will the composition and workings of the RACs have to be reassessed.
Should the experiment prove these bodies to be effective, they must then be given a significant role in managing fisheries resources.
Lastly, I disagree with the geographical division of RACs proposed by the Commission, which divides up the entire EU territory into only five zones.
Portuguese waters, both continental and around the islands, are thus included in the âSouth Western Watersâ zone.
Â Â  . The aim of creating the Regional Advisory Councils (RAC) under the common fisheries policy is to increase the involvement of fishermen and their organisations in the decision-making processes of the CFP for the first time.
I welcome the excellent work of the rapporteur, who has given voice to the fishermenâs legitimate expectations that these Councils will be set up.
These Councils would, in particular, provide an ideal forum in which fishermen and scientists could overcome their traditional differences over the state of fisheries resources.
The sustainable management of fisheries resources, the social interests of the sector and the economic survival of all coastal communities will depend, to a large extent, on the involvement of representatives of the fisheries sector in developing the CFP.
We must, therefore, also ensure that these RACs are governed by transparent regulations and are quite independent, perhaps, as the rapporteur suggests, as âlegally incorporated non-commercial bodiesâ registered in a Member State.
For this reason too, the European Commission must increase the funding it wishes to provide, which the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur consider to be derisory, in order to ensure that the RACs are truly viable.
These Councils respond to an objective need of the European Union in terms of the value that their will bring to the CFP and to the work of the European Commission, and in terms of preventing problems arising in the future.
Â Â  Here it is at last â the long-awaited proposal for a decision establishing Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), which is a response to the framework regulation that provides for new ways of participating in the common fisheries policyWhile it is certainly a response, it also raises further questions.
The rapporteur rightly points out that without adequate and continued funding this initiative will quickly become an empty shell, which will have helped the Commission to ease its conscience for the minimum outlay.
My contribution to the report consists of requesting the creation of intermediate structures corresponding to coherent and homogenous geographical sub-units, whose role will be to propose technical recommendations to the RACs at the outset of the decision-making process.
The social and economic dimension of the CFP will finally be taken into account, provided, again, that adequate funding is made available.
The effectiveness of the RACs will depend entirely on the extent to which the fishery sector participates, which it will do in a genuine and effective way only if the RACs are guaranteed a certain level of Community funding and of involvement.
The RACs can then take on a genuinely hands-on managerial role in addressing the economic, social and environmental issues directly affected by the CFP.

Â Â  . Five years ago, the power of the Serb state over Kosovo, which is mainly populated by Albanians, was broken.
The predominant memory that the people of Kosovo have of the Serbs is that of soldiers, police, tax collectors, prison wardens, unfriendly officials and unwanted rulers.
They do not regard the remaining 5% of Serbs as people who will adopt the Albanian language or adapt in other ways.
In fact, this minority is suspected of wanting its old privileged position back.
Its position is similar to that of the Turks in Greece and Bulgaria, the Hungarians in Slovakia and Romania and the Russians in the Baltic states, except that the memories in Kosovo are more recent and more bitter.
The area which was designated the bilingual autonomous province of Kosovo-Metohia within Serbia after the Second World War, has, in practice, fallen apart into a Serb north â a few scattered Serbian villages under military surveillance â and an otherwise purely Albanian country.
The few contacts between Serbs and Albanians result in violent conflict.
It should now be about the equality of people and good neighbourly relations.
I expect that the Albanians intolerant attitude towards the Serbs, Turks and Roma â which is deplorable â will pass away as soon as they are certain that they can take over the running of the country and will never again be dominated by others.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats take the following views:
Item 28
We do not consider this to be the right forum for calling upon the Member States to change their legislation regarding euthanasia.
This is an issue for each country to settle itself.
Item 147
We consider that the Member States must themselves decide whether or not they need to make use of transitional rules.
Many Member States have chosen to introduce transitional rules in order to gain time to prepare a smooth transition to full freedom of movement.
We think it important that the transitional rules apply for as short a time as possible.
Â Â  . I voted against the Boumediene-Thiery report on fundamental human rights in the EU, which, I was delighted to see, was narrowly rejected (177 in favour, 184 against).
What this report in fact does is to record our sins, at length, and right across the board. It claims that we do not respect human dignity (Chapter I), that we deny people their freedom (II), that we practise discrimination (III), that we neglect solidarity (IV), that we hinder citizensâ rights (V) and that we do not allow access to a fair trial (VI).
The thread running though all of these chapters was the situation of immigrants, since, if this text is to be believed, we are not sufficiently open to immigrants and asylum seekers, we do not place sufficient numbers of immigrants on the electoral register and we should give legal immigrants the right to vote.
Not surprisingly, this report contains a ringing endorsement of the draft European Constitution, the effect of which would be, however, to remove the definition of fundamental human rights from the competence of each nation, and to shift it instead to European level, where no one is in control of anything any more.
This is an obvious sleight of hand.
The report was rejected, but sadly the Constitution lives on.
Â Â  . The report paints a relatively accurate picture of the ÎU, far from its made-up profile as a model of respect for human rights, as it often appears from its propagandists.
It contains numerous critical references to the situation as regards fundamental rights in the ÎU, treatment of prisoners, slavery and forced labour, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, rights of asylum, racism and xenophobia, discrimination based on sex, disability, worker' rights, rights of third country nationals and fair access to justice.
Nonetheless, this self-criticism is undermined, in that it takes as its criterion compliance with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which still lags behind the provisions of numerous constitutions, including the Greek constitution.
Our basic objection, however, concerns how fundamental rights, such as the right to work, free health care, education, welfare and so on are addressed. At a time when big business is attacking workers' rights on all fronts, to consider that the problem can be addressed not by fighting but with new EU directives and measures or by applying existing ones is, at best, self-delusion.
As far as women's rights are concerned, the report ignores the fact that there cannot be equality in social and family life unless the capitalist core is removed from EU policy.
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote.
Â Â  Fundamental rights within the EU seem even more important now that we shall be reuniting Eastern and Western Europe in just a few weeksâ time.
A common basis of values for the new, enlarged EU is now even more necessary.
We want to create a Union, the foundation for which is humanitarianism, tolerance, human dignity and the equal value of human beings.
We have chosen to abstain in the vote on partnership and rights for heterosexual and homosexual couples when it comes to adoption within the EU.
The Liberal Party has always pushed for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or marital status, to be able to apply for adoption.
All adoption decisions should be made on the basis of what is best for the child.
We are not, therefore, against the possibility of either heterosexual or homosexual couples being tested for adoption.
We are, however, doubtful that this is something that should be decided on at EU level.
We are also of the opinion that the issue of euthanasia is something that each individual Member State should be allowed to resolve on its own.
We have, however, adopted a position whereby the EU should push for women to have access to safe and legal abortions, essential contraceptives and economically accessible services within reproductive and sexual health and sex education.
Â Â  . We are all forever deploring the fact that Parliament suffers from an obvious lack of reputation and credibility.
As if it were not bad enough that there is no such thing as a âEuropean peopleâ and that it is impossible to transpose the Member Statesâ current parliamentary practice to the European level, the federalist majority insists on burdening us continually with fulminating reports, which â as I have said many times before â do untold damage to the image of this House.
This is true of the annual reports in the EU on human rights, and the report before us this year is no exception.
Member Statesâ police forces are portrayed as âmilitiasâ made up of potential torturers; governments are suspected of controlling and manipulating information; there is condemnation of policies aimed at strengthening control of illegal immigration and the inexorable rise of racism and xenophobia. The picture painted by this report is simply astonishing, not to say ridiculous.
Add in the fact that the report argues in favour of homosexuality and euthanasia, and it is hardly surprising that reports of this nature do such damage to our standing in the eyes of the citizens.
Â Â  .
These reports have, unfortunately, become a ritual in the service of a radical and sectarian ideological agenda.
They no longer serve the important idea of protecting and valuing human rights in the European Union, to really benefit the citizens.
This yearâs report did not break with this trend.
It frequently slipped into a maximalist approach.
It made unfair, frivolous and unfounded assessments of Member States, and this is true of its references to Portugal, all of which were incorrect.
Having based its approach on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it promptly rode roughshod over this document and distanced itself completely from the charter by proclaiming a âright to abortionâ â when no such thing exists (whilst rejecting an amendment that I proposed, in discussions in the parliamentary committee, to protect human life) and by obsessively promoting the homosexual agenda, which contravenes the exclusive competence of the Member States in the field of family law.
Lastly, it lacked the vigour required for dealing with real threats.
On the one hand, it completely ignored the fact, lost in the torrent of paragraphs couched in emotive terms, that terrorism is the main threat to human rights today.
On the other, the report failed clearly to condemn the French legislation on religious symbols, which is the most disturbing recent sign of discrimination and threatens religious freedom.
I therefore voted against and welcome the fact that it has been rejected in plenary.
I hope that lessons will be learnt for the future.
Â Â  I have today, together with a majority, voted down this report (184 against, 177 in favour and 13 abstentions).
We European Christian Democrats in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have done this on a huge scale because, in our opinion, the report should have concentrated on evaluating how the Member States have respected human rights, taking the EUâs Charter on Fundamental Rights as a starting point.
This was unfortunately not the case.
The report is sweeping and poorly formulated, at the same time as diluting and devaluing the concept of human rights.
Here is an example: in one and the same item there are references to torture on the one hand, which of course must be condemned outright, and demands for the introduction of euthanasia on the other, which is neither an EU issue nor a human rights issue.
The report covers a series of subjects that fall outside the area of competence of the EU and are not covered by the Charter, for example, changing national legislation on marriage between men and women, together with the very concept of the family, or including the extinguishing of life in the form of terminations/abortions under the concept of human rights.
This is something to which, of course, Europeâs Christian Democrats say no.
Â Â  Today, the European Parliament voted on a report regarding the state of human rights in Europe.
The report should have concentrated on evaluating how the Member States have respected human rights, taking the EUâs Charter on Fundamental Rights as a starting point.
This was unfortunately not the case.
The report is sweeping and poorly formulated, which is exemplified by the fact that, in one and the same item, there are references to torture on the one hand, which of course must be condemned outright, and euthanasia on the other, which is not an EU issue and does not count as a human right, either.
The report covers a series of issues that fall outside the area of competence of the EU and are not covered by the Charter.
The report does, however, cover several important issues such as trafficking in human beings, womenâs rights, asylum policy and the rule of law, to which I would like to lend my support.
The whole assessment of the report will, however, be such that I have chosen to abstain in the final vote.
Â Â  . The conditions for Croatiaâs accession to the EU â and not to Europe, as the resolution states â raise similar problems to the accession of other countries, albeit with some peculiar characteristics.
As elsewhere, we claim to be applying the Copenhagen criteria, based on the assumption that a viable market economy is being created, whilst in reality the statesâ erosion of social protection and their underfunding of social programmes have led to poverty, unemployment and external debt.
The report, and I quote, draws âattention to the need to ensure transparency and speed up the privatisation processâ. These forced privatisations, however, have, as everywhere, lacked transparency and their slowness reflects substantial difficulties and legitimacy problems that have never been analysed.
Croatiaâs accession, is, moreover, supposed to encourage the Western Balkans, who were promised future integration by the Thessaloniki Council last June.
This is breathtaking hypocrisy, given the disastrous state of international policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, as evidenced by the recent violence in Kosovo, in the presence of some 20Â 000 NATO troops.
Although we are in favour of European integration that is open to all countries, current debate on enlargement analyses areas that we would prefer to avoid.
We therefore voted against this resolution.
Â Â  , . By submitting a request, on 21 February 2003, to join the European Union, this country that was part of the former Yugoslavia became the first country from the Western Balkans to choose to align its destiny with that of the European Union, reinforcing the idea that the European project is still a mobilising factor, even beyond the round of enlargement that will take place on 1 May.
Given the political and post-war situation in the region, I fully share the rapporteurâs opinion that Croatia can become the driving force for progress in the Western Balkans.
With its economic strength and the progress it has made on establishing democracy, Croatiaâs success can certainly serve as a model and an incentive for the other countries that make up the Western Balkans, in view of their own eventual accession to the EU.
This would, therefore, be the most desirable scenario for ensuring stability and prosperity in the region.
If Croatia wishes to have the opportunity to join the Union reasonably quickly, it must nevertheless first solve certain problems relating to the definition of its land and sea borders, which concern Slovenia and Italy.
The European Union cannot allow such problems within its borders.
The rapporteur refers to these problems and calls for a rapid solution to be found.
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . Croatia submitted its request for accession to the European Union on 21 February 2003 and was the first country from the Western Balkans to opt firmly for the project of European integration.
In recent years Croatia has embarked on economic and political reforms aimed at democratising the country and modernising its economy.
Croatia has also made substantial progress in bringing its legislation into line with that of the European Union in several areas, in accordance with the guidelines laid down for the association and stabilisation process.
A great deal remains to be done, in particular on the return of refugees, on Croatiaâs cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia and on the extension of Croatiaâs jurisdiction over the Adriatic â considerable perseverance will be needed to ensure that Croatia has the necessary means to ensure that the rule of law and democracy are consolidated.
I feel, however, that despite these limitations, the example of Croatia could serve as a model for the entire Balkan region and I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  â The June Movement has today chosen to vote in favour of Turkey being treated like other candidate countries and having to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, particularly where human rights are concerned.
The June Movement firmly believes that Turkey's possible membership cannot in any way be linked to a need for an EU Constitution or a common security and defence policy.
The June Movement is fundamentally opposed to an EU Constitution and a common security and defence policy.
Â Â  .â The Oostlander report assessing âTurkeyâs progress towards accessionâ is compelled to make negative assessments of each area, yet falls short of reaching a negative overall conclusion.
If we do not wish to redirect Turkey towards privileged partner status, as I proposed in my intervention during the debate, then what is the solution?
The Oostlander report tentatively moves in an unexpected direction, namely the internal reform of the policies and institutions of the EU itself (see item G and paragraph 36).
This idea is worthy of consideration, particularly as it ties in with a suggestion we ourselves have made in the past, that a variable-geometry Europe would more readily welcome Turkey as a partner, as it would establish free relations between sovereign countries, and would avoid the explosive situation of being subject to a supranational decision-making system in which Turkey would carry very considerable weight.
Unfortunately, the Oostlander report, having made several steps in this direction, then takes a wrong turn, by proposing, as a solution to all problems, the strengthening of the supranational system by the adoption of the draft Constitution currently on the table.
The federalists are going round in circles.
Â Â  . We voted against Amendment NoÂ 7, the author of which â with his outdated and chauvinistic ideas â would like to slam the EUâs door shut to Turkey.
The fact that he hides his stance behind a proposal for a referendum â in which every EU citizen would be asked to voice their opinion on the matter â does not justify that stance.
Does he propose referendums on questions that really matter to the public, such as the redirection of State arms budgets to schools, hospitals and public transport in the EU?
We are not, of course, opposed to Turkeyâs accession to the EU. We are, however, opposed to all those who cite religious or ideological reasons for refusing to lower a border on a continent that is already all too divided.
Nevertheless, we do not accept the reasons why the European ruling classes would like Turkey to be integrated into the framework of the EU, nor do we accept the clean bill of health given to the Turkish Government, especially when basic rights and freedoms are being trampled under foot in Turkey, such as the Kurdish peopleâs right to enjoy such rights and freedoms, and when political prisoners are still detained.
We also do not understand why backing should be given to the conditions imposed by the European institutions on Turkey, for which the leaders of the country will undoubtedly make the working classes foot the bill.
We have therefore abstained from voting on this report.
Â Â  .
The report contains some aspects that I believe to be fair and others with which I disagree, particularly those underlying its main thesis.
The rapporteur is right to condemn the Turkish authoritiesâ failure to respect trade union freedom and to criticise the progress of the trial of Leyla Zana and other Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin.
We must call for prisoners of conscience to be released and condemn political persecution and the ban on the activity of some political parties.
We must condemn the ongoing torture, mistreatment and persecution faced by human rightsâ activists and organisations.
We must reaffirm the cultural rights of the Kurdish people and a âjust, viable and functional settlement of the Cyprus problemâ, in line with the UN resolutions.
In order to be consistent, however, and to demonstrate solidarity with the Turkish people, I must criticise some aspects of the report, such as accepting âthe primacy of EU law over national lawâ, the need to approve the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ, using Turkey as a Nato ally, to âsignificantlyâ increase the EUâs influence in the region, and even the view that Turkey should âput up or shut upâ in negotiations, without the EU making any concessions on imposing its neolioberal economic policies.
An example of this is the opinion of Parliamentâs Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Â Â  . I believe that, whilst it has work to do to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, Turkey belongs in Europe.
It has helped to mould Europeâs culture and history.
I have therefore dissociated myself from all amendments that do not target genuine improvement in the democratic process in Turkey, but that endeavour instead to put up fresh barriers and to set traps in order to prevent any decision in favour.
Â Â  . I voted against the resolution.
By integrating the whole of Turkey, Europe would be changing not only its geographical dimensions but also its very nature.
Turkey has no claims â be they geographical, historical or cultural â to be part of the EUâs political project.
We must, however, connect Turkey with Europe.
I say ânoâ to accession, but âyesâ to close and privileged cooperation, and to a strong partnership agreement.
Turkey must, furthermore, confront its past.
I also voted in favour of the amendment calling on the Turkish authorities to make a public acknowledgement of the genocide against the Armenians.
I also hope that Parliamentâs assent will be sought before negotiations are opened, and not once they have been completed.
Â Â  . What breathtaking hypocrisy on Parliamentâs part to discuss Turkeyâs accession today, as though somehow this were not a , although the impending enlargement, with the accession of ten new countries, paves the way for a âsecond waveâ, in the shape of the accession of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
The title of the report says much about what the Commission is cooking up, with the active complicity of the political âelitesâ.
âReport on Turkeyâs progress towards accessionâ â you only have to read the title to be in no doubt that the Community bodies are already planning Turkeyâs accession.
We are expected to wait until December 2004 to know whether or not negotiations on accession can get under way.
What a charade!
All European leaders have expressed their support for this unholy accession, and without so much as consulting their citizens.
As the first to speak out against an enlargement that is non-European, politically unjustified, economically suicidal and socially devastating, the is the only French political force genuinely opposed to Turkeyâs accession to the EU.
Â Â  . This report makes it clear that Turkey, despite steps in the right direction, still fails to meet the Copenhagen criteria.
These form the basic conditions for partnership and the European Union.
It is an illusion to think that these criteria will be met by this autumn, and so it would be premature to mention a date.
What is essential to us is that there can be no real democracy under the army's guardianship.
It is equally essential that the Kurds should be able to exercise to the full their rights as a cultural minority.
A constitutional state is unthinkable without an independent judicial system.
While we are still not convinced that Turkey's ultimate destiny lies in membership of the EU, or that the European Union can welcome it as a Member State, we do not want to rule this out at this point in time.
This should also be debated within the European Union.
A final decision in favour of an association agreement to the exclusion of membership appears to us to be just as premature.
We do not want to discourage Turkey from continuing on the path towards greater democracy and more human rights, or from giving the Kurds their autonomy in order to enjoy their culture.
Â Â  . Turkey decided in favour of Europe as long ago as the AtatÃŒrk revolution in the early 1920s.
Moreover, people from Turkey and their descendants have formed a major population group in Western Europe for the past 40 years.
This has made the discussion about the question whether Turkey belongs to Europe and whether it would not be preferable if it were to sign association agreements with the Middle East, Central Asia or Iran, increasingly more theoretical.
Those who want to keep Turkey outside the European Union on the grounds that it is largely outside Europe in geographical terms or because it is not founded upon the Judaeo-Christian tradition, lost the argument a long time ago.
However, this does not mean that those who defend the other extreme are necessarily right either.
In its current state, Turkey does fit into the authoritarian Europe of the first half of the twentieth century, but not as yet in a European Union of parliamentary democracies.
Before that can happen, it will need to stop banning political parties, do away with an electoral system that is geared towards exclusion, stop taking political prisoners, and abolish censorship of the press, the oppression of regional languages and the army's political influence.
Legislative amendments without changes in practice are not enough.
Anyone who wants Turkey to join for military, economic or idealistic reasons should realise the negative effects that a premature admission could have.
It would not benefit democracy, human rights, peace and the environment within the European Union.
Â Â  . My position on this matter has been well known for a long time.
Everyone knows why I am strongly opposed to Turkeyâs accession to the EU.
It is, consequently, obvious that I would be unable to endorse the conclusions of this new report, which appears to suggest that Turkeyâs accession is a foregone conclusion.
I would also be most surprised if a great nation such as Turkey were to accept such contemptuous treatment at the hands of such European institutions as the Commission and Parliament.
What gives these bodies, whose legitimacy is more than dubious, the right to treat a sovereign state such as Turkey in this humiliating fashion?
Under the pretext of monitoring compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, Parliament calls on the Turkish authorities to adopt a new constitution, to spread federalist propaganda in this famously civil society, and then unscrupulously subjects Turkey to international condemnation for these never-ending breaches of human rights, and so forth.
Quite apart from the problem of Turkeyâs accession, the EU is showing an extremely worrying tendency to interfere.
Â Â  .
This report assesses Turkeyâs progress towards its potential accession to the European Union.
The rapporteur has made a realistic interpretation of the doubts that have been building up in various Member States as regards Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, by advocating a realistic policy which, in his view, the Union must adopt towards that country.
We must not promote the idea that, as a result of the measures that have already been adopted, Turkey is already close to accession.
Instead, we should work closely with the current Turkish Government to ensure that it fully meets the Copenhagen political criteria.
In fact, the Council has, perhaps over-hastily, given Turkey recognition as a candidate for accession and, as the rapporteur states, âin this recognition the quality of Turkey as a democratic and constitutional state did not play a dominant roleâ.
I support the position adopted by Mr QueirÃ³, which he expressed in plenary, on the need for the Council and the Commission to make a clear and precise assessment of the consequences of Turkeyâs accession.
It is not enough to know whether Turkey is ready to join the Union.
The important question is whether the Union is prepared for this eventuality and reason dictates that we must ask this question.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  I have abstained in the final vote.
The report was adopted by 211 votes to 84, with 46 abstentions.
Turkey must revoke its 30-year occupation of Cyprus and acknowledge the genocide of the Christian minorities of Armenians and Syrian-Assyrian-Chaldeans in 1915-1918, which cost 1.5 million people their lives.
The EU as a proponent of peace is undermined if Turkey is allowed to enter into negotiations regarding EU membership in a situation in which the country continues to be an occupying power in the northern part of the new EU member, Cyprus.
EU Member States do not occupy one another.
Historic blunders must be acknowledged in order to alleviate the suffering and sorrow of the minorities affected.
Only thus can we embrace a new future.
Germany would never have been considered a democracy or been able to become an EU member if it had denied the Holocaust, the genocide of the Jews, during the Second World War.
Turkey has everything to learn from this.
Â Â  . I voted against the report on Turkeyâs progress towards accession, since, quite apart from the reportâs position stating that Turkey does not fulfil the required criteria to accede, I am opposed in principle to Turkey joining the EU.
Turkey does not belong to the continent, geographically speaking, and Europe must establish coherent borders.
It is for this reason that I welcomed the possibility of proposing a privileged partnership, as envisaged in the future European Constitution.
While Parliament does not support this approach, I feel that Turkeyâs accession would run counter to the construction of a strong and coherent political Europe.
Â Â  . I remain opposed to integrating the EDF into the EUâs budget, given that States will not agree to contribute an amount that is at least equivalent to current voluntary contributions towards the EUâs development policy, all of which will be on top of the current ceiling of 1.24% of joint GNP.
Â Â  .â If the EDF system has survived thus far in an unconventional fashion, this is because the relationships forged by some EU Members â by no means all of them â with developing countries, especially in Africa, it is because these relationships are themselves less than conventional.
Rather than be suspicious of these privileged relationships, the EU should instead welcome their continued existence, in spite of the fact that the Community perspective has, in recent years, due to enlargement, tended to focus its attentions eastwards, at the expense of the south.
If procedures must be rationalised and simplified, two forms of injustice arise from the reform of the system in favour of the total communitisation and budgetisation of aid: firstly, the fall in overall funding resulting from the removal of the psychological factor, which meant that voluntary contributions tended be the most generous; and secondly, labelling a major part of cooperation policy âEuropeanâ serves to make action less visible, and, accordingly, reduce the influence of the principal donors in the region in question.
In conclusion, levelling will, as ever, be downwards, and will serve to offer the shirkers an undeserved smokescreen and to discourage the most generous donors, who will see their efforts masked by unjust and counter-productive anonymity.
Â Â  .
The financing of the European Development Fund (EDF) was originally kept outside the Community budget because, for a long time, development cooperation was viewed, as someone has said, as the ânational preserveâ of the Member States.
The main benefit of incorporating the EDFâs financing into the budget would be to facilitate parliamentary control and it would also make it easier to simplify and streamline procedures and to clear up the '' (RAL), which are partly responsible, it is widely believed, for the lack of transparency affecting the entire operation.
This budgetisation will also enable us to provide more effective responses to one-off situations of the utmost urgency.
We must, however, at all costs avoid this process automatically resulting in lower contributions to the ACP countries, diverted towards other strategic areas for investment or contributions being reduced as a result of the accession of the new Member States.
We must also prevent the psychological factor of the visibility of national donations from disappearing completely, as a result of aid being provided at a more centralised level.
As I have always maintained, Europe has a historical and human responsibility to contribute to the wellbeing of peoples and nations to which we are bound by a deep-rooted sense of fraternity and which, for various reasons, need our consideration and our practical support.
The results that have been achieved, over many years, by this European form of solidarity, particularly towards the ACP countries, must encourage us to pursue this course of action, which is much needed by these peoples and much desired by the European public.
Â Â  Mr President, multilingualism is guaranteed, for better or for worse, in Europeâs legal system, by the founding treaties. In the same way that it applies to every citizen of the EU, it also protects the Members of this House in the way in which they carry out their functions.
It follows that the Rules of Procedure of this House cannot alone be exempt from an obligation that is established in the Treaty. The Bureau must, therefore, in line with the provisions laid down by common agreement, comply strictly with the obligations that also bind it.
Â Â  Mr President, the resolution on the European Council, as you are well aware, is very wide-ranging.
Once again, it contains approval of the draft European Constitution, which would have led meÂ âÂ as I have not changed my mind in this respectÂ âÂ to vote against it.
However, it also makes so many other valid points, particularly with regard to terrorism and the appalling attack on Madrid, that I had no choice but to vote in favour of it.
Â Â  I am aware of the text of the Council statement, MrÂ Dehousse.
If I may take the liberty of making a comment, even if as President I usually only preside, I found it very strange, amongst other things, that, in an official European Council document, the last two paragraphs were dedicated to an internal matter of accommodation.
I feel that we â as Parliament â should in some way point out to the Council that we found this truly strange.
Â Â  MrÂ President, even though, in my opinion, considerable elements are missing from this resolution, it is largely balanced, and so I voted in favour of it.
First of all, I believe that no solution to the Kosovo problem can be found without first making clear decisions as to the future of Kosovo.
If we do not define the status that we want to give it, then the standards cannot be achieved.
To this end, I believe that the route taken to date is wrong.
Secondly, I think that the United Nations Transitional Administration has discredited itself so much that it should be replaced there by a European civilian administration, which could be better controlled and which would â if it avoids the mistakes that UNMIK (United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ) made â enjoy more respect.
The third and final point that I wanted to raise is that it is being said that Kosovo-Albanian leaders were insufficiently unequivocal in condemning the riots, but they did do so, and emphatically.
President Rugova declared a day of national mourning for both nationalities, whilst the Serbian Prime Ministermarched at the head of a demonstration in Belgrade where there were calls to âkill the Albanians!â
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcome the Baltas report as a cautious step towards Croatian membership of the EU, and I must say that we had got even further on this matter, since, with the Brok report, this House clearly argued for candidate status and for Croatiaâs accession in the next wave.
I would like to say that we should continue down this route.
Although, through no fault of its own, Croatia is in a different league from the Member States that will be joining us on 1Â May, it is, in many respects, as ready for accession as some of them are, and I believe that we should give immense support to Croatia so that it is present in the next wave of enlargement.
Â Â  Mr President, I should simply like to express my concern at the resounding vote given by this House in favour of Turkeyâs progress towards accession.
Turkey is a great and respectable country, but it is not a European one.
Turkeyâs accession would initiate a process that would, little by little, gradually lead to an overall dilution of the EU as a whole. It would deprive the EU of a genuine ability to make decisions and take action in the future.
I appreciate that the House has voted in this way as part of the Helsinki decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in 1999. This was, however, a rash decision that was taken without proper debate or consultation and we are now reaping its disastrous consequences.
I am also astonished â and I will finish on this point â to see some people today opposing the follow-up of the process, even though yesterday, they approved the initiative â involving Mr Chirac and MrÂ Jospin with particular regard to my own country â which was at the root of the Helsinki decision in 1999.
Â Â  Mr President, I acknowledge that Mr Bourlanges is one of the most learned Members of this House.
Consequently, I am stunned by his bold declaration that Turkey is not a European country.
To say that, Mr Bourlanges, would be like saying that Byzantium is and has never been European.
Go on pilgrimage to Ravenna and then we can speak about it.
This issue has nothing to do with the past, however, and everything to do with the future.
The question is whether or not we want Turkey to be part of European integration.
It is not history that will take us forward, but our own will and that of our peoples.
I share the concerns held by Mr Bourlanges and others.
I am one of those hoping for serious debates to take place, including in this House, so that we can take decisions based on careful consideration.
I would say, however, that those who have expressed their views have done so prematurely, and at a time when any reservations we may have about Turkey, be they well-founded or otherwise, undermine the difficult task to which the EU is committed, alongside the UN, that of finding a solution to the Cyprus question.
This is not the right time, therefore, to be discussing such matters and less still to be taking decisions, which is why I unreservedly endorse the proposal before us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I voted against the Oostlander report even though it includes many good ideas.
I would, however, like to clearly associate myself with the line taken by my colleague MrÂ Bourlanges.
We want a strong Turkey as a good partner, but we also want a stable European Union that is capable of action.
Those who turn Turkey into a full Member State of the European Union, destabilise the European Union.
Those, however, who only lead Turkey to believe that they really have a chance of being a candidate, are ultimately destabilising Turkey because they are, so to speak, luring the Turks in with unattainable promises and then letting them down by imposing ever tighter criteria.
This is a game I am not prepared to play.
I am in favour of an honest policy on Turkey, which says that there are limits to everything, even to a Europe that can be integrated.
Turkey must be our closest partner and as far as Byzantium is concerned, you can say that Saint Augustine came from todayâs Algeria, and he was one of the fathers of the West, but even so, I would not incorporate the current Algeria or the future Algeria âÂ even a democratic AlgeriaÂ âÂ into the European Union.
The European Union is not the amalgamation of all democratic countries in the world that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, but rather all European States that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and wish to join.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.(4)
(5)
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, there was no announcement just now, but as the written declaration on the rights of deaf-blind people has reached the required number of signatures, namely, 320, I would just like to thank everyone here for signing that resolution, of which I was co-author.
It is great news for deaf-blind people.
We are not asking for more rights for deaf-blind people in the European Union, but for the same rights as other European citizens have.
Â Â  We congratulate you, Mrs Lynne, and we are all very pleased with this important news that the declaration has now received the necessary number of signatures.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0176/2004) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission: Towards a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to join in the congratulations.
I would like to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for the fact that the Commission developed this thematic strategy.
I would also like to encourage her to pursue this issue because I believe that we are currently in a phase in Europe where we must consider whether the waste policy can be continued as we have done to date or if it is not the case that we have for a long time had new knowledge and must no longer just tighten up the loose screws, but rather perhaps here and there also change the system.
As a result, this is the first regulation â that both the Commission and Parliament have had to address â that makes it urgently necessary that we look at the transposal of the law in force in Europe.
For example, the implementation of the landfill directive is abysmal, to say the least.
Some countries go over the top but some are not doing anything in this area.
This is why I believe that, alongside a high level of protection, we must also pay attention here to the transposal of such things.
The second thing that is very dear to me is that we ensure, in the areas of waste and recycling, that the instruments and regulations that run in parallel, such as for example REACH and IVO, as well as other product policies and the resource strategies â that we should have also included in the debate now â are compatible with this report.
Otherwise, I think the legislation will not be watertight and loopholes will open up; that we really do not want.
We warmly welcome the Commissionâs approach, which involves developing sustainable waste management whilst giving equal value to the environmental, economic and social aspects and, therefore, to develop sustainable policies.
We also believe that the entire lifecycle of resources and waste policy too must be considered together; not just a part, but the entire lifecycle must be taken into consideration.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, I must give my particular support to the approach to set up cost-benefit analyses.
Without them, I believe that we would be doing Europe no favours as a location for industry.
I do not want to question the sustainable combination within the waste hierarchy at all, but we must subject this waste hierarchy to a certain degree of transparency and flexibility since prevention, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and environment-friendly waste disposal are the tried and completely trusted instruments.
The order is also right, but I would once again like to expressly point out the flexibility that we actually need here.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy clearly dealt with the issues where more proposals for harmonisation must be made, and where existing regulations must actually be implemented.
I am extremely pleased that there will in future also be certain rules and systems concepts for recovery facilities, so that one person does not think one thing and someone else another as regards recovery facilities.
I hope that the committee and the Commission agree with me that the competitiveness of secondary raw materials as well as of primary raw materials must be guaranteed.
I think that help from outside is also necessary, probably from the area of taxation, in order to develop an adequate and above all a continual flow of secondary raw materials for the manufacturing industry.
The issue of the landfill directive is a difficult one and, together with environmentalists, we are looking into whether or not to bring in a landfill tax.
I do not think much of this idea at all, as it makes Europe more expensive as an industrial location.
I do, however, believe in ultimately raising landfill standards to a level where they can be compared.
Raising taxes is basically the easiest thing to do in this sphere but achieving the required equal standards for landfill would also entail harmonising the costs.
That would be a much more sensible route to take.
We have, therefore, proposed standardisation and a truly âEuropeanâ landfill regulation and we have gained a huge majority for it.
A further important point â this is hard to believe â is this issue of whether to differentiate between recovery and disposal and so on and so forth.
All these things will in future be regulated under this directive and will be tracked by the Commission and by you in line with the objectives.
I would like to thank all Members, who were involved in this report and I hope that we will reach a successful conclusion.
Â Â  .
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Florenz for this important report; as usual he has done a thorough job.
In the Sixth Environmental Action Programme the European Union set out a vision integrating resource, product and waste policies, and now with the development of the Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste we are designing the concrete policy which will take the next step towards turning this vision into reality.
Allow me to share with you some thoughts on the challenges we are facing.
The first challenge ahead of us is for waste policy to adapt to enlargement and the increased diversity of the European Union.
We must set common rules guaranteeing a high level of environmental protection for all facilities in the European waste recovery market.
We must ensure that our legislation gives the right signals to Member States, whilst allowing them to adapt policies to national issues.
This means waste legislation must take more of a framework approach.
The second challenge we are facing lies in defining the environmental objective of waste policy.
We need to accurately target environmental impacts and look at how waste prevention, re-use and increased recycling can best reduce this impact.
Finally, the most concrete challenge will be to design cost-effective instruments.
In the past we have focused on products with particular issues like end-of-life cars and computers.
However, these wastes represent small fractions of total waste flows, and we have outlined in the communication ways to promote recycling more generally.
We need to influence the economic attractiveness of recycling and set the scene for materials to re-enter the economy.
I would like to make a few comments on some key aspects of the report before you.
It rightly stresses the general objective of reducing environmental impacts of waste and the primary role waste prevention should play.
However, we must accept that there is no miraculous instrument that can stop waste at source.
We will have to adopt a flexible approach, enabling Member States to use a wide range of measures.
I welcome the support given to developing common standards for waste management facilities and promoting the use of economic instruments such as landfill taxes.
I believe these elements should play a key role.
Landfill bans can also be useful, but only as part of an overall policy.
I would like to stress that it will not be possible to increase indefinitely the number of product directives.
The waste flows covered are too small, and implementation is complex.
In conclusion, if we are to move forward in the face of changing circumstances we need to get our strategy right.
We need to focus on the most significant environmental impacts of waste, and adopt framework actions to tackle them.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission Communication is a first step towards the thematic strategy which includes both the prevention and the recycling of waste.
This is recognised in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, presented by Mr Langen, and I welcome him.
Our position in this regard is clear.
We must adopt a flexible approach which takes account of the diversity of geographical, social and economic situations in the various Member States.
We recognise that it is necessary to reduce the quantity of waste produced and achieve the highest possible levels of reuse of materials, and that all possibilities for dealing with waste are valid, provided that they are sustainable.
Recycling 100% of waste is highly desirable, but impossible.
Imposing obligatory objectives, particularly in the case of prevention, and charges and taxes may have effects that are counter-productive for the management of waste.
There are markets in waste which already function perfectly and which handle great quantities in an efficient manner.
Therefore, establishing obligatory rules and taxes on waste may have distorting effects, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry.
Furthermore, industrial waste is often easier to recycle and, therefore, we call on the Commission to take this factor into account and to include in its proposal the separate collection of recyclable material originating from industry.
We also urge the Commission to produce an evaluation of the consultation procedure carried out on the definition of âwasteâ, publishing its results and presenting a response on the definition of this concept and other parallel concepts, such as waste recycling.
Commissioner, we impatiently await the thematic strategy on waste and we will always draft our proposals for improvements in accordance with what is best for the environment and for the general public.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, waste has to be prevented both quantitatively and qualitatively, and at the same time there have to be ways of recovering material defined as waste, so that the quantity of waste for disposal is minimised.
This has been the aim in the Community approach to the problem of waste for a long time now, and this has also been the main thread running through the commendable report by my colleague, MrÂ Florenz.
The principles that lie behind waste prevention and its effective treatment and recovery, however, can easily be interpreted as a threat to each other.
We have organisations that are opposed to the effective recovery of waste because they fear the successful treatment of waste threatens the principle of prevention.
This is madness and the sort of ideological inflexibility the world can no longer afford.
Every single means must be used, first prevention, then recovery, and our politicians must be able to find a system in which these objectives do not pose a threat to one another.
We will be bad politicians unless we can make the system a more rational one.
This means that the definition of waste will be of central importance.
Our problem is the differing and often too restricting definitions in the waste sector, as the large number of problem cases before the European Court of Justice shows.
This problem has to be addressed though the clarification and harmonisation of legislation.
It will be necessary to define the difference between recovery and disposal quickly when the next parliamentary term starts.
At the moment it seems that with competition more effective operations really will lead to better efficiency, which in most cases also means eco-efficiency in the use of materials.
Thus competition in conjunction with Community legislation already implemented is satisfactorily steering towards the prevention of waste.
The trend is absolutely the right one and only needs to be endorsed.
The greatest untapped potential still lies in how materials and by-products classified as waste can be recovered so that the use of virgin materials can be reduced and waste disposal made unnecessary.
Industry accounts for enormous quantities of waste whose precise composition is known and which at source could be treated separately from the rest of the waste flow.
This would facilitate its recovery with the risks fully under control.
Europe is acting properly in its aim towards sustainable waste management and there can be no compromise regarding this objective.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, waste prevention, reuse and recycling â all these topics have been in the limelight over the past few years.
I should like to thank MrÂ Florenz for his contribution to the debate and for his interesting report.
The European directives have certainly started the ball rolling.
We are sorting and collecting our packaging waste, and we make sure our appliances are disposed of effectively.
All over Europe, there are now recycling installations, and all over Europe, people are committed to processing the waste we are all producing.
That is heavy and demanding work.
However, we should do this for the environment and should continue doing this, because the waste mountain is still growing.
We should therefore not turn a blind eye to a few obstacles in European waste policy.
First of all, there are large discrepancies among the Member States in the implementation of the directive.
This is sometimes attributable to indolence, but often to real problems, such as the lack of potential markets.
These differences in implementation also lead to competitive problems.
In some countries, it is the governments and taxpayers who collect, and industry contributes little, while in other countries, it is precisely the other way round.
Secondly, there is the environmental benefit, which is not always clear.
We think that recycling benefits the environment, but there is a limit.
For example, in the case of excessive transport distances, the environmental benefit becomes a burden.
Thirdly, we are still not sufficiently engaging in prevention and reuse.
Packaging is important to protect the product, but surely a double layer of plastic around a small piece of bread is taking things slightly too far.
Although the Group of the Party of European Socialists is not a keen advocate of expressing prevention targets in weight, because this stimulates the use of lighter materials, such as plastic, we have to note that, in Belgium for example, reuse targets work very well.
Germany too offers much inspiration with regard to its deposit system.
As far as the amendments are concerned, we wholeheartedly back all amendments which stimulate reuse and prevention, except for amendments in which prevention is expressed in a percentage, such as in Amendment No 13.
As for the definition of waste, I think that we should remind ourselves of the objective that the environmental burden of production and consumption should decrease.
For this, the whole chain has to be examined, from raw material down to waste.
It does not seem useful to me to have continual discussions about the definitions of waste and prevention.
I share Mr Florenz' view that the reduction of waste is an essential element of sustainable waste management.
The wording is of secondary importance.
Finally, I should like to comment on the economic and social aspects of waste prevention.
Our key topic is the environment, but that also encompasses other aspects, particularly in the economic and social areas.
It is precisely these aspects that have been insufficiently addressed, even if the costs have been regularly mentioned recently in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
In the past, we have called for the introduction of a supercommissioner for sustainable development.
This may be a good time to repeat this request.
The Lisbon objective needs a shot in the arm and that should come from a new Parliament and a new Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, waste is a major problem throughout the European Union.
If we take municipal waste for example, what we produce is far in excess of the targets set in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme.
The prevention of waste is one of the ways of tackling it, because the disposal of waste â whether through landfill or incineration â causes health and environmental problems.
Many people in the European Union are trying to tackle the issue of landfill sites situated near homes or the fact that incinerators are being planned in some countries, including my own to try to deal with the waste problem.
That is the wrong road to go down.
The Commission's communication is a first step towards having a strategy that covers prevention and recycling.
We welcome the fact that the report has included some very important things, such as waste reduction plans.
It is all very well to say we will have them, but this is meaningless without some effort to ensure that happens, so it is essential that they are compulsory.
The promotion of re-use is extremely important and particularly respect for the judgment of the European Court of Justice that waste incineration of municipal household waste is disposal and not recovery.
It was regrettable that the review of the packaging directive did not deal with this properly.
The judgment was clear in itself, so how could anyone consider that the incineration of household waste was the same as recovery?
We regret that we were unable to change the whole pro-incineration approach to a pro-recycling approach.
This is essential because, by following the road of incineration, any incentive to reduce and look at alternative ways of dealing with the reduction of waste is destroyed.
Â Â  . Mr President, first a word on waste definition.
This is often mentioned as being important, which of course it is.
In its communication the Commission stated that it would consider changes to waste definition if the need for such changes was demonstrated, and also that the alternative proposal guarantees a high level of environmental protection.
The Commission also stressed that the debate on waste definition should focus on easing the application of the definition of waste.
This has also been widely supported by stakeholders.
It would seem useful to mitigate the impact of the definition of waste in some circumstances, and this may involve changes to the Waste Framework Directive.
Turning to waste prevention, since it has been discussed, and the subject of setting targets for waste prevention.
This is a complex issue, and the potential for waste prevention will vary; it depends on economic growth and also the maturity of different industrial production processes.
Furthermore, specific information and instruments are needed to influence each decision taken at production-process, management, design and consumer levels.
EU legislation contains the seeds of mandatory waste prevention plans, because under the Waste Framework Directive Member States must draw up waste management plans which promote, , waste prevention.
On recycling and recovery: in general, but not always, recycling is environmentally more favourable than energy recovery.
For example, low quality of recycling, a high proportion of recovered energy or highly mixed waste can influence environmental performance.
In such circumstances, case-by-case assessment may be necessary to determine the best option.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the International Conference on Renewable Energy to take place in Bonn in June.
Â Â  . Mr President, the plan of implementation agreed in Johannesburg during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 put a strong emphasis on renewable energy.
It stresses the need to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the total world energy supply.
In answer to this challenge, the European Community and the Member States launched, during the World Summit in Johannesburg, the so-called 'Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition', inviting all countries of the world to joint it.
A key milestone in this process is the conference that will take place in Bonn this year.
The Commission has been involved in its preparation since the very early stages.
The first preparatory international high-level conference was organised by the Commission. It offered the first major stepping-stone towards the Bonn conference, including a clear road map.
The Commission is also hosting the secretariat of this coalition.
The coalition has now grown from 66 to 87 members and continues to grow: Ghana joined only this week.
The Commission intends to present three initiatives at the Bonn conference: first, a communication assessing the state of development of renewable energy in the European Union.
The communication takes as its starting point the need to address the Union's growing dependence on energy imports â mainly oil and fossil fuels from a few areas of the world â and the need to tackle climate change.
The promotion of renewable energy has an important part to play in both those areas.
The communication will evaluate progress made by Member States under the directive on electricity from renewable energy sources.
It will report that all Member States have adopted national targets for the share of electricity production from renewable energy sources.
If Member States achieve their national targets, the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in the EU of 15 should come close to the 22% target of the directive, compared to 14% in 2001.
However, national policies and measures currently in place will probably achieve only half of the progress necessary, bringing the renewable energy share in electricity production only up to between 18% and 19% in 2010.
That is a source of concern.
As regards overall energy consumption, the Union has, since 1997, been working towards the target of a 12% share of renewable energy.
A couple of years ago the share was only 6%.
Since that date, in 2001 the Community adopted new legislation in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency, a directive on electricity from renewable energy sources âcovering biofuels, energy performance of buildings, co-generation, etc. The European Parliament and the Council are examining further proposals on eco-design requirements, energy efficiency and energy services.
However, even if this framework legislation is fully transposed and implemented, the share of renewable energy should still only reach 10% in 2010.
There will be a need for further action. A priority will be the heating sector.
Through the secretariat of the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition we have launched two key initiatives to support, in particular, the developing country members of the coalition.
We are developing a global on-line renewable energy policy and measures data base, including reported targets jointly with the renewable energy team of the International Energy Agency.
To respond to the continuing call for innovative public/private partnerships we are also exploring the feasibility of creating a patient capital fund to encourage participation from international and local financial intermediaries, as well as the international financial institutions.
The aim is to offer affordable risk capital.
Both projects will be presented by the Commission at the Bonn conference.
I should like to clarify some issues about the patient capital initiative, which originates from the commitments made by the European Union to identify and bridge financing gaps and obstacles with respect to renewable energy.
First of all, it is still only an idea that we are studying.
A feasibility study has been launched.
If it is established, that fund would be a type of equity finance that blends public and private sector investment requirements.
It would provide equity funding in the expectation of a return but on a less demanding basis than pure market private equity capital.
We are presenting this initiative in a wide range of events and fora and have received positive feedback so far.
As regards the Bonn conference, the European Preparatory Conference on Renewable Energy was held in January this year.
That conference considered that the use of overall targets for renewable energy should be extended beyond 2010.
A number of technical studies suggest that a target of at least 20% of gross domestic consumption from renewable energy in 2020 is economically feasible and achievable for the EU of 25, provided that the right policy environment is created.
