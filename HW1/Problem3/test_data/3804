Alas, the way chosen by the Commission to launch the process of reforming the common fisheries policy has been the exact opposite of the cooperative effort that is needed to develop new rules.
And yet the fishermen's organisations played a very active and constructive part in the consultation process initiated by the Commission after the publication of its Green Paper.
They thought that the reform of the common fisheries policy would offer an opportunity to restore confidence by breaking with the depressing tradition of dictated policies.
They are all the more bitter to find themselves presented with reform plans that effectively ignore their suggestions.
The Commission's initial error, in other words, has been compounded by the wrong choice of method.
With regard to the measures to protect and regenerate stocks, instead of moving towards the procedures based on consensus and responsibility that fishermen want, the Commission seeks to drag us towards greater authoritarianism and centralisation, in spite of some spurious concessions, such as the regional advisory committees.
As far as the measures to regulate the fishing effort are concerned, these are brutal and arbitrary decisions that are being imposed, and their purpose is to scrap more and more vessels and to make more and more fishermen redundant.
If such measures were adopted, there would be every reason to fear, Mr Busk, that monitoring the implementation of the common fisheries policy would be fraught with far more problems tomorrow than it is today.
But there is still time, Commissioner, to think again and to listen to the messages that the fishing communities are addressing to you.
As you well know, rather than arousing enthusiasm, your proposals have only stirred up revolt in our ports and along our coasts.
If you are able to discern the import of this revolt, you will soon realise that our fishermen are more deeply committed to the practice of sustainable fishing than your armchair environmentalists.
Mr President, with growing signs of the depletion of many fish stocks, the common fisheries policy (CFP) has incorporated and progressively stepped up the component of stock protection and conservation.
This is an issue of civic and political responsibility, because such measures are crucial to safeguarding the future of the fisheries sector itself and of fishermen, even though the measures might not be very popular in the short term.
In order to ensure the effective implementation of this important aspect of the CFP, we have for a long time had a set of Community control, inspection and surveillance mechanisms, compliance with which depends, basically, on the Member States.
What the Commission has now presented is an evaluation report on the way in which these mechanisms are implemented in the various Member States.
This report shows that profound inequalities exist in the interpretation and implementation of these measures, specifically: in inspection and surveillance equipment, in the training of inspectors, in the frequency of inspections and in sanction procedures.
Mrs Attwooll's report also focuses on some of these very problems.
This being the case, it is obvious that such disparities are creating genuinely unequal treatment of fishermen in the various Member States. These inequalities also lead, ultimately, to a distortion of competition.
This is what has happened, for example, with the famous Multiannual Guidance Plans for Fisheries - the MAGPs - under which the Member States failing to meet the established objectives have not had any sanctions imposed on them and it is ultimately those who have broken the rules who have become the beneficiaries.
What the Commission is now suggesting in this report is the need substantially to strengthen the mechanisms for the control and surveillance of fisheries, including the possibility of the Commission's corps of inspectors' being able to act independently of national authorities.
We agree with this proposal, and this debate must now be incorporated into the debate on the CFP following 2002.
To conclude, I simply wish to thank Niels Busk for his support for the Committee on Fisheries, and for his report, the content of which we broadly agree with.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Busk and Attwooll reports and the Commission documents they deal with are most timely and extremely useful.
In fact, we are at a pivotal moment, when all the chapters of the common fisheries policy are in the process of being revised.
The reports throw light on the matter and help to explain an essential element of fisheries policy: control and sanctions.
It is worth repeating that the conservation of meagre resources, however renewable, is the vital issue.
The fish mortality rate can be regulated, as we know, in various ways; by limiting catches, the TAC and quotas, by limiting the effort and days spent at sea and by holding periodic closures; the model of exploitation can be also be regulated by technical measures, net sizes, minimum fish sizes and closed or restricted zones.
Nevertheless - and here is the rub - control systems are essential, because they are designed to ensure that fishing activities respect and comply with the conservation measures that have been adopted.
Unfortunately, what we are seeing today is that the effectiveness and the quality of fisheries control is unequal and leaves a great deal to be desired.
There are activities that are controlled effectively and others that are completely uncontrolled.
Progress has certainly been made, but as everyone is saying, it is inadequate.
Control and the concomitant sanctions, says the report, vary so much between Member States that the final result is biased towards the quite unfair treatment of the fishermen of various countries, which is damaging to the reliability and the acceptance of Community regulations as well as to respect for them.
Under these circumstances, it is crucial to put the finishing touches to the instruments for controlling Community fisheries in the areas of vigilance, inspection and implementation.
I should like, lastly, to encourage the Commissioner to give commitments and make adjustments that make his proposal for reform, which is so controversial, acceptable to all the Members States.
We sincerely hope that an agreement can be concluded by the end of this year and that we do not sink into a mess of poorly defined regulations.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission communications and the reports by Mr Busk and Mrs Attwooll show that the common fisheries policy is a giant with feet of clay!
The Commission has considerable political and legislative power over the CFP but its instruments are relatively weak, as the Commission itself must acknowledge.
There are evident shortcomings in the CFP's financial resources and in the management of its implementation.
Furthermore, there is a considerable disparity between the monitoring of each State and the sanctions applicable to the same irregular activities, which gives rise to a degree of suspicion about the CFP itself.
This shortfall in instruments is also seen in the lack of staff and financial resources, in the participation of regional fisheries organisations and in the issue of agreements with third countries as well as in the scientific study of fish stocks, a field in which the Commission does not have a credible system.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think it would be better to start the reform of the CFP by giving the Commission the necessary financial management instruments, establishing equal access to Community waters and to catches, whilst respecting the principle of sustainable development.
Mr President, firstly I would like to begin by reading a short speech by my colleague, Mrs Langenhagen, who cannot be with us this evening.
In her words, "This week the Danish Presidency took off and regarding fisheries it will be a difficult task.
We are at a crossroads and unfortunately we are late.
Have a look at the fish stocks in our waters and you will see that there is no time to be lost.
In my opinion the two reports we are discussing now show clearly the need for action.
There is a lack of cooperation in some Member States, and that hinders proper implementation of the CFP.
Controls must be strengthened, sanctions must be established with the same level overall in the EU.
I am therefore convinced that with this reform of the CFP, Europe has to regain credibility.
A major reform will only be successful if the men on board understand what Brussels imposes and believe in the success of the measures to be taken.
Clearly we also want to fish in the next decade and beyond, so let us join forces and find the right solution."
I will now continue in my own words.
The rapporteur, Mr Busk, has done an excellent job, as has Mrs Attwooll, in writing these reports.
I commend them for their worthwhile and committed efforts.
However, to use an English phrase, these measures are akin to closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.
We are only being forced to introduce such drastic measures thanks to the total failure of the CFP.
It is now widely accepted that this policy has been an unmitigated disaster and to a large extent has led to the environmental and economic catastrophe we now find ourselves in.
I accept and support the need for the immediate implementation of checks and monitoring of the fishing fleets in European waters.
We must use all the measures available, particularly satellite technology, and this must be rigorously and evenly enforced by all Member States if it is to have any effect.
The Commission has recommended that 6- and 12-mile limits should be retained in order to protect sensitive inshore fisheries.
It is interesting to note that in the original draft to the CFP reform proposals, which were widely leaked in March, the Commission stated that 6- and 12-mile limits should become a permanent feature of the CFP without any time limitation.
That was how it put it.
Now mysteriously that has disappeared to be replaced by a simple reaffirmation of the need for 12-mile limits.
Despite Mr Fischler's assurances that he did not succumb to the bullying by Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, it seems that Spanish threats to take the Commission to court over open-access agreements may have borne fruit.
These changes are hugely disappointing and hugely worrying.
I would welcome an explanation as to why they occurred.
It is essential that we see real management responsibility with the 12-mile limits given back to the Member States involved.
Greater responsibility for conservation management measures and enforcement relating to all those vessels of any nationality operating within those zones must fall to Member States.
As far as the controversial issue of discards is concerned, it is time to sort out this whole sorry mess once and for all.
We cannot continue the policy which leads to overall 2 million tonnes of healthy fish - 25% of all fish caught in the EU - being dumped dead back into the sea every year.
UK fishermen are outraged at discards, which continually account for nearly 50% of catches.
Much of this problem can be traced to the way in which we operate TACs and quotas.
Let us be clear about this. TACs and quotas were introduced in the CFP, not for conservation purposes, but to aid in the process of sharing out fishing rights.
However, there are many who would argue that "fair" is not a word that can be applied to the CFP.
When the UK entered the CFP in 1972, the agreement which we reached was a body blow to the British fishing industry.
In closing, in many people's eyes the CFP is drinking in the last-chance saloon.
There is too much at stake to get it wrong a second time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteurs of both these reports for their hard work.
There are many types of behaviour which infringe or could infringe the rules of the common fisheries policy, and it is a fact that actions constituting infringements may be somewhat hazy both due to the lack of information by the Member States and the lack of points of reference and possibilities of comparing markers, and also to difficulties in interpreting and reading information, given the lack of data on infringements proposed, fleet size, most effective control mechanisms and resources, etc.
While accepting the need for a certain amount of flexibility in interpreting rules and assessing behaviour, I believe now is the time to back reinforced cooperation between the various national inspection authorities, in order to provide information on penalties for infringements committed and also to back truly dissuasive, efficient, effective penalties, equal treatment and also to back a brave decision to prevent the entry of the products of illegal fishing into the European Union.
The most serious infringement procedures concern illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, which is detrimental to the protection of fisheries resources and also penalises fishermen who do not commit infringements, the perpetrators of which - I mean the illegal fishermen - are undeterred by the pecuniary or monetary fine and still make a profit from their illegal activity, and are not discouraged from continuing to fish illegally.
In conclusion, we must achieve an effective control, application and notification system, as stated in recital A, but this system will inevitably require of the Member States a spirit of mutual trust and accountability and an equal commitment to notifying infringements securely and effectively.
Commissioner, taking the opportunity to reform the CFP to this end would make European Union actions more transparent and effective.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports which are the subject of this debate both deal with the implementation of the common fisheries policy.
I greatly welcome the fact that you, Mr Busk, and the Committee on Fisheries support the Commission's report on the monitoring of the implementation of the common fisheries policy.
We all agree that controls and the enforcement of the legislation are key themes in the common fisheries policy.
However, the improvements made by the Member States in their systems of monitoring and enforcement are still very patchy, and so the fishermen quite rightly feel that they are treated unequally in different parts of the Community.
Within the Member States, there is unequal competition, and there are wide variations in Member States' sanction procedures.
We have followed Parliament's debate on this report very closely, and I note your recommendations.
During the second half of this year, I will be submitting to the Commission an Action Plan for more cooperation in control and enforcement and on common fisheries inspection.
The purpose of this Action Plan, as well as achieving more effective monitoring and enforcement, is primarily to ensure more uniform implementation of the common fisheries policy.
In your report, you call for a list of sanctions to be drawn up.
The Commission welcomes this.
Your suggestion is based on the proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy. As soon these are adopted, we will submit such a list to Parliament and to the Council.
As regards Mrs Attwooll's report, I would like to express my thanks for her positive statement on our communication.
Mrs Attwooll, your words clearly show that Parliament and the Commission are pulling together on the issue of a standard procedure to deal with infringements and on the call for uniform sanctions.
The purpose of our communication was to compare, in a transparent way, how the provisions of the common fisheries policy are adhered to and what procedures are adopted in the event of infringements.
Such infringements include, for example, non-compliance with the licence provisions, permitted fishing equipment, or the issue of landing and controls.
When drawing up our first communication, we faced a number of fundamental problems: firstly, the majority of Member States submitted their data far too late and not in the required format, which made computer processing far more difficult.
Secondly, one Member State, namely France, initially preferred not to submit any data at all.
Thirdly, some of the information submitted by some Member States was incomplete.
Today, I can put on record that all Member States have now come into line with the stipulations of Commission Regulation 2740/99.
However, the approach that was initially adopted naturally makes a comparison of the situations in the Member States very difficult.
Nonetheless, based on the information submitted to us, we can draw the following conclusions: firstly, the majority of infringements relate to fishing without a fishing licence for a specific zone.
Secondly, in some Member States, infringements are prosecuted under criminal law, whereas in others, they are dealt with solely by administrative means.
Thirdly, there are major differences in the penalties imposed by the various Member States.
Often, the penalties are simply not designed to be a deterrent.
We have therefore put forward targeted proposals as part of the reform of the CFP.
We need uniform regulations on the enforcement of the common fisheries policy.
The sanctions must be effective and must also be such as to deprive the transgressor of the profit accrued through the infringement, and we need measures to prevent repeated and serious violations.
Furthermore, when we drafted the communication on infringements brought to light in 2001, the majority of Member States did not submit their reports on time on that occasion either.
For this reason, the Commission was itself unable to adhere to the deadline for the second communication, namely 1 June 2002.
The call for Parliament to be informed in future by 15 April if Member States fail to comply with their reporting duty is something that I gladly support.
I hope that we can pursue this approach so that the public finds out which Member States are meeting their responsibilities, and which are failing to do so.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Fortunately, the Van Lancker report, which has just been adopted by the European Parliament (in spite of my vote against it) has no legal value.
It has no hesitation in interfering in the areas of competence of the Member States, and even in those of the candidate countries, giving advice on sex education and on legalising abortion.
In terms of form, the text employs typical methods to extend European competences.
Last night, Commissioner Byrne explained that, of course, 'sexual and reproductive rights' are not strictly speaking included in the treaties, but that, on the other hand, 'reproductive health' may be linked to public health in general, for which the Community has a few additional competences.
In any case, in the absence of any genuine control of subsidiarity, the European institutions are free to say whatever they like.
In terms of content, the Van Lancker report has dealt with the sensitive subject of abortion too superficially.
Each country must be able to decide on the basis of its own values and its own approach.
In any event, although we can accept that States cannot prevent abortion, it is difficult to recommend that they cheerfully give it the green light.
. (ES) First of all I would like to say that I consider it a serious political error that the Conference of Presidents has authorised the production of a report which clearly violates the principle of subsidiarity, especially when there is about to be a referendum in Ireland.
This is one of the reasons why I have voted against.
The European Union does not have competence in the field of sexual or reproductive health - as Commissioner Byrne clearly reminded us yesterday - which falls to the Member States.
This is shown by the fact that the report does not make legislative proposals but restricts itself to making recommendations to the governments of the Member States and the candidate countries.
But above all I have voted against the report because I do not agree in any way with its proposals.
The value of human life must be preserved and not destroyed.
It is one thing to promote appropriate sexual information programmes, family planning and contraception advice and sexual health services, and it is quite another to recommend the legalisation of abortion.
The right to life takes precedence over any other right, including women's rights, and its defence must be the main objective of the policies implemented by public authorities.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Gender equality programme (2001-2005)
The next item is the report (A5-0197/2002) by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the application of the gender equality work programme (2001-2005) [2001/2266(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the positive steps taken in the legislative area to promote equality between men and women, many shortcomings, inequalities and forms of discrimination still remain in the differing practices of the States Members, which must be resolved.
Following the adoption in 2000 of the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women and of the respective Community action programme for 2001 to 2005, there has been an effort to involve all Community policies and all Commission departments in this strategy, which has already produced some positive practical results.
We need to go further, however.
It is unacceptable, for example, that the Community institutions themselves, including the European Convention now running, comprise less than 20% women, in other words, an even lower percentage than that of the previous Convention drafting the Charter on Fundamental Rights.
It is particularly important that the implementation of the guidelines, directives, recommendations and resolutions aimed at the promotion of equality by the various Member States be monitored decisively in order to ensure that the decisions taken in the sphere of policy on equality of rights and opportunities are better implemented and that they are also effectively applied in national equal rights and opportunities policy.
For example, therefore, with regard to the objective set at the Lisbon Council of ensuring that 60% of women are part of the active population by 2010, it is reaffirmed that this target will only contribute to equality of opportunities for men and women if the majority have quality and properly paid jobs, stressing the importance of various forms and methods of training, and the establishment of a sufficient number of facilities for the care of children and dependent persons and by promoting diversification of the career choices open to girls.
Hence also the importance of the implementation of the Council recommendation of 31 March 1992.
It is not enough for the Commission to say that it adopted the report on this implementation on 4 February 1998.
Four years have now passed and we need to know the current state of play, focusing on the importance of establishing common indicators as regards childcare structures and the disparity in wages and other forms of income between men and women, by sector, with regard inter alia to atypical forms of work and part-time work.
It is equally important to insist on the conclusion of research on the causes and means adopted and to be adopted by the various Member States in order to combat the disparity in wages which still exists (of around 15% to 20%), despite the 1975 directive on equal treatment as regards pay.
Precise quantitative and temporal objectives must also be included in the employment guidelines, which are already in the process of being revised, and the Commission must submit a report on the matter, specifically on the measures to be adopted.
There is also an urgent need to establish goals to be achieved in realistic and measurable stages in the fields of intervention envisaged in the Community framework strategy on gender equality, in order to ensure real practical progress in all areas, bearing in mind that there are still many infringements of legislation on equal treatment between men and women.
With regard to the new directive being prepared on gender equality in sectors other than employment opportunities and which the Commission promised to submit before June, this must not be subject to any further delay.
We must also insist on making improvements in line with other existing directives, specifically those concerning the safety and health at work of women who are pregnant, or have recently given birth or are breastfeeding and the equal treatment of men and women in legal and professional social security schemes.
The central issue is the need to work for the integration of the prospect of equality between men and women in economic guidelines, not least in the accession process, with a view to preventing any adverse effects on gender equality of the processes of privatisation, liberalisation and cuts in public expenditure in the social sectors, and we must reaffirm that quality public services are essential, and call for an increase in the budget allocation in the social sphere in order to prevent social exclusion and to combat trafficking in women.
Lastly, I wish to thank everyone who worked on drafting this report, and I am convinced that the success of the fight for equal opportunities for men and women, not least in political life and in decision-making bodies, depends also on the greater involvement and political will of us all, both men and women.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her work on the application of the gender equality work programme, since, as she has said and as we say continually in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we still need to carry on working to achieve equality in most fields, such as equal pay and equal opportunities, despite the fact that this Chamber constantly receives reports of all types covering a wide range of legislation.
We need to continue with this work and to insist that the programme is complied with; we must be familiar with the data and possess better information on the implementation of the programme.
It would be very helpful to our work if the data were given for each country.
That is something we have asked for many times and which is crucial if the work is to be based on real data and if it is to be more effective.
As the report states, it is also important to achieve the objectives proposed at the Lisbon European Council, for women to represent 60% of the active population, not forgetting the significant number of women who work in small family-owned businesses, with no recognition of any kind for their work and with no social protection.
That is a problem we should address in the near future, as the number of women in this situation in areas such as agriculture, fishing and small companies is highly significant.
These are specific gender-related problems which arise in various fields, but which are extremely important.
This report calls for a solution to be found.
Gender is also very important in terms of social exclusion and poverty.
We should therefore welcome the fact that the Danish Presidency has included this in its programme in order to be able to make progress in solving these problems.
I also genuinely hope that the proposal for a directive on equality based on Article 13 of the Treaty will be presented here.
I also hope that the establishment of the Institute for Equality between men and women, which I am pleased to see the feasibility report has already approved, will not be postponed.
Commissioner, on behalf of my Group I insist that this work must continue as quickly as possible.
The work programme 'Equal Opportunities' for the year 2002 is an excellent document.
It effectively outlines the actions taken by the Commission and the strategy adopted.
During a meeting of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities of this Parliament in April, Commissioner Diamantopoulou explained this strategy once again in the penetrating and convincing manner that is so characteristic of her.
We very much appreciated the dialogue that was initiated at the time.
I should particularly like to mention the initiative to develop policy within the gender dimension of foreign policy.
The Commissioner might be able to inform us of the latest on this score.
On a more general note, it should be mentioned in my view that the European Commission is currently ahead in the way it tackles gender mainstreaming.
Many a Member State, but also the European Parliament, could take a leaf out of its book.
I should like to single out a number of elements from the report by Mrs Figueiredo that is before us.
First of all, I should like to turn my attention to paragraph 3 of her report, the issue of the so-called 'Gender Institute', which is, by the way, a strange term on which we should be able to improve.
We learnt about the feasibility study on the subject of an Institute which collates and disseminates information, supports networks, and so on.
In short, it fulfils a broker role, and the implication is that it could be useful to give women's issues a more political dimension in Europe and to support the professional content of our work.
My question to the Commission is whether it shares this idea and would like to develop this further.
Above all, would it like to ask Parliament for advice on this and if so, what is the timeframe it envisages?
I am of the opinion that there are many people in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities who are keen on the idea of an Institute, but would first like to see more concrete plans on the table before they can give their final verdict.
My question is therefore: will the Commission produce such a plan?
My second question pertains to paragraph 5.
Can the Commission give assurances that it will draft a political analysis of the state of implementation by the Member States of the equal treatment acquis and of its intentions to amend this legislation, if necessary, or to start treaty inbox procedures?
Finally, I should like to echo the request already made by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, and ask when the Commission will now finally produce its draft directive on equal treatment for which we have been waiting an awfully long time?
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for carrying out such tireless work in this area.
The outcome is not of course dependent upon the Commissioner for Equality alone. It is dependent to the very highest degree upon the whole of the Commission, and I am completely convinced that, in our present Commissioner, we have an extremely good spokesperson for equality.
It is not so easy to get a programme such as this accepted, and the reason for that is clear enough, there being only five female Commissioners out of a total of twenty.
We are all aware, then, that we are under the critical threshold for getting things through, so there is cause for thanking the Commissioner for being so indefatigable.
If we are to criticise anyone, it is in any case not our Commissioner. Rather, it is the men in the Commission to whom we should be addressing our attention.
Having said that, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the brilliant report she has presented here.
I think, in general, that it is one of our very major tasks to continue to keep these issues on the agenda.
The EU is a political project which therefore applies to both men and women. For that reason, it is important that we always be careful to involve the other half of the population, namely women.
That being said, we must of course also distinguish between matters to which the principle of subsidiarity should apply and those which are matters of overarching concern.
In common with previous rapporteurs, I would also enquire after the Equality Institute.
It is becoming ever more obvious that we shall have a shortage of data if there is a lack of people, for example in the EU, who are able to collect, and so coordinate, national data.
Then, there is the issue of subsidiarity, which is also mentioned in the report in connection with important areas, such as childcare arrangements, in which efforts need to be made. Without such efforts, women will not be able to enter the labour market.
This is an area to which I still regard the principle of subsidiarity as applying. It is an area in which we can merely point to best practice and, in reality, only issue exhortations about rather than enter directly into.
Mr President, firstly I echo Mrs DybkjÃŠr's comments and thank the Commissioner also for her work.
On behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what is a very comprehensive and fair balance of criticism for the shortcomings in the Commission's work, praise for the achievements of the work programme and also constructive suggestions for work in the future.
The support that the report received in committee was a reflection of this.
We are only too aware, as other speakers have said, that we have a long way to go in terms of gender equality within the EU institutions, as well as in society as a whole.
We could not have a clearer reflection of this than the make-up of the Convention on the future of Europe.
Only 16% of the members are women on a body which is directly involved in planning the whole future of Europe.
This report addresses the means of achieving gender equality in the labour market, employment, decision-making, social inclusion, lifelong learning, health and so on. The rapporteur has addressed these issues in a very focused way and gives very clear guidelines to the Commission on the kind of measures that Parliament would like to see adopted.
In terms of actions for 2002, I would particularly like to welcome the Commission's commitment to providing gender-specific data, gender progress indicators and gender impact assessments in policy areas that have not yet been mainstreamed.
We know that this information is essential when forming and assessing equality legislation.
Time and time again in reports and opinions we have condemned the lack of appropriate data on which to base our analyses.
This has to be addressed now, as other speakers have said.
I would also like to mention some of the new Commission proposals noted in this report, such as the conference on rural women to be held in October.
This is extremely important given the crisis that many of our rural areas have suffered, particularly in the past 18 months and the specific needs of women who live and work in rural areas.
Equality in foreign policy and international relations is again a vital issue.
The proposed conference could not only draw attention to this but give us a better understanding of its significance in all of our international work.
As Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea said, gender should be central to the round-table discussion on social exclusion and poverty.
The work programme for 2002 is more developed and ambitious than this year and hopefully on the basis of this report we can make significant progress.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
I must start by saying that I fully share the regret expressed by other female colleagues at the sadly symbolic, worrying fact that, despite the many good intentions expressed, of the members of the European Convention planning the future of Europe and therefore the future of the rights of European citizens - both men and women - only 16% are women, which I feel is a genuinely disturbing figure.
Nevertheless, it is worth calling strongly for the achievement of a number of fundamental objectives, strongly underscored in the report, which would help to secure more tangible and, above all, better opportunities for European women.
I am referring, in the first place, to the need for an evaluation report to be drawn up assessing compliance by the Member States with all the legislative texts adopted - resolutions, recommendations and directives - in order to assess regularly the extent to which these texts are being implemented by the Member States and, if necessary, instigate any appropriate infringement proceedings in the event of failure to transpose or respect them.
This would enable us to keep the situation more under control, making the Member States accountable and taking more effective measures to secure all the conditions necessary for a more balanced participation of women both in the work place and in government, while attempting, moreover, to promote a responsible social assistance policy for working women - in other words, facilities for the care of children and dependent persons - so as to make it genuinely possible for women to reconcile professional and family life.
For the reasons I have attempted briefly to outline, our group will vote for the report.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have heard much that is on the credit side, but a number of drawbacks have been enumerated, and there I would like to join in.
The report shows that much is left to be desired in terms of practical application one and a half years after the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women came into effect.
Action in the areas of social rights, economic life and participation and representation has produced nothing in the way of positive outcomes, as the difference in income between women and men in the private sector is still around 25%.
Only 23% of entrepreneurs are women.
The proportion of women involved in decision-making processes scarcely reaches 30% in most countries, and the institutions of the European Union, with women represented in between 13% and 30% of positions, are not exactly the best of examples.
We have already heard how the composition of the Convention plays its part in this.
If we are to make demands of the Member States, we should be going on ahead and setting the best possible example.
Not only are the EU's existing directives on the equality of men and women in need of improvement, they also need to be better transposed in the Member States.
This also means better monitoring by the Commission, so that equality will work; otherwise, it strikes me as nothing but a farce if directives exist and we are constantly having to check to see that progress is being made with their implementation.
Mr President, may I congratulate and thank Mrs Figueiredo and, of course, the Committee on Women's Rights as a whole for their most welcome support, their proposals and, of course, their criticism.
I should like to comment on some of the issues discussed which are especially important but on which no headway has been made.
Several lady members referred to the question of infrastructures and childcare and care for all those who, in many cases, are dependent on their family.
Of course this is an issue for the Member States alone but there is always room, not for intervention, but for help from the Commission and cooperation at European level in order to achieve added value.
So may I remind you of what has been done so far: first, the strategy on employment contains one of the four approaches to gender equality.
It focuses mainly on the question of infrastructures and provides important funding for several Member States.
Last year, following our evaluation of the implementation of the strategy on employment, 8 of the 15 Member States were specifically advised that they needed to improve their childcare facilities.
Although there are a few exceptions, most Member States refuse to set quantitative targets which would be easy to monitor.
Nonetheless, we have seen a net improvement year on year under the strategy on employment.
The second issue is statistical monitoring; again this has not exactly been a success at European level.
We are now working closely with Eurostat so that, with the new manpower research, childcare will also be included in the statistics.
The definition has been discussed at length, the situation is not the same in all the Member States, but I feel that it is very important for these data to be included in the official statistics, together with the question of gender-related pay differentials.
A second issue raised by a number of honourable Members is the Institute.
I have been asked if I agree with it.
We have, I think, discussed this issue in committee on numerous occasions.
Of course I think we need this Institute.
As you know, we commissioned a study and have already received the results; we have scientific confirmation of the need for this Institute and an initial estimate of its budgetary requirements and financial conditions and I have already been in correspondence with the President.
I would remind you, if I may, of the overall difficulties inherent in setting up a new institution.
I put this question to the last Council of Employment Ministers and I must say that several countries reacted positively and supported the need to set up this Institute.
The rest expressed no opinion whatsoever.
No Member State has yet spoken out against the Institute.
I should like to reassure you that I for one shall be taking decisive action to bring about a final decision.
A third issue raised was the application of legislation in the Member States.
Here, as with other issues, such as the job market and the entire legal framework on working conditions, the Commission has objective difficulties in monitoring the application of legislation.
It does not have the mechanisms it needs in order to monitor what is happening on the ground in the Member States.
So it works at two levels.
At one level, which I would call the relatively easy level, it checks that the Member States have adopted the legislative framework needed and have done so properly while, at the second level, the Commission takes immediate action, using every means of recourse to the Court available, if it receives reports that the law is not being applied.
My final comment refers to planning for 2002 in general.
I think we have made significant progress, especially on how we operate.
This year, all the planning dossiers will take account of gender equality ex ante, at the programming stage, not ex post, during evaluation.
Secondly, we are still collecting gender-based data at all levels, which is helping enormously in developing indicators and, thirdly, one of the priorities which we set in motion this year is special staff training on gender equality in all the Directorates-General, especially for anyone involved in planning and programming.
During the last two years' working together, we have made significant progress in the legislative sector, our crowning achievement being the recent agreement on legislation on gender equality. This establishes a very important basis and will be a huge help with the new proposal on gender equality in all sectors based on Article 13.
I have one political comment. I think this is a very important and very hard-hitting directive, which is why we are making every effort to ensure the text is as well processed and substantiated as possible, so that it will help the debate move in the right direction right from the start.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have received another communication from the Commission on developing the local dimension in the European Employment Strategy.
I believe this to be extraordinarily important and have tried to develop these approaches in my report.
There is an unfortunate tradition within employment policy which involves thinking in national terms, i.e. in terms of national labour markets and economies, and viewing the labour market as one single market.
However, this ignores the local labour markets, the differences between them and their significance.
There is also a tendency for local labour markets to become a kind of leftover concept referring to rural areas or weak sections of the economy and the social economy.
In my report, I use a different definition of local labour markets, i.e. labour markets producing goods and services which are consumed locally.
This covers care staff and craftsmen, people who work in transport and technical services, local businessmen, small businesses, local public services, etc., and also includes vital infrastructure in the form of education, etc. These are therefore important elements we are talking about, including in economic terms.
The area is also interesting due to its having a kind of counter-cyclical economic significance.
Local labour markets are affected to a lesser extent by the fluctuating fortunes of the world market.
This means that during a period like the present one, with a sluggish world economy, local markets manage best, relatively speaking.
If the economy is to bring itself out of the current decline, it is particularly important for local labour markets to be functioning well, as they constitute the bed from which new companies will grow and new activities can be developed.
I would also like to emphasise the importance of these local labour markets.
In my report, I point out that they constitute at least 30% of total employment.
This proportion may be higher, depending on how one calculates the figure.
As such, it is not a question of marginal problems, but of an economically extremely large, significant and important element of the overall employment policy.
I must also stress that these local labour markets are incredibly important for quality of life and social welfare in various ways.
These labour markets are dominated by women, which is extremely important in terms of employment: if we are to promote and increase employment, employment of women, in particular, must be improved.
Furthermore, these are, more often than not, the labour markets onto which young people first come after finishing their schooling and the labour markets generally most easily accessed by those who are new to the labour market.
The local labour market therefore has an important function as a bridge to other parts of the labour market.
Finally, the local labour market is vital to the establishment of major industrial companies, perhaps even multinational companies, in the local social structure, contributing high-quality staff to those companies which need to compete at international level.
As you can see, there are many strong social and economic reasons for focusing more on local labour markets.
Within EU Member States, there is a great deal of regional and local variation, which suggests that there is much that can be done.
I would like to stress that this is as much a question of city and urban areas as of other areas.
In the large cities, one can see major local differences between poor immigrant districts and the districts of the rich and between the labour markets linked to these.
Many of the social problems which arise are reflected in the employment situation.
Finally, I would like to comment on the three amendments which have been submitted.
I have proposed local partnerships which are open to many different types of actor. The proposers of Amendment No 1 wish to remove a number of these actors, which is something I do not understand.
Perhaps I will receive an explanation later in this debate.
In Amendment No 2, I advocate quantitative guidelines for education policy, about which, not surprisingly, opinion may be divided.
I have no objections to Amendment No 3, but am happy to support it.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the other political groups for their excellent cooperation in the committee with regard to this important area.
Mr President, this report received a unanimously favourable vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which demonstrates not only the consensus on the importance of strengthening the local dimension of the European Employment Strategy, but also the value of the work of the rapporteur, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate.
This initiative proposes developing local labour markets in order to achieve high levels of efficiency and quality with regard to job creation and to deal with aspects such as gender equality, the social dimension, economic development, innovation and the information society, as I have stated in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
It is becoming increasingly necessary to adopt measures that involve incentives and action in the field of economic and social cohesion, paying special attention to the least-developed regions with structural weaknesses and to the most badly-affected groups.
In order to achieve these objectives, the proper coordination of National and Local Action Plans is crucial, and these must clearly indicate the role and the level of participation of local authorities, so that the training and the information provided for all actors involved contributes to the improved organisation of the measures to be adopted.
Equally, the Member States must involve local employment agencies in the processes of decentralising the European Employment Strategy, given the physical proximity of these bodies and their better knowledge of the situations of the local labour markets.
Women must be both agents and beneficiaries of local employment strategies.
Local businesses (as employers) and social partners can and must help to promote career opportunities for women and to reconcile work and family life at company level, for example, through flexible working hours and tax and social security aspects, and the implementation of directives and agreements concluded in this field must, in particular, be speeded up.
In order to achieve the objective of equal opportunities within the European Employment Strategy, we must strengthen the financial instruments of Community initiatives, such as EQUAL, the European Social Fund, the ERDF, and in local actions.
Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to Mr Schmid on a very good report on the Commission communication 'Strengthening the local dimension of the European Employment Strategy?.
Having been the rapporteur on Parliament's guidelines on employment policy in 2000, I take pleasure in referring to what we in the plenary decided almost unanimously at the end of 1999. We decided that "the special role and responsibility of local and regional authorities, other partners at the regional and local levels, as well as the social partners, needs to be more fully recognised and supported.
In addition, the role of the Public Employment Services in identifying local employment opportunities and improving the functioning of local labour markets, should be fully exploited."
The call for Territorial Employment Pacts, sometimes couched in rather nebulous terms in the Commission document, is supplemented in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by the demand for the creation of employment pacts between the social partners in enterprises.
I was recently convinced by an example in my constituency of how successfully an attempt of this sort can work.
The BÃŒrkert works in Ingelfingen were saved by this.
There is a need for a binding guarantee of employment to be agreed in return for workers waiving their rights to certain benefits.
This will be significantly improved by the incorporation of the local dimension into the European employment strategy.
What this is about is European coordination of national employment policies while incorporating also their local counterparts, the objective being a joint strategy to tap society's potential for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.
This is about subsidiary solutions that harmonise flexibility and social security.
The right formula for the European employment strategy is 'think globally, act locally? and it is with that in mind that we want to support Mr Schmid's report.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Schmid for his work.
The Commission communication, which I consider to be extremely positive, follows the consultation process launched by the Commission in 2000 on 'Acting locally for employment?, which involved a large number of actors at European, national and local levels and confirmed the opinion that Parliament had expressed on a number of occasions in the past. It also tallied with the positions of the Commission regarding the necessity and importance of making good use of local actors.
If we want to achieve the goal set by the Heads of State and Government at Lisbon of implementing a European employment strategy which will achieve full, high quality employment while promoting social cohesion by 2010, there is no doubt that we need to give due consideration to, make use of and support the efforts being made by actors at local level, and to tailor our involvement to the sphere in which they are operating.
To this end, we need to urge the Member States to follow the recommendations we have consistently provided at European level, namely partnership, support for local employment projects and support for all the actors - whether social bodies or non-governmental or 'third sector' organisations - giving primary responsibility to the public institutions.
I feel that we really must continue, as we are doing with this communication, to call upon the Member States to ensure through the European employment strategy and the launching of national plans that the local actors are listened to, for it is local officials who have to respond in person to the daily challenges represented by the new demands for job creation and use of mobility instruments and life-long training instruments, which are crucial to the achievement of this objective.
I will end by pointing out that the forum which the Commission has undertaken to organise for next year would appear essential.
Secondly, in my own view and in the opinion of the Socialist Group, the amendments tabled are superfluous and run counter to the spirit of unity which characterised the vote on the Communication in committee.
We would therefore like the text adopted in committee to remain in its current form.
Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish first of all to extend a big thank-you to Mr Herman Schmid for the splendid work he has done on his report.
We have political disagreements about a lot of things but, when it comes to making the open coordination of employment policy more transparent, we stand shoulder to shoulder, and I would especially thank Mr Schmid for clearly pointing out that the employment strategy must not only be a process driven from the top but also a process developed from below and involving everyone practically engaged on employment policy.
We know that it is at local level that large parts of employment policy are implemented. It is here that experience is accumulated and knowledge acquired, and it is here that there is a practical sense of what will be effective in achieving the objective of higher employment.
That is why it is crucial to amass local experience.
I should like to say to the Commission how pleased I am at the way that local efforts have been incorporated in the context of the Social Fund.
The Commission has promised to keep us up to date on the utilisation of the appropriations at local and regional levels in the framework of Article 6 of the European Social Fund, for which EUR 40 million have been set aside for this year and next year.
We shall hold the Commission to that promise.
It is important for Parliament to monitor developments within this high-priority area.
I am also looking forward to a situation in which open coordination involves local and regional levels and in which the new National Action Plans and Joint Employment Report tell us what is happening at those levels.
To these issues, I would add that of the Commission's making more active efforts to obtain information from local and regional authorities.
The objective of open coordination is not just that a few experts, officials and high-ranking politicians should meet and confirm each other in the view that we have a good policy.
No, the open coordination of employment policy should be aimed at giving elected representatives a better basis for decision-making and voters more knowledge of the options we have in the area of employment policy.
Mr President, local society feels the scourge of unemployment and under-employment most acutely, especially in areas of poor economic growth where, as production is cut back, workers have trouble surviving.
Greece has over 11% unemployment, the hardest hit being the young, with one in three under the age of 25 unemployed, and there are areas in which there is over 40 or 50% unemployment or under-employment.
The aim of these proposals is not to combat this tragic phenomenon but to bring employment and social agencies and local authorities within the liberal policy of the European Union.
The aim is to turn local authorities into structures which operate according to private-sector economic criteria and help destabilise labour relations, break collective agreements and erode workers' rights.
These proposals undermine the labour movement and increase the potential for big business to drive a wedge in, creating artificial divisions and posing false dilemmas.
They are an attempt to protect the monopolies' obscene profits from the grass-roots protest and opposition being pumped up by barbaric capitalism and cruel liberal policies.
We categorically oppose these policies and are fighting alongside the workers for local authorities and local social agencies for the masses which express the real interests of the people and which the workers can use to weather the neo-liberal storm.
Mr President, the human measure is the measure that befits employment.
The paradigm of economic growth, on the other hand, is an abstraction, with little relevance in practice.
Recent developments have shown an increase in unemployment, but the people behind the statistics, losing jobs and income, are being overlooked.
The report by Mr Schmid tries to keep sight of the human element behind the abstraction of employment policy.
I should like to make two comments on this human measure in the employment strategy.
First of all, I set great store by the fact that the resolution stresses the power of local employment plans.
In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur points out that the local labour market is stable and less sensitive to the economic cycle.
From my own experience as a member of the Capelle-aan-den-Ijssel municipal council, I can report that local employment policy is effective.
This does, however, make me wonder about Europe's role if local employment policy leads to a stable climate.
Indeed, in this way, a framework is created at European level for the promotion of employment, far removed from the citizens and their regions, and limiting the scope for developing own initiatives in different areas.
Consequently, Europe's role in the local employment strategy is, in my view, restricted and, at most, a coordinating one.
Its role is confined to exchanging experiences with regard to the participation of target groups that are difficult to reach and the role which education has in promoting employment.
Secondly, I should like to draw attention to the effects of the formulated policy.
The aim of promoting labour participation for women and creating equal opportunities for different groups throws up new dilemmas.
Suffice it for me to refer to the impact on families, social contacts, voluntary work and care for others.
It is not sufficient to draw attention to the special significance of high-quality childcare.
The acquired right of women and men to choose a role in caring for the family and extended family, is a great privilege in our western society.
The pressure to take part in the labour process, however, is considerable, and we need to strike a proper balance here.
Participation in the labour process need not preclude care, and providing care in families should also be recognised as work.
Finally, I should like to express my support for this resolution.
European policy on employment should not eclipse local and regional initiatives.
However, European policy should support local initiatives to allow citizens to take part in the labour process, so that work and care tasks can be neatly combined.
I think this would serve people the most.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor this morning as a new and very recent non-attached Member, having been expelled from the Group of the Party of European Socialists at the request of French Socialist Party.
Incidentally, and everyone is well aware of this, as I take the floor to speak on a subject which I believe to be crucially important, that of employment, I am still a man of the Left and a Socialist in the broadest sense of the word.
First of all, I would like to thank the European Commission for its communication which, despite not being revolutionary, contains firm proposals, which are capable of moving things forward in the right direction.
In an ultra-liberal world, this is a very important sign.
I would of course also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Herman Schmid, on the high quality of his work and for the interest and the relevance of many of his proposals to which I subscribe and which have my very strong support.
Since this is the case, I would also like to reiterate just as firmly that, in addition to the firm proposals made by the Commission and those by the rapporteur, the important, essential, even vital thing to do is to put employment back at the heart of everything, and at each and every level.
Whilst employment provides all citizens with a purpose, unemployment, on the other hand, can be devastating, isolating and very often destructive.
In a world where employment is too often considered to be 'an adjustment variable of so-called efficiency and of the very real quest for profit?, it is high time that we re-established our priorities and reaffirmed at all levels that full employment is our number-one goal.
From now on, and because, naturally, there is no miracle cure in the field of employment and since words alone are not enough, we must combine, increase and diversify the initiatives we take at all levels in order to achieve this goal.
What we must do, of course, is take initiatives and introduce regulations at world level.
At European level, we need to pursue an innovative industrial policy, a research policy and a strong social policy.
We must also implement national social policies which put employment above all other considerations.
And developments in recent months have meant that many European countries are further away from reaching this goal.
We must, at long last, devise local policies that involve businesses, local government, associations, trade unions and citizens.
These policies will allow new jobs to be created that are as close to the ground as possible.
They will allow jobs to be created for people who are often on the margins of society or in difficulty.
They will, lastly, allow us to combine jobs, salaries, services and quality of life.
The European Commission and the rapporteur are moving forward along this path by making firm proposals.
I repeat that I subscribe to them and support them, and that we must implement them swiftly now, whilst resisting the temptation to believe that everything can be resolved at local level.
The fight against a rampant form of globalisation, a Europe that is purely liberal and national policies subjected to stock market and finance injunctions affects the success of local employment policies.
I am sure that the rapporteur is aware of these issues, but I wanted to use my speaking time this morning to repeat these very clearly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mr Schmid on his work and on his attitude in including the myriad amendments tabled, which merely aimed to strengthen and extend the ideas regarding the local dimension of employment and its possibilities.
It is true that all work can be considered local, and although the European Employment Strategy has focused on the efforts made at national and European level, it is increasingly accepted that the objective of full employment cannot be achieved without greater involvement and participation at the levels closest to the job-seeker, in other words, at regional or local level, both from the point of view of the job and from that of the workers.
In considering the labour market as a vertical structure from the European, national, regional and local points of view, nobody doubts the role of the local market - perhaps, quantitatively, one-third of total employment - and this local dimension takes on particular significance in rural and peripheral areas.
In this regard, it can and should act as a tool to keep people in certain areas and can play - and I believe it must play - an important role with regard to the most socially vulnerable groups.
Many different types of direct local action for employment, with an immediate impact, are also possible, naturally with the support of the European programmes.
In any event, municipal or local action can open the doors to work in the fight against gender discrimination, as emphasised by Mrs Bastos, or in the fight against social exclusion.
Perhaps all that is needed may be to convince a company - sometimes the largest in a city - that incorporating workers from socially disadvantaged groups into that company is just as important as sponsoring a club - perhaps a football club, since the World Cup has just ended - and also convincing it that this attitude is probably more sensitive and, at least locally, also more profitable, from the point of view of advertising and promotion.
Furthermore, where one or a few companies dominate the labour market in a given sector or area, they have the opportunity to diversify and provide greater guarantees for society as a whole.
Social agents, who need to be convinced, also have an important role to play.
I do not want to end without referring to the importance of the link between local employment initiatives and health and safety at work.
Good communication between the local authorities and other authorities can also be a weapon in the battle to lower the accident rate.
Mr President, I want to address two points here.
One is the question of equal pay and the other is the question of youth employment.
Statistics show that, despite the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation in Europe, nationally and at European level, the gender gap in pay continues to be something like 17% between men and women.
In Ireland it is now 20%, having risen from 18% in 1997.
There is still clearly a problem there and if we are serious about addressing a 60% participation of women in the labour market, we have to address the question of equal pay in the review that is being carried out by the Commission.
I believe that such an approach will encourage voluntary participation by women in the labour market and will hopefully close the gender gap as well.
On the question of youth employment - there are hundred of thousands of young people right across Europe who are excluded from the labour market for all kinds of reasons.
If we are serious about breaking the cycle of poverty in Europe, then we have to address this issue.
We have to do this through action programmes and targets and in a way which engages with them on a one-to-one basis in a multi-disciplinary way to actually break the cycle of exclusion.
Otherwise they will continue to face a lifetime of exclusion and poverty.
Mr President, years ago, the European Commission undertook that it would commit itself to the local dimension of European employment policy.
There were, unfortunately, no additional financial resources; these had to come out of the European Social Fund.
Parliament sees local employment markets as having priority.
They make substantial contributions to improving the conditions under which people work, to improvements in services, in the social economy, in the third sector, both in centres of population and in regions to which access is difficult.
They improve the start-up conditions for new businesses, not only in the regional domestic market, but also at the national and international level.
The under-representation of women, to which Mr De Rossa has referred, means that effective measures need at last to be taken to support them in all positions in businesses.
Integration is being promoted.
Marginalised groups and the socially disadvantaged such as old people, the unemployed, and people with disabilities, find entry into local labour markets easier.
Territorial Employment Pacts, in which towns and local authorities cooperate, are equally noteworthy.
Dialogue is taking place between the social partners.
What is missing, though, is the purposeful exchange of experiences and best practices across national borders.
In order to make more effective use of the potential of local and regional jobs, we need employment strategies by the social partners in enterprises - of which Mr Menrad gave a very good example - and on the part of the authorities.
Aid on the spot can certainly be provided by development agencies, observatories - including via the EU's Socrates and Leonardo programmes - by community initiatives and by the Structural Funds' support of employment services.
The concept of lifelong learning will then help with adaptation to technological change and with the acquisition of new knowledge.
I expressly refer to my fellow MEP Mrs Lulling by supporting the demand in Mr Schmid's very fine report for a marked increase in financial resources for education and for its content to be of the best possible quality.
Mr President, I would also like to add my voice to the chorus of congratulations for Mr Schmid on his excellent report and the superb cooperation in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
In my opinion, the major problem facing the future labour market is that we realise that within quite a short while, we will have a labour shortage across the European Union.
This is already the case in certain sectors.
At the same time, we in the union have a large number of unemployed people who we are unable to use.
This is where the local dimension comes in.
We are drawing up strategies centrally which must be implemented locally if we are to be able to match labour market policy with the requirements we see before us on the labour market.
We must do this in order for the central objectives to be known locally, but also so that we centrally can be aware of the problems facing those on the local labour markets.
I myself come into contact with this.
As chair of the EURES Cross-border Partnership for the Ãresund region, I can communicate our central objectives for labour market policy, as well as listening to the problems seen in local labour markets in a cross-border region.
We must achieve such a balance in the future.
It goes without saying that many actors must be involved at central level, but primarily at local level.
Such actors include both sides of industry, NGOs and organisations for disabled people, in order for us to be able to design programmes for vulnerable groups.
We should also act via the European Social Fund, for I have seen the Social Fund in many cases playing a major role in the local labour market in terms of providing assistance for the strategies which we draw up at central level.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has produced a fine communication and rapporteur has done an excellent job!
As we know, there is no doubting the importance of local labour markets, resources, institutions and authorities to harmonious and sustainable development.
The local level does represent added value, but only if it is allowed to play an effective role in taking decisions that are normally taken at other levels; the local level must not be relegated to being an implementation zone, as unfortunately often happens.
The fact is that there is - and has been with every passing year - an increasing panoply of measures and specific projects to boost employment, which means that all policies functioning at local level, all the main players involved and all the local operators must be integrated without further delay.
Local authorities, because they are the best placed to do so, can and must work as agents for development to encourage partnerships in the fields of tourism, culture, small-scale industry and the environment, participating in setting up joint companies and micro enterprises, involving young people, women and the unemployed.
These are centres of excellence in the field of information, cooperation and training.
I shall finish on this point: the bureaucracy of application procedures must be reduced and access to credit must be made easier.
Mr President, it is clear from what Mr Schmid and the other honourable Members have said that women, the regions and small and medium-sized enterprises will be the forces in the ascendant this century, which is why the Employment Strategy needs to take very serious account of these three factors.
The point of the European Employment Strategy is, of course, to create national action plans on employment and the need for regional and local planning has very quickly become apparent, especially as new conditions on the globalised market and the new definition of isolation - when an area is remote from the centre and when it is not - have changed this dimension with the advent of the information society.
And the new way of thinking about production models and employment and in companies has quickly generated a need for local strategic planning and local action plans on employment.
The Commission engaged in exceptionally broad consultations before proposing this particular communication.
Large conferences were held, one in Strasbourg, attended by delegates from regional authorities, from regional governments throughout Europe, and we have taken account of their views and proposals.
We believe that it is very important for local planning to combine local development objectives with the basic strategic approaches to employment, which are basically one and the same: employability, adaptability, entrepreneurship and equal opportunities.
This will allow us to create a large number of jobs, different standards of jobs and greater cohesion in local societies.
So how can the European Union intervene, how can we combine European planning, the European Employment Strategy, national planning, national action plans on employment and local options?
The European Commission can, of course, intervene with all due respect for subsidiarity and the division of powers and I think that we have already achieved important results, as we have said. First, through initiatives, be it the Equal initiative, the programmes on exclusion, discrimination and, most importantly, the Social Fund, guidelines have been laid down and we have seen entire local action programmes on employment funded by the Community in several countries.
These proposals, also called local initiatives, are the plans we monitor closely, so that we can disseminate knowledge, information and experience.
A second factor is the Commission's support for local agencies wishing to take part in these programmes, so that they can access the corresponding funding mechanisms.
This happens via very specific information networks and an effort, which I know has not yet brought in results, to cut as much red tape as possible, since this often places an exceptionally heavy burden on local action plans and local agencies.
And of course, the Commission is creating new procedural tools to support these local action plans.
I should like to highlight the important part which both national and regional parliaments need to play in national and regional action on employment and which they are not yet doing to the extent we should like.
Generally speaking, I would say that we have encountered a serious problem during our evaluation of the implementation of national action plans, as numerous members have said, with cooperation.
Cooperation with agencies, initiatives, civil society, the social partners; wherever cooperation is needed, it has not taken the form we would have expected.
I think you may be interested to know that a pan-European forum on local employment will be held over forthcoming years, under the Greek Presidency, to take stock of progress made with the programmes on local employment currently being implemented in collaboration with the European Union.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0251/2002) by Mrs Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Gillig, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication entitled 'Promoting core Labour Standards and Improving Social governance in the context of globalisation' (COM(2001) 416 - C5-0162/2002 - 2002/2070(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication has - as you pointed out, Mr President - defined a strategy for promoting core labour standards in the context of globalisation.
So, what does this strategy involve?
First of all, let us reiterate that the core standards in question are those set out in the ILO's Declaration of 1998, identified by the Copenhagen Summit and included in eight of the ILO conventions. They are the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
Although the International Labour Organisation, the ILO, is indeed the body competent to define and negotiate the core labour standards, the European Council of October 1999 reiterated that the Union should strongly support the protection of core labour rights.
The role of the European Union in the WTO has thus been particularly highlighted.
We must, however, note that the difficulties - indeed the impossibility of applying these rather basic rights at world level - are very real.
At the same time, throughout the world, people are condemning a type of economic development that does not go hand in hand with social development and the communication itself notes that 'market governance has developed more quickly than social governance'.
Are we going to leave it at that?
First of all, I would like to welcome the communication as well as the proposals that it makes and point out the benefit and timeliness of launching a debate within our institutions on the relationship between globalisation, labour law and social governance.
The communication also notes that, although market mechanisms and trade liberalisation are essential for development, they alone cannot guarantee development for everyone on this planet.
With regard to core labour standards, this type of globalisation must involve implementing public regulations that are as effective as those implemented for the markets.
The WTO cannot ignore these standards, neither can it be the only body that imposes global regulations.
Nor can it be the organisation that dominates all the other institutions.
With these considerations in mind, we are submitting to you an opinion which is intended to supplement the Commission's proposals.
The opinion is based on some crucial ideas that are developed in the report.
I would like to mention three points which, in my view, are fundamental.
The first point is the importance of defining and clarifying relations between the European Union, the ILO and the WTO.
The major problem of applying core labour standards at world level highlights the lack of coherence, on the one hand, between the approaches of the various institutions, and, on the other hand, the weakness of world governance, its architecture, which is unsuited to today's realities, as well as the lack of common hierarchy of rules between the various world regulatory systems.
To tackle this problem, the report recommends, amongst other things, that the EU-ILO partnership be reviewed and improved - this process is under way, which is to be welcomed; that the ILO obtain observer status at the WTO; that the ILO decisions, particularly the results of its monitoring procedures, be published and that the Union genuinely take them into account in its relations with third countries.
The second guideline action concerns development policies.
The European Union must develop an integrated approach for its policies and encourage a coordinated aid for promoting core labour standards.
Let us take just one example. What is the use of banning child labour if, at the same time, we are not promoting education policies?
What progress have we made on enhancing the right of expression of workers living in a country which is not a democracy or which is not a constitutional state?
Therefore, by using incentive clauses rather than penalty clauses, clauses which do not simply depend on commercial agreements, we call on the European Union to systematically integrate the clause on core labour standards into all agreements with third countries, whatever the area.
Commissioner, I have used an expression, highly prized by feminists, who said that things that are not given a name do not exist.
I think that if core labour standards are not given a name, we will forget them, and they will cease to exist.
The third point relates to stepping up European efforts in its regional work and in the new regulatory areas which are being established throughout the world in order to adapt the promotion of core labour standards to local realities.
The ILO is working on this and genuine synergy might be developed here.
The debate is due to be launched on this issue with representatives of developing countries with the aim of identifying realistic and innovative action plans.
In our view, Commissioner, this communication is a step forward and should herald a change in the working methods that the European Union must develop with third countries, methods which, in particular, show more respect for these countries' problems.
We also hope, Commissioner, that the Council will take up this issue as soon as possible and we call on the Danish Presidency to schedule an examination of the dossier at the next Social Affairs Council meeting.
I would like to conclude, Mr President, by passing on my very sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, especially those who, as part of the four committees which issued opinions, which we tried to integrate as best we could into the report, enabled us, I believe, to produce a better report, and will also, I hope, enable us to achieve a broad consensus.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to congratulate Mrs Gillig and thank the Committee on Employment for adopting most of our proposals.
The Committee on Industry sets great store by respect for core labour standards and considers that the situation can only be improved by maintaining a fairer international trade policy, restricting speculation and reducing foreign debt.
It welcomes any progress made towards recognition of the universal nature of core labour standards but is concerned about the impact of accelerated liberalisation of trade and the financial sector.
The Committee on Industry welcomes the European Commission's moves to place the issue on the agenda of international bodies, in response to calls by the European Parliament and the trade union and citizens' movements, as expressed in Seattle, Genoa and elsewhere.
It notes that no progress was made in Doha and calls on the European Commission to revise its strategy and on the European Union to intensify dialogue with international organisations.
It is in favour of imposing sanctions, especially on transnational companies that profit from failure to observe core labour standards and welcomes the use of the generalised system of preferences.
Our committee also considers that WTO member countries have a particular responsibility to observe core labour standards and calls on the WTO to clearly state that sanctions imposed by the ILO will not be considered incompatible with the WTO treaties.
Finally, we call on the European Commission and the Council to promote compliance with other labour rights, such as social security, the right to stable employment and prevention of accidents at work.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to a number of points in our opinion which I consider are extremely important but which were not adopted by the Committee on Employment.
I have taken the initiative of repeating these points in Amendments Nos 9 to 12, which I urge you to support.
They contain references to fairer trade relations, the imposition of sanctions on transnational companies that profit from failure to observe core labour standards, the need to respect other labour rights and a specific reference to the movements in Seattle, Genoa and so on.
Mr President, first of all, I think we should congratulate Mrs Gillig on this report.
European legislation is often poorly perceived by the public and we therefore demand that greater account be taken of people's interests, particularly to improve social governance and working conditions in the Member States, but also in third countries.
We believe it is rather dangerous to say that the greatest concern is that the recognition of a link between trade and social issues could be abused for protectionist purposes or open the door for increased recourse to trade sanctions.
Some people believe that social issues are still abusive.
Where are they abusive?
When are they abusive?
We can reaffirm that people use work in order to improve their living conditions and not the other way round.
Unfortunately, changes often bring about a deterioration of workers' living conditions.
In the Programme of Action, governments committed themselves to 'safeguarding and promoting respect for basic workers' rights, including the prohibition of forced labour and child labour, freedom of association, freedom to organise and bargain collectively'.
This is an important point.
Slavery is a crime; sexual exploitation is a crime.
It is not work.
And I wanted us to state this even more clearly.
Promoting core labour standards means preventing third countries from being exploited by rich countries.
This is, in my view, how we must understand it.
At the Nice European Council, the European Union endorsed a social agenda which promotes the concept of quality - in employment, in industrial relations, and in working conditions - as the driving force for a thriving and inclusive economy, with more and better jobs.
We are today reaffirming, Mr President, Commissioner, that the universal application of fundamental rights is, obviously, a prerequisite for making progress.
I congratulate my friend and colleague Mrs Gillig as rapporteur.
Her report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is parallel in many ways to mine on corporate social responsibility.
We have worked together to ensure a consistent and complementary set of proposals is put to Parliament, and I should like to thank her very much for that.
On behalf of the Committee on Development, I want to stress four points in particular.
Firstly, whilst we very much welcome the Commission's commitment to the inclusion of core labour standards in the enhanced GSP and in its trade agreements - we have seen evidence of that already in the South Africa trade agreement and the Cotonou Agreement - we stress in paragraph 11 of this resolution that new emphasis must be placed on practical implementation.
For too long the human rights and democracy clauses in the EU's international agreements have committed us to the finest ideals, but they have not been subject to monitoring, reporting and systematic dialogue between the parties.
Such clauses on core labour standards have to become the means to actual enforcement and that is the test for the Commission in following up this communication.
Secondly, as we say in paragraph 12, that implementation has to be part of development cooperation programmes too - not just fine words in country strategy papers but real, quantifiable programmes, assisting developing country governments to establish and operate effective labour inspectorates and giving direct aid to developing country trade unions and other civil society and watchdog groups, to provide an independent voice in tackling abuses such as child and forced labour.
Thirdly, core labour standards are universal.
There must be no exceptions and that means the abuses which are systematically accepted in the massive informal sector in many developing countries, and deliberately encouraged in export-processing zones in many more too, have to come to an end.
Europe has to be part of making that happen.
Finally, specifically on corporate social responsibility, I welcome the Commission's new commitment to promote and enact the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprise in its White Paper this week and I repeat - as we do in paragraph 15 - the ultimate aim is a binding EU code of conduct for multinational enterprise.
Today's vote and report brings that aim one step closer.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication we are debating today contains the strategy by means of which the European Union attempts to make a contribution to social development.
It is positive that this is being done.
Many fear that in the era of globalisation, social development will be compromised.
These days, the bodies that reach agreements are further removed from the average citizen, and become anonymous for that reason alone.
This anonymity leads to discomfort and unrest.
Indeed, the citizen who is positively disposed towards this society has no way of gaining an overall picture.
The Commission has mapped out the relations between the different players in the global society in a clear and readily understood format.
It has listed the mechanisms whereby the European Union, the ILO and the WTO, commit themselves to the promotion of fundamental labour standards and to improving social governance.
As draftsman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I have to tell you that, in our view, the communication does not specifically consider the gender dimension as part of fundamental labour standards and of the acquisition of social sustainability.
It is true that gender forms part of the ILO's core labour standards because the non-discrimination principle and the principle of equal treatment are, after all, enshrined in it.
However, we know that the best economic and social development is that in which women are definitely involved 100%.
This is, in fact, the reason why the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities proposes to incorporate studies on the gender dimension as an instrument.
I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that, where the topic of social partners is discussed, the role of women's organisations is not considered.
This is a failing, because not only within the EU, but also outside it, women are still not being involved enough via the traditional routes to be able to help shape policy.
By way of conclusion, I want to make an urgent appeal to the Commission to improve the excellent communication that is before us with the studies on the gender dimension.
This will give a better insight into the important role to be played by women in social development, and I want to thank Mrs Gillig warmly, not only for her sterling report but certainly also for the way in which she has joined forces with the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Mr President, is it anachronistic, in the face of globalisation's many menacing effects and of increasing adverse developments in labour markets, for us to call on businesses to commit themselves to core labour standards?
Given the direction the economy is increasingly taking, is it acceptable to demand social governance?
We have to do both at the same time if we want to be able to carry the people with us - consumers, workers, and managers alike.
The PPE-DE group, on behalf of which I speak, shares Mrs Gillig's basic thinking.
We attach importance to uniform labour standards, non-discriminatory practices in employment and occupation, the abolition of forced labour, the recognition of the right to collective negotiation and to freedom of association.
We do, however, prefer voluntary schemes in enterprises, provided that there is consistency in the way they are adhered to and assessed, and that they are unmistakably identifiable by means of a seal of approval.
Standards certainly need to be developed for an international system of certification.
It is our expectation that private initiatives and effective public quality control will represent an impressive contribution by the EU to giving core labour standards a proper place in the new global architecture.
We need a two-stage policy if we are to achieve sustainable development.
The ILO agreements must be ratified by all the EU Member States and by the candidate countries.
I consider the idea of a joint meeting of the ILO and Parliament to be an initiative that is absolutely deserving of support.
We will then need consensus on the order in which standards need to be achieved in the areas of social policy, commerce and the environment, and in social governance.
Secondly, third countries also need to be prevailed upon to adopt ILO model agreements.
This will hardly be achieved by means of an array of penalties, and an incentive system will work much better - for example, more financial aid for development or preferential access to markets if social kitemarks are gained through such things as a commitment not to permit child labour.
It is for this reason that my group highlights the special role of employers' associations and trades unions in promoting core labour standards, which are so important.
Thank you, Mr President, on behalf of my group, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Gillig on this excellent report, and the Commission on presenting this communication on labour standards.
Respect for core labour standards in an ever more globalising economy is a matter whose importance has to be continuously reiterated and driven home.
It is to be welcomed that this is exactly what the Commission has done.
On behalf of my group, I can therefore say that we are completely behind this report.
I also welcome the fact that this report has clearly brought the International Labour Organisation (ILO) into the limelight.
Within the UN family, the ILO is the only organisation that is not only made up of officials and national authorities, but where employers' and employees' organisations equally have a leading role.
This role is not only advisory and observing, like many NGOs, which carry out excellent work by the way, but in this tripartite organisation, the social partners co-manage and help develop policy 100%.
This commitment by the social partners, who themselves play a key role in the economy and the labour market, is invaluable.
I should like to stress this within an EU context, because I have noticed that when we were discussing this report in committee, some fellow MEPs had no, or hardly any, idea about this.
Fortunately, the amendment that was submitted by the PPE-DE Group, which threatened to negate this supporting role, has been withdrawn.
I am grateful for this.
Another quality of the ILO is that it combines legislation with very practical, technical support on site.
Both these elements ensure that the ILO is not merely a paper tiger, but actively plays a key role in the general debate.
However, in my view, we should, in the international debate, prevent social issues from always ending up on the ILO's shoulders alone.
The WTO and other organisations too, should ensure that they take account of social issues in their policies in a pro-active manner, and they must also see to it that they take a more active part in the world committee established by the Director-General of the ILO, Juan SomavÃ­a.
Mr President, Commissioner, I firstly want to thank Mrs Gillig for the considerable, and very skilled, work she has done on this report.
The result is a well-balanced report, which I support.
Parts of the report contain some basic attitudes with which I cannot agree.
Globalisation and free trade are at times presented as prejudicial to social development in the world, but I basically think it is the opposite way around.
For the developing countries in particular, free trade is the way out of poverty and social deprivation.
Social development and workers' rights are most to the fore in countries with open economies, while the worst examples of basic workers' rights being infringed are to be found in countries which seal themselves off from the world around them.
Basically, then, I think that free trade benefits social development but, that being said, we must of course ensure that the ILO Conventions are effectively complied with so that workers are guaranteed proper working conditions, for I agree with Mrs Gillig that free trade and economic growth are not enough.
The Commission's report shows that the task of ensuring that the Conventions are complied with is one which the ILO does not have the ability to implement, and that is why it has to be asked what it is we ourselves can do.
Given the nature of the case, I shall reject the instrument of trade sanctions, but it is important for the EU to put the issue on the agenda at international forums.
Unfortunately, not all countries share our view of workers' rights.
We must therefore put the pressure on.
It is also only right that workers' rights should become a natural part of efforts to combat poverty so that, when we provide aid to developing countries, we also factor in workers' rights.
Finally, it is important for us to make an effort in the education field, incorporating information about workers' rights into vocational training so that such rights can be implemented, both in our own part of the globe and in the poor countries of the world.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the Commission communication reveals an impressive ambition.
However, there is, unfortunately, a risk that this type of communication will remain a pious hope in terms of the form of globalisation that exists today and the consequences that it has.
That is why, like all my fellow Members, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mrs Gillig, who deserves credit for highlighting a number of proposals that require clarification.
Therefore, and I also stressed this point, Mrs Gillig raised the following question: what is the meaning of the freedom of expression or the freedom of association of workers in a dictatorship, or what does banning child labour mean in Less Developed Countries where there is no free and compulsory education system?
Although the European Union has specific standards on child labour, trade union rights and equal treatment, it is still necessary to supervise the strict application of these standards and to establish processes ensuring their effectiveness.
The report places the emphasis on improving relations between the European Union and the International Labour Organisation, but also on the need to respect the core standards declared by this organisation.
It also puts forward some proposals with a view to making further progress.
Lastly, the report emphasises the essential and positive role of trade unions working to promote core labour standards within the context of the World Trade Organisation, and also stresses the importance of the role of non-governmental organisations.
Although I have taken careful note of these contributions, which I welcome, I would still like to stress the fact that the solution to the problem with which we are faced must not be restricted to alleviating or regulating the harmful effects of a neo-liberal form of globalisation.
We see more evidence every day that this globalisation is making poor people even poorer and is widening the gap between north and south.
This is not a question of fate or of an abstract situation.
The European Union must, as a matter of urgency, state its ambition to give its support in combating this form of globalisation, and it must propose a genuine alternative measures for a new era in international relations.
My group tabled amendments to this end.
We therefore demand that the existence of unequal partners be taken into account, together with a reform of international financial institutions.
We also demand that sanctions be principally aimed at transnational companies that fail to observe International Labour Organisation standards and especially if they profit from this violation at the expense of employees themselves.
At the same time, and I shall conclude with this point, the European Social Forum, which is part of the global movement for a new form of globalisation, will be meeting in Florence in the near future.
This very diverse movement will put together proposals with a view to reform, in particular, world trade rules and international financial institutions, in order to achieve a more supportive form of development.
The Forum is calling for new international rights for employees of multinationals, particularly the right of association and collective negotiation.
I think that this could be the opportunity for the European Union to listen to and support these proposals.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
The fact that major conferences, such as Seattle and Doha, have been unsuccessful also implies the failure of the major organisations which are at world level involved in the economic processes, the distribution of labour and wealth, and the social processes on this planet: the United Nations, the WTO, the International Labour Organisation, but also our own European institutions.
Rich world states should search their own conscience.
We hope that Johannesburg is a turning point.
They will have to start talking somewhere about sustainable development in a way that gives this development centre stage.
Establishing the reasons why this has been impossible to date will also lead to the answer as to what has gone wrong at our end.
Economic processes have an impact worldwide.
Political authorities and institutions, including the European Union, have helped remove the barriers to the globalisation that had been made possible by the development of our western technology.
However, despite a host of elected politicians and officials of international institutions, we have failed to bring about the necessary legislation on the same scale and with the same efficiency in order to ensure that humanity as a whole, and people in the south, in particular, can live their lives in dignity.
Not in a material sense or in a cultural sense.
In the area of trade, it has been possible to lay down effective legislation with a sanctioning body within the framework of the WTO.
However, from our experience in the European Union, we know that promoting trade on its own is dangerous.
It almost always leads to social exclusion of the weak.
Poverty, destruction of social and cultural structures, of standards and values can be the outcome.
And this is what dictators, international Mafia, arms dealers and warmongers prey on.
Along with the rapporteur, I therefore conclude that the hierarchy of standards at international level is there for a reason.
We should not only concern ourselves with corrections, but with sustainable global development.
The rights that are regulated by the International Labour Organisation cannot be enforced adequately.
And I suggest that we start by looking whether we ourselves strike the right balance within the framework of our own European institutions.
We will see when the subsidies in agriculture, for example, will be brought up for discussion for the first time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must congratulate Mrs Gillig on her good work and her balanced approach to this important report.
I believe that we are living in a global world, an information and technology society, and that what we want to achieve is a society with a dynamic, highly developed economy that creates more and better jobs.
Hand in hand with this economic buoyancy, however, go sustainable development and social cohesion.
In the European Union, we benefit from a social model - the European social model - that has been developing for the past 40 years and which has given rise to what we call our 'social acquis?, an important legacy, which includes the free movement of workers, gender equality, health and safety at work, the fight against social exclusion and poverty, etc.
These principles have also been given form in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the first chapter of which concerns dignity and the fourth concerns solidarity.
Globalisation, however, involves further regulation of economic and trade relations and also, at the same time, new risks.
These new policies must in no way constitute a barrier to those practices and ideas, but rather, must contribute to social development and to promoting respect for fundamental rights.
In the terminology or ideology of the ILO, freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the prohibition or abolition of all forms of forced labour, the elimination of child labour and the absence of discrimination with regard to employment, have been described as fundamental rights.
Commissioner, I believe that the application of these rules and their distribution, which should act as an important model for the candidate countries, must constitute a priority for the Commission in its interinstitutional cooperation with the Council and the Member States.
I also believe that social dialogue will be a suitable instrument for applying and distributing the principles of our European social model.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Gillig on her excellent report and the European Commission for raising such a serious and topical issue, at a time when the future of Europe is being debated and it is playing an increasingly important role on the international political stage.
We need to stress today how important it is for the European Union to exert influence and take initiatives to ensure that ILO conventions are ratified by countries which have not yet done so, core labour standards are observed, social dialogue is consolidated in all the WTO member countries, action is taken against the disgraceful exploitation of child labour and the modern slave trade, a common, integrated immigration and asylum policy is at last introduced and action is taken against the overexploitation of immigrants, which has turned modern society into a society of haves and have-nots.
Europe needs to act as a global standard and driving force, using international agreements such as the Cotonou Agreement to actively promote equality of the sexes, not just for reasons of fairness, but as an important factor in limiting poverty and achieving a viable economy, social development, greater democratisation, stability and peace.
Unfortunately, unbridled globalisation without social guarantees has globalised poverty rather than wealth.
The International Labour Organisation is talking in terms of one billion unemployed in the world and we unfortunately appear to have turned not just into a market economy but into a market society, which is why we urgently need to promote policies which will transform globalisation into a source of prosperity and greater equality rather than a threat to social development and world peace.
Mr President, this report claims to promote core labour standards, to improve social governance, and even to create a better framework for globalisation.
So exactly how much progress has been made with your social governance here, in the rich and supposedly civilised countries of Europe?
Europe is not even capable of giving its citizens the basic right of being able to work and earn a salary to allow them to have a decent standard of living.
In the last few days alone, a long list of redundancy plans has been announced by some of the most powerful companies in the world, including Alcatel, Hewlett Packard and Vivendi, that former future capitalist flagship, which has been ruined by its own financial speculation, and by the erratic workings of your economy.
More to the point, how can you claim that your form of social governance benefits poor countries which are constantly plundered by industrial and financial companies, when you do not do anything to stop these companies doing this?
Child labour, which you condemn, exists - as you are well aware - since a number of large corporations practice this through third party sub-contractors, in their factories that have been relocated to poor countries where women and children are horrifically exploited in return for a meagre wage.
In reality, you do not govern very much at all.
Those who govern are the large financial corporations, which not only make fun of your recommendations, but go as far as giving you orders.
We will not therefore approve this web of hypocrisy and impotence.
Commissioner, we can only welcome this text and thank Mrs Gillig for the work that she has done.
Let us take one very simple point of reference: child labour.
In a recent report by the ILO, it is estimated that 245 million children are involved in economic activity throughout the world, of which 180 million perform the worst forms of labour, in other words, labour that puts their physical and mental health or their morality at risk.
This shows how important it is to reflect on core standards.
However, at a time when we are advocating a European social model, we must consider our own standards because we must not forget, once again taking the point of reference of child labour, that the number of children working in developed countries is estimated to be 2.5 million and, although all the fifteen Member States have now ratified ILO Conventions 182 and 138 on the worst forms of labour, this situation, Commissioner, is only very recent and, moreover, the conventions have not yet been ratified by all the candidate countries.
In the developing countries, 10 million children work in export-related activities; they work, therefore, albeit indirectly, for multinational companies.
The vast majority of children, however, are involved in labour connected to the undeclared economy, which makes it extremely difficult to monitor.
This is why our group is calling for the core labour standards to be integrated into the Union's development policy, in order to provide a clearer definition of targeted measures in the context of development cooperation programmes and to promote coordinated aid.
It is from this perspective that we have drafted a number of amendments and we hope that the House will support the proposals by the Group of the European People's Party in this area.
Mr President, double congratulations, to the Commission on its initiative and to the rapporteur for breathing new life into this report.
From the moment I joined the various bodies and committees of the European Parliament working on social policy issues, I have taken pains to demonstrate that the first and most important move the European Union has to make in order to strengthen the validity of the International Labour Organisation is to make it an equal member of the WTO and develop permanent channels for collaboration between the European Union and the ILO.
This is the only way we shall combat the huge social deficit in globalisation.
Global society has lost no time breaking down barriers to trade and even less time setting new standards for global trade and, at the same time, not just averting new regulatory standards on social matters but equating development in third countries with unbridled privatisation and market liberalisation.
What we have is the total supremacy of the World Bank programmes.
However, even these organisations talk in their own reports of how these programmes have failed on the social front.
The philosophy of abolishing workers' rights and of forced labour which prevails in third countries must be reversed.
Consequently, if we really want to make the ILO a true protagonist on the new world stage, we need an integrated programme.
We need ratification of international conventions and, more importantly, acceptance of control mechanisms for social issues.
Mr President, I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to the Commission and to Mrs Gillig, and also to all the Parliamentary committees that have, in actual fact, drafted excellent reports.
The globalisation of the economy, which is inevitable, is only accepted if it improves living and working conditions.
Since the European Union, with its strong economy, is one of the key players in this globalisation, Europe is obliged to commit to improving social conditions.
For this purpose, Europe can use various levers, and the question is to what extent these levers are actually being used.
I should like to ask the Commissioner two questions in this respect.
My first question is about Europe itself.
People are still being abused in our own countries.
Just think of child labour or domestic slavery.
These practices contravene fundamental labour standards.
I have written an initiative report on this domestic slavery.
I have often quizzed the Commission to find out to what extent it is dealing with this issue.
I have to be frank with you, Commissioner; I have never had any feedback, even though you have promised to make efforts in this area.
My second question is about the cooperation agreements with third countries, to which clauses were added recently concerning respect for fundamental labour standards.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation notes on this subject that nothing is being done to implement these new provisions.
My question is: how is cooperation being organised on these issues within the European Commission?
Between, for example, the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid and the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs.
To what extent are you involved in these issues?
To what extent is it possible for you, from you office, to monitor and stimulate these issues?
In fact, the same question could be asked about the introduction and follow-up of clauses concerning human rights and women's rights.
I shall never forget, Commissioner, how everyone was up in arms about the destruction of the statues by the Taliban while simultaneously, a huge number of women were being murdered.
These matters should also be followed up.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, however briefly.
I also welcome the fact that so many colleagues are pouring into the House at this moment, clearly to hear what I have to say.
I wanted to contribute because, as colleagues on the other side of the House know, there are differences between groups on the important issue of corporate social responsibility.
Mr Howitt made a very important observation when, at the start of this debate, he said that he had been working in parallel with Mrs Gillig on this report.
"Parallel" is a very good choice of word because parallel lines are separate lines and do not meet.
It is important that CSR, as a subject, should not be seen as a catch-all for everything that everyone wants businesses to do better.
Also it is important that the core labour standards - these ILO standards - are given the dedication and focus needed for their implementation, as indeed the rapporteur so eloquently pointed out.
Clearly there is much work, collectively, that we need to do on this.
I thank the rapporteur for accepting two of my amendments in particular.
One was that globalisation can be positive, creating opportunities for real growth and development.
I say to Mrs Jensen that this is still very much in the body of the report.
The other was that a major driver of social cohesion is full employment.
All of us need to be much more positive and proactive in this regard.
Finally, I would observe that the rapporteur has accepted the Commissioner's conclusions.
We, across the House, will be supporting the rapporteur's conclusions.
There is a real danger of consensus breaking out all over the place.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her work in making this possible.
Mr President, I think that there is an automatic connection to be made between the global and local dimensions of employment.
The previous communication was on local employment planning and, as the interventions by numerous honourable Members have demonstrated, impoverished workers in a third world country can hold workers in a region of Europe hostage.
And that is the problem with the development of global economic governance, which liberates trade and capital without any accompanying global social governance.
The aim of this communication is to help service the need for a social governance framework.
The political approach taken in this communication is that it is not predicated on protectionism.
It is a positive approach which makes use of incentives, cooperation and sustainable development.
I should like to comment on a few specific points raised by the honourable Members.
The role of the International Labour Organisation.
We can confirm the central role of the ILO, we have decided to increase our involvement in ILO programmes and just last year I and Mr SomavÃ­a, the Director-General of the ILO, signed a new exchange of letters which include the promotion of core labour standards throughout the world, reducing poverty, promoting decent work, social dialogue, companies' social responsibility and employment.
This agreement will also cover the Cotonou and ACP accords.
It is important for Parliament to support the financial dimensions of this collaboration between the Commission and the ILO.
I also think that the high-level global committee on the social dimension of globalisation set up in a global agreement under the auspices of the ILO to address and propose innovative ways of improving governance at global level was an important step.
Another step needed is to promote the greatest possible cooperation between the ILO, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the two United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development.
As far as the Member States and individual bilateral or multilateral agreements are concerned, the Commission proposes that the social dimension and social or core labour standards be taken into account in all the relevant sectors of the European Union (trade, development, foreign relations and social issues).
One speaker mentioned Parliament's support for the new approach under the system of generalised preferences which, may I remind you, encourages beneficiary countries to exceed core labour standards using specific incentives granted to these countries by the Commission.
My last comment concerns the European initiative on democracy and human rights, under which very specific action is being taken to support the fight against child labour, which numerous members referred to, and the reintegration of working children in education.

I should like to close my intervention on this communication by responding to two honourable members; first Mrs Smet, who referred to monitoring of the internal job market in Europe: there is, of course, the Dublin institute, but as regards home working, another form of slavery, we are up against the major problem of undeclared work which is very hard to identify, but I shall be submitting a study which, as I said, is being prepared on the question of women engaged in undeclared work at home.
Where the question of cooperation between the Commissioners for Development Aid and Social Affairs is concerned, we already have close collaboration, as the result of which, may I remind you, we had a horizontal action plan on the gender dimension in all the individual projects for all development aid last year, complete with timetables and its own budget.
The second point is the new Commission communication on social dialogue and, more importantly, the external dimension, the global dimension of social dialogue and the role which the social partners, employers and employees, can play with respect to investments at global level to observe social labour standards.
Mr President, I have the honour and the pleasure, as rapporteur, of informing the Members of this House of the fact that the draft agreement on waste statistics, reached during an informal meeting between representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 26 June last, was adopted by Coreper yesterday afternoon; this has been confirmed in writing by the Chairman of Coreper to the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
With this, the last obstacles have been removed on the road to agreeing on the achieved result.
The Council will be adopting 13 amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, while a compromise has been reached on all other amendments.
The compromise amendments have been tabled on behalf of the EDD Group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the PSE Group, because only those groups were represented on 26 June, but these are also backed by other groups.
I should like to have Commissioner Diamantopoulou confirm that in these waste statistics and the further development of pilot studies by the European Commission and Eurostat, every effort will be made to keep the burden for the respondents to a minimum.
I am concerned that this very much applies to agriculture.
I should also like to receive confirmation of the Council's oral pledge to produce an annual update of the waste indicators available.
After all, it is on this proviso that we accepted the biannual provision of information.
Finally, we have gained one year, thanks to this agreement.
This result could only be achieved thanks to the excellent cooperation with the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and their staff, as well as our unsurpassed Secretariat.
I should also like to thank the 7 Council presidencies with whom I have teamed up, the European Commission and Eurostat, for their excellent cooperation.
Thank you, Mr Blokland, for this good news.
The Council cannot confirm it orally, as you requested, for it is not here, but the Commission is here and is able to give us its opinion of these amendments.
Mr President, the Commission can accept all compromise amendments tabled and thus can support the voting recommendations of the rapporteur.
The amendments as tabled in the compromise package should increase the quality of statistics.
The main reason is that Member States have more time to establish their methodologies for obtaining reliable data.
Data collected on complicated issues such as agricultural waste and waste recycling will benefit particularly from this.
Allow me to say a word on the waste data requirement for agriculture.
The Commission has also been very well aware of the fact that an equilibrium had to be found between the important data requirement and the minimisation of the burden on respondents.
I would like to stress the following fact.
In order to reduce the administrative burden on small enterprises, enterprises with fewer than 10 employees will be excluded from surveys, unless they contribute significantly to the generation of waste.
This derogation for small enterprises is applicable for the whole regulation.
Moreover, I would like to recall that the regulation provides for a transitional period of up to three years and that this transitional period is closely linked to the pilot studies, which aim at finding the most cost-effective methods for obtaining data.
The Commission welcomes the proposed frequency of data provision, which is to be every second year.
The Commission takes note that Member States will provide yearly updates for some aggregated data sets. These aggregated data refer, for example, to some of the structural indicators requested for the annual spring report of the Commission, which was agreed at the GÃ¶teborg European Council of June 2001.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to withdraw our support for Amendments Nos 68 and 69.
This was a joint motion by the rapporteur and myself on behalf of our respective groups, which we tabled out of a desire to be accommodating to the Council, which wanted an immediate resolution, albeit one contrary to the line taken by the Committee.
The Council, however, did nothing to meet us halfway, and my understanding of the codecision procedure is not that it involves conceding negotiating points at first reading stage without getting anything in return.
We will be voting against both amendments.
Mr President, I wish to point out that something very strange has happened to Amendments Nos 13 and 35.
In the original report, the term "consolidated version" was used, but in the folders - both of which are in German - both the amendments refer to a "codified version".
I would like to say that there have been difficulties with the legal department, but that the original version adopted by the Committee is described as "consolidated" and not "codified".
I am sure that more work will have to be done on this when final adjustments are made, but I just wanted that to be on the record.
The linguistic services will, of course, carry out a thorough check on the basis of your comment, Mr Wieland, to ensure that the text used is the version you have indicated to be correct.
Regarding Amendment No 14:
Mr President, under Amendment No 14(2)(f), I should like to add the following words after "seagoing vessels": "inland waterway vessels".
It was remiss of me at committee to have missed that out.
I have raised it with the rapporteur and he is in agreement with this.
Mr President, I did not want to speak until the vote on the second part had been taken.
I would like to point out that in the second part there is a technical error in the English version.
The speed should be 0.15 metres per second, whereas in the English text gives it as 0.015 metres per second.
The former is correct.
The English version will be corrected as well, Mr Miller.
The text I have before me has already been corrected.

Mr President, the text of the resolution which we are about to discuss on the International Criminal Court states that the Statute has been ratified by 69 countries, but it was 76 countries.
This should therefore be corrected: 76 instead of 69.
Mr van den Berg, this problem has already been pointed out by Mr Lagendijk.
Moreover, during the debate which I chaired yesterday, I heard several Members mention that the number of countries which have already signed the International Criminal Court statute is much higher.
The correction will, of course, be made.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I regret the fact that this House, when considering the report on the promotion of the use of biofuels, did not advocate making the addition of biodiesel mandatory.
As I see it, the many benefits associated with their use mean that biofuels have to be promoted much more extensively as a competitive product.
Let me remind you of our dependence on fossil fuels and of the fact that they are imported from third countries.
I would also like to reiterate that we would thus be able to comply with the Kyoto protocol all the more speedily, and would remind you of the impetus this would give to rural areas and to the multifunctional role of agriculture.
I spoke in favour of the addition of a mandatory quantity because, on this point too, I believe that a greater market share can be achieved more quickly.
Despite this, though, I am very grateful, as I believe that these new directives and the new decisions taken by Parliament are a good thing in terms of an innovative future for agriculture and rural areas, and hence that what we have done today is a good start.
I am a firm believer in the possibilities of developing biofuels from primary agricultural products; one example of the multifunctional character of our agricultural industry is that we are able to produce food and energy. The energy industry produces 570 000 tonnes per year; it is still in its infancy, in other words and is expected, in the next few years, to undergo substantial growth, in terms of volume, energy efficiency and in terms of improving its environmental impact.
I supported the measures which seek to introduce differentiated taxation; we should increasingly consider taxes on oil products as an 'ecotax', designed to penalise fossil fuels for their negative external costs, such as their non-sustainability and their contribution to the greenhouse effect.
Biofuels, on the other hand, are a clean, renewable and indigenous resource, and have no impact whatsoever on the greenhouse effect.
I supported the measures which give Member States specific and increasing objectives on the use of biofuels in the fuel pool, and I regret that Parliament has watered down the restrictive character of these measures.
Lastly, I regret that we received no support for the provisions which seek to avoid a situation whereby the measures taken bring about an increase in imports of biofuels and their raw materials.
We Swedish Social Democrats voted against Amendment No 33(3)(a), which proposes that hoists are only to be intended for persons of limited mobility.
We believe that these simpler lifting devices should also be available to a broader public which has need of them.
This report requires the certification of machinery and lifts to be based on criteria that will provide greater security for users.
We therefore voted in favour, even though the recommended measures will apply to new machines alone and only very rarely to old appliances.
Despite the fact that the report stresses the obligation to maintain operational appliances in good working order, the likelihood of fulfilling this desire can, however, be questioned.
There have been reports recently in the French press of a series of accidents involving lifts in council flats, in which several people died.
The French lift trade union stated that, for some time, it has condemned chronic staff shortages within service departments, whose technicians are responsible for maintaining two or three times as many appliances as 20 years ago.
In addition to this, the standard of council accommodation is deteriorating, like all council equipment, and it is being increasingly neglected by the public authorities.
The report's declared intention, which we support, to bring safety up to the highest possible level should therefore be backed up with coercive measures to prevent the sale of dangerous machinery and with the obligation to provide sufficient technical and human resources to maintain this equipment, to replace it as and when necessary.
We Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote in favour of the resolution in its entirety and in favour of Amendment No 12.
We would hereby like to clarify our position.
Amendment No 12 goes a long way in its efforts to combat racism and xenophobia.
The Swedish constitution provides robust protection for fundamental freedoms and rights.
Certain elements of Amendment No 12, particularly item (f), may contravene our freedom of association, as enshrined in our constitution.
We shall not support a restriction upon, or change to, our constitution.
The reason we still support Amendment No 12 and the resolution in its entirety is that the report is a clear improvement compared with the Commission's original proposal.
It is vital that the European Parliament takes a clear stand against racism and xenophobia.
In our view, the proposal for a framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, presented by the Commission, has no legal basis from two points of view.
1.
The proposal aims to approximate rules on criminal matters - and sanctions - in the Member States, using Articles 29, 31 and 34(2) of the Treaty on European Union as a basis.
However, these articles do not confer this responsibility for combating racism.
2.
One of the objectives of police and judicial cooperation under Title VI of the TEU is, indeed, to combat 'racism and xenophobia?, but the Commission's proposal takes it upon itself to widen the definition of these words, by adding aversion determined by 'religion or belief? (Article 3) to aversion determined by race or national origin.
Although the meaning of the words could be changed at a later date to broaden the competences set out in the Treaty, it would be a little too easy, and we would find out.
Lastly, this attempt at excessively widening the definition of racism gives rise to the fear that a European 'thought police' is on patrol, and for this reason too, it must be rejected.
- (DA) We wish to begin by stating that in no way are we opposed to combating racism and xenophobia, that is to say to the very objective of the report.
We have nonetheless chosen to vote against the proposal, since we are basically convinced that legal and internal issues are best dealt with by the Member States themselves.
We also have our doubts about the legal basis for this framework decision which, with its very specific instructions, has assumed the character of a supranational decision.
We agree fully on the need to fight racism and xenophobia and welcome that the European Commission recognises the need to fight racism and xenophobia.
We will, however, not support the Ceyhun report for several reasons.
Firstly, the report leaves little if any attention to the political fight against racism and xenophobia, and focuses primarily on the judicial action to be taken.
However, racism and xenophobic attacks and discriminations occur in the social and economic spheres and must be countered by measures to abolish such discriminations, which exist also in institutionalised forms.
An approach strictly limited to criminal law cannot be considered sufficient in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
Secondly, the focus of the report is on legal restrictions on racist and xenophobic beliefs and not on the actions motivated by racism and xenophobia.
Criminalising what people think amounts to attempted censorship and diverts attention from violent criminal attacks on people of colour and foreigners.
Instead of a "mind-policing-approach" we would support a hate-crime-legislation approach that considers racist and xenophobic motives for a crime an aggravating circumstance and increases sanctions on these crimes.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Today, in light of the growing threat from election results in favour of the far right in Europe, it is necessary, more than ever before, to show our determination to protect all the fundamental values and principles of our democratic system.
Therefore, the representatives of democratic political groups have a duty to assert their commitment not to join together with a political coalition, nor with groups or parties which entertain ideologies or proposals that could undermine the democratic principles on which our political system is based.
As part of the democratic debate and during election campaigns, we must also undertake to condemn any talk, any populist attitude that could artificially heighten the fears which bolster far-right groups.
Furthermore, it is a good idea to make all the Members of our parties to sign a code of good conduct in order to define the attitude that they must adopt towards groups which place the democratic principles of our political system at risk.
The rapporteur is himself proof that Europe is not racist.
Mr Ozan Ceyhun, Turkish by birth, is a Member of the German Parliament.
I do not think, however, that there are many offspring of European residents in the Turkish Parliament.
We are still confronted with the same approach: Europeans are racist if they reject the immigration policy.
This approach involves forced guilt, moral inquisition and permanent psychological conditioning.
The Ceyhun report is a further step towards moral totalitarianism.
It contains such a broad definition of the racist offence that it is becoming difficult to say what is not racist.
Therefore, a simple reference to national origin may be considered as a racist act or as racial discrimination.
Ultimately, the mere fact of setting aside public sector jobs or the right to vote for nationals falls foul of this aberrant legislation.
The report also has a repressive edge, making it a crime to express one's thoughts.
Freedom of expression is giving way to the principle of compulsory cosmopolitanism.
This 'anti-racism' hysteria is the psychological level of the process whose aim is the general colonisation of Europe.
One right is finally recognised implicitly in the report: that of keeping quiet and supporting those who are destroying our freedoms and our identities.
This document is the manifesto of collaborators of future foreign occupations.
We are mounting resistance.
Undoubtedly, racism is a dangerous and unacceptable phenomenon.
However, in Britain we have developed our laws to tackle these matters in ways which best suit our own circumstances and to reflect improving race relations (at least until 1997).
The offence of xenophobia is extremely difficult to prove and there is no direct place for it in British criminal law.
In those circumstances we prefer to continue with our own policies and sanctions.
This framework decision if implemented also challenges traditional values of free speech and this is harmful, not helpful, to good race relations, which we all desire.
British Conservatives do not like to abstain in the fight against racism but must do so on this occasion for the above reasons.
- (DA) I have two main reasons for voting against the proposal.
1.
Actions to combat the callousness that finds expression in racism and xenophobia should not be translated into sanctions under criminal law such as the proposal is based upon.
Criminalisation is, at best, ineffective and, at worst, counterproductive. It also has a number of damaging effects, including that of seriously impairing freedom of expression.
2.
A 'common EU criminal law approach?, which the proposal is based upon, has no legal base in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
In reality, we are talking here about such an extensive regulation of both ends and means that a 'framework' decision, as such, cannot be taken.
Add to this the fact that 'racism and xenophobia? are not included in the types of crime that can be regulated pursuant to Article 31(e) ('organised crime, terrorism and illicit drug trafficking?).
The framework decision therefore contravenes the Treaty and entails a clear infringement of the Danish exemption in connection with legal and internal affairs.
We support Mr Ceyhun's report as a praiseworthy contribution to the fight against racism and xenophobia in Europe.
Racism stands in direct opposition to the values on which the European Union is based - human rights, equality, freedom and democracy.
A common definition of racist and xenophobic crimes, along with a harmonisation of crime classifications, may be an important tool in combating actions which constitute a violation or persecution of individuals or ethnic groups.
At the same time, it is our duty as democrats to enter the debate with the racists.
If we can obliterate their arguments, democracy and tolerance will have won a major victory.
Freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of the press are fundamental rights and should generally never be restricted.
In Sweden, these freedoms are enshrined in the constitution and any restriction should be carefully considered.
Striking a balance between these freedoms and effective work against racism and xenophobia is, therefore, difficult.
With this in mind, it is with some hesitation that we support the proposal on banning the dissemination of printed material and the proposal which may in practice mean that membership of certain organisations and parties may be criminalised.
. Mr President, I wholeheartedly support this motion for a resolution which will act as a considerable deterrent to racist offenders.
By making it easier to prosecute people for racist offences, religious and racist intolerance could be significantly diminished.
Indeed, by increasing the scope of what constitutes racist behaviour, to include actions that may be deemed threatening, abusive or insulting, this resolution represents a consolidation of the principles of freedom and human rights, principles upon which the EU and its Member States are founded.
We voted against the resolution on the conclusions of the European Council in Seville, because it approves the confusing statements which seek to mislead the Irish people in the run-up to their second referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
These two statements - the first, unilateral in nature, made by Ireland, and the second made by the Council which takes account of the former (or takes note of it, depending on the language version) - seem to guarantee each country's freedom of choice in terms of security and defence policy in general, and in terms of each process in particular.
But this is not the spirit of Nice.
If they say 'yes' in the second referendum, the people of Ireland will become trapped by texts which will inevitably lead them further into integration, which is what they do not want.
Unfortunately, I am unable to continue on this subject here, since the European Parliament's administrative service has decided to cut down every explanation of vote that exceeds 200 words.
But people who want to know the truth about European affairs, and who are tired of the truth being hidden in Parliament's official debates, can log on to the web site of the French Mouvement pour la France members, at the following address: http://www.autre-europe.org.
.
(PT) I welcome the approval of the amendment - which we supported - condemning the action of the Spanish authorities preventing a group of Portuguese citizens, including a member of the Portuguese national parliament, from crossing the border in order to take part in an authorised demonstration in Seville, during the European Council meeting, because I believe that this action runs counter to the fundamental principles and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties.
The joint motion, however, has many shortcomings, which we addressed in the motion tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (but which, unfortunately, was rejected) and contains many negative aspects, specifically in failing to criticise the criminal justice and security aspects of immigration policy, in insisting on compliance with the Stability Pact and the monetary guidelines and in calling for the federalist approach to be extended in various aspects of Community policy.
Consequently, despite the fact that we voted in favour of certain points, such as the amendment condemning the actions by the Spanish authorities at the Spanish-Portuguese border, we have voted against the joint motion.
. (EL) The European Council in Seville added an extra course to the walls around fortress Europe by taking measures to strengthen xenophobia and racism and conceal the cruel liberal policies of the ?U and the Member States, making scapegoats of immigrants and their countries of origin.
It is persisting in its anti-grass roots policy of antagonism, privatisation and liberalisation of the markets, which increases the profits made by big business and exacerbates the situation of the workers, understandably provoking them to react.
It is strengthening the militarisation and high-handedness of the ?U, making provision to send forces to Bosnia and FYROM and creating new prosecuting authorities to consolidate the new order, deal with differences of opinion between the imperialist powers and suppress opposition and counterattack by the workers.
One example of this high-handed policy is the fortress erected around the Council venue, the attempt to terrorise citizens and the ban on demonstrations and on demonstrators from other countries entering Spain.
These splendid demonstrations, with more broadly-based social groups rallying round to oppose this policy, and a new anti-imperialist, anti-monopoly front will, without any shadow of a doubt, be the workers' response in their bid to overturn it.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the joint motion because it basically consents to this policy.
What will, without a doubt, retain the public's attention in relation to the Seville Summit will be the European programme on combating immigration.
The Heads of State and Government, haunted by the election results in favour of the far right, have adopted a vast and repressive arsenal of security measures but have not tackled the underlying causes of immigration, nor even attempted to find other solutions apart from extradition for immigrants residing and working in Europe.
It is rather paradoxical that, at the same time, in Seville, 450 illegal farm workers, most of whom are Algerian, occupied the university demanding to receive the correct paperwork for their situation.
They asked the real questions, that of the debt that their country of origin has run up at the IMF, which is plunging the population into further and deeper poverty; about the mafia groups which are taking advantage of 'Fortress Europe'; about the employers who abuse this illegal workforce, disregarding the right to work and human rights.
We urgently need a different policy to cancel third world debt, to withdraw European support for dictators, provide immigrants with the correct paperwork and to open up borders.
Spain has also set little store by the Treaties by preventing, during the Summit, Portuguese citizens from crossing the border.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Once again, the conclusions reached at a European summit, in this case at Seville, illustrate that work on Community integration continues to come up against a brick wall.
Although we made faster progress with integration during the 1990s by following a federal approach, the voice of the nations seems to be making itself heard again since the drafting of the Treaty of Nice.
The conclusions of the Seville Summit confirm the fact that the debate on most of the major areas was postponed due to disagreements between nations that are anxious to promote their sovereignty and their interests.
As for immigration, the penalties against illegal immigrants' countries of origin, as advocated by certain governments, were fortunately not approved.
Led by France, several countries rejected such measures, which run counter to their long-standing tradition of welcoming immigrants.
These measures would have had a detrimental effect on their relations, developed over some time, with the States from which these illegal immigrants originate.
Similarly, no specific changes were made to the way in which the CAP works or to the way in which the Council of Ministers operates.
All this goes to show that the Member States have distinct interests and proves, as if it were necessary, that, if we wish to continue with European integration, we must not ignore these realities.
. (NL) During the first half of 2002, the Council's Spanish Presidency achieved the same kind of results as the current Spanish government is achieving in Spanish internal affairs.
It was looking back instead of forward.
The government's priorities were to even further withdraw from the economy and to strengthen the authoritarian and militarised character of what remains of the government, thus creating greater scope for the rulers and less for critical citizens.
It appeared to be an attempt to cast the entire European Union back into the nineteenth century, the era before the rise of the labour movement and the environmental movement, and before the introduction of universal suffrage.
Fortunately, parliament has corrected a proposal on protecting prominent people, and the Spanish Presidency, in its opposition to my report on the market for public transport, did not manage to find a majority to enforce large-scale privatisations.
The Seville Summit has done nothing to solve the financial problems which stand in the way of EU enlargement, and failed to reach agreement on 14 EU agencies for which a chair is yet to be found, but has once against spoken out against immigration without offering a solution.
In short, it was a large-scale pass-the-buck operation.
. (PT) The Seville Summit focused on three main issues: firstly, the approval of a set of measures on the organisation of the European Council and the Council which, without affecting the principle of equality between Member States, will enable these bodies to function better and more effectively; secondly, the positive confirmation of the timetable laid down for the conclusion of negotiations with the candidate countries that will join the European Union in the first wave, whilst respecting the principle of merit and of differentiation; and finally, the adoption of a firm position on the fight against illegal immigration, without, however, undermining the commitments on development and cooperation we have given to the countries of origin or of transit of migratory flows and their involvement in this fight.
The clear position of the Council on the need to strengthen the component of the outermost regions in the Union's policies, given their specific characteristics should also be noted, because of its importance and significance.
This set of issues is sufficiently and appropriately developed in the Joint Resolution that has just been approved, despite the fact that it is a compromise text, which is why I supported the motion and voted for it.
.
(PT) A point I welcome in particular from the Seville Summit, at the close of the Spanish Presidency, is the refocusing of attention on the outermost regions and therefore, the corresponding paragraph in the motion for a resolution that we have approved.
The Azores and Madeira, in the case of Portugal, fully deserved this attention, which prevented Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam from falling out of sight or into disuse.
Unfortunately, in the last two years, neither the Portuguese nor the French presidency, which at that time was run by socialists, gave any new boost to this important aspect of the Treaties - even though Portugal and France are, in addition to Spain, the Member States that have outermost regions.
We had to wait for the Spanish presidency - not a socialist one - and for the boost given by the new Portuguese government for the issue at last to be accorded the consideration it deserves.
We shall pay close attention to developments in this area by the end of the year.
. (NL) Like my group, I have voted against Amendment No 1 tabled by the ELDR Group, because it is not within Parliament's remit to prescribe to national parliaments how they should deal with the forthcoming enlargement treaties.
The European Council will undoubtedly make proposals, to which national parliaments will be able to respond individually.
It is up to each of those national parliaments to decide whether they want to deal with these treaties individually or en bloc.
How can we fail to comment on the affirmation in this resolution which states that every human being has the right to have access to healthy and nutritional food and clean water and a fundamental right to be protected from famine?
How can we fail to be horrified by the statistic that 815 million people in the world suffer from hunger?
Our positive vote is solely inspired by this aspect of the document.
Because how, at the same time, can we fail to be indignant at the hypocrisy of gaining unanimity across all the parties, which, for the most part, have supported each and every disgraceful policy conducted by the major imperial powers to support their corporations and financial groups which are directly or indirectly responsible for this situation?
The material resources and accumulated wealth are more than enough to provide every human being with access to food and water.
But this wealth is monopolised by a small number of large corporations which not only refuse to part with the slightest amount in order to help those members of the human race that are suffering, but continue to increase their wealth at its expense.
The resolution stops short of the point where the problems begin.
It is precisely because of its hypocritical condemnation and its cowardly proposals that all the parties were able to take a part in drafting it.
. (ES) Just like the Monterrey Conference, the World Food Summit has sadly been yet another wasted opportunity.
The EU and the Member States could have shown, not only with words but also through action, their commitment to the fight that the United Nations has embarked on in order to end poverty and hunger in the world.
Once again, however, we achieved nothing more than grand declarations of principle and we have not been able to adopt the necessary measures and allocate the necessary resources to turn words into action.
We continue to proclaim the right of each individual to have access to healthy, nutritious food, yet we are incapable of taking action to allow this right to be exercised by the poorest people.
We limited ourselves to repeating the commitment to halving the number of malnourished people by 2015, which is not only totally insufficient but is now impossible to accomplish given the failure to adopt generous, effective measures.
That is why I have voted for the Resolution on the Rome Summit, because it proposes solutions that attempt to get to the heart of the problem and address not only the consequences but also the causes of poverty and the lack of food in the world.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (DE) I cannot share the optimistic assessment given by the report on the World Food Summit in Rome.
I see the results emerging from this conference of 182 states as being rather meagre and the prospect of effectively combating hunger as a worldwide problem, as a dismal one.
Little progress has been made in the intervening six years towards the objective proclaimed at the previous summit in 1996, that of reducing the number of the world's starving from 800 million to 400 million by 2015.
Whilst some states have succeeded in keeping hunger within bounds, new starvation zones have come into being in other regions, for example in the former Soviet Union.
The main reason for the 1996 action plan's failure to reach its target is primarily that it was founded on a neoliberal policy which entrenches the structural causes of hunger and malnutrition rather than doing away with them.
It is not globalisation and market liberalisation that are needed, but rather the radical dismantling of the trade barriers erected by the North to keep out products from the South, just as much as the promotion of food production for local markets by small farmers and producers' free access to input such as water, land, woods or fishing grounds.
Trade can only be a key factor in security of food provision across the world if it is not seen as a one-way street down which the big food and feedingstuff corporations may travel as they will.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
The Rome Summit has once again revealed the divide between the northern and southern hemispheres.
One of the most serious problems continues to be the lack of water for both drinking and other purposes.
This problem could be solved if the Member States were to set up an ad hoc fund for the direct financing of the planning, purchase, construction and management of wells and water systems.
Combating hunger in the world is not just a competition to see who can show the most solidarity, it is a fight against the desperation which is driving millions of people to pursue their dream of a better life elsewhere.
Sadly, in many cases, this dream is never realised, shattered by our inability to act as quickly as progress demands.
We are sure that greater focus on the primary needs of the economies of the poorest countries and searching for on-the-spot solutions will bring effective solidarity.
The proposals of the FAO Summit in Rome appear to follow this line and all the participating countries are committed to them.
Our task is to ensure that the good intentions are translated into practical measures and immediate, focused solutions.
In the hope that this will happen, we voted for the motion.
Today the House approved a motion protesting against the recent American law exempting American personnel from the jurisdiction of the new International Criminal Court, even if they are accused of genocide and war crimes.
There can be no doubt whatsoever that this bill degrades the basic principles of international law and illustrates the arrogant, martial, world-dominating, imperialist profile of the USA.
However, every well-meaning person must be wondering:
1.
Has the ?U only now remembered the principles of international criminal law?
Why did it not apply them when it joined with the USA in bombing Yugoslavia and, after 11 September, in declaring "war on terrorism" and Afghanistan, when it said "we are all American"?
2.
Which principles it and the USA applied when setting up the International Criminal Tribunal, which is illegal under the UN Charter, in order to try President Milosevic and anyone else who resisted American and NATO intervention?
3.
Whether the leaders of the EU and NATO will be brought before this Court for their crimes in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and anywhere else in the future?
4.
Whether this Court will perhaps eventually be used to try those who resist the new imperialist order?
Because of these concerns, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are unable to vote in favour of the motion.
Mr President, it was a matter of great satisfaction to us all that the Medina Ortega report was adopted by such a decisive majority.
It really is an important issue for many of our constituents to regulate better the timeshare industry and related activities.
Many people in the European Union - and certainly many of my own constituents - have had serious complaints about fraudulent behaviour and mistreatment at the hands of sharks operating in this market.
This is very unfortunate because there are many honest, decent and appropriate operators, for example those represented by the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe, from which I have received important help in relation to my constituents.
I am sure others have too.
The real problem is the regulation of fraudulent behaviour and making sure that people in particularly vulnerable situations are adequately protected against it.
