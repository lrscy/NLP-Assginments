rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am just taking the floor to say, for the sake of clarity, that as rapporteur I call on everyone, in all roll-call votes, to vote against anything not tabled by the committee.
I do so to prevent the European Union from having to intervene the next time there is an accident on any major European river, because that might happen if we do not extend consumer protection to this sector as well.
(DE) Mr President, that was a very brief description of the problem.
Both my own group and the other take the view that specific rules would offer better protection for passengers on inland vessels, since the present regulations, on which we are to vote, apply to sea-going traffic, and so I would just like to point out that we are doing no less for the passengers' safety if we table our amendments, and then - it is to be hoped - get a majority to vote for them.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (vote)
- Motion for a resolution
- Before the vote
(FR) Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs should like, on the basis of Rule 170(4) of our Rules of Procedure, to have the vote on this resolution postponed until the second part-session in September.
The aim of this postponement is to adapt our timetable to the new timetable set at our request by the Commission services for approval of the IFRS 8 accounting standard as a replacement for the IAS 14 standard.
The Commission proposal to adopt IFRS 8 would mean incorporating the equivalent US accounting standard into European law without an impact study on the effect of applying such a standard to European listed companies having been carried out.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to point out that the convergence of IFRS financial reporting standards and US GAAP - which Commissioner McCreevy is so keen to see happen - must result in standards that make it possible to produce better quality financial information.
Real convergence means much more, for the one party, than simply copying the financial reporting standards of the other party.
In this context, the Commission services have agreed to review their timetable, and have thus consented to an impact study being carried out.
This information was communicated to us by letter last night.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would also like to point out that the Commission proposals on implementing measures - at the very least in the financial sphere - including financial reporting standards, must be examined within a three-month period.
We should like it if the Commission could resubmit this implementing measure, accompanied by the results of this impact study thus requested, before our Committee on 10 September, so that our Parliament might definitively validate or otherwise the application of this standard in European law.

Mr President, I would like to propose the following changes to paragraph 13.
Firstly, that the word 'welcomes' be replaced by the word 'notes'.
Secondly, that we add at the end: 'regrets, however, the lack of democratic oversight due to the exclusion of the European Parliament and national parliaments from this dialogue'.
Finally, we also propose deletion of the word 'political' before 'framework'.
(ES) Mr President, I simply wish to say that my group would agree with two of the references: that of changing the word 'Welcomes' to 'Notes' and the removal of the word 'political'.
In order to be able to agree to this proposal, however, we would like to add a positive note and say: 'so as to give greater democratic legitimacy to this dialogue, calls for the European Parliament to be involved'.
Mr President, I think that is acceptable.

rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, something else I have to clarify, with the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs, is that this provision is intended to apply to all problems with borders, and so I ask that 'with neighbouring countries' be inserted.
This rule that recourse be had to the services of a third party should, then, apply in principle to all border problems that are as yet unresolved.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
That concludes the vote.
(DE) Mr President, might I ask why it is that, since we always have relatively few votes on a Tuesday and always a very large number of them on Wednesdays, why it is that formal sittings are always on Wednesdays?
Could we not move them to a Tuesday?
That would work every bit as well, and we would be able to organise our timetable far better.
I shall pass your comment on to the right person and try to get you an answer.
Voting time (continued)
Explanations of vote
This association agreement concerns the ongoing Single European Sky initiative.
One of the key aspects of the initiative - typical of agreements of this kind - is the gradual liberalisation of transport among the contracting parties and the euphemistic-sounding 'adjustment' of the state monopolies.
We therefore wish to restate the principle that it is up to each Member State to decide how to run air transport services and under what conditions, including the condition whereby it is ideally up to the State itself to provide this service.
We also wish to reaffirm our view that the overriding principle governing all action undertaken under these agreements should be that of cooperation and respect for national sovereignty, including each State's management of its own airspace.
The liberalisation of air transport has led to a deterioration in the quality of the services provided and to attacks on the rights of the workers in this key sector.
At the same time, liberalisation has served the interests of the large international carriers by concentrating the sector, to the detriment of smaller operators.
Lastly, I wish to highlight the incomprehensible involvement of the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo.
Mr President, how often do we hear the argument that because a particular field of policy has an international dimension, we need EU jurisdiction?
That argument is superficially plausible, but on closer inspection turns out to be specious, and nowhere is this more neatly demonstrated than in aviation policy.
This is plainly an issue that crosses state borders, yet the way to deal with it, as we have seen in this report, is internationally rather than supra-nationally, and involves states outside the EU as well as within it.
This is surely a better model for the organisation of our continent than the control of all cross-border matters from Brussels.
Let us extend that dispensation beyond aviation.
in writing. (DE) I have voted in favour of the Regulation on civil aviation security.
I would furthermore argue that detailed measures, such as, for example, the ban on the carrying on board of drinks and liquids, should expire after six months.
The present situation, in which airports apply this rule in different ways and in an unprofessional manner, so that many travellers do not know exactly which items they are actually allowed to take with them and which rules actually are in force, is not sustainable and it is understandable that people are getting fed up with it.
It is absolutely vital that passengers be informed in precise terms as to the rights and duties of security personnel at airports if they are to be processed peacefully and efficiently while on them.
Should a Member State decide against this, an in-depth reappraisal of the security risks and a thorough review of the costs and effects on flights associated with these measures must be carried out first.
in writing. (PL) I am voting in favour of the recommendation of a common position of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002.
Mr Paolo Costa has rightly pointed out that the additional security measures proposed by the Commission will not mean obligatory armed security officers on board aircraft.
According to the rapporteur, such a decision would be up to the relevant authorities in the Member State.
The problem of funding the additional security measures was also properly addressed.
Security costs should partly be paid for by the Member States, and not just the air carriers as the proposed by the European Commission.
Any costs of on-board security included in the ticket price should be stated separately on the ticket or communicated to passengers in an understandable way.
I also agree with the proposal made in the report that special instruments for implementing common minimum standards, such as the decision of the European Commission to restrict the carriage of liquids on board, should expire six months after they have been imposed.
If they are to be extended, they will have to be subjected to a thorough reassessment of the security threat and the costs of the measure.
I voted against those amendments which aimed for the European Aviation Safety Authority to take on a security role.
That is a separate issue and must not be confused.
The strengthening of common air security rules is a key objective of transport policy.
Terrorist threats must be met with clear and precise objectives.
Our objectives must be to guarantee maximum security for passengers and to fight these crimes tenaciously.
Effectiveness, clarity and coherence in the European provisions should therefore be our main objectives.
There are various important issues to resolve, such as the sharing of costs of aviation security, the more restrictive measures implemented by one or more Member States and the transport of liquids on board.
In resolving these issues, however, we must not lose sight of the main objective of guaranteeing the citizens' safety, even if this may sometimes be at the expense of the comfort and punctuality of air transport services.
Our obligation is therefore to strike a balance between these two factors of air transport security and quality.
At the same time, what is the point of high-quality transport if tough security standards are not met?
The purpose of this directive is to create a legislative framework for the assessment and management of flood risks in order to protect human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity.
This aim is to be achieved by means of a three-stage approach.
First, there will be an initial flood risk assessment to identify areas at risk, followed by flood mapping and, thirdly, by the drawing-up of flood risk management plans for river basins.
Without wishing to question the principles and objectives underpinning the proposal before us, what I should like to know is why there has not been a similar instrument set up for the problem of drought, which every year affects millions of EU citizens, with particularly devastating consequences in the agricultural sector and in the water supply to the people.
This omission is all the more serious in view of the recommendation made by Parliament in its resolution of May 2006 on natural disasters, which, among other points, called on the Commission to submit a strategy on drought on which to base a European drought risk prevention and management policy, including strategies for minimising impact.
Accordingly, although we voted in favour of this report, we are very disappointed by this omission and stress the need for a strategy on drought.
When it comes to us in floods, water is a force of nature, endangering our health, the environment, infrastructure and our property.
Water takes no account of borders.
It is important that the EU should use this proposal for a 'directive on the assessment and management of flood risks' to promote more cooperation across borders, which must be founded on the existing plans and designs held by the Member States, which themselves ought to draw on the best available data, procedures and technologies in the field of flood risk management.
I am glad that agreement has been reached on the last outstanding issues, so that the new directive can rapidly come into effect.
Flooding is a constant risk for people who live in river valleys; they can, to some degree, make their properties proof against it.
My neighbouring village in the Moselle valley found its salvation in the building of a protective flood dam, but preventive measures that involve all members of the public are much better and more effective.
In the report, we make reference to the principle of solidarity, which comes into play in villages when the floods come, with everyone helping everyone else, and the volunteers from the fire brigade showing admirable dedication in setting out.
It is this solidarity principle that must be developed and supported, not only in the villages affected by flooding, but across every border too.
Community action on issues relating to climate change are of vital importance for the future.
It is for this reason that I feel that the measures taken by the Community institutions and the Member States cannot be narrow measures focusing on just one aspect of the phenomena, overlooking the rest.
I must therefore advocate integrated measures on climate phenomena.
In voting on the assessment and management of floods, it is clear that we are overlooking the fact that floods go hand in hand with other phenomena such as drought and fire.
in writing. - (FR) This is a nod in the direction of nature: just when an unprecedented heatwave is beating down on northern Europe, in April 2007, the European Parliament has just said 'Yes', this lunchtime, to enhanced coordination between the Member States in the fight against floods.
This is a practical response to the ever more frequent and dramatic natural disasters occurring in our countries: my fellow Belgians will recall the floods of December 2002, and how could we not mention, in this House, the floods that occurred in central and eastern Europe during the summers of 2002 and 2005?
These two tragedies justified the European civil protection mechanism's being activated.
As such, I welcome the role played by the Commission in terms of coordinating the management of major disasters via the Brussels-based Monitoring and Information Centre.
I have a suggestion to make: for the sake of effectiveness, the European centre should be coordinated with the meteorological and hydrological services of the 27 Member States.
In order to prevent Europe from flooding too often, there is an urgent need, in my view, for deforestation, agricultural crops and building permits in flood risk areas to be taken into account in the risk management plans, as requested by the Seeber report.
(SK) We have just voted on a report in which I called for the adoption of a text and amendments which would, both now and in the future, exclude the possibility of all EU Member States being forced to accept the use of human embryos for research and potentially for treatment, and the creation of human-animal hybrids which would be traded for their tissues, and also interventions in the human germline.
From the way the majority of this House has voted, it would appear that for the time being a text has been adopted which is, as yet, ethically neutral, but will only remain so until products based on stem-cell research appear on the market.
As a human being, a father and a doctor, I shall always press for the right of nations not to apply the above-mentioned practices.
I strongly reject any future possibility of trading in human tissues, buying and selling embryos, using eugenics, or eugenically modifying the human genome.
On 23 April the European Commission assured us in Parliament that the commercialisation of the human body is out of the question, because it is covered by European legislation.
I can assure you that I and the European Parliament will be closely watching and monitoring the observance of this principle.
(CS) Parliament has voted for harmonisation in the areas of gene therapy, cell therapy and tissue engineering products.
A central register will integrate the market, cut costs, increase European competitiveness and raise hopes of cures for serious diseases.
So much for the benefits.
As a matter of principle, ladies and gentlemen, I object to the fact that you have refused to set boundaries for experiments with human genes.
European liberals, socialists and the hard left failed to heed the expert opinions of three committees, and rejected our package of amendments outlawing monstrous ideas such as the transplantation of human DNA into animal embryos.
The possibility has also been opened up for the modification of human cells and trading in human bodies.
I would like to know according to what criteria the register in London is going to operate.
How can we meet the objective of the single market when in some old Member States the cloning of human beings with animals and other experiments that threaten human development are not considered crimes?
Unfortunately some countries have yet to ratify the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.
My 'no' at the final vote is an expression of common sense, which says that this is a grossly irresponsible and reckless step.
Today I voted in favour of the package of amendments designed to ensure the inclusion of key ethical safeguards in the legislation on advanced therapy medicinal products.
The amendments aim to protect the principles of non-commercialisation of the human body and its parts through voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells, to prohibit all interventions in the human germline which could be passed on to future generations and to ensure that no material from human-animal hybrid embryos or chimeras would be used in research.
Finally, I welcome the amendment respecting the principle of subsidiarity, which in this case gives legal certainty to Member States to opt out of the use of certain ethically controversial cells.
By giving the green light for the legally-vague regulation of new therapies, the majority of this House has allowed itself to be blinded by an alliance of social democrats, the Commission and the German Government, and in doing so has sold its own values.
It is shameful that Members should wipe from the board the explicit ban on the commercialisation of the human body, on interference with genetic identity and on the production of human-animal hybrids.
The vote was influenced to an enormous degree by intensive lobbying on behalf of the German Government, which, while presiding over the Council, helped to bring about the demolition of the European values highlighted in the Berlin Declaration and to ensure that they were paid no more than lip-service.
Only the proposal by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs (on which I was the rapporteur) for the removal of human embryo stem cells from the scope of the regulation would have assured legal clarity and security.
It is now more than a matter of suspicion that representatives of the German Government wanted to use the European Union to nullify German legislation on stem cells, and the Commission's derogation, which this House now supports in principle, will not stand up in a court of law.
Parliament has today failed to go as far as the prevailing European consensus, expressed in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the directive on biotechnology patents, and has opened the door to people being treated as commercial goods.
We can still hope that other Member States on the Council will be courageous enough to stop the slide in bioethics heralded today and call for a complete turnaround.
Explanation of vote on behalf of Karin Riis-JÃžrgensen, Anne E. Jensen and Niels Busk, Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
A number of ethical amendments have been tabled that are quite superfluous and that, at best, muddy the waters where this matter is concerned.
The principle governing the donation of tissue and stem cells for no payment has already been settled in the Directive on Tissue and Stem Cells.
We support that principle, which applied before and during this vote and which will apply after it.
It is the Member States that have, and should continue to have, competence in the matter of ethical decisions.
We voted for the compromise amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe together with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, because we believe that only if a European regulation on advanced therapies is approved quickly can millions of citizens waiting for effective treatments be helped and the freedom of scientific research be assured.
Doctors and researchers must be able to operate within a framework of legal certainty - one which recognises their work on a European basis and guarantees that treatments will be made available to all patients in need of them.
Parliament has rejected the so-called 'ethical amendments' by a large majority; in actual fact they were anti-science and aimed solely at delaying and preventing the adoption of legislation to make European scientific research more functional and competitive and to give patients hope.
Any self-styled ethical objections are completely overthrown by the fact that the independence of the Member States guarantees them the power to impose restrictions on research, as still happens in Italy regarding the use of embryonic stem cells.
Today's vote, therefore, was just an essential step to ensure that European citizens have equal access to treatments, giving the prospect of hope to all those people who today are forced to undertake expensive journeys to find more suitable treatments, and at the same time enhancing scientific freedom.
Our position on today's vote, and particularly on block 3, reflects a number of factors, including the belief that such matters should be decided at national level and the fact that our party has yet to take a formal position on certain questions which arose in today's vote.
in writing. - (FR) I endorsed all of the amendments in favour of advanced therapies and, in particular, of cell therapy products.
I voted against the amendments tabled by the eternal reactionaries who, on the pretext of protecting the beginnings of life - the embryo - want to ban any recourse to cells from an embryonic source, even an indirect one.
By seeking to make all embryonic cells sacred, those who campaign to protect embryos are forgetting about the life that is there and about the genetic diseases and all the forms of human suffering that could be prevented or reduced thanks to advanced therapies.
Mr President, I have voted in favour of what, for the sake of convenience, I will refer to as the package of the trialogue.
With this legislation and this approach, we wish to give sick or suffering people the opportunity to avail themselves of new, advanced therapies as soon as possible.
I have studied the proposal for a regulation and the amendments in detail, and I have come to the conclusion that we, without undermining the Member States' autonomy, were able to approve this legislation with a clear conscience.
I therefore share the joy of many patients over the fact that the vote has ended favourably.
I approve the report, even though not all the Committee on Legal Affairs' amendments will get through, and not all them are to be seen in a favourable light.
It is sufficient for the ethical issues to be regulated on the basis of subsidiarity.
The regulation almost exclusively applied to products that are ethically uncontentious and must enter into force if the protection of European patients, and their safety, are to be guaranteed.
I am opposed to the exploitation of the human body, or of human body parts, for commercial gain.
in writing. (DE) Not only does the Communists', Socialists' and Liberals' so-called 'compromise package' reject important demands for common ethical standards, but it also makes the Member States impotent as regards their responsibility for national health care provision.
The compromise, as adopted, is not at all suitable to the task in hand.
Small and medium-sized enterprises working together at national level with hospitals, are exempted from the requirement for national licensing, while others are compelled to go to the agency in London.
The compromise has been taken down at the dictation of large-scale industry, in the teeth of the interests of the self-employed and the small and medium-sized business sector.
Not only that, but the Member States are also losing their independence in matters of public health, since it is now to be an agency in England that decides on the licensing of medicines.
This goes against the concept of subsidiarity and national responsibility for such fundamental areas as public health and consumer protection.
The opportunity to lay down fundamental ethical principles for the whole of Europe has been missed.
It was formerly the case that interference in human genetic identity was not supported in Europe and that the commercialisation of the human body and its parts was ipso facto outlawed.
Although the compromise as achieved rejects these principles of respect for human life, there are certain things that are essential and inimical to shabby political compromises, and the manipulation of human life is one of them.
It is for that reason that I have voted against the report.
(DE) Mr President, despite the obvious importance of the protection of intellectual property and its essential role in the success of businesses, I have nonetheless voted against the Zingaretti report.
What the European Union has to do if it wants to take truly seriously the protection of intellectual property as set down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights is to take more action to deal with the infringements of it committed in such places as China, but, instead of at last giving this problem a high profile and doing something about it, it appears that what is sought is to hamper new inventions and to punish as crimes infringements committed in the private sphere without any intention of turning a profit, for that is precisely what the directive would do in its present form.
It is my view that the current vague forms of words could do damage to competition, hinder economic growth, and prepare the way for something akin to censorship.
(CS) I should like to explain why I voted against the Directive on criminalising violations of intellectual property rights.
This started out as a good idea, and I strongly support penalties for counterfeiting and piracy.
Unfortunately, the directive as it has turned out will not help a great deal to combat counterfeiting from Asia.
On the contrary, instead of offering protection for innovative business people, the inconsistency of some paragraphs make them open to misuse in the fight for competitiveness.
Even European business people may in the future be faced with unfair complaints, perhaps from Asian counterfeiters.
The Union should be focusing on enforcing intellectual property rights outside its borders, not on criminalising its own citizens and businesses.
I am opposed to the idea that for the first time in its history the Union will intervene in the criminal law of the Member States.
I do not agree that the Union should enforce criminal liability against legal entities in countries, like the Czech Republic, that do not have this in their law.
I object to the notion that the general public, journalists, scientists and ordinary consumers could be punished under so-called 'derived criminal liability'.
To conclude, I should like to ask for my first vote on Articles 43 and 44 to be changed.
I was in favour, but I pressed the red light by mistake.
in writing. (SV) We voted in favour of Amendments 43 and 44 and against the report in the final vote as we believe that it has not been adequately shown that there are legal grounds under the first pillar for common criminal law provisions in the field of intellectual property law.
The Commission's extensive interpretation of the European Court of Justice's judgment in case C-176/03 has been called into question and cannot, without further investigation, be extended in this way so that it also applies in the area of intellectual property law.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member, Mr Zingaretti, on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
Naturally, the European Commission does not and must not have legal powers except when it comes to negotiating between the peoples.
Criminal justice is the responsibility of the people, not of the European Union.
That does not stop it from drafting directives that send out messages to the Member States with the aim of ensuring that Community law is effective.
Thus, in the field of patents and, on a broader level, intellectual property, there is an urgent need to establish a European legal framework that is reliable and respected.
Instances of counterfeiting, piracy, copying, theft and so on are becoming too serious to go unpunished.
in writing. - (IT) As radical members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this Parliament, we voted together with our group against the Zingaretti report, because we believe that caution and balance are needed when applying criminal provisions for the first time to copyright infringements, but that no room was found for them in the amendments adopted.
Combating international counterfeiting organisations and gangs is certainly a priority, but running the risk of criminalising tens of millions of citizens, perhaps simply exposing those who use the Internet to download music over peer-to-peer networks to summary criminal prosecution, is a policy that is out of touch with reality and also counterproductive, if the objective is to combat criminal organisations.
The ALDE Group had tabled practical amendments to make the report more balanced, by reducing the scope of the directive to copyright and trademarks and clearly indicating aggravating circumstances, such as organised crime or threats to public health or security, that would trigger criminal sanctions.
We had also tried to limit the mandate of the 'joint investigation teams', which would give companies the power to play an active part in investigations and the gathering of evidence.
in writing. (SV) The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has voted against Mr Zingaretti's report on the grounds that, under the EU's treaties, criminal law is a national competence.
In those areas in which the Member States have nonetheless chosen to cooperate in this sphere (for example, certain kinds of cross-border crime), the decisions should be taken by the Council, and the legal basis shall consequently be found under the EU's third, intergovernmental pillar (which covers legal and domestic issues) and not under the first pillar, which consists of supranational EC law.
As long as we do not have a Constitutional Treaty providing fundamental rights at EU level, we cannot have a common European criminal law either.
The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have voted in favour of Amendment 43, tabled by Mr Guidoni, Mr Holm, Mr Pafilis, Mr Remek and Mrs Figueiredo on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
It is the delegation's view that the directive is not of a sufficiently high quality.
While not adequately able to prevent organised crime in this area - which is the aim of the proposal - the directive also fails to provide satisfactory protection for citizens who have inadvertently infringed intellectual property rights.
The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have abstained from the vote on the proposal as a whole as the delegation believes that the proposal is contrary to existing regulations.
The delegation wishes to emphasise, however, that it does support the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
I do not agree with the decision adopted today which seeks to give the European Union the power to impose criminal sanctions on people who breach intellectual property rights.
I hope that the EU Council of Ministers will take an opposing view to that taken by the European Parliament today.
That is because in Ireland we operate what is known as a common legal system, as opposed to the civil code system which operates in many other EU member states.
In Ireland, we operate a judicial system whereby one is presumed innocent until proven guilty, whereas the opposite system operates in many other EU Member States.
We should not allow a system to develop whereby the European Union is given a free hand to impose criminal sanctions in Europe.
The European Court of Justice has said that the EU can impose criminal sanctions for serious breaches of EU environmental law.
But this judgement cannot be interpreted as meaning that the European Union can now impose criminal sanctions for whatever measure it feels like.
We completely oppose the legal basis used by the Commission to present this proposal on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights and are very disappointed that our proposal for a rejection was not adopted.
On the basis of a Court of Justice judgment on the environment - regarding which one might raise a number of questions - the Commission has submitted a proposal for a directive laying down criminal measures that the Member States will be required to adopt in the event of breaches of intellectual property rights.
Criminal law falls exclusively to the Member States.
We therefore feel that the Commission has no powers to submit legislative texts on this issue.
We are disappointed at the rejection of most of our proposals, which were aimed at blocking most of the worst aspects of the Commission's proposal.
The report contains some welcome points, which the majority adopted, but, overall, the negative outweighs the positive.
We also find it unacceptable that, under the Commission's proposal, private firms are to be allowed to take part in criminal investigations.
Hence our vote against the report.
in writing. (SV) The June List has, on a number of occasions, pointed out that criminal law ought not to come within the competence of the EU.
This has, in general, been confirmed by the European Court of Justice's judgment of 13 September 2005 in case C-176/03, in which the Commission opposed the Council.
The rapporteur believes, instead, that initiatives in connection with imposing penalties at EU level are 'perfectly consistent with the Commission's broad interpretation of ... the judgment of the Court of Justice'.
The report is indefensible from a legal point of view.
We are concerned about freedom of expression and the right to exchange information.
Clearly, the Commission and many Members of the European Parliament are giving in to the powerful music and film industries and their special interests.
They are doing so without taking account either of the European Court of Justice's clear interpretation of the EU's powers or of people's need for legal certainty.
Apart from a few amendments that the June List supports, it is difficult to find anything to people's advantage when it comes to the right to freedom of expression and the exchange of information.
We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on those amendments where we had to choose between two evils.
The June List defends copyright protection but believes that the Commission's proposal constitutes a threat to democracy.
The June List is therefore voting against the report as a whole.
I voted against this report as it aimed to impose criminal sanctions on the end users of counterfeit goods, i.e. the consumers.
I believe that it is the producers of these goods, not the consumers, that should be punished.
While the European Parliamentary Labour Party very much supports the work of the rapporteur Mr Zingaretti on the proposal for Criminal Sanctions for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, we continue to have serious reservations on the Commission proposal to rush to extend criminal sanctions to first pillar legislation before the completion of current hearings at the ECJ.
Moreover some of the proposals passed today concerning the definitions of intentional infringement and commercial scale threaten to remove the discretion of trained and qualified national judges to take the circumstances of each individual case into account.
Such decisions are best left to national courts and national judges who have a wealth of experience in dealing with such cases.
The text as voted by Parliament runs the risk of potentially putting innocent consumers in prison, while at the same time creating loopholes for individual criminals engaged in organised and serious crime.
The compromise which the rapporteur agreed will lead to legal uncertainty and remove an essential power of discretion from judges and national courts.
For this reason the Labour MEPs have voted against this
in writing. - (EL) The directive is an attempt to reinstate 'under the table' major reactionary provisions of the 'Euroconstitution', which has been condemned by the people.
The European Commission and the European Parliament are blatantly attempting to annul the principle of unanimity of Member States in order to adopt penal measures on EU level, abolishing one of the basic principles of national sovereignty of its Member States.
On the other hand, the content of the Directive, which was adopted in the European Parliament by the notorious 'sacred alliance' between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the socialists and the liberals, is nothing more than a conformance to the provocative demands of monopolies to dominate, without barriers, the sector of intellectual creativity.
With the intentional vagueness in the definitions of infringement 'offences' of intellectual property rights, the imposition of harsh penalties (minimum imprisonment of four years and a fine of EUR 300 000 minimum) and the unprecedented privatisation of criminal proceedings through the provision for the participation of large corporations in judicial and police inquiries with regards to the violation of their rights, there is a clear attempt of the monopolies to exert rigorous control Î¿n all sectors of intellectual creativity.
The EU has even penalised free access of workers to intellectual creations so as to stifle this sector of human creativity and boost the profits of euro-unifying capital.
According to the proposal for a directive on criminal measures to guarantee the enforcement of intellectual property rights, Member States are required to penalise every deliberate violation of intellectual property rights if these actions take place on a commercial scale.
Forgeries and piracy are clearly punishable offences.
So far, so good.
I refuse to back the Zingaretti report, though, and for a variety of reasons.
The limitative list of property rights increases legal uncertainty.
It is unacceptable for businesses to be discouraged from innovation, creativity and investments if it transpires that the businesses violated these rights unintentionally, and for them to be immediately prosecuted under criminal law.
In addition, the concept of 'commercial scale' has been left rather vague.
Would a busker fall within this scope?
Is personal use excluded?
There are also serious questions in my mind about subsidiarity and proportionality.
It is not up to the EU to specify the nature and level of the penalties, certainly not if personal freedoms are involved, and, although the report, in its Article 7, proposes enquiry teams for the benefit of collective copyright managers, the privatisation of criminal prosecution is not an option either.
People are entitled to unambiguous legislation, and this report fails to hit the mark in this respect.
European policy in the area of maritime safety has been at the top of the European political agenda since 1999.
The disasters of the Erika in 1999 and the Prestige in 2002 tragically demonstrated the extent to which European policy and the strategies of the Member States in the event of a shipwreck have fallen short of what is required.
I feel that this report will help enhance the safety and effectiveness of maritime traffic as a whole.
As regards the implications for the fisheries sector, the report is in my view a balanced one, and provides protection for smaller fishing vessels that do not appear to be obliged to install the Automatic Identification System.
I shall be voting in favour of this report.
We broadly welcome the proposal to install a vessel traffic monitoring and information system with a view to preventing accidents and enhancing the safety of maritime traffic.
We cannot, however, accept some of the proposed amendments, for example that of handing over the power of decision on the accommodation of ships in distress to a so-called 'independent authority', which will not be independent at all, given the conflict of interests involved, as was the case with the Prestige disaster including the name of the port of refuge.
This is a responsibility that lies with each of the Member States.
It is for the national authorities of each Member State to manage the Exclusive Economic Areas under its sovereignty.
The Member States are responsible for ensuring the management of their maritime resources.
We therefore propose that any initiative in the framework of Community-level maritime transport safety - at least, initiatives that we feel are relevant and necessary - should form part of the framework of cooperation between the Member States, without infringing on their sovereign powers.
Despite attempts by many Eurosceptic UKIP colleagues to demonise this report, I will be voting for it on the basis that the attempt by the Commission and rapproteur to extend its remit to include inland waterways is rejected.
As for the inclusion of domestic sea transport, the rules incorporated here already apply largely to the United Kingdom.
Thus this poses no threat to ferry services in my region, be it to the Scilly Isles or Lundy, nor will the international dimension have an impact on services from Gibraltar.
I see no reason why ultimately travellers on board ship should not have the same levels of protection as those that travel by train or plane.
Broadly speaking, we welcome this proposal on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea.
It is a proposal that is mainly aimed at taking account of the rights of passengers at sea, in keeping with what currently happens in air transport.
For example, according to the proposal before us, carriers must have insurance that can be activated in the event of an accident.
It also broadens the extent of liability of the carriers as regards the levels of financial compensation to be awarded to passengers in the event of an accident.
What is less welcome is that in today's vote, inland waterway transport was removed from the scope of this regulation.
We feel that the need to create this kind of instrument is also related to the gradual lowering of safety standards, which, in turn, is the result of the removal or reduction of state carriers and the upsurge in private operators.
The latter often fail to comply with standards of quality and working conditions, as exemplified by the increasing use of unstable working contracts.
Respect for passenger safety goes hand in hand with respect for workers' rights.
I voted for this report to give protection in the case of accidents at sea.
In particular, however, I voted against those amendments which sought to exclude inland waterways from the legislation, as I feel that there is a difference in liability cover between accidents at sea and those on water such as rivers.
I voted in favour of taking inland waterways out of the scope of this Directive for a number of reasons.
Firstly, this report was introduced to facilitate adequate liabilities for seagoing ships, not inland waterways including river and estuary crossings.
Secondly, any extension of the scope of this proposal to include inland waterways would have caused severe problems not only on the leisure-based inland waterways of the UK but also on many river crossings that provide an essential public service as part of the public transport network.
Thirdly, bringing estuary crossings into this legislation would have added a considerable cost burden on operators, bringing into question the very viability of some of the operations.
I was surprised that the Liberal Democrats supported the move to include inland waterways, as this could have adversely affected the operations of ferries across the river Mersey, which they purport to support.
Thankfully the plenary, in its wisdom, has now overturned the view of our Liberal rapporteur and removed the problems that I have alluded to.
This means I can gladly vote for the report as amended by plenary.
Along with my colleagues in the European Parliamentary Labour Party I voted to exclude inland waterways from these measures.
It was successfully carried in the face of opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who wanted to include these small craft, leading to disproportionate costs, reducing economic viability and a loss of service.
I particularly condemn the outrageous press releases prior to these votes suggested by certain political parties, which raised false worries and concerns.
Of course operators such as Isle of Wight ferries may have been forced to consider their economic liability because of such opportunist press releases.
It is therefore welcome that, as I said before, no such measures will be introduced.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mrs Vlasto, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on port State control.
I am not a specialist in the subject, but I welcome the important work done by Mrs Vlasto to uphold a balanced position in the legislation on the inspection of vessels entering a European Union port.
Everyone realises, in view - I am sorry to say - of the accidents that have occurred, that flag State control must be supplemented by port State control.
Mrs Vlasto's recast - which is far more ambitious than that which was initially proposed by the European Commission - of the directive will enable us to make ever more progress in the field of maritime safety in the interests of the coasts of Europe, the environment, businesses and the citizens.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this text.
This report raises the subject of the debate on potential improvements to the EU's competitive environment, not least in relation to private damages actions and damages for breaches of competition law referred to the civil jurisdictions.
I endorse the idea that it should be made easier to bring such damages actions.
The objective is to 'promote competition, not judicial activism'.
It would be appropriate to encourage swift out-of-court settlements.
Ninety per cent of the disputes between professionals and consumers are settled out of court.
Companies have a tendency to compromise, even when they are not accountable, so as to avoid a long judicial procedure.
It would be helpful if Europe were not directly to import the American-style procedural model.
We must therefore give precedence to alternative methods of dispute settlement.
If we all think of the major groups that will be affected in this way, SMEs are clearly not protected.
We must therefore remain vigilant in order to ensure that their survival is not jeopardised.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on a thematic strategy for the sustainable use of natural resources.
No one can continue to dispute that our natural resources are under threat.
The current growth in the world's population - one billion people in the space of 12 years, bringing today's population up to 6.5 billion - on its own warrants the attention that we must pay to our natural resources.
While the report could have been more ambitious, structured and well-documented, it remains a fine document to be assigned to this difficult matter of sustainable development.
in writing. (SV) We have today voted against this report.
Its main message is that we need drastically to reduce our use of natural resources and that the best way of bringing about such a reduction is far-reaching political regulation.
We Swedish Conservatives have our doubts about that.
We believe instead that the sustainable use of natural resources requires clear ownership rights, permitting a use of natural resources that is governed by market mechanisms rather than by political decisions.
The use of natural resources within a market economy does far more to encourage thrift and technological development than do political regulations.
Human life and creativity aim to leave an imprint.
The triumph of humanity is that we have developed ideas and technology that have increased productivity and reduced world poverty by two thirds in 50 years.
We Swedish Conservatives believe that, through production and trade, we can not only put an end to poverty but also improve our environment.
It is precisely technology and prosperity that provide us with the will and the methods to do just that.
The Commission's proposal on the strategy for natural resources is too narrow, as pointed out by Mrs Liotard, rapporteur and member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
She has sought to extend its scope by means of the proposals she has tabled.
The proposal deals with essential elements such as water, trees, soil and oil, which are vital not only to our economy but also to our very existence.
Accordingly, we welcome the adoption of her report, which advocates sustainable economic development along with a fair and equitable share of the benefits arising from natural resources and from access to resources and markets, in order to reduce poverty and to enhance people's well-being.
We are disappointed, however, that not all of her proposals, which we supported, we incorporated into the final resolution.
We welcome the inclusion of proposals calling for reuse alongside recycling, for the Commission to promote technologies conducive to durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable products, and for the principle of proximity to be upheld in all legislation.
in writing. (SV) I am voting in favour of tax switching as a principle, even though it is poorly described in the text.
I believe that tax on capital and consumption promotes prosperity and justice and that the EU should allow the Member States to switch from one form of tax to another.
in writing. (SV) I have today chosen to support Amendment 3 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to Mrs Liotard's report on the sustainable use of natural resources.
I support the principle of reorganising the tax levy, so that growth-impeding taxes on labour, capital and consumption are replaced by taxes on activities that harm the environment.
There should also be a switch from tax on labour to tax on alcohol and tobacco.
I was unable, however, to support Mrs Liotard's report as a whole because of a number of unfortunate statements it includes.
For example, it identifies the long-distance transport of agricultural products and retail goods as undesirable.
The trade of which such transport is a result has helped lift millions of people out of poverty.
What should instead be limited are the emissions to which such transport gives rise.
I will be supporting this report.
One issue Europe must deal with urgently is the US request to establish Theatre Missile Defence facilities on our eastern border.
These proposals threaten to destabilise our relations with Russia, encourage them to modernise and update their own missiles and nuclear weapons, while at the same time driving them to rather than deterring them from producing an Islamic bomb.
Europe's reaction will be an important test of our ability to project our own foreign policy interests, rather than acquiesce in the US neo-conservative agenda that threatens us all.
The resolution on transatlantic relations - undersigned by the Right and the Social Democrats and adopted today by the majority in Parliament - is a useful snapshot of the current state of EU-USA relations.
The majority in Parliament has set the agenda and its priorities, of which I should like to highlight the following:
'welcomes the improved climate of EU-US relations on an equal basis' and expresses the desire to share responsibilities in what is termed 'global governance';
'strengthening the transatlantic market', with the liberalisation of financial services a 'key issue', and calling for 'regulatory convergence and a level playing field, in view of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment';
the affirmation of 'serious opportunities for the EU and US to work closely together' in relation to 'the Western Balkans, the South Caucasus region, Central Asia, the Middle East, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean, Latin America and Africa';
strengthening cooperation in the context of what it calls 'fighting terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction' as 'the greatest security challenges for both partners', with NATO a 'transatlantic forum for political debate in a true partnership of equals'.
This agenda expresses the ambitions of the major European capitalist powers, in particular Germany, in relation to the USA.
I have voted against the resolution on transatlantic relations because it is my conviction that those relations must be based on common values that the United States have shown themselves not to respect on numerous occasions, as demonstrated by the failure of President Bush's militarist foreign policy, one example of which are the plans that locate missiles in certain European Union countries.
The United States administration is responsible for serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Afghanistan, Iraq and GuantÃ¡namo and for illegal detentions and renditions in the case of the CIA flights.
Total respect for international law should be an absolute condition in relations between the EU and the United States.
In the case of Iraq, we should demand the withdrawal of troops and respect for natural resources.
The EU should demand that the US ratify the different international treaties, such as the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel mines and the Kyoto Protocol.
The EU should also condemn the illegality of the Helms Burton Law and the United States' trade embargo on Cuba.
As the resolution correctly points out, transatlantic relations have improved considerably in recent years.
They have regained the quality that one would hope, although they could never be entirely devoid of problems and difficulties, and nor would one want them to be.
It is necessary to invest in this good relationship.
When one looks around at the old world of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, or at the new world that emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the advent of globalisation, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that the United States remains our biggest ally, our best friend and our partner in the business of making the world a freer and better-developed place.
The importance of the alliance with the United States of America is unquestionable and without parallel, and must not be jeopardised by political outlooks that have always been underpinned by the idea that the USA is the problem, rather than a vital part of the axis of peace, prosperity, democracy and freedom.
On a broader level, I wish to express my agreement with the speech by the leader of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in Parliament, in which he advocated the creation of a large transatlantic market by 2015 and called on parliaments on both sides of the Atlantic to become more involved in preparing the legislative groundwork for this to materialise.
Relations between the European Union and the United States of America have proven very fruitful over the last decade.
In particular, financial services is a very positive issue whereby administrations and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have seen real progress.
If the aims of the OECD Working Paper of 29 May 2005 - which was adopted by both sides - can be put into practice, there would be great benefits.
The barriers it mentions, if removed, would lead to growth of over 3% GNI each year, year-on-year.
The transatlantic marketplace needs hard work from both sides.
Failure to do so, however, means leaving our industries behind and our peoples at economic risk in the global environment.
My meeting with the President of India meant that I was unable to vote on this resolution.
As a strong supporter of the transatlantic relationship, I would have voted in favour.
However, I strongly object to what has become a regular and very dangerous sleight of hand in EU policy documents - the displacement of our national governments by the EU, in this instance in its efforts to become the single 'partner' of the US in the transatlantic relationship.
This has particular significance for the UK.
This language also appears in the reference to NATO.
Furthermore, it should be recalled that the idea of a transatlantic single market was a British Conservative initiative going back many years and included in more recent reports through my own amendment.
As I see no justification for European Parliament offices in other countries, I certainly oppose the costly proposal, in paragraph 40, of a permanent European Parliament official post in Washington DC.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to make a few brief comments on the progress report on Croatia.
Now that it has allowed Slovenes to buy property there, Croatia has discharged its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and so this point of contention ought to have been laid to rest.
A certain amount of progress has also been made on addressing the issue of war crimes, and, finally, even the Committee of the Regions, in the report it adopted yesterday, observed that Croatia's accession would bring only minor financial effects in its wake.
I take the view, then, that it is a disgrace that Croatia, which undoubtedly belongs to the European family of peoples and complies with all the conditions required for accession, has been strung along for so long.
Instead of wasting our time on Turkey, which is neither able nor willing to comply with the EU's requirements, yet nevertheless is impertinent enough to demand that it be given a date for its accession, I do believe that all our energies should be concentrated on bringing the negotiations with Croatia to a prompt conclusion.
- (PL) Mr President, we have just adopted a highly important report on the steps taken by Croatia to join the 27 EU Member States.
There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that Croatia belongs to our European homeland and that it should soon become a full member of the Community.
While some countries react negatively to further enlargement to include Turkey or Ukraine, and despite the need to reform the EU institutions so that they can function smoothly, the process of integration that started 50 years ago cannot be halted.
I am convinced that Croatia will continue with the reforms it has begun, including in the fields of justice, administration and fighting corruption, which will allow it to meet all political and economic conditions for EU Membership, particularly the Copenhagen criteria and the conditions laid down for the stabilisation and association process.
I hope that Croatia will be the 28th member of the EU, something which I wish both for the country and for all of us.
in writing. (SV) We are of the view that EU enlargement is a good thing.
Enlargement cannot happen, however, until the candidate countries in fact fulfil all the membership requirements imposed.
The latest enlargement, when Romania and Bulgaria became members, happened far too early because the countries and their systems were not ready for membership.
Croatia too has a long way to go, for example in terms of reforming its public administration and judicial system, before membership can become a reality.
It is encouraging to see that progress is being made, but, for the sake of both Croatia and the EU, this important and irrevocable process should not be carried through too quickly.
Moreover, it is depressing that the European Parliament is using something as important as enlargement in order undemocratically to engage in propaganda for an EU Constitution.
Recital G states that the current draft Constitutional Treaty should enter into force, in spite of the fact that the populations of France and the Netherlands are clearly and unambiguously opposed to it.
Paragraph 7 points out, moreover, that there is 'flagging public support for EU accession in Croatia'.
If that is the case and if the majority of Croatians are opposed to EU membership, it is only democratic that Croatia should not accede to the EU.
We have consequently voted against this report.
After being at the forefront of the disintegration of Yugoslavia - and let us not forget Germany's role in recognising Croatia following NATO's brutal attack in which war returned to the European continent for the first time since World War II - and after years of the EU/NATO's military occupation of the Balkans, the (major powers of the) EU are now anxious to move on to a new phase of domination by absorbing the countries of this key region, politically and economically, by means of their 'integration'.
As regards the objectives set out in the report, I should like to highlight the following:
the attempt to make new rounds of EU enlargement conditional upon the spurious need to reform the Treaties, which would lead to the (re)imposition of the so-called 'Constitutional Treaty'.
the constant emphasis on the adoption of the Community acquis, or in other words the neoliberal 'open and competitive market' handbook - thereby gearing an autonomous national development project to the interests of the major powers and their large financial and economic groups - and on Croatia's implementation of 'reforms' such as opening up to 'strong private investment' and the 'sale of minority and majority state-owned interests in companies';
This demonstrates that, quite typically, it is not the interests of the workers and the people of the region that is motivating the EU.
I voted for this report, which congratulates Croatia on some of the changes it has made in meeting the criteria for accession.
Unfortunately, my group did not have any speaking time on the subject of Croatia this morning.
We regret that the negotiations with that country have been seriously delayed as a result of the war in the 90s and that it was impossible for that country to enter the EU together with Slovenia.
Croatia is no longer dominated by extreme nationalists, and accepts the protection and return of minorities; although it is now better prepared for EU membership than some countries that have already joined, it is mainly put at a disadvantage because some within the EU refuse to admit new Member States as long as the EU Constitution that was thrown out by the Dutch and French electorate is not being introduced.
Indignant about this delay, Croatian public opinion is now turning its back on the EU.
My group regards as extreme the demands made in the Swoboda report for the sale of state-owned companies and the closure of shipyards.
So far, it has always been claimed that the EU has no preference in respect of ownership in the economy, and that state-owned companies and private companies can freely co-exist.
Newcomers, however, are now likely to have to meet stiff demands.
My group also rejects all amendments that are based on Italian claims on Croatian territory and on the denial of the war crimes during the occupation under Mussolini.
in writing. (PL) I am voting in favour of the report by Hannes Swoboda on Croatia's progress in 2006.
The rapporteur has made an insightful analysis of the present political, economic and social situation in Croatia.
The report is objective in that while on the one hand it points out the efforts the Croatian Government has made to meet the requirements of the EU, for example, in relation to the political criteria for accession, it also enumerates the problems that still need to be solved.
An important element in this is the implementation of the acquis communautaire to the national legal system in all areas, considering that the joint consultation process was successfully completed in October 2006, and negotiations on specific aspects of the acquis are now underway
The rapporteur also rightly pointed out the positive leading role that Croatia is playing in South-Eastern Europe.
British Conservatives supported the Swoboda report but voted against amendments relating to Recital G. Conservatives are strong supporters of enlargement of the EU, in particular to include Croatia, which will be a relatively smooth process, but are strongly opposed to the idea that a Constitution is a requirement for further enlargement as stated in Recital G.
in writing. - (FR) Shortly after the 'Erika' and 'Prestige' oil tankers went down, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament led a campaign calling for the EU to provide itself with legislation aimed at enhancing maritime safety and at doing more to prevent accidental pollution in its territorial waters.
This campaign has borne fruit, but a genuine European maritime safety area has not fully been created.
This 'third maritime safety package' is a decisive step towards achieving this objective.
The five reports submitted to the European Parliament contain several major advances:
a clear and precise legal framework for places of refuge for ships in distress, under the aegis of an independent authority;
a permanent inspection body, to make inspections easier;
a high level of protection for passengers, in line with that for other modes of transport;
more effective and higher quality controls in European ports, with special attention paid to 'high-risk' vessels.
I shall therefore vote in favour of these reports.
I hope from now on that the EU will also improve its legislation against the 'hooligans of the sea', who are responsible in the Mediterranean for 'daily oil slicks'. There are 650 000 tonnes of oil spills each year as a result of unauthorised degassing, a figure that equates to 75 'Erikas'!

Ukraine (debate)
We shall proceed to the next item on the agenda. This is the Council and Commission statements on Ukraine.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we very much welcome your decision to put discussion of the current situation in Ukraine and also the European Union's relations with that country on the agenda.
Ukraine's importance in terms of European stability is not to be underestimated, and so I am glad of the opportunity to express the Council Presidency's position with regard to it.
The Orange Revolution was an impressive demonstration of the power of civil society movements in Eastern Europe, and the democratic parliamentary elections in March 2006, being largely free and fair, were an example for other states in the region to follow.
This is not, however, the first time that Ukraine has found itself at a very difficult point in the course of its difficult process of transition and transformation.
It has experienced the Orange Revolution, which was in itself the critical culmination of a political dispute, followed by the political wrangling and difficulties relating to the formation of a coalition and a government following the March 2006 parliamentary elections, which were a debate on the country's internal and external orientation, and now President Yushchenko's decree of 2 April 2007 dissolving the parliament, together with the refusal by the government and parliament to obey it.
The attitude of both sides is causing considerable constitutional misgivings in Ukraine itself, with the Ukrainian parliament appealing to the constitutional court to rule on the constitutionality of the President's decree dissolving it.
While the Council is of course following events in Kiev with close attention, they are also a cause of great concern to it.
The European Union has been in close contact with both parties in the conflict since the crisis broke; Mr Solana has spoken with them on several occasion and has made them aware of the European Union's position, and our Presidency, on the day after the decree of dissolution was published, urged moderation and readiness for dialogue on the basis of democratic rules and the Ukrainian constitution.
Our Presidency has also been in close contact with the groups involved in the crisis and with protagonists on both sides, and the European Union will build on those contacts.
The Ukrainian constitutional court has been presented with a difficult task, and will be able to perform it only if it is enabled to come to a decision on the constitutionality of the dissolution of parliament without being made subject to external pressure.
If the political crisis is to have a long-term solution, however, political compromises will be necessary, and so we are glad to see that both President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yanukovych are no less willing to engage in dialogue than they were, and welcome the assurances given by both sides to the effect that violence is not even being considered as a means of settling the conflict.
Our expectation is that both sides will abide by their public statements and the assurances given by them to the European Union in order to prevent any further escalation of the crisis.
Whatever changes may come about in the political environment in Kiev, democracy, free and fair elections, the free expression of opinion and the freedom of the press remain the basis underpinning political and social life, and that is one reason why we are confident that Ukraine will find a way out of this political crisis that is consistent with our shared conceptions of democracy and of the rule of law, one that will enable Ukraine to continue to be able to count on the support of the European Union.
Mr President, honourable Members, I thank you for the invitation to make a statement on relations between the European Union and Ukraine.
This debate is of the utmost importance and is of greater contemporary relevance than ever for various reasons, one of which is the fact that we, on 5 March, commenced negotiations on a new and extended agreement that is intended to put our relations with Ukraine on a new footing.
Another is the way in which the domestic political situation in Ukraine is developing.
It is of the utmost importance in terms of the further entrenchment of democratic conditions in that country and of the continuity of its reform process that a solution be found to the present crisis.
The Commission has kept an attentive eye on the latest developments in Ukrainian domestic politics, observing with concern the way in which President Yushchenko's dissolution of parliament has resulted in deeper division between him and Mr Yanukovych, the Prime Minister.
It matters a great deal to us that Ukraine should pursue its course of reform, moving closer to complete democratisation, stability and prosperity.
Ukraine, and its future in Europe, depend absolutely on stability, which is vital to the European Union too, for it, along with prosperity, is what we need in the countries around us.
What is happening at the moment is that the maturity of Ukrainian democracy is being tested.
Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission said, when he met President Yushchenko last week, that there was, in a democracy, no political problem for which a political solution in harmony with the law could not be found, and the frank political debate and the - so far - largely peaceful demonstrations on the streets of Kiev are evidence of the fact that the Ukrainian people understand that internal political disputes have to be settled in a responsible and democratic manner.
What is crucial is that all the relevant political forces should work together in a constructive manner and work honestly towards a political solution, adhering completely, as they do so, to the principles of democracy and of the rule of law, and all of them must obey the democratic ground rules, take action to deal with corruption, respect the independence of the Constitutional Court and obey its rulings.
Ukraine is also in need of a long-term process - one in which everyone can take part and which will lead to a constitutional reform founded on a new-style political compromise - that will equip the political system with clear mechanisms of control and regulation.
While it cannot be part of the European Union's role to intervene in this crisis by mediating directly between factions, we can and should appeal to the cautious and rational instincts of all those involved in Ukrainian politics in urging them to hammer out a compromise together.
That is the message we should be sending out in the confidence that the young Ukrainian democracy will pass this test and that its politicians will continue to work for the good of the country and for its future relations with the European Union.
Since what was known as the 'orange revolution' and the adoption of the EU/Ukraine action plan, the EU and Ukraine have come much closer together, and relations between them have improved.
Ukraine is an example of just how successful the European neighbourhood policy can be; our political dialogue has deepened to an appreciable degree, and there has been a constant increase in the sectors in which we cooperate.
We have decided to increase the support grant under the new European neighbourhood and partnership instrument to EUR 120 million per annum, have initialled the agreement on visa facilitation and returns, and, on the trade front, are preparing extensive measures that, taken together with the new and wider-ranging agreement, will move us closer to a free trade zone.
We have just started to do something about putting our relations on an even closer footing, for it was on 5 March that the Commission commenced negotiations with Ukraine on the new and extended agreement, which, it is intended, should, when concluded, reflect the significance of relations between us and open up new perspectives, among them the prospect of a deeper partnership in the energy sector.
A second round of negotiations followed in Kiev on 2 and 3 April.
The talks progressed to our complete satisfaction, in that it proved possible to achieve substantial progress, and the Ukrainian side demonstrated considerable commitment to them.
It is the Commission's intention that the negotiations on the new and extended agreement should be continued as planned, for Ukraine is a key partner for the European Union, and we continue in our firm determination to further develop and put on an even firmer footing our relations with this important neighbour.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, the political crisis in Kiev is a matter of concern to those who welcome the political progress made since the Orange Revolution.
Let me remind those here of the leading and pioneering role played by Parliament in 2004.
It is vital that today's situation be resolved in line with the rule of law and democratic principles consistent with European values and, above all, in accordance with the democratically expressed wishes of the Ukrainian people.
In my view, we could have done more to prevent this crisis from developing, notably by providing more substantial moral and financial support to help Ukraine overcome the very difficult political legacy of its Soviet past.
We must devote every effort to the task of nurturing and encouraging Ukraine's democratic gains.
It is now time for Europe to engage in a more committed and consistent manner.
A new enhanced agreement should establish relations between the EU and Ukraine on a new, reinforced basis commensurate with the challenges posed by reality.
The European Union must understand and acknowledge the context in which this crisis has arisen.
There is little use calling for Ukraine's leaders to reach a sensible internal settlement when not all the sides in the conflict are willing to share power, and the normal constitutional mechanisms have fallen into disrepair.
Some may use the crisis in Ukraine as a pretext for not doing anything, claiming that the situation there creates an obstacle to more serious engagement on our part.
That is exactly the opposite of what we should do.
The difficult internal situation is a challenge to the Union to set out a practical course of engagement for resolving the crisis, which might as such have wider implications for Europe.
It is high time to do more for Ukraine.
Tangible progress has been made since the Orange Revolution, but may be wasted if it is not further pursued.
Let us support Ukraine in its European choice.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we too are worried about the ongoing political instability in Ukraine.
The situation that has arisen out of a conflict between the President and parliament is not doing the country any favours, and will undoubtedly affect cooperation between it and the European Union.
As long as the country is in a constitutional impasse, it will be difficult to hold further discussions on closer cooperation, let alone to make concrete progress.
I do not think, though, that we should be persuaded to think that this crisis could cancel out the results of the drastic events of the winter of 2005 and 2006, when the Orange Revolution brought about fundamental democratisation of Ukraine, so that it is today a considerably different country from what it was before that, and the European Union has played a major, helpful role in this.
At the same time, though, it has to be said that this Orange Revolution has not managed to bridge the huge divisions in Ukraine, and there is as yet no consensus on the course that the country should take.
The current conflict is an expression of discord within it.
It also reflects the apparent failure, at any time, to strike a balance between the role of the different political players, the power of the different institutions and the varying views of the country's future.
It is not in the first instance up to us to choose sides now.
At this moment in time, the case is already before the Constitutional Court in Kiev, and at this moment in time, I cannot see any really good reason to doubt its ability to pronounce a correct verdict about the right institutional balance, for it has proven before that it can act independently.
The lion's share of the responsibility, however, lies with the political players and the political class.
Without a compromise on their part, a constitutional solution will not work either, so they will have to do everything in their power to invest in a compromise that brings the groups closer together rather than driving them further apart.
This is where the European players can, and indeed must, play a mediating role, and I welcome the comment Mr Gloser made in this connection.
It is in our interest too, because muddling along as they currently are not only produces losers in Ukraine, it also turns the EU into a loser, because we can only play our role there with some difficulty.
The challenge is now to overcome internal inconsistencies, so that they can carry on with the reforms needed to forge closer ties with the EU, and to flesh out Ukraine's own ambition of becoming a Member State of the European Union.
This is the only credible basis on which the ambition that all political parties have in common can be achieved.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) The Ukraine is a strategically important partner of the European Union.
We have a fundamental interest in the Ukraine being a stable and democratic country with a functioning market economy.
This is why we supported and followed with great hope the events of the Orange Revolution. Unfortunately, the period since then has proven that the country's democratic, social and economic transformation is much more complex and contradictory than we had hoped.
The current crisis is another sign that this is the case.
The crisis in the Ukraine is fundamentally a matter of internal politics, and therefore the solution will have to be found within the Ukrainian internal political sphere, by Ukrainian politicians, through peaceful negotiations.
We can help in this by our active neutrality.
We are neutral with regard to the parties to the debate, but not with regard to the outcome of the debate.
For it is in our interest that ultimately the Ukraine be a stable, democratic state governed by the rule of law and nurturing close relations with Europe.
We cannot expect much from the Ukrainian Constitutional Court by way of providing a solution to the conflict, since it is itself a part of the problem.
The greatest responsibility therefore rests on the internal political forces within the Ukraine and on the country's politicians.
At the moment there are discussions between the European Union and the Ukraine with a view to closer collaboration. These discussions are moving along smoothly.
Our interests are that these discussions meet with success as soon as possible, but the leaders of the Ukraine have to understand that ties between their country and the European Union will only be strong if the Ukraine finds its way back to the path from which the recent crisis has diverted it.
Therefore we emphasise that a solution to the internal crisis has to be found as quickly as possible by means of peaceful negotiations, and that we are happy to be of assistance in seeking such a solution.
We will assist any process that leads to the consolidation of a democratic Ukraine.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President.
The development of events in Ukraine is of particular interest to the European Parliament, and not only because Ukraine is a state neighbouring Europe.
Although Ukraine, at least in the near future, is not regarded as an applicant country to the European Union, nonetheless the successful development of democratic processes and the growing economic potential of the country in the medium term does not rule out such a possibility.
The development of democratic processes in Ukraine, its integration into the world economy and the multi-faceted development of relations with the European Union created strong foundations for steering the country's internal political contradictions towards constructive solutions and for uniting Ukrainian society.
The current political crisis is a touchstone for the degree of development of democracy in Ukraine and its resolution will determine the direction of the country's future development.
The European Union must encourage the movement of Ukraine's warring political factions in the direction of compromise.
Political rivals need to be able to reach an agreement on eliminating shortcomings in constitutional reform, in order for these reforms to be directed towards preserving the balance between institutions of the national government and in order to ensure the stability of the state's political system.
Solutions to the political crisis should be based on democratic methods, including early elections, which would give the Ukrainian people the final word in the resolution of the political crisis.
Thank you.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, if you want to judge how far Ukraine has progressed in becoming a democracy, all you have to do these days is to look at Moscow and Kiev both at the same time; a comparison between them shows that light years separate the two in terms of respect for democracy, and that, confusion and disorder notwithstanding, it is in a much more stable state in Kiev than one could have hoped three or four years ago.
It is because Europe - as everyone who has spoken so far has said - has such a great interest in Ukraine's development as a stable democracy that I do not want to take a neutral view of President Yushchenko's decision; I think he is right in his political reasoning behind the calling of new elections.
If a political force such as the Party of Regions announces its desire to unite under its banner three hundred votes in the Ukrainian Parliament, then the President is perfectly entitled to declare that they, if they want that sort of majority, will have to seek it through the ballot box.
I believe that these elections are necessary, that President Yushchenko was right to bring political matters to a head, and that this is in Europe's interests too, but, when these new elections are actually held, all the parties must accept their outcome and do much more to make the constitutional reforms, which have been promised for so long and put on the back burner, actually happen.

Something I would like to add for the benefit of the Members from Poland, since Warsaw is Ukraine's principal advocate in the EU, is that Warsaw, where Ukraine is concerned, really is being very continental, very European, in its approach, and I wish that our Polish Members - with whom I share many points of agreement - would show evidence of this European approach, this continental thinking in other matters of dispute, for that would make it possible for us, once more, to pursue a good Eastern policy, not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries to the East of us.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if the president of a state is to dissolve its parliament, it goes without saying that he has to do that in accordance with the rules laid down in that state's constitution, and, just as President Yushchenko is perfectly entitled to do that under Article 90 of the Ukrainian constitution, which lays down in clear and precise terms the conditions under which a parliament can be dissolved, in the same way, the parliament itself has the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court and say that it takes a different view, that this article is not being applied consistently with the text of the constitution.
That is why democratic societies have the separation of the powers, which guarantees that, at the end of the day, it is the judicial power that determines how the text is to be interpreted.
That is, then, in the first instance, a legal opinion rather than a political one.
By the same token, any member of parliament is perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment on whether or not it is a good thing when members change sides, and I would like to remind you that groups in this House, too, have been formed and reformed, that members of it have left one group and joined another; such a thing is perfectly normal in many countries within the European Union.
Members of the Ukrainian parliament do not take instructions directly from those who elect them, and, for as long as that is the case, they can be required to take moral responsibility, but cannot be pursued in the courts.
Mrs Harms is right; there is a very considerable difference between Moscow and Kiev, and I would ask her to call to mind how the late Boris Yeltsin, when he was the Russian President, had troops fire on the Russian Parliament for not doing what he wanted it to do.
That sort of thing is not happening in Ukraine, where there are democratic forces to prevent it, and a good job too!
What I find intermittently disturbing in this debate is that we are in too much of a hurry to pigeon-hole the rival parties, making the assumption that President Yushchenko is the one the European Union can do business with, that the Prime Minister, Mr Yanukovych, is Russia's protÃ©gÃ© and represents Russian interests, that it is obvious that the two are of different nationalities, the one being Ukrainian and the other Russian.
The fact is, though, that they are both Ukrainian citizens and both of them represent that country's interests; that they differ in their ideas as to how they should go about that is perfectly normal and is regarded as such in every Member State of the European Union.
I think, then, that there are four things we have to do.
Firstly, we have to ask that the decision from the Constitutional Court be forthcoming in the immediate future.
Secondly, we should be thinking and talking about the possibility of sending a delegation to Ukraine.
Thirdly, it might also be possible to invite all the groups in the Verkhovna Rada to come here and have a debate.
Fourthly, we could also invite the sparring protagonists to come here on the same day in order to debate the matter together; we do not want to have Mr Yanukovych coming here on one day, with Mrs Timoshenko arriving on the next, and Mr Yushchenko turning up the day after that, when what we want instead is a joint debate.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, as I see it, the future of the European Union and that of Ukraine are politically intertwined.
The EU of the 27 will need to nail its colours to the constitutional mast about its geographical scope and its external borders, which should, in principle, extend to include a European country such as Ukraine.
This clarity would also open up Ukraine's European future prospects, which is undoubtedly a huge incentive for the Ukrainian reform forces, and in fact, an honest choice for all Ukrainian citizens.
Given the general political crisis situation in which Ukraine is currently embroiled, all this still seems far removed from reality.
Kiev's discord, however, requires at this stage a powerful and creative contribution from Brussels within the framework of European neighbourhood policy.
For the sake of sustainable stability along our own eastern border, the Council and Commission cannot afford to wash their hands of the Ukrainian crisis.
How would you reconcile these strategic interests of the Union with a beckoning prospect for Ukraine?
Mr President, I was privileged to observe the 2006 Ukrainian Parliamentary election, which was held in exemplary fashion.
Regrettably, the outcome then produced neither a stable government nor a climate of financial probity amongst many of the Verkhovna Rada MPs, who had little interest in politics and really only a vested interest to protect their business interests or avoid prosecution by acquiring parliamentary immunity.
I was therefore not surprised to hear the allegations that MPs were being bribed large sums to cross the floor in an attempt by the governing coalition to achieve the magical 300 seats, or constitutional majority, required to finally strip President Yushchenko of his remaining powers.
I personally have always championed Ukraine's intrinsic right under Article 49 of the Treaty to apply for EU membership.
That is still some way off, given enlargement fatigue and the fear by some Member States of offending Russia.
Nevertheless, I believe the Council missed a trick in not granting Ukraine, in the heady days of the Orange Revolution, the same status as western Balkan countries like Albania of being called a potential candidate for eventual EU accession.
This would have been a great carrot to Westernising democratic reformist forces.
It is very regretful that this did not happen.
I believe Ukraine will come through this most recent constitutional crisis without violence and fully respect European norms of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
I strongly condemn the alleged attempts to intimidate the Constitutional Court judges in their legal deliberations over the legitimacy of President Yushchenko's dissolution of the Verkhovna Rada.
In the meantime, I welcome EU plans for a free-trade and visa-facilitated travel area after Ukraine joins the WTO.
Ideally, in 2008 the expiring PCA should be replaced by an association agreement.
Either way, Ukrainians must be brought closer to the European Union, where they rightfully belong.
It is clear to me that the enduring legacy of the Orange Revolution, namely a free press and democratic elections, remains intact.
Mr President, the essence of the crisis in Ukraine lies in the difference between the views of the political players regarding the check and balance mechanisms and separation of powers.
The crisis is fuelled by weaknesses in the interinstitutional equilibrium and how state institutions function.
The European Union should play its part and assume responsibility, since it did not do much to prevent the democratic deficit or the fragility of democracy which led to this crisis.
The good news is that parties now seem to be negotiating and there is a prospect of compromise.
We should not take sides.
It is wrong to view the Ukrainian people as being pro-Western or otherwise.
I think that we ought to assess them not by their rhetoric but by their deeds, in accordance with our values.
At the same time, we should at all costs avoid personal initiatives which could be misleading or be misused.
Likewise, we must avoid approaching the situation in Ukraine with national agendas in mind, and avoid competition within the European Union or Parliament which would be counterproductive.
On the other hand, we should not be indifferent to certain values.
As I mentioned, we have particular values which we are entitled to put forward when approaching this crisis.
We have to encourage all players to show a spirit of compromise, respect for the rule of law and democracy.
We should also ask them to accept the Constitutional Court's decisions, even if it is not yet fully functional.
We have to encourage them to negotiate a package of constitutional modifications and improvements, preferably to be agreed before the Constitutional Court issues its decision.
Parliament's delegation for relations between the European Union and Ukraine is in permanent contact with those concerned and is prepared to help.
We made it clear that the outcome will be a test of Ukraine's ability to cooperate with the European Union and integrate with our structures.
We have also stated that one should not sacrifice the rule of law for the sake of a better institutional equilibrium or vice versa.
On the other hand, we should look at ourselves.
Do we have a clear vision of the future status of relations between the European Union and Ukraine?
Do we really know what kind of state Ukraine should be?
Did we express our expectations clearly enough?
Do we have a strategy on how we ought to promote cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union?
Do we have a plan on how we could draw Ukraine and its Euro-sceptics towards us?
Are we interactive, not just reactive?
I am afraid the answer to many of these questions could be 'no'.
If we do not change the approach, I am afraid that the prospects are dubious, to say the least.
- (PL) Mr President, the European Parliament committed itself closely to Ukraine during the Orange Revolution.
We were greatly moved by the call from Kiev's Independence Square for respect for human dignity, for a democratic country based on rule of law, for a country free of financial and political corruption.
It was the Ukraine we had all been waiting for.
From the platform of this House I now appeal to both sides of the conflict in Ukraine - president Yushchenko and Yulia Timoshenko, both symbols of the Orange Revolution, and to premier Yanukovich, representative of the ruling coalition - to resolve this crisis through negotiation.
Compromise is something that is greatly prized in the EU, it is a value which has repeatedly proved its worth in avoiding conflict.
It is good that today both sides have sat down at the negotiating table.
We hope that the negotiations will end soon, and with success.
Here in the European Parliament, we would like to continue to have the grounds and the conviction for declaring that we are open to the European aspirations of the Ukrainians.
(PL) Mr President, three years ago we rightly supported democratic change in Ukraine.
Today Ukraine has media freedom and more efficient democratic institutions.
It is now up to the Ukrainians themselves to decide where their country will go next, and how to resolve democratic stresses and crises.
But that does not mean that we should just sit idly by.
By supporting the changes in Ukraine, we took on certain moral obligations, and it is our job to maintain good relations with the country.
So firstly, we must begin serious negotiations with Ukraine on closer energy cooperation. This will help us secure supplies of oil and gas to the EU via Ukraine and independently of Russia.
Secondly, some active investment is needed in Ukraine, above all in oil and gas pipelines which have been short of funding or which are incomplete.
Thirdly, we need an EU diplomatic offensive among the Caspian states which are potential suppliers of oil and gas to the EU via Ukraine.
Fourthly and most importantly, we must conduct an open-door policy to Ukraine and treat it as our closest strategic partner and a future EU member.
This will be a way of providing true support for an independent, stable and democratic Ukraine with a free market.
It is up to us, and it is our duty to make it work.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we agree on many points where the assessment of the situation in Ukraine is concerned, and I agree with the many of you who have said, in the course of this debate, that it is now the people in positions of political power who must have their say, that it is they who have to take the decisions, that they must do so with respect for the institutions now established in that country - of which the Constitutional Court is one - and that they must not be put under pressure when they do so.
It is not appropriate, at the present time, that the European Union should play some sort of mediating role; on the contrary, this is, in the first instance, an internal issue in which the persons responsible - the state's President and Prime Minister - must reach some sort of accommodation with one another and find a way out of the crisis.
On the other hand, however - and Commissioner Å pidla made this perfectly clear - the European Union has itself shown that the way to closer cooperation is through the commencement of negotiations and that Ukraine has the choice of many courses of action as it pursues its economic and political development.
It is that way that we should make our own over the coming weeks.
As I have mentioned, Mr Solana is in close contact with both groups, and it is important that we should not keep our distance, but should instead, so to speak, maintain a neutral attitude as regards what others have to do in Ukraine.
I do hope, though, that the people of Ukraine will find the prospect that the European Union has held out to them acceptable.
I am put in an optimistic frame of mind when I note that neither political camp has lost sight of the road that leads to Europe and that that is something on which they agree.
Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission fundamentally agrees with the assessment your House has given of the current political crisis and welcomes the prudent approach it has so far adopted to the present situation.
For our own part, we will keep an eye on the further progress of the crisis and play our part by encouraging those in positions of responsibility in Ukraine to see long-term political compromise in the interests of their country.
As has already been emphasised, the Commission continues to give firm backing to negotiations on the newly-extended agreement and sees Ukraine as one of our key partners, to which we are wholeheartedly committed.
We will follow with interest the ongoing debate in your House on Ukraine and now look forward to the final version of the KamiÅski report.
The debate is closed.
Homophobia in Europe (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on homophobia in Europe.
I have to inform you that the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group has tabled a motion to omit this debate on the grounds of inadmissibility.
Mr SzymaÅski is to speak in defence of this motion and now has the floor.
(PL) Madam President, I ask the motion for the debate on homophobia be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 167 of our rules of procedure.
The grounds are that this House was misled as to the grounds for the debate, which is to discuss a bill that has never existed, does not exist and will not exist, as was quite clearly stated by the Polish premier.
The proposal is to discuss the statements of certain Polish politicians, which the Polish premier corrected by stating quite clearly that the Polish Government has not proposed any kind of discriminatory policy against homosexual circles.
In my view this should suffice to withdraw the motion for a debate on this issue, as the grounds for the debate do not exist.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, where anti-discrimination is concerned, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats' position is perfectly clear; it unequivocally endorses the decisions taken by this honourable House and expressed by it in various resolutions and legal acts.
Having discussed the Polish minister's utterances in the House's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we asked the House's legal service to give us some idea of what importance should be attached to them and whether or not they were contrary to European law.
The legal service replied that it regretted its inability to give an opinion, as this was not a legal matter, and that is the very point made by our friend from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
The Group of the European People's Party would like to see this issue taken seriously, and so we have moved that our agency recently formed to deal with these matters be mandated to monitor developments in this area and keep a close watch on them.
I would like to make it clear that, while the Group of the European People's Party endorses these decisions, we do believe that there is no reason to bring these matters before Parliament again, and it is for that reason that we are in favour of deleting this item from the agenda.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I think that the PPE-DE Group also knows that today we are not just talking about one statement by one Minister.
It is a much broader debate.
I think it is obvious to the majority in this House that this motion has only been put forward because some people do not want to discuss discrimination against homosexuals.
However, we are politicians in a democracy and if you do not like a resolution, you simply vote against it.
I cannot understand why this should be inadmissible.
Next time we will declare a debate about the internal market as inadmissible!
The topic falls within the remit of the European Union.
Equal rights are at the core of the European Union.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam - I do not know whether everyone is aware - Article 13 stipulates that we have a role in anti-discrimination legislation.
It is not the first time that we have discussed homophobia and nor, unfortunately, will it be the last.
My point is that it is very clear: it is admissible because it falls within our remit.
The only reason it can be otherwise is because you do not wish to discuss it.
Let us debate it this afternoon and take account of it when we vote, but let us not distort a debate.
(Applause)
(The motion of inadmissibility was rejected.)
Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, 'Europe - succeeding together!' is the motto that the German Presidency of the EU has chosen as its watchword; 'Europe - succeeding together'- but what does that mean?
It did mean that we, in Europe, have to keep on reminding ourselves of what is positive and good about diversity, respect, recognition and tolerance, because diversity, respect, recognition and tolerance are the core values upon which is founded the Europe in which we share.
At first sight, it would appear that those whose orientation is towards their own sex are today accepted and tolerated more widely than ever, and the work of associations plays a vital part in this, for movements of lesbians and gay men are ever better organised and encourage their members to affirm their sexual orientation openly.
Following as it does centuries of institutionalised discrimination, that is a heartening development.
I speak for Germany, and our history has given us a particular responsibility, in that, 60 years ago, homosexuals were among those who fell victim to the National Socialist machinery of extermination.
If one takes a second look, it rapidly becomes evident that homophobia is still very much alive and kicking in many parts of Europe, and current events show that in ways that make us ashamed.
Homosexuals are still exposed to prejudices, intolerance and officially sanctioned discrimination, and hate-filled tirades and acts of violence against sexual minorities are daily occurrences, often going unpunished by the criminal law.

In this regard, I can wholeheartedly endorse the words of Hans Winkler, who, speaking to your House as a representative of the Austrian Presidency of the Council not quite a year ago, stressed that: 'Wherever the safety and dignity of any man or woman living in the European Union are in jeopardy, so are the safety and dignity of all of us, and with it the credibility of our Union and its principles and institutions.'
That is still true today.
(Applause)
Discrimination against homosexuals is a problem against which we have to bring all the means at our disposal to bear.
Fighting homophobia calls for perseverance.
Continuous work is needed in order to progressively demolish the walls of prejudice and intolerance in people's heads, while, at the same time, there is a need for the building of new structures founded on acceptance, equality and respect.
To be sure, people's thinking cannot be changed overnight, but official positions and laws can be, and must be, changed if fundamental human rights are to be protected, and in this regard we, in Europe, have already taken a great step forwards.
The European Union is founded upon the principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
To be specific, Article 13 of the European Communities Treaty, and also Article 21 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly forbid any form of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and, over and above that, the EU's Member States, as members of the Council of Europe, have committed themselves to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Ever since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, the European Union has been empowered to address discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including discrimination by reason of sexual orientation.
Since then, the European Union has, by adopting the equality directives, put in place a wide range of regulations making it possible to take action against discrimination right across the European Union; in the world of work, for example, an EU directive has prohibited discrimination on the grounds of religious belief, handicap, or sexual orientation.
We may well already have made considerable progress in changing the legal position on protection from discrimination and on the promotion of equal opportunities across the EU, but that is no reason for us to rest on our laurels, for even the best-drafted legislation avails nothing if the political will that it be consistently implemented is not strong enough and it is not supported by the population as a whole.
(Applause)
This is where there is work for the Commission to do, because its task is to monitor whether directives such as the ones I have mentioned are transposed properly and in good time by the Member States, and the newly-established Fundamental Rights Agency will in future be giving it additional support in this, as soon as it is fully up and running.
Even so, I have to emphasise that responsibility does not lie with the Commission alone.
We, too, as people in positions of political leadership in the EU or at national or regional level, can and must give a good example by promoting tolerance, understanding, mutual respect and peaceful coexistence, and we also need to keep a watchful eye on the Commission's monitoring activities in the countries that are candidates for accession or have the potential to be such.
Accession negotiations no less than stabilisation and association agreements require that all conditions be fulfilled, and that includes specifically those applicable to the human rights of sexual minorities.

At the end of the day, we have to influence the way people think, in order that the walls of prejudice and intolerance in their heads may be brought down, and I am glad that the joint initiative of the Commission and the German Presidency of the Council made it possible for the first European Equality Summit to be held in Berlin on 30 and 31 January, marking the inauguration of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities for All', which offers a unique opportunity to promote a more solidarity-based society and to mobilise everyone concerned in order to drive forward the European Union's new Framework Strategy on Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunities, both now and after 2007.
The intention behind the programme is that the public be made more aware of the right to equal treatment and of the ways in which discrimination is combated, and to spread the news that everyone is entitled to equal treatment irrespective of their gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or outlook, of any disability they may have, of their age or of their sexual orientation.
Let us make use of this opportunity to fight intolerance and discrimination together and to promote diversity, respect, acceptance and tolerance as positive things.
Only if we work together can we ensure that the European Union can claim, with pride, to be 'united in diversity'.
(Applause)
Madam President, honourable Members, I should first like to remind the Chamber that, in my statements on homophobia on 17 January 2006, and on the increase in violence motivated by racism and homophobia in Europe on 14 June 2006, the Commission strongly condemned all forms of homophobia, which represents an attack on human dignity.
The Commission wishes to emphasise its serious commitment, as a matter of principle, to upholding the basic rights on which the EU was founded.
The Commission will do everything in its power to fight homophobia.
It is necessary to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, which is clearly outlawed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Furthermore, Article 13 of the Treaty allows for the adoption at a European level of appropriate measures in the fight against discrimination on the grounds of gender.
In the year 2000, the Council adopted a directive, on the basis of Article 13, establishing a general framework for combating discrimination in employment and occupation on several grounds, including sexual orientation.
The Commission will monitor the implementation of the directive in all Member States, including Poland.
It will not hesitate to take firm action against Member States if directives are not properly implemented.
The Commission wishes to point out that in 2005 it launched studies into the current national laws prohibiting all forms of discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, in areas other than employment and occupation.
These studies demonstrated that all Member States to which the studies related have in some areas gone further, often much further, than Community law.
There are, however, significant discrepancies between Member States as regards the extent of protection.
The Commission also stated in its political strategy for 2008 that it will propose fresh initiatives aimed at preventing discrimination in areas other than the labour market, including discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
In this context, in February the Commission launched an impact assessment in order to establish whether further EU intervention is justified in areas other than employment and occupation.
The Commission is now carrying out extensive consultation with the general public and with interested parties such as NGOs and social partners.
The results of the impact assessment are expected at the end of 2007.
The Commission is aware that protection under the law alone is not enough to guarantee the protection of the people concerned.
It is also important to fight prejudice and stereotypes.
The European Year of Equal Opportunities for All 2007 establishes the following aims: to inform the citizens of their rights, to support diversity as a benefit, to promote equal opportunities for all in economic, social, cultural and political life.
The Commission welcomes the national strategies drawn up by the Member States in the context of the European Year.
All countries including Poland have incorporated all grounds of discrimination into their strategies.
The Commission has become aware of the statements made by a member of the Polish Parliament, who has declared his intention to table a proposal for an act that would ban the promotion of homosexuality in schools and in all other youth or leisure organisations.
According to information at the Commission's disposal the proposal in question has yet to be drawn up and the statements made by the Polish Government are not binding.
This law, were it to materialise, could be in breach of fundamental laws contained in the European convention on human rights and the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It also could be in breach of the principle of non-discrimination in employment and occupation, that is to say, in breach of Directive 2078/EC.
The Commission will monitor further developments closely and will not hesitate to take action in the event of breaches of Community law.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make clear - perhaps rather more calmly than before - that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stand fully behind the European Parliament's resolutions and behind the directives that have been adopted here and which the Commission has described.
Europe is an area of the rule of law and we have to defend that.
However, the occasion for today's discussion, namely the statement by this Polish minister, which is unacceptable and which the Group of the European People's Party rejects, is no reason for such a debate.
As Commissioner Å pidla pointed out, when we discussed discrimination against homosexuals only a few weeks ago we saw that unfortunately some of Europe's politicians say things that are unacceptable and we must fight them by political means.
I would like to say that it should make us stop and think when Polish Members of all groups - and I am thinking in particular of the discussion among the Liberals - have said that what happened in Poland is unacceptable, but that the debate must be conducted primarily in Poland itself and that Poland itself is dealing with the unacceptable things that were said there.
It has been said that Poland does not need a Big Brother interfering in its affairs and that they will deal with the matter themselves.
That should give us pause for thought.
We will do those who are fighting discrimination in Poland as we would wish no favours by making a big issue of it here.
Please therefore accept - and it is a procedural matter we are raising here - that we consider it inappropriate to debate this matter today, because we have enough decisions and directives about it.
No to discrimination, No to homophobia in Europe!
We therefore propose that our agency should continue to monitor the situation and keep an eye on it.
The Group of the European People's Party will act accordingly tomorrow.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, on 16 January 2006, I spoke in this very place to defend the resolution against homophobia.
It was not the first time, and I fear that it will not be the last.
Indeed, we were hoping to put a stop to the difference in treatment suffered by homosexuals on Union soil, and we fully realise that there is still a long way to go.
Let us remember that we are a few days away from the International Day against Homophobia.
The text being submitted to us today mentions not only known cases of homophobia in several EU countries but also, in fact, a declaration by the Polish Deputy Prime Minister.
It is not a question of stigmatising this or that government or this or that Member State, but these diatribes reveal this rise in homophobia within the European Union.
These remarks reveal, in fact, an unacceptable state of mind, and they are not the remarks of the man in the street.
They are those of a member of government.
This needs to stop.
We must once again take a stand against these sickening remarks, and I should like, here and now, vigorously to denounce the new revolting and despicable publication by Mr Giertych, a Member of our Parliament, who has just had his second pamphlet distributed, in which he implies that homosexuals are sick.
All those who rightly feel hurt by these hateful acts and words and all those young people who discover that they are different, some of whom go so far as to commit suicide, must know that that is not what Europe is about.
We cannot spend our time voting for resolutions designed to fight against the discrimination suffered by homosexuals.
In the future, we must think about tools that will enable us to act effectively.
From now on, everyone within the Union must shoulder his or her responsibilities.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to clear up a misunderstanding: this resolution is not about Poland, but about homophobia.
Unfortunately, Poland does not have the monopoly on homophobia, which is, regrettably, to be found throughout the world.
It is a fact, though, that we discussed the problems in Poland one and a half years ago and that they are still there today.
As Mrs Roure rightly pointed out a moment ago, it not just anybody who has made statements of this kind, it is opinion leaders and members of the government who have contributed to a climate in which hatred and violence have become the norm.
Two weeks ago, a homosexual man was beaten to death on the street in my own country - a country that is extremely tolerant and liberal - because somebody thought he looked too effeminate.
Beaten to death!
Can you imagine?
That is the kind of thing that happens in a climate that is created by people who are guilty of making homophobic statements.
You cannot say, therefore, that because there is no legislative proposal yet, we do not have a problem.
In that respect, I am also delighted that Mr Weber, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as the ombudsman, have dissociated themselves so emphatically from the statements of the Polish minister in question.
I would be appreciative if the Council and Commission could respond with a statement that is just as emphatic.
As the Commission, and particularly the Council, have said, we do have laws, rules and treaties; all of which are wonderful, but they have not managed to stop these people from making homophobic statements of this kind.
We would like to see more action.
We would, for example, like the Council to indicate the measures it intends to take in respect of this Education Minister.
Will you tolerate that this Education Minister attends meetings of European Education Ministers, or are you prepared to consider suspending him as long as he refuses to distance himself from his statements?
This is the first time that we have made statements of this kind about Member States - plural, because there are several of them in the European Union.
We are always keen to point the finger at other countries, but I think that if we take Europe seriously, if we are a community of values, we should put our own house in order first.
I hope that this House will, today, send a very strong message to Europe and to the world that these are the values for which we stand.
Madam President, aggressive behaviour against homosexuals is a problem in many European societies, but it is certainly not the biggest problem.
We also have problems with such behaviour on the part of government agencies, such as the police, in Germany, the UK and Italy, for example.
Even so, it would never occur to me to debate the matter in the European Parliament and to give advice.
The governments of the Member States themselves know best how to deal with such matters.
It is unfortunate that some colleagues here do not think this rule applies to Poland, for example. There can only be one reason for this.
This House is being led by the nose by a group of extremist MEPs who are riled by every word of polemics (applause) that stipulates or mentions homosexuality.
I would like to point out that homosexuals are not outside the scope of criticism.
That is the basis of democracy.
Submitting so easily to homosexual censorship has become a hallmark of this House.
I do not believe that this will do anything to help our authority.
(Applause)

on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to start with a word of reassurance for the last speaker - we have most definitely discussed hooliganism in this House before, but this is a different matter altogether, because in the case of hooliganism, the government does not incite the violence, whereas in this case, certainly in the case of Poland, I am beginning to get the feeling that homophobia is something that is - as it were - being staged by the state, certainly if one considers the statements that were made by members of the Polish Government to the effect that 'homosexuality is demoralising, perverse, a mental disorder and a threat to society'.
I listened very carefully to what Commissioner Å pidla had to say to the effect that 'if a law is proposed, then I will respond'.
I appreciate this, and I gather that Commissioner Å pidla can see why a law of this kind would constitute a threat to European values and an infringement of European law.
Things, however, are already going wrong, and this is something I find lacking in the speech, for governments cannot, of course, make all kinds of unconditional proposals, only then to retract them, with it then being said that there is not really a problem anyway.
After all, something is obviously being set in motion: this sort of thing is, of course, making homophobia more widespread, and the Commissioner is, after all, responsible for compliance with anti-discrimination legislation within the labour market.
Surely you do not believe that the concept of equal opportunities within a labour market can survive within a society where homophobia is rife, so what are you proposing to do about this?
How do you propose to deal with governments that - to all intents and purposes - promote homophobia?
What are the repercussions for the labour market?
This is what I would like you to tell us.
Finally, for the benefit of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to say that I regret that you have given your backing to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group for what you claim to be merely procedural reasons.
It would be great if a whole delegation from Parliament, including your group, could attend a number of gay pride marches in Warsaw, in Riga and in many other countries.
I would greatly appreciate it if we could stand there, hand in hand, so that is my invitation to you, and, who knows - it might actually happen.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it would have been extremely hypocritical if the European Parliament had not debated this issue today, that is, if we had not debated the fact that homophobic public displays and statements have increased in Europe in recent years.
The Polish minister's statements are embarrassing and come in the wake of his Government's ban on the Gay Pride celebrations.
Despite public indignation, the minister has never withdrawn his very worrying assertions.
Sadly, this is not the only case in Europe.
Displays of intolerance are on the increase in our civilised Europe.
We often read about incidents of violence against men and women because of their sexual leanings, or we look on helplessly at the increasingly common cases of serious bullying at school, which can even lead young people to commit suicide, as recently happened in Italy.
For that reason, politicians must not show signs of intolerance and they must not issue statements like those the Polish minister made, because by doing so they risk legitimising homophobic attitudes.
This applies not just to politicians but also to the Church authorities, who more and more often do not miss an opportunity to show their aversion to homosexuals, branding them as sinners.
No kind of discrimination is acceptable and, more to the point, no discrimination based on sexual orientation is acceptable.
This Parliament rejected Rocco Buttiglione as a Commissioner because of what he said.
I think there needs to be a strong message from the Commission, so that it can keep the promises it made to adopt concrete measures against any form of discrimination.
Europe's history and culture owe a great deal to the sensitivity of men and women who have been persecuted by authoritarian regimes and are still criminalised by reactionary and racist cultures in Europe.
We owe a great deal to Sappho, Pier Paulo Pasolini, Oscar Wilde, Michel Foucault and AndrÃ© Gide, and it seems to me a serious matter that, if it had been up to these obscurantist cultures, these great artists would never even have had a voice.
I believe, and I hope that Parliament too will agree with me, that a culture that is against homosexuals is unacceptable and should be strongly resisted.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, the fact that homophobia is still a problem in Europe in 2007 is deeply unfortunate and alarming.
What is still more unfortunate is that there are fellow Members here in this House who, through their clearly homophobic statements, help make the situation worse for homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals.
They make such statements not only here in the European Parliament but also, to a large extent, on their home territories.
One of the consequences of stirring up homophobic feeling is that homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals are in danger of being exposed to both physical and psychological violence, as happened at quite a few Gay Pride parades around Europe last year.
What is even worse is when faith and religion are used as excuses for discriminating against EU citizens.
You can surely work out what I have in mind.
These are medieval values that do not belong in our modern society.
Europe in 2007 should be further along the road than that.
Let us combat homophobia wherever it occurs: in politics, in the media and in the circles in which we all move.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, we have already had a debate on homophobia in Europe - it was in January of last year - and, on that occasion, I said, among other things, that nobody in the European Parliament should accept that homosexuals, on account of their orientation, should be disadvantaged, attacked or intimidated in any manner whatever.
At the same time, I also warned against the spirit of political correctness which is gradually suffocating the free expression of opinion.
Indeed, in addition to homophobia and other phobias, a kind of 'freedom of speech-phobia' is starting to develop, an irrational fear of letting people express their opinions freely.
What my group does not like in today's debate and the resolutions that have been submitted, is that one specific Member State is being targeted on the basis of information the accuracy of which is in dispute.
This is not the right way to going about things.
We should exercise more care in this area so as to prevent the people in that Member State from turning away from the European Union even more.
Madam President, I rise in sadness, and not in anger.
After the Second World War, we still have not learned the lessons.
During the 1930s we stood and watched as Jews, Communists, trade unionists and homosexuals were taken off to the camps.
We stood.
We said and did nothing.
We have now moved on.
I say to those countries that have lived under domination and repression that they, of all countries, should know the value of fundamental human rights, freedom of association, freedom of speech and the right to a private life.
(Applause)
You should be teaching us about fundamental values.
That is why we will not hesitate to defend human rights and human rights defenders, wherever they are.
Let me say to anyone who feels under attack wherever they are - and, as a gay man, I could have been born in Poland, Latvia or the Czech Republic in fear of my life, in fear of my job - you are not alone, we are with you and we will win for the simple reason that goodness and justice always succeed in the end.
When we refer to politicians in office and the statements that were made, we are not talking about a one-off statement but rather a series of statements that have been calculated and made over the years.
Hate-speak creates a climate that somehow lives are inferior, that the person poses a threat to society.
A climate is created and fear is engendered, rights are under threat.
Words once spoken cannot be taken back and the harm that is done continues and the words too often empower the thug, which leads to violence.
I note that Mr Weber says 'no to homophobia'.
However, it is sad that he also says 'no' to doing anything about it here in this House today.
Let me finish on this: we will succeed, but that means we have to take up our responsibility to defend human rights and to end human rights abuses, wherever they are.
(Applause)
- (PL) Madam President, I would like to say a couple of words on behalf of the Polish delegation in the liberal democratic Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group.
Firstly, we accept no form of discrimination, and are for complete tolerance in matters relating to this debate.
Secondly, we would like to stress that there is a big difference between non-discrimination in this area and the promotion of homosexual attitudes.
Tolerance yes, non-discrimination yes, but promotion no, because such promotion is not a measure of respect for human rights.
And finally, this is not a political issue, and should not be treated as such.
It is a moral issue which is deeply related to pluralism, which should characterise the European Union.
Madam President, those who were so willing to vote on the necessity for this debate just now were just as quick and willing to leave the hall.
That is the best illustration that their intentions were not real, but artificial and for political purposes.
It is an attempt to persecute a government in a country that does not please various options: liberals, the left, left-wingers, etc.
This I can understand, but, for heaven's sake, while thousands of pyres were burning in your countries in the not too distant past, those who fled those pyres gathered in Poland.
Jews, persecuted throughout Europe, gathered in Poland.
Poland is a symbol of tolerance.
The attempt being made here to convince the world and Europe that Poland is a hotbed of intolerance towards homosexuals is a huge obscenity and political slander, a cynical ploy to delude public opinion in Europe.
I protest against this ploy because it is fundamentally untrue.
(Applause)
(ES) I believe that Mr Cashman has conveyed the sentiment shared by the majority of this House very well and I therefore believe that we must insist once again that we must raise our voices in the face of certain attitudes.
It is not a problem of freedom of expression.
The problem is that certain statements that are hostile to sexual freedom come from governmental institutions, States and governments that are part of the European Union, who have signed treaties, such as the European Union Treaty, Article 6 of which clearly defines freedom of choice, including sexual choice.
Let us not confuse propaganda with the right to be free to be what one wants to be at any time, in any circumstance and in any Member States of the European Union.
I therefore believe that these statements, which, as Mr Cashman said quite rightly as well, are not isolated, are part of a tendency, of a calculated strategy to question the fundamental values of the European Union.
They cannot go unpunished.
This House had to react - I believe that it is doing so - though, regrettably, I fear that this is not the first time, but we will always insist and, although it is a bore to re-state the obvious, we must continue to do so because - as Mr Cashman also said - we are right and right will prevail.

(PL) Madam President, everybody has the right to live and deserves respect and help.
That includes misguided and injured people who have succumbed to homosexual inclinations.
The solution, however, is neither blind acceptance nor intolerance, but understanding and kindness.
The solution is to help sufferers to get better, which is what is expected of us.
To accept homosexuality as something natural and normal is to glorify pain and suffering.
It is erroneous and dangerous political correctness.
Homosexual acts are against the laws of nature, because they preclude the gift of life.
Propagating them is an attack on the family and leads to abnormalities.
Dear Europeans, instead of levelling unfair criticism at Poland, you ought to be following Poland's example of morality, tolerance and normality.
In this country, Coming out Straight.
Understanding and Healing Homosexuality has been published.
The author is Richard Cohen, who freed himself from homosexuality and is now a happy man and a father.
Let us benefit from his experience.
To the so-called defenders of human rights who are raising such a fuss today and magnifying the problem I ask - why are you ignoring the moral degradation of the media, discrimination against normal families, why do you shut your eyes to the mass murder of children in their mothers' wombs?
Do you realise that by promoting a civilisation of falsehood and death you are bringing about the destruction of Europe?
(PL) Madam President, the Campaign against Homophobia and the Lambda Association presented a report on the situation in society of bisexual and homosexual people in Poland in the years 2005 and 2006.
The report paints a picture of persecution.
Every fifth homosexual has been jostled or kicked.
Half of those questioned have been insulted, harassed or blackmailed.
Harassment has increased in recent times.
Of the people who have experienced physical violence, almost 42% had experienced it more than three times in the past five years.
It is with deep regret that I have to confirm that homosexuals today cannot rely on the institutions of the Polish state, ruled by a conservative-nationalist-populist alliance, to afford them effective protection.
In many statements representatives of the government openly express an ideology of hatred, intolerance and discrimination against homosexual circles.
That is what makes today's resolution so important, my Polish compatriots of the right!
For these people, the European Parliament has become a champion of justice, a leading light which keeps alive their hopes that their fundamental citizen's rights, and to a dignified life, will be upheld.
(Applause)
Someone wanted to raise a point of order.
Madam President, no, I cannot do that because there is not one.
I just wanted to say that listening to Mr Tomczak proves exactly why we need a debate on homophobia in this House.
Those were the most homophobic statements I have heard in this House for a very long time, and I am truly saddened by them.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of this debate to come back to a speech which the Council President made here in this House about a Europe of values and tolerance.
It is a very important point that holds true in very many areas.
We have discussed a great deal about various other matters today, directing our gaze to problems outside the European Union.
If we do that - and we are right to do so - it is perfectly legitimate also to look at what we have still not put in order in our own House, namely intolerance towards homosexual orientation.
I therefore ask you, even if many take a different view on this matter, at least to tolerate there being a debate and to see that it is also important that the Commission should have instruments on the basis of which it can take appropriate action to combat such discrimination.
On behalf of the presidency I can only expressly repeat that it is our duty not to leave this with the Commission or the parliaments alone, but that we must also actively seek to make our society aware of this matter so that such discrimination no longer occurs.
I hope today's debate has at least made a small contribution to that.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, human rights are inalienable rights, and I feel that this is a fundamental value on which the entire European project is based.
Given that we have held a very profound and emotionally-charged debate, I should like to quote exactly what the Polish deputy minister said in his speech.
According to the deputy minister, the proposed law will affect all those who promote homosexuality or other deviations.
I feel that this detail is a sufficiently clear signal for us to conclude that if the law is adopted it will stigmatise a particular category of people on the grounds of their sexual orientation, and for this reason it is unacceptable from the standpoint of European law.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will do everything in its power to uphold the rights of all citizens in all Member States, and I feel the message has come through strongly from this debate that homophobia is not only a phenomenon affecting some Member States, but rather a universal phenomenon.
It is of course true that today we are dealing with a speech made by a member of parliament in a particular country.
In conclusion of the debate, four motions for resolutions have been submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)
Council Question Time
President-in-Office of the Council.
(DE) I can answer your question as follows, Mr Ortega. In its December 2006 Conclusions, the European Council noted the following: the capacity of the European Agency for Operational Cooperation at the External Borders - the European border protection agency Frontex - will be rapidly enhanced by ensuring adequate financial and personnel resources and their effective use, establishing procedures for emergency situations, strengthening operational means, reinforcing links with the Immigration Liaison Officer Network and completing the planned review of the Agency and its tasks in 2007.
The Agency's budget for 2007 has been increased appreciably and now stands at a total of EUR 22.2 million.
The number of persons employed is also increasing steadily and will total 87 in 2007.
Regarding the establishment of procedures for emergency situations, the Council has recently concluded consultations with the European Parliament on a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams and amending the Council Regulation as regards that mechanism.
The European Parliament will be voting on the regulation at the end of April. The Justice and Home Affairs Council will then consider the regulation in June.
In addition to sending personnel, Frontex is currently compiling a centralised record, the 'tool box', of the Member States' existing technical equipment for controlling and monitoring the external borders, which they are willing to put at the disposal of another Member State on a voluntary basis and on request.
On 15 February 2007, the Council examined the progress made in establishing the 'tool box' and called on the Member States to make an active contribution.
The situation was again reviewed at the Council meeting on 19 and 20 April.
The Council Conclusions of 14 and 15 December 2006 invited Frontex, together with the Member States of the region, to establish a permanent Coastal Patrol Network on the European Union's southern maritime borders by mid 2007.
The introduction of this network will be an important step for taking action jointly and in particular in coordination with the Member States against illegal immigration on the southern maritime borders.
The network will be an effective instrument for countering the growing migratory pressure in the region that is anticipated in the next few weeks and months.
The Coastal Patrol Network is planned to commence on 24 May 2007.
Finally, in accordance with the Hague Programme which the European Council adopted on 4 November 2004, the Commission will before the end of 2007 be submitting to the Council an assessment report on the Agency, and in connection with that assessment consideration could be given to the possibility of giving Frontex additional tasks or powers.
(ES) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Council in this field, and I believe that you have explained it very clearly.
Our only concern, however, is that it appears that the operations that have been set up - specifically ERA 1, ERA 2 and ERA 3 - are interrupted at a particular moment with regard to the protection of the Atlantic maritime border and the feeling is created amongst the public that, being of a temporary nature, protection is purely temporary and there is no permanent protection.
Does the Presidency believe that, by means of these measures, permanent control of this border - currently a sensitive border - can be guaranteed for the whole of the European Union?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) In the first instance, the protection of external borders is of course the responsibility of the respective Member States.
In special situations, however, Frontex can be called in.
That is why it was created.
That means there may be cases where Frontex does not need to act because the Member State concerned can cope on its own.
But of course we want to get the idea across that in particular situations, such as illegal immigration, the European Union will show solidarity - that is what this European initiative was about.
Only it cannot be a permanent deployment. Really, Frontex should only act in particular cases.
President-in-Office, thank you very much indeed for your answer on how to bolster the Frontex Agency.
You talked a lot about having more staff, or in other words having more money.
If that is your thesis, how would you recommend that the staff complement of Frontex be enlarged, and how much money should we put into the Frontex budget?
I cannot give any definite figures at present, honourable Member.
We have set this agency up and we must now see what demands are made of it, what tasks the Member States are able to assume and what tasks can be performed by Frontex.
But in the talks on the matter that is still undecided.
At any rate, if I have understood the honourable Member correctly, we must also send out a signal that we have not merely created a pseudo institution, so that the public can see that here the European Union has recognised that it is necessary to have an agency to take effective action.
Then of course we must also be able to make the necessary resources available.
Question 2 has been withdrawn.
Subject: The investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes
In order to increase the effectiveness of the investigation and prosecution by law enforcement authorities of persons who have committed genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the Council adopted Decision 2002/494/JHA on setting up a network of contact points on genocide and Decision 2003/335/JHA on the investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes.
What plans does the Council have to improve the institutional infrastructure of the network, in order to strengthen cooperation among the national authorities and contribute to the creation of a consistent approach by Member States in the fight against impunity for grave international crimes?
What is the attitude of the Council regarding a suggestion to establish EUROJUST as the secretariat for the network?
Will the Council consider including the network on the agenda of the Article 36 Committee (CATS) meetings so as to ensure a follow up of network conclusions?
In light of Article 4 of Council Decision 2003/335/JHA, how will the Council address the current lack of specialised war crimes units within Member States?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) There is no proposal for improving the institutional infrastructure of the European network of contact points under discussion at the moment.
Up until now, the meetings of this network that have been held have been prepared in cooperation with the Council Presidency and General Secretariat.
Neither is there any proposal before the Council to set up a secretariat for the network within Eurojust.
If such an initiative is put forward, the Council will discuss it.
The Presidency can inform you, honourable Member, that the next meeting of the European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes will be held on 7 and 8 May.
In accordance with existing practice, that meeting's conclusions will be passed to the Article 36 Committee for further discussion.
Under the Council decision of 2003, the establishment of specialised war crimes units is a matter for the Member States.
All the Member States have already designated contact points for the investigation of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity.
Yes, that is reasonably encouraging.
I hope that you will conclude that Eurojust should indeed be a secretariat or at least a contact point.
I am glad that there is going to be a meeting in May of the contact group - unfortunately there was none under the last Presidency.
Can you assure me that the European Parliament will be informed about the conclusions of that meeting?
As the Council begins the process of developing the post-Hague JHA programme, what steps will be taken to ensure that the EU's commitment to fight impunity from international crimes, genocides, crimes against humanity and war crimes, both within the Union and outside, is included as a vital part of the justice, freedom and security agenda so as to create a single area of justice for victims of the gravest crimes?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) On this question I would like to say that the right of initiative in the area of public health lies exclusively with the Commission.
There is at present no legislative proposal concerning diabetes before the Council.
May I point out that under Article 152(4) in conjunction with Article 251 of the EC Treaty such a proposal would fall under the codecision procedure?
I would also like to draw your attention to the Council's answer to the written question from 2006.
Given that type 1 diabetes predominantly affects children and that poor management of diabetes in children can cause problems in the long run, such as kidney failure, blindness and amputations, what measures can the Council put in place to ensure the provision of appropriate education for the patient and his family, as well as providing education campaigns about the disease, in order to prevent the discrimination that many diabetes sufferers come across?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) You are quite right to raise the issue of the consequences of type 1 diabetes, especially in children.
I would like to point out, however - please do not misunderstand me - that this is primarily a matter for the Member States.
It is, however, important to do research and make discoveries and then to exchange those findings at European level, even if the responsibility for health matters does lie with the Member States.
We are talking about the wellbeing and future of children and the right thing to do is to exchange findings promptly and effectively.
The President-in-Office replied that the EU has no legislative competence, which is true, but it has the Framework Programme for Research.
Does the Council believe that the EU is providing enough financial backing for research into type 1 diabetes?
My understanding is that scientists believe that a cure for type 1 diabetes is deliverable, although a concerted effort will be required to achieve this.
It is probably the worldwide disease for which we have the best chance of finding a cure.
I should add that I must declare an interest, as my husband is the Chairman of the UK arm of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which supports research on type 1 diabetes.
In its 2007 Spring Report, the Commission noted that the availability of affordable child care is a problem in some Member States, making it difficult to reconcile work and family life.
The 2006-2007 Joint Employment Report expressly points out that some Member States have set national targets for child care.
These efforts should be recognised.
At the same time, however, we should keep an eye on further developments in the Member States to see that the Barcelona Process obligations are complied with.
Thank you, President-in-Office, but with respect that was a very general answer.
Perhaps that is all you can provide me with at this stage, but could I ask you to kindly e-mail me any details you have, or indicate how I can obtain a breakdown of details by Member State because, as you rightly say, improving the work/family life balance is a priority and it is in all our interests to ensure that priority is widely shared.
I hope that you will in turn encourage your successor Presidency to take it on board as a priority too.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) A few weeks ago we had a debate against the background of the Alliance for Families and the objectives we set ourselves in Barcelona.
In that debate I proposed, on behalf of the Presidency, that a report should be presented next year on how far those objectives had been achieved in the individual Member States.
In the meantime, we have also produced a list of criteria on the basis of which this report will be produced in 2008.
That is an important point.
I am also pleased to say that child care has featured prominently at a number of conferences in the last few weeks, including in the debate about the Alliance for Families.
As you know, I am from Germany and I am familiar with the debate that is currently taking place in our country.
We have also found that the problem is not confined to Germany, however.
What can we do, then?
So far as best practice is concerned, the experiences and results in achieving those objectives must be set out in the report I mentioned next year.
We will send you the information you require in due course.
(DE) You mentioned Germany, Minister.
I would like to know about the position regarding child care in the old and new LÃ€nder.
In my opinion, the fact that the child care situation is particularly bad in the new Member States is a problem for the EU.
How do you see this problem?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) There are of course different trends in the European Union, and there is no need to make a distinction between old and new Member States.
We have found that some Member States have developed a sensible infrastructure over many years - it was a political objective - while other countries are lagging behind.
The East German LÃ€nder had a different structure even before reunification, and facilities exist there.
We do of course have another problem to deal with in the East German LÃ€nder, namely the question of depopulation, of people moving away from particular areas because the economic situation is not as people imagined.
In general terms, Germany needs to find a way of providing all-day care and care for small children under three.
The German Bundestag is currently discussing how we can meet the targets we set ourselves in Barcelona.
(EL) Madam President, I would like to point out that daycare cannot become a substitute for families; it can only facilitate them.
Therefore, I would like to inquire about the quality of the service provided, namely how can it be assured and how can we be certain that the personnel hired by these institutions will be capable of determining possible learning difficulties or other disorders, in order to protect children while growing-up, but also provide them with a solid educational future for the rest of their lives?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) First, I would like to point out that the amendment to the Television Without Frontiers Directive will be adopted under the codecision procedure.
As co-legislator, the European Parliament is just as entitled as the Council to bring influence to bear on the content of the legislation.
The Council has taken account of the particular concerns you raise in revising the directive.
In particular, the Council is considering extending the scope of the directive so that appropriate provisions for the protection of minors and a ban on incitement to hatred will also apply to new no-demand services and to services offered over new platforms such as mobile networks and the Internet.
The Council envisages that the revised directive will recognise that instruments for co- and self-regulation can make an important contribution to this.
As you know, the final scope of the revision will have to be agreed together with Parliament.
I also made clear at yesterday's meeting of Presidents that the Presidency is very keen to work together with the European Parliament to reach a decision quickly.
(EL) Madam President, I would like to specifically ask the representative of the Council on the free market and free competition with regard to these products and the obstacles that may arise from this directive, which prohibits certain products that are hazardous to children.
I would also like to ask if a relevant regulation would be provided for, with regards to trade relations with third countries, so that the imported products can be inspected.
