In addition, the Commission has provided a grant of EUR 10 million for the funding of the Government of India's National Disaster Risk Management Programme.
At the recent EU-India summit held in The Hague, India reconfirmed its interest in pursuing an environment dialogue with the European Union and proposed the organisation of an EU-India environment forum.
This forum will be a first step in tackling the enormous environmental problems that threaten both India and the European Union.
Let me finish by expressing our deepest sympathy for all the victims and our firm hope that such a catastrophe will never occur again.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
We shall now proceed to the vote on these draft resolutions.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I simply wished to point out that there is a mistake in the voting list circulated to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
As regards the amendments on Bhopal, we voted against the first of these and in favour of the other three.
Â Â  I should like to note that my card has still not been registered and is refusing to work.
I wished to vote in favour.
Â Â  Your comment has been noted.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to raise another point of order.
Yesterday, we were voting until 2 p.m.
It has in fact always been the custom of this House to vote between noon and 1.30 p.m., because we do of course have a lot of lunchtime commitments and we end up keeping our guests waiting.
I would therefore ask the Bureau to make it a rule â as it was in the previous legislative period â that voting ends at 1.30 p.m.
I would also like to take the opportunity to wish all those present in the Chamber a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Â Â  Thank you for your comment, MrÂ RÃŒbig.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned, and I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2005.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0070/2004) by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 2004/2129(INI).
Â Â  . Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union means we are having to upgrade from driving a minibus, capable of taking 15 passengers, to a full-sized bus, capable of taking 25, with some spare seats to take on new passengers in due course.
This larger bus needs a stronger motor if we are not to slow down, and one that enables us to cross the difficult hills that lie on our path.
If we are to have a stronger motor, we will also occasionally need stronger brakes â perhaps an emergency brake â and better safety features too, such as a safety belt on each seat.
Since we are upgrading, we should also have more comfortable seats so that every passenger feels at home and comfortable in this bus.
Also, while we are at it, why not have a geo-satellite positioning system so we always know exactly where we are on the roadmap and can better plan the journeys we want to take together by the most efficient and comfortable route?
That is why we need a new set of rules for the European Union: a new Constitution to replace the current constitutional order and the set of overlapping Treaties.
In concrete terms this means a set of improvements that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteurs have identified as falling into four main categories.
First, it means greater clarity as to what the Union is, how it works and functions.
Under this heading one can identify a single Treaty instead of the several overlapping Treaties â a single, clearer document that spells out more clearly the objectives and the values of the Union and its competences, what it is responsible for and what it is not responsible for, and how it works, with fewer and clearer procedures.
This will make it easier for citizens to see and to understand what our Union is about.
We will get rid of the distinction between 'Union' and 'Community', which nobody except lawyers understands, creating a single legal entity.
It makes it clear that we are not creating some huge monolithic monster â the mythology of the superstate that some people seem to fear.
It is clear that we are not creating a centralised Union.
Second, it will provide for a more effective Union â a Union capable of deciding and acting with 25 Member States.
It will make for more qualified majority voting and more continuity in the chairmanship of the European Council.
There will be a single foreign minister to speak for the Union to the outside world, instead of the Commission speaking on some issues and the High Representative of the Council on others, which meant that third countries never knew whom they had to deal with.
Those posts will be merged into a single position.
Third, and most important in my view, it will provide more democracy and accountability in the Union.
Under the Constitution, all legislation will be subject first to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments, and then the double control of the Council and the European Parliament at European level, such that both have to approve virtually every item of European legislation.
Frankly, this makes the European Union the most democratic international structure, or supranational structure, that exists in the world.
Compare the EU to the IMF, to the World Bank, to the WTO or to any other international structure: none of them have or will have this degree of parliamentary input and of parliamentary scrutiny.
We should be proud of the democracy that exists at the heart of this Union.
The Constitution will significantly reinforce that democracy by extending codecision, by giving Parliament the right to elect the President of the Commission and by improving parliamentary control over the Commission and the so-called comitology system for delegated secondary legislation.
Fourth, the Constitution introduces greater rights for citizens through the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has been incorporated into the Constitution.
This, of course, applies only in the field of competence of European Union law, but that is a significant field of competence, and all European legislation henceforth will have to comply with that Charter.
All of this has led us to conclude that the Constitution is, to quote the committee's report, a 'vast improvement'. It is a vast improvement on the current Treaties and on the current constitutional order.
It merits our support.
These improvements are due in no small part to the input of the European Parliament into the Convention and the IGC.
We can be proud of our results.
It is a compromise. It is not a Utopian treaty.
All of us would have written it slightly differently had we had to write it ourselves, but as a compromise package it is a distinct improvement.
I am confident that tomorrow Parliament will endorse it by an overwhelming majority.
This Parliament, elected by citizens across the whole of Europe, with parties from left to right across the political spectrum, parties in government and parties in opposition, will send a powerful signal if it endorses the Constitution tomorrow by an overwhelming majority.
I am confident it will.
Â Â  . Mr President, when at the last plenary session of the last term in office I had the honour of speaking on behalf of my group at an event held by this House in homage to Monnet, Schuman and Spinelli, I wondered what the founding fathers, the visionaries of Europe, would have thought of the point in European integration we were at and what they would have thought of the European Constitution.
I believe â I said it then and I repeat it today â that they would not have believed that what was happening was real, because, leaving behind a Europe divided by fratricidal confrontations, this Constitution sanctions peace on our continent and, to use Mr Geremekâs beautiful expression, this Constitution stitches the two Europes together.
We are moving on from a Europe desolated by totalitarian regimes to a Europe â and this is sanctioned by the Constitution â based on democratic systems in which fundamental rights are respected.
After a Europe of ration books, this Constitution sanctions a Europe of prosperity and material well-being.
Overcoming a Europe which had disappeared from the world, this Constitution sanctions a Europe of solidarity, as demonstrated by the enormous wave of solidarity which has arisen on our continent to deal with the effects of the other terrible wave that struck Asia.
This Constitution will have, and does have, instruments which will allow Europe to play a greater role in the world from now on.
I believe that the Constitution marks a point of no return and, just as, not so long ago, the Constitution of my country was the Constitution of harmony, which allowed us to move into the future, this European Constitution is going to allow all of us Europeans to move forward together within a project of common civilisation.


The value of the European Constitution is that it removes the ambiguities; it is the first document to define what the European Union is, as a Union of States and citizens, and does not weaken the Member States, far from it, because the Unionâs competences are competences that come from the Member States, and it does not weaken national Constitutions, quite the contrary: it strengthens them, because the strength of the European Constitution stems from the strength of the national Constitutions.
With this Constitution, Europe is demonstrating that it is much more than a market; it is a market as well, and that is important, but it is much more: it is a project of common civilisation based on our religious, cultural and humanist heritage. This is acknowledged in the first sentence of the preamble, based on the values of freedom and human dignity, founded upon the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is also a Constitution that opts for a particular economic system: a capitalist system with a social dimension.
If we look at the history of Europe, we see that that was not so obvious fifty years ago.
Today it is.
For all of these reasons, I believe, Mr President, that many of the flags that this Parliament has unfurled over recent years are today standing as proud as those we have behind us.
I joined this Parliament 13 years ago, when it was a consultative assembly; today it no longer is.
I joined this Parliament when there was talk of the European Unionâs democratic deficit; I believe that the European Constitution will put an end to that democratic deficit, because this Constitution introduces more democracy, more efficiency, more clarity and more transparency, as my friend, Richard Corbett, has quite rightly pointed out.
Mr President, this work has been done by many people over many years.
I would like to acknowledge them today.
I would like to remind you of the names of Emilio Colombo, Marcelino Oreja, Fernand Herman, Giorgio Napolitano, Olivier Duhamel, Antonio Seguro, Dimitris Tsatsos, Antoinette Spaak, and so many people who, seated here in this Parliament, have defended what today is going to become a reality.
They have often been called utopians or dreamers; well, today, these dreams, these utopias, are becoming reality.
We in this Parliament can feel very proud of the work we have done.
Mr President, eight years ago in this very Chamber, a young Member of Parliament defended the opinion on the Treaty of Amsterdam and said that it was not perfect, as we knew, but that it was not the final destination, and cited, as I am going to do again today, a Miguel de Cervantes disenchanted with life in his final days, who said that there were occasions when we had to choose whether to be a road or an inn.
That was a road, and that road has led us to where we are today and I believe that today, in this comfortable inn represented by the European Constitution, over the coming years we Europeans are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move Europe forward in peace, freedom, justice and solidarity.
I would, therefore, be delighted if tomorrow this Parliament votes in favour of this document, and this is very important, since it ushers in a new era on our continent.
Â Â  Mr Schmit has the floor on behalf of the Council, and I would like to thank him in particular for being here, and also express our condolences to him and the people of Luxembourg, who are in national mourning following the death of the Grand Duchess.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank you for these expressions of solidarity with the people of Luxembourg at a time of great sorrow.
I am very grateful indeed.
Personally, this is the first time that I have had the honour of appearing before Parliament and it is therefore a great honour and a great pleasure to be able to speak in this House, on the Councilâs behalf, on a matter as important as the draft European Constitution.
I had the opportunity to work with some of you in the Convention and I feel that I can say that the work done in the Convention was historic, remarkable work that underlines the importance of the process that we are currently pursuing.
In this context, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work.
The message that you all wish to send out tomorrow by means of an overwhelming vote in Parliament is also intended for the citizens, because this Constitution is primarily a constitution for the citizens; it is they who will derive the greatest benefit from it.
It has been said that this Constitution democratises our Union.
It strengthens citizensâ rights, through the Charter of Fundamental Rights; it confers new rights on Europeâs citizens, by giving them the opportunity to interact with the institutions and in particular the Commission.
This Treaty confirms that we are no longer an economic Union and that we are more than a political Union in the making; we are, first and foremost, a Union based on common values.
In this respect, the Constitution is a crucial step in the integration process.
Once Parliament has had its say, it will be the citizensâ turn to speak, either directly, through referendums, in countries where referendums are to be held, or indirectly, through parliamentary ratification.
The Council is committed to channelling all the necessary energies for this Constitution to be adopted in all Member States.
Each Member State, each government and each parliament now has the responsibility to take us over this hurdle so that the Constitution can enter into force, and, I should add, on the scheduled date.
The European Parliament, national governments and national parliaments share a great responsibility in this respect.
We must work together if we are to meet this challenge.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Constitution before us today would not have been possible without the European Parliament.
This House has played a crucial role in strengthening the foundations of our common enterprise, not least through the substantial contributions made by Members of this Parliament during the European Convention.
It would also not have been possible without that European Convention, which provided such a dynamic, open and innovative means of negotiation.
The involvement of the European Parliament in this unprecedented process culminates today with an excellent and well-written report, which sends a clear message on the benefits of the Constitution and the need for its ratification.
I wholeheartedly congratulate Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the two rapporteurs, RichardÂ Corbett and ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
The Commission fully supports your resolution.
We firmly believe that the Constitution allows the Union to make significant improvements.
In simple terms, for the first time the powers, competences, rights and duties of the Union are set out in a single Constitution.
The Constitution consolidates and simplifies half a century of treaty changes, allowing us to move from 12Â basic treaty acts to a single text.
It makes the Union more open and simpler to understand.
The Constitution modernises the institutional structure. It increases the powers of the European Parliament and provides for citizens actively to participate in the decision-making process through a petition with one million signatures.
We will have more democracy.
The Constitution sets out, in 54 concise articles, the fundamental rights we will guarantee to our citizens.
For the first time the Union will accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, so there will be more rights for our citizens.
These three simple concepts â more rights, more democracy and more openness â explain why this Constitution should be ratified.
We would certainly have wished to be more ambitious in certain policy areas, but the final result is the best possible compromise in the current political situation.
I also accept that people have fears and criticisms regarding this Constitution.
It is not a perfect text and we should not hide from responding to these concerns.
Our latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 68% of our citizens support the idea and principle of having a European Constitution.
Other opinion polls show that many feel they are inadequately informed about the content of the Constitution.
Your report has made a good start by rejecting some of the misconceptions and scare stories about the Constitution.
It provides a range of good reasons for the Euro-specialists to be voting yes, but these are not always the reasons that will persuade a single mother in Gdansk, or a shipyard worker in Spain to do so.
The ratification of the Constitution is an opportunity to debate the kind of Europe we want.
I welcome this opportunity to remind ourselves of what Europe has achieved and what Europe stands for, as has so elegantly been explained by others.
In the mid-1980s, the vision of creating a genuine single market seemed a bridge too far.
And yet it happened, bringing in its wake an economic dynamism from which we still benefit.
To cite one simple example, the fact that we do not have to go through customs at borders has dramatically reduced costs and delivery times.
In a single step we removed the need for 60Â million VAT documents per year.
Today, the younger generation treat as a right the idea of a zone of free movement, in the same way that they expect the Union to ensure a clean environment and cross-border cooperation on public health.
Today, in 12 countries of the EU, we have a piece of Europe in our pockets, with the euro being taken for granted across the Union and with new Member States joining the queue to introduce it.
Finally, first through membership of Greece, Spain and Portugal and now with the 10 new Member States, we have helped guarantee and consolidate democracy and the rule of law across the whole continent.
We must now turn to the ratification of the Constitution.
While we respect our different constitutional roles in relation to the national ratification processes, we cannot tolerate the debate being confused by myths or misconceptions about the content of the Constitution.
All of us have a duty to make available clear and reliable information on what the Constitution does and the benefits it can bring.
In so doing we must compare the results of the Constitution with the current situation.
Lithuania and Hungary have already ratified the Constitution.
I would, in particular, like to pay tribute to Lithuania and the speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament, who is here in the Chamber today.
We must now start to show what concrete impact the Constitution can have on the daily lives of the people we represent.
Indeed, there is no shortage of good examples in this respect.
As I said earlier, the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from a symbolic innovation.
Citizens will have a catalogue of rights and principles whose respect by the public authorities â be they European or national â they will be entitled to invoke before the courts.
The possibility of concrete participation in the functioning of the Union is extended far beyond the election of the Members of the European Parliament.
The citizens' initiative will, for the first time, make European citizens protagonists in the legislative process.
Modernisation of the area of freedom, security and justice will allow the Union to respond to the growing demand for more effective European action in the fields of border controls, asylum and immigration.
The same is true for judicial and police cooperation.
The Constitution lays the foundations for a single area of liberties and guarantees.
The new provisions on public health will provide higher quality standards with regard to safety.
The Union will be able to intervene in a more effective way to prevent and fight cross-border health threats such as avian flu or BSE.
Today, we cannot avoid thinking about the tragic events in Southeast Asia.
The Union is already playing a key role in providing humanitarian aid and contributing to the political, economic and social reconstruction of that region.
The new provisions on civil protection, which entrust the Union with the task of promoting consistency in international civil protection work, will allow us to make our international action even more effective in the future.
We have, of course, already put in place a number of initiatives aimed at informing the public about the content of the Constitution.
The Commission has produced written and audio-visual material, developed a website, promoted and financed information relays, and sponsored seminars and other public initiatives.
The European Council has supported our efforts, calling on the Member States to improve their capacity for communication about European issues in the context of the ratification of the Constitution.
It is now time to move up a gear.
I seize this occasion to call on you to examine the possibility of putting in place joint communication initiatives with us that can maximise the impact of our initiatives.
I refer, in particular, to the possibility of organising media events at both European and national level during a 'European week', around 9 May 2005.
In the meantime the Commission will not refrain from developing other ideas that can assist the Member States in drawing up and implementing their national communication strategies.
I can also assure you that the Commissioners themselves will be active in the debate on the Constitution and the future of Europe.
Securing the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is the main concern for the Member States and for the European institutions.
However, while we do not intend to anticipate application of the Constitution, we must also devote some effort to ensuring a smooth entry into force of the Constitution once the ratification procedures have been successfully finalised.
That is why we need to open discussions on preparing for implementation of the current provisions.
The Commission has been engaged in this process from the start.
We are proud of the text of the Constitution and will do our utmost to ensure that it sees the light of day.
I remain committed to dialogue with the European Parliament.
Our work will not stop today. In fact it is only just starting.
I look forward to debating these issues in more detail with the Constitutional Affairs Committee and joining you on different platforms to present our case.
In conclusion, I return to my three simple concepts: more rights, more democracy and more openness.
This year we will celebrate the 15th anniversary of the rebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe.
Setting aside all other provisions of the Constitution, these three concepts alone underline why countries have joined the European Union and why the Commission will defend this Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have come a long way, and those of us who were Members of the previous Parliament will be able to remember how, in this Chamber, we debated the Treaty of Nice.
At the time, many of us were unsatisfied with it, and we said that our stance on the Treaty of Nice would ultimately depend on what new method of reform we might have in the future and on what the efforts at reform added up to.
The result of that is in front of us today: the Treaty on a Constitution for the European Union.
Unlike in December 2000, when we discussed Nice in the absence of the Central European countries â Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia (which is now the Czech Republic), Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia, not to mention Malta and Cyprus, none of whom had yet joined us, it is a particularly happy circumstance that today, the day when we are debating the Constitution, we have among us Members from these countries, particularly from those European countries that were once Communist.
I think that is a wonderful symbol of the future we share on the continent of Europe.
I would like to extend very warm thanks to Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo for the outstanding work they have done together with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and also to all those who assisted them in it.
Today, I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Convention, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, for the work he did, which was sometimes on the receiving end of criticism, but if he had not done as he did, we would probably not have this Constitution today, and so Mr Giscard d'Estaing deserves our warmest gratitude today.
We are the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) â and of the European Democrats.
There are 128 MEPs in the European Peopleâs Party, and the DE part of our group has 40 Members.
Speaking for the PPE part of our group, I can assure you that we will be saying âyesâ to this Constitution without reservations, while the European Democrats in our group are entitled to come up with their own positions.
A constitution needs values.
Almost as crucial as the procedures are the values that bind us together, for if we have no awareness of values, we have no foundation on the basis of which we can take political action.
We rejoice that many of our values, which we see as Christian, have been included: human dignity, the dignity of older people, the worth of children too.
I think it particularly splendid that children get a mention in the Constitution, for without children, this continent has no future, that we have described our values and banned cloning, and that reference is made to our principles â the rule of law, democracy, subsidiarity and solidarity.
All these things give us cause to say âyesâ.
Today, though, I would not wish to deny that many of us would have welcomed a reference to God in the Constitution, because it affirms that our human capacities are not infinite.
We would also have been glad to see reference made to our Judaeo-Christian heritage, for, at a time when dialogue with the worldâs cultures is so necessary â particularly with the Islamic world â I believe that it is important that we know where our own roots are, and that our cultural and religious development should be mentioned in the Constitution.
Even though that is not in the Constitution, every Constitution is of course a compromise, and so we say âyesâ to this Constitution, because it reflects our values.
It is also proper that a constitution should include a description of the constitutional structure of the European Union, and I think it is particularly successful in this, talking as it does in terms of national identity.
Europe is not a melting pot, nor is it meant to become a superstate; on the contrary, it is in its diversity that Europeâs wealth is to be found, beginning in our towns and communities, where people live, and in the regions.
Our nation states have their own identities.
We have a Constitutional Treaty which declares that it is from the nation states that the Constitution originates.
It is through our own national citizenship that we are citizens of Europe, and hence freedom of organisation for local authorities is made explicit in the subsidiary structure of Europe.
I think that is quite a masterstroke.
Jean Monnet, the first Honorary Citizen of Europe, once said that nothing is possible without people, and that nothing lasts without institutions, and what he said is true to this day.
If we do not have values which underpin everything, and if these values are not ultimately expressed in institutions that embody them, then those values cannot be realised.
That is why it is right that we should follow Jean Monnetâs directions and go down the road that leads to Europe as a community, and, my dear friends â I apologise for using an expression current in my own party, but, as we are talking about the Constitution today, we are somehow joined together as one, not that our differences should be obscured â neither now nor in the future must it be intergovernmentalism or cooperation between governments that shapes the European Union.
The Europe of the future must rather be founded upon the Community method, and upon the Community action of the European institutions.
What this means for us is that we need a strong European Parliament, one that is a symbol of democracy, that we should act as equals in all matters affecting European legislation, that we need a strong Commission, deriving its legitimacy from its election by the European Parliament and hence also from European elections, and that we have to have a Council of Ministers whose actions are transparent.
Let me conclude by saying that much that is in the Constitution is in the nature of a programme and has yet to become reality.
An example of this is Article 750, which states how we are to live as good neighbours alongside the peoples of Europe who have a European vocation â and right now it is Ukraine of which I am thinking.
Another is foreign policy, an area in which we cannot, in future, allow ourselves to speak with two or three voices, but must act jointly.
That is why it is not Member States of the European Union, as such, that should be seeking to join the UN Security Council, but rather the European Union as a whole, if it wants to be a global actor for human rights and democracy.
It is the European Union as such that must be represented in the United Nations.
We have many tasks ahead of us.
I speak for my group when I say that I hope there will be broad support for this Constitution, not only here in this House, but also in all the Member States, because this Constitution is the means whereby we will get through the twenty-first century as a Europe of freedom, democracy and peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this coming 27 January will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Auschwitz.
The foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community a few years later was a direct consequence of what had happened during the Second World War.
The fathers and mothers of European cooperation could see with their own eyes that ultra-nationalism, Fascism, and the division of our continent by Bolshevism, always resulted in oppression, in terror, and in the dignity of the individual being lost.
They could also see that what created peace, dignity and democracy was supranational action and integration at a supranational, European level.
It is worth adding that this was then achieved through the Coal and Steel Community gaining control of the weapons-manufacturing industries.
If you trace a continuous line from the ECSC to the European Economic Community, through the next act of integration to the European Community and then to the EU as we know it today, you find a success story as yet unequalled in the world, for it looked not only to 1945, and to the end of a war of destruction on this continent; the next stages incorporated states that had, in the post-war era, had their own political changes to cope with, namely Greece, Portugal and Spain, and so the overcoming of their fascist dictatorships and the stabilisation of democracy through membership of the European Community was an enormous success in the late 1970s and 1980s.

What we saw happening in the 1990s, when the states that have now acceded took their present form, was, in principle, a triumph over Communist oppression in one part of Europe.
The European Union is a union that has managed to take the values described in our Charter of Fundamental Rights and use them as the basis of democratic integration and to overcome both the Fascism and the Communism of Europeâs past.
The events of recent days, in which people have been powerless in the face of forces that no amount of technology has enabled them to confront, show how absolutely necessary it is for action to be taken at the supranational level, with no national borders standing in the way.
In the global village, the European Union is Europeâs rational and modern response to the challenges of the twenty-first century.
The Constitution we are now debating is the framework provided for it.
Our group will be voting in favour of the Corbett/MÃ©ndez de Vigo report â out of profound conviction, and also out of the conviction that the values described in this constitution are civil values.
The splendid thing about them is that you can understand them as Christian values if you are a Christian. You can understand them as your own values if you are a Jew or a Moslem or an unbeliever.
These values are universal and indivisible, and so they are valid for everyone.
That also makes it easy for us, despite the divisions that otherwise separate us, to join together in supporting this Constitution, but if we do that, it is our shared basis for a democratic and dignified future in a social community with social responsibility and economic prosperity.
In the knowledge-based society of the future, this Union of ours must, at one and the same time â and the Constitution does indeed set this out in black and white â perform its social tasks and guarantee the protection of the individual and of every citizen from the dangers present in this divided world.
That is what this Constitution will be able to achieve, and we are largely agreed that we are willing and obliged to stand up for it and contend for it.
One thing alone is lacking, and, speaking for our group, I will spell out what it is.
For the European Parliament to commit itself and mobilise itself is not enough.
Those who signed their names to this Constitution at the dignified ceremony in Rome, which all of us chairmen of groups were allowed to attend, Europeâs Heads of State or Government and foreign ministers, must, in the same way as we do, appear before the peoples and declare that this is our Constitution and that we want it.
Far from this being one individual matter to be left to the European Parliament or to the Commission, the statesmen and stateswomen of Europe must do their part and affirm this to be their work â not only the work of the European Parliament or of the Convention on their own.
It is those things too, but it is the work of all those who carry responsibility for Europeâs future, and they must affirm, before the peoples of Europe, their support for it.
If they do that, this Constitution will enjoy majority support, with the support of the PPE Group and probably even of that Groupâs European Democrats.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Poettering properly reminds us that when Parliament reacted to previous reforms of the Treaties, the resolutions adopted were peppered with regrets, criticisms and things that we deplore, plus demands for further reform.
This time, we are not obliged to do this because we ourselves have been prominently involved in the drafting of the reforms, both in the Convention and the IGC.
This report by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo gets the story right and I am pleased to say that all Members of my Group who will be speaking today will be speaking in favour of this resolution.
Thereafter we will be out campaigning for the entry into force inside the Member States where referenda are to be held, including in France â to oppose certain factions of the left â and in Britain, where we will be fighting to oppose the right.
The principal argument for this great reform is clearly that it strengthens the European Union.
It strengthens our capacity to act abroad and inside our Member States, making us prepared to stand on our own feet in world affairs, shaping Europe's response to globalisation politically.
The Constitution redefines the European Union.
It strikes a balance between states â the old and the new, the large and the small â between citizens and the authorities and, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing has said, between dream and reality.
It has created a fresh, large consensus behind the project of European integration.
A word to those such as the British Conservatives who carp on the sidelines: if you are for Europe, you should be for the Constitution.
Europe cannot be constructed without clear, liberal and social values, strong rules and robust parliamentary democracy.
Europe will not work without strong authorities in Brussels.
Without the Constitution, things will not work properly and the quality of policy flowing from Brussels and Strasbourg will begin to decline.
Future expansion will be out of the question and I cannot believe that is what the British Conservative Party really believes in.
But Europe cannot work either without strong leadership.
This Parliament must learn to fill some of the strategic space that the reforms begin to open up for us.
We have many new powers, including, importantly, the right to propose a reform â a reform in the future of the Constitution itself.
The Commission must assert itself quickly as the new arrangements for the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Service, the team presidency and especially the so-called full-time President of the European Council are put in place.
The prime ministers and presidents must coordinate their campaigns.
I am pleased to hear what Mr Schmit said on that.
They must shoulder their individual and collective responsibility to win these referendum campaigns by showing the voters why these reforms are for them and why this is truly the Constitution for Europe.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, a majority in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in favour of ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, because it sees it as an important step on the road leading to the political integration of our continent.
Despite the Treatyâs many shortcomings, there are no other alternatives in the current political and institutional context.
The proposed Constitution establishes the Union as a community based on fundamental rights, grounds European policies in a code of common values, defines clear and binding objectives, and expresses a commitment to uphold sustainability in the economic, social and environmental fields.
It includes social rights among traditional human rights, ties the Unionâs external actions to compliance with international law, simplifies procedures, clarifies competences, expands the scope of Community decisions, and increases transparency and the democratic legitimacy of the Union, as well as opportunities for its citizens to play a part.
The text has a good many gaps and pitfalls in it, and it is understandable that there should be growing disaffection towards the European project among many people, associations and movements politically close to us, in whose eyes the Union is not yet able to respond to their concerns or to be a political entity fully able to act for a better, less unfair world.
To deny this reality, as our fellow Members do in their report, is, in our view, inappropriate.
Turning the motion for a European Parliament resolution almost into a propaganda exercise, pretending that it is the ideal outcome of noble, harmonious work done in the best possible manner, even saying that the Intergovernmental Conference left the Conventionâs text unaltered â although we know that that is not true because all the amendments made by the Intergovernmental Conference made the text worse: one need only think of the Legislative Council or the disagreement over the budget â none of that will convince a single Eurosceptic or help us win over all those who, far from fearing a non-existent European superstate, know that the Union is not yet united enough or cohesive enough.
For us Greens, the European integration process cannot be considered complete with the adoption of the Constitution, partly because other countries and peoples, beyond the current 25, are still finishing or starting out on their journey to join the Union.
In that respect too, unlike the rapporteurs, we believe that the Unionâs institutional system is still too confused and complicated and will not last much longer without further reform.
We therefore believe that any development and improvement of the future European Union will depend on ratification of this text.
It is a dangerous illusion to believe that rejecting this text would prepare the way for another, better or even ideal constitution.
On the contrary, throwing it out would leave us with the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are much less advanced in terms of both the values of their objectives and the institutional structure they propose.
If the Treaty were defeated, it would be an ideal opportunity for the Eurosceptics to point out that the people no longer want Europe, whereas we know very well that this is not the case.
It would also convince many governments that the Convention method â that timid, half-hearted attempt to overthrow undemocratic, inefficient methods of reform like diplomatic talks and the power of veto â can lead nowhere.
We therefore have a double objective: to approve this Constitution so that we can quickly lay the foundations for its successor, by seeking to build a strong, stable alliance with those political, social, associative and economic forces that believe, as we do, that in order to achieve our aims of social justice, ecologically sustainable development and peace, we must not only win the elections again at a national level, but also make European democracy stronger and more complete.
To do that, we need to take back the initiative, and it is on that point, MrÂ President, that I believe it will be possible to rebuild a united front of all those who are today convinced of the inescapable need for European democracy but are divided in their evaluation of this text.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the report by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo concentrates almost exclusively on a series of new provisions that are not in the current Treaties. Such provisions include replacing the rotating presidency with a more stable two-and-a-half-year presidency, creating the post of minister for foreign affairs, albeit without communitarising the common foreign and security policy, strengthening Parliamentâs powers, according national parliaments the right to call the Commission to account, where they feel it has overstepped its powers, and giving a million citizens the opportunity to propose that the Commission table a draft law on a particular matter.
If the text submitted for ratification by the citizens or by the parliaments were in fact limited to that type of provision, many members of my group âÂ not all, but many of them, including meÂ â would not be opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty.
We are in favour of Europe and in favour of anything that serves to enhance Europeâs democracy and improve its functioning.
We should not be bracketed with the UK Independence Party.
We feel that there is a great need for Europe in this globalised world, but what guidelines and structures do we need for Europe? That is the question.
The first thing we need, in our view, is a set of guidelines and structures that enable us, at Union level, to control the financial markets, rather than be entirely at their mercy, as we are now.
This can be done, provided that it is agreed to make use of powerful levers such as the Central Bank and taxation of the capital of major public bodies; to make laws aimed at holding companies accountable on social, environmental, democratic and ethical issues; to channel funds thus released into major political priorities that are publicly debated, democratically established and regularly assessed.
Europe is therefore the appropriate level to meet challenges that a single country would nowadays have difficulty in tackling, due to globalisation.
It follows, for that very reason, that we need guidelines and structures whereby we can reverse the trend of maintaining the main decision-making centres at a distance from the people, and whereby we can reclaim popular sovereignty and the power to make political choices, instead of submitting to the laws of the market, even if that means encouraging fatalism, that deadly enemy of democracy.
In other words, to achieve those objectives, Europe is also a relevant level, a level at which it is appropriate to promote the rights of workers, citizens, members of Parliament and the public authorities to access information and to take action, in order to reduce the arrogant power of those who tend to see themselves as modern day feudal lords.
Indeed, if there is a role that we are amply entitled to expect Europe to take on in full, it is that of responsible player on the world stage, determined to use its influence to bring about the introduction of a fresh set of rules governing international relations.
Let us consider the potentially salutary influence of, say, a European decision explicitly to ban all recourse to war as a means of solving the worldâs problems, so as to ensure that, from the Middle East to the Caucasus, the force of politics prevails over the politics of force. Think of the positive influence of a decision to conclude alliances between Europe and the countries of the south that will extend to include international financial and trade institutions, thereby tackling head-on the murderous onslaught of economic war; or of a decision to establish with the United States, of course, the will to forge â with that great nation and with others â the most ambitious partnership possible, yet within a framework of total political and strategic independence.
If you harbour such ambitions for Europe, then perhaps some of you could tell us why, in that case, you are opposed to this draft Constitution.
You are opposed to it precisely because this text takes up provisions accumulated in particular since the Maastricht Treaty, in order to perpetuate them, solemnly and for the long term; provisions that constitute so many obstacles to even the partial implementation of such a European project.
I refer in particular to the key principles of the open market economy in which competition is free; to the fact that the European Central Bank can no longer have liberal statutes or a liberal mission; to the Commissionâs discretionary powers as regards competition or indeed the blatant subordination of all European security and defence policy to the policy formed within NATO.
New provisions are added to those old ones, thereby widening still further the gulf separating the concept of Europe that is being constructed from the one that I have just mentioned.
The draft Treaty thus contains an article which calls, in the fiery spirit of the multilateral agreement on investments, for the removal of restrictions on foreign direct investment and of other dangerously ambiguous articles relating to life patenting or indeed to cultural diversity.
In all of these fields, what we need is not a propaganda campaign that brooks no contradiction, but a frank, public, pluralist review of the experience of recent years which has led to a breakdown of trust between the citizens and the European institutions.
As for the report by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, it does not say a word about the part of the draft constitutional Treaty devoted to the policies and functioning of the Union, which in fact accounts for two thirds of the whole text.
We are therefore opposed to this report, just as we are opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty itself. Once again, however, I wish to make it clear that the ânoâ that many of us are saying is open to alternative suggestions.
It is a European ânoâ.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one word missing from this Constitution, and that word is âsovereigntyâ.
It has been replaced by the word âidentityâ, which is not at all the same thing.
In the four corners of the earth, as we well know, there are peoples who have strong identities and who rightly claim sovereignty, such as the Palestinians, the Iraqis and many others.
In Europe, there will now be peoples who, at a time when they are at risk of losing their identities with Turkey set to join the EU, will lose their sovereignty when the Constitution comes into force.
One word has disappeared, the word âsovereigntyâ, and another has appeared, the word âlawâ, European law, a word that is the very symbol of national democracies.
There is therefore going to be a European law, henceforth on a higher legal level than national laws, even constitutional laws.
Our Constitution, therefore, for each of our peoples, will become the equivalent of the internal regulations of a region of Europe.
This European, supranational law will from now on be adopted by majority and not unanimously.
There is therefore no longer any opportunity for a particular people to voice its opposition, even if this is a matter of defending its vital interests.
Thirdly, this supranational European law will be drawn up by a Brussels bureaucracy that has had the attributes of a State conferred on it.
That bureaucracy is becoming a full-scale international player, with the right to conclude international agreements, with a minister for foreign affairs; those words do not lie. It will enjoy the transfer to its remit of the powers of a superstate â the capacity to draw up laws, to define public services and to address matters relating to immigration and borders.
At the same time â and this will be my last point â national democracies will be trampled underfoot.
National parliaments are having their capacity to make laws removed from them.
To compensate for this, they have been given the right to deliver opinions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteurs for undertaking the very difficult task of trying to find some areas of agreement on the Treaty in the very diverse institution and august body that this Parliament is.
However, in one sense the debate has moved on, because it is now up to the Member States and the debate on the Treaty-ratification process that takes place in the Member States.
It is up to the people to determine what the level of debate and discussion and the final verdict on this Constitutional Treaty will be.
Many times when we speak about the issues involved, in spite of our best efforts, some of us would like to see new things added to what has already been agreed.
Therefore, we are fighting the next argument rather than dealing with the current debate.
In addition, when you listen to some of the debate, it is like going back to the future, because the same issues and points that were raised in opposition to the first treaties in the 1950s, and to the second and subsequent treaties in the 1970s and 1980s, are being rehashed.
People are saying that this is the prophet of doom and gloom about to come and join us and take our power away.
Let us be realistic about what is in this Treaty and what is good and bad about it.
As a basis for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the future, it is a very good document.
It ensures there will be proper respect and trust for the Member States and for their roles within it, in particular for the smaller Member States; it clearly sets down in the doctrine of conferral who has the power to do what and where the lines of demarcation are drawn.
When the people who oppose this Treaty and have opposed other treaties say that this will override national law, this issue has already been decided.
Back in the 1960s in the European Court of Justice, the primacy of European law over national law was brought into being.
However, the Treaty clearly defines that and narrows down that role, namely that it only operates for European law.
The European institutions and European lawmakers have been given the power by the Member States to make that law.
So let us have a real and honest debate.
Let us move away from the lies, the fear and scaremongering that takes place.
Some people will be justified in opposing this Treaty because of their political beliefs, ideologies or their genuine concerns about what it means for those Member States.
But let us ensure that the debate is based on fact, truth and the written text and not on misconceptions.
Â Â  Mr President, though this House, in self-congratulatory euphoria, will embrace this Constitution, thankfully the ultimate decision rests with the Member States.
It is their votes that really matter.
What I despise most is the false pretence, particularly prevalent in the UnitedÂ Kingdom, that this Constitution is merely a tidying-up exercise made necessary by enlargement and that it will settle the constitutional shape of Europe for generations.
That is demonstrably false.
Those who peddle that deception are best exposed by the Constitution's own most ardent and more honest proponents.
In the Constitutional Affairs Committee, I have observed at first hand the strategy and scheming of arch Europhiles.
They make no secret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in itself, but a work in progress and they do nothing to conceal their ambition to have it, in their terms, strengthened at the first opportunity â without, of course, the troublesome obstacle of further national consultation.
Their undisguised candour gives the lie to those who would deceive voters into thinking that this is a mere tidying-up exercise: it is not.
The choice for the nation-states is this: a choice between a Europe of cooperating sovereign nation-states, or a Europe that is itself a superstate.
Despite all the denials, this Constitution is a framework for superstatehood.
It declares its supremacy over national constitutions; it proclaims the subservience of national law; it appoints its own president and foreign minister.
It relegates national parliaments to mere consultative sounding boards; it trades meaningful democracy for the pseudo-democracy of this House; it neuters the last defence of the nation-state by increasingly supplanting the national veto with radically increased qualified majority voting; and it provides an unbridled path to further integration by permitting amendment by heads of government rather than by the people.
Anyone with pride in his or her own nation, who does not want to see it subsumed into a hideous conglomerate, will reject this tawdry Constitution.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have been given here is a Constitutional Treaty founded on the work of a Convention composed largely of parliamentarians, and, as it was they who made this breakthrough possible, the development of Europe is no longer in the hands of diplomats.
Ninety per cent of the draft produced by the Convention then went through the Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe that it was this method, involving the peoples of Europe through their elected representatives, that was crucial in terms of the progress made.
Not everything in this constitution is perfect, but I think the decisive thing is that it is better than what we have at present.
This Constitutional Treaty reinforces the citizens in their rights; the Charter of Fundamental Rights will give them entitlements and safeguards.
It strengthens citizensâ rights because, in future, the election of the President of the Commission will be directly dependent on the votes of the European Parliament.
The publicâs hand is strengthened both by the referendum and by extending the rights of the European Parliament.
This Constitution has become more transparent, because it makes the allocation of powers and responsibilities clearer, thereby making procedures more readily comprehensible, and because the Council is, at least when taking decisions on lawmaking, required to meet in public.
The extension of majority decision-making may well not be sufficient, but it is considerable, and it does make the European Union more efficient, something that is apparent in other areas, for example, in the removal of the pillars structure and the introduction of a single legal personality, and, in particular, in the substantial improvements made in the fields of foreign, security and defence policies.
Our Europe is founded upon values.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which I regard as drawing to a high degree on the Christian conception of what humanity is, is âÂ or so I believe â one of its wonders.
Having been drafted by a previous Convention, the marvellous thing about it now is that so many peoples can take such a common basis of values as their guide and that those who make our laws in future must look to see that these values are adhered to â and this is legally binding rather than a matter of policy.
We want this Europe of ours to be a community, and that is what the Convention wanted.
Now, as we move to make the Constitution work, we have to attach high priority to what the Convention wanted being retained, without it being altered by a technocratic approach to its implementation.
Even now, we have a Foreign Service on which to practise, and we are constantly hearing of attempts already being made in the corridors of countriesâ foreign ministries to contest the Commissionâs powers â and hence also those of the European Community and its Parliament â as a means towards establishing a new intergovernmental authority.
In the way it is represented abroad, too, the European Union is a Community, and we see this in its foreign relations, in development and in many other areas of activity, and this must not be changed by the technocratic way these are shared out in a foreign service.
Here we have fought to secure substantial rights for the Commission, without whose consent nothing happens, and I would point out to it and to the Council that we will keep a very close eye on this.
The way in which Europeâs powers and responsibilities are ordered makes clear that those powers and responsibilities are conferred by the Member States, and it is for this reason that all this talk of a superstate is complete nonsense.
The fact is that sovereignty continues to be vested in the Member States, and every competence not expressly defined as being European remains with them.
In this respect, this Constitution surpasses anything else we have had; as the opponents of a superstate argue that Nice is worse, it is they who must surely be in favour of the Constitution.
That is the truth of the matter, and so I would ask Mr Allister and Mr de Villiers to take an open-minded look at the way things are and not tell their voters and the public things that are not true.
This Europe seeks to pool sovereignty where we as individual states are too weak to go it alone.
What this means is that we do not want to take sovereignty away; on the contrary, we want to reclaim it for our citizens where we cannot act otherwise.
Now that the tsunami has struck, we can see that the nation-states can no longer help on their own, because it is beyond us, and that is why our peoples need to be given additional strength through our standing together in order to have a chance of survival in this globalised world order.
That, after all, is the whole point of this European enterprise, whose traditional objective has been to make war in Europe impossible â an objective of which we must not lose sight.
At the same time, the citizens, states and peoples must retain their own identities.
In the future, too, I would like, as a German, to be able to get angry when we lose at football to the Dutch.
We want to retain our identity.
It is in diversity that our wealth is to be found.
That cannot mean, though, that we do not take joint action in situations in which our strength depends on our standing together.
We should see to it that the Constitution is successfully ratified.
Domestic, day-to-day policy must not be allowed to decide how the Member States and their parties handle the ratification process; what is, instead, decisive is the historic moment, in which it will become apparent where the statesmen are in the Member States, moving the process of ratification forward.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo on their outstanding report.
This Constitution is indeed our baby, and even if it does have a few flaws, there are no ifs or buts in our commitment to it.
We want it to grow and flourish.
Let me say, secondly, that the greatest challenge for the European Union is not Turkish membership in twenty yearsâ time, but the ratification of the European Constitution in two.
It is by that that history will judge us, and â let me say â not just the politicians, but also the peoples of Europe.
I have confidence in the peoplesâ intelligence, and in that of their parliaments.
In two yearsâ time, the Constitution will be in place.
After all, what will happen if it is not?
Those who believe that the status quo under the Treaty of Nice will continue to prevail in Europe are hankering after an illusion.
Europe will not shake itself down into a core Europe and a fringe Europe, either; on the contrary, without a European Constitution, the European Union will degenerate into a patchwork Europe, confusing the public at home and destroying Europeâs credibility in the eyes of the world.
It would be criss-crossed by the axes and alliances of what would claim to be strategic partnerships.
If the Constitution fails, we will revert to a Europe of plots and counter-plots, the old Europe, and it is precisely that that we do not want.
The Constitution brings to an end twelve years of intermittent reform, which have taken us from Maastricht to Nice via Amsterdam and from 12 to 15, and then to 25, Member States.
Now at last, Europe can again give its full attention to the political challenges of the twenty-first century, which are enormous.
We do, though, have a new basis on which to do this.
The 25 different peoples, all of whom want to retain their identity â and will do so â who robbed and murdered each other, waged war on each other and laid each other waste for centuries; these 25 peoples are now indissolubly uniting their political destinies.
No such thing has been done before in Europeâs history or that of the world.
That is what makes our fight for this constitution so worthwhile.
Let me say, fourthly, that European unification was, for fifty years, an inward-looking affair, focussing on the accession and integration of new Member States.
From now on, it must look outwards.
Europe is not a world power, but it does have a world powerâs responsibility, and that responsibility we have to be able to live up to.
The twenty-firstÂ century will present Europeans with immense challenges: globalised business and financial flows, international terrorism, climate change and the disasters associated with it, and the flow of migrants.
A new world order is coming into being â not in ten yearsâ time, but now!
Economically speaking, Europe is â still â a global player.
Politically speaking, we are in the regional league.
If we Europeans do not face up to these challenges now, we will be exiting the stage of world history â politically at first, and then â inevitably â economically.
That is not the Europe for us to leave to our children.
Europeâs response to globalisation is the unity of its peoples.
That is our response to the challenges of the twenty-first century.
Let me conclude by saying that the Constitution provides two guiding lights for the European Unionâs actions in the future.
In the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Constitution affirms that the EU exists not only to guarantee the freedoms of the market, but also so that the citizens may enjoy the freedoms to which they are entitled.
Article 3 of the Constitution commits the EU to working towards peace, security and the sustainable development of the earth, thus affirming that the Union bears responsibility for our planet rather than existing for its own sake.
Freedom for humanity and responsibility for the world â from these grows the new Europeâs identity.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the American publicist Jeremy Rifkin recently wrote a book about the European Union and entitled it âThe European Dreamâ.
I am grateful to the President for making it possible for Mr Rifkin to be with us this afternoon, and for giving us the opportunity to discuss with him the future of Europe and of the European ideal.
This book is a dazzling analysis of the achievements and innovations of fifty years of European unification, which are truly unique and to be found nowhere else in the world: direct elections in 25 countries to one parliament; a court of law capable of handing down rulings for all citizens and all states; one single currency in twelve countries, enabling us to defend our economic sovereignty at a time of globalisation; and, now, a European constitution on the table before us.
This is something of which Europeans should be proud; they really should take great pride in what has been achieved.
It is, however, glaringly apparent that such a euphoric analysis is the product of observation from outside Europe, for the European Union evokes astonishment and admiration from around the world: in Africa â having heard President Mbekiâs speech to this House, we know what expectations are placed in Europe; in Asia, where Europe is giving extraordinary help to deal with the present disaster; and also in America, both North and South.
I sometimes wish there were less small-mindedness, less fearfulness and less scepticism within the European Union.
Rather than being afraid of the project of European unification, we should hold our heads high with pride.
We are a model, and a model secured by the European Constitution.
Some of Europeâs dreams have already come true.
We still have work to do on the others.
As has already been said, the founding fathersâ great dream was that, after a millennium of war, peace would at last be restored to the continent, and the EU is the greatest peace project in the world.
Many peoples have longed for freedom and democracy.
Let me say it again: the EU is the greatest peace project that there has ever been on this continent.
Many of those around us find the EU very attractive and want to join it.
Some dreams, though, have not come true in a time such as this, in which crime, terrorism and the challenges of globalisation are gnawing away at the European Social Model.
I believe we will be better able to make the dream of prosperity and security a reality with this Constitution than without it.
Such are the big issues that have to be explained to people everywhere over the coming eighteen months, as ratification is debated in the twenty-five countries.
The Europeansâ great dream, the long-term goals of this European project and the values that underpin it: these are what we must communicate, and we must not allow ourselves to get lost in trivia or details.
One Member on my committee once said that we must not now count the individual trees, the 448 articles, and pick out one; instead we must look at the whole wood, the project as a whole.
It is then that we come to the conclusion that this is a great leap forward, from a union of states to a union of citizens, from diplomatic Europe to a democratic Europe.
Nothing is set in stone, and there will of course be more stages to European unification.
That is what we should be saying to all those who are not yet satisfied.
I want to thank Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo for producing a really good report, which will prepare this House for dialogue with our partners in the national parliaments and the citizens of twenty-five countries.
I am glad that the European Constitution owes much to this House, from Altiero Spinelliâs âCrocodile Clubâ to the European Constitution Intergroup in the previous and present legislative periods, in which many Members have worked to achieve progress in this area.
We rejoice and are glad that this draft is now on the table.
We must now do everything possible to ensure that this draft becomes reality rather than existing only in black and white.
There have already been two drafts; this third attempt at a European Constitution must see the light of day.
If, tomorrow, we vote for the Constitution by a large majority, everyone will go out and fight for it.
Europeâs friends must not let this historic opportunity be taken out of their hands.
We must not leave the field to its opponents, who will lead their countries and peoples into isolation and down a political cul-de-sac.
Â Â  . Mr President, Parliamentâs Committee on Development expressed decisive support for the constitutional text, in the belief that it represents historic progress by establishing solidarity with those who need it most, development cooperation and responsibility in humanitarian assistance, wherever it is required, as defining characteristics of the European Union.
In the opinion of the Committee on Development, we call for mobilisation so that the Constitution can be ratified and can enter into force as soon as possible, and for that mobilisation to involve those institutions, NGOs and individuals in Europe who have made North-South solidarity a fundamental cause within our political struggle and our social commitment.
Let us remember, therefore, that the Constitution makes these values of solidarity and cooperation and humanitarian responsibility the European Unionâs distinguishing marks and that, accordingly, they must transcend all policies and guide all Community actions.
The Constitution also means that, in the future, the European Union will have the legal personality we have lacked and which will allow us to act as a Union on the international stage and particularly within the realm of the United Nations.
In this way, we will be making considerable progress with regard to representativeness, responsibility, efficiency and potential, which are particularly important in terms of the European Unionâs presence and work in the countries of the developing world and in the field of development cooperation.
Let us not forget that the eradication of poverty in the world is explicitly laid down as one of the European Unionâs constitutional objectives.
We will end â though this is of particular relevance given the current circumstances in Southeast Asia â by stressing that the Constitution provides for the creation of a European body of volunteers for humanitarian actions, thereby demonstrating its considerable timeliness and capacity for anticipation.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the area of trade policy, this Constitution puts the European Parliament in a much stronger position.
When, as was formerly the case, the European Parliamentâs democratic control did not extend to trade policy, that gave rise to constant criticism.
This House did not even have to be consulted when the autonomous trade legislation was adopted.
In future, necessary measures will have to be laid down by European acts and framework legislation, so, in principle, Parliament will participate as an equal.
That is something in which we should take great satisfaction.
It is still, however, a source of anguish that it has still not yet been possible to make qualified majority voting the norm in the Council.
On this, the Convention was more advanced than the Intergovernmental Conference.
Nevertheless, this Constitution makes for greater consistency in the trade policy matters that we have been dealing with within the WTO ever since the Uruguay round.
This Constitution puts the European Union on a better legal footing for conducting negotiations.
Â Â  .
Mr President, for those of us who work to ensure that the Unionâs economic resources are well spent, this is a good day: all spending is going to be subject to greater democratic control by Parliament and the Council, and efficiency in spending is going to increase, because governability is being increased: we are replacing vetoes with democracy.
That means we are going to be able to spend better; and if the resources the citizens contribute are better spent, we will have more authority to ask for more resources in order to implement the policies the citizens are demanding of the European Union.
It is, therefore, a great day, a day for being happy to say âyesâ, at a time when, through this Constitution, we are bringing the European project to fruition after fifty years.
This Constitution brings much progress with it; nevertheless, as our Group President, Mr Poettering, quite rightly said, it is lacking certain things.
We have been timid in terms of acknowledging our Christian roots, we have been timid in recognising the obvious.
We have just celebrated Christmas; this Parliament will stop at Easter; here in Strasbourg the most important building is not a building like this one, but a medieval building, a cathedral.
Perhaps we have been victim to a degree of intolerant secularism, but Christmas, Easter and the Strasbourg Cathedral will still be there and there are many aspects we have been able to improve.
We must, therefore, say âyesâ, because we believe in Europe and we are aware that this European project is going to resolve the daily problems of the citizens.
We are going to do so in the best way: by spending better, controlling our spending better and having more democratic and effective policies.
Our group and I personally say yes to the Constitution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there was a large majority of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who voted in favour of the new draft Constitution.
We did so not because we thought that the proposal was perfect in all respects.
Indeed, we should like to see more decisions with qualified majority voting in the social area.
I myself should like to see opportunities exist for cross-border union rights.
We voted in favour because this proposal in the social area is better than the current proposal.
We must not turn the best into the enemy of the good when we judge the new draft Constitution.
Let me give a few examples of improvements.
Firstly, the objective of full employment.
This is the first time we have this objective in any draft for the new Constitution.
Secondly, the social clause in Part III, which obliges the EU to meet the social objectives in all the areas of competence.
Thirdly, the fundamental rights in the Charter of Citizensâ Rights, which also includes union rights.
Fourthly, the strengthening of the social partnersâ role through recognition of the significance of the social dialogue and trialogue.
Fifthly, the emphasis upon the balance between employment policy and macroeconomic policy.
Sixthly, the introduction of a legal basis for services of general economic interest.
Seventhly, the fact that EU citizens are now able to take initiatives.
The new draft Constitution would make the EU more open, more efficient and more democratic.
For ourselves who defend the social model, it is quite easy to support the new draft Constitution because it includes a long list of improvements which will significantly improve the opportunities for developing the social model in the future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a position with regard to the Constitution, of which I shall highlight the following salient points: we welcome the fact that the implementation of the three pillars of sustainable development is among the Unionâs objectives and that environmental integration and a high level of protection for human beings have been recognised.
It is a pity that the third part relating to the Unionâs policies and functioning does not tally with the principle of sustainable development, within the scope of the policies on agriculture, cohesion, transport and trade.
Certain environmental measures â such as those relating to tax, town planning, quantitative water management and land use â could be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, but instead are still adopted unanimously by the Council.
We welcome the adoption of measures aimed at attaining high standards of quality and safety of medicines and medical devices.
Measures relating to surveillance and early warning systems in the fight against serious cross-border health threats are also a step in the right direction.
Such measures form part of the EUâs shared powers and are therefore subject to the ordinary legislative procedure.
We welcome the introduction of a chapter on democratic life in the Union, and the principle whereby these positions must be taken as transparently as possible and in the manner that is closest to the citizens.
Furthermore, we should like to highlight the importance of the Community institutionsâ responsibility towards the public, and public access to the courts and other relevant organisations, not least in the field of the environment.
Personally, Mr President, I feel that the next step is to discover how the public will take to the new constitutional structure; how this Constitution, which has been created in a somewhat top-down fashion, will be received and experienced from the bottom upwards; and how the principle of equality between States and the Community method will be strictly guaranteed in practice.
Only history will be able to tell us.
Â Â  . Mr President, although Mr Leinen has enjoined us to consider the whole forest of the Constitution, and not just individual trees, I must, as spokesman for the Committee on Industry, give brief attention to the trees of industrial policy, some of which I might wish would grow better than the Constitution makes provision for.
Some significant progress has, though, been made.
The example I would like to give is that of space policy, for which Europe now has additional powers; it may well not sound either particularly everyday or convincing, but I am not talking about us competing with the Americans or the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else in sending our man â or woman â to the moon or to Mars.
Rather, what I am talking about is our making use of the means of information afforded by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also around the globe.
Consider, then, the great disaster that we now have to deal with: we need better information and warning systems, and Europe has the technology to provide them.
Consider the day-to-day problems and tasks in connection with information and navigation that our Galileo has to deal with, and, finally, let us give thought to security policy.
We cannot deploy our troops without the information they need being provided from space.
If we want a proper policy of military security around the world, then we also need a proper space policy, with an emphasis on civilian and peaceful use, and for that the Constitution provides additional possibilities.
For that reason, the Industry Committee, too, fully and wholeheartedly supports the European Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, it goes without saying that I must begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on their excellent report.
I have had the honour of being draftsman of the opinion for this report for the Committee on Regional Development and I would like to say that the debate on this issue has been very positive and intense, because, amongst other things, we must remember the essential role played by regional and local administrations in European integration.
And it is also essential to remember that the European Constitution recognises local and regional autonomy as an integral part of the national identity of the Member States.
This means that, amongst other things, the European Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the current borders of the States making up the current European Union.
Today, however, on the subject of the Constitution and the regions, I would also like to condemn the fact that, in a region of Europe, a Spanish region, the Basque Country, the exclusive nationalist government of that Autonomous Community wants to implement a rupturist, secessionist and independentist plan, the Ibarretxe Plan, which is a direct attack on the Spanish Constitution and the European Constitution.
Because Ibarretxe and his government, who call themselves democrats, have made a pact with the murderers of ETA and Batasuna to bring this plan into being; they have made a pact with an organisation which is on the European Unionâs list of terrorist groups, Batasuna, and the Basque Nationalist Party has made a pact and an alliance with criminals, with murderers: in short, with the enemies of Europe.
At this point, I am convinced that this Constitution is also going to put an end to independentist, rupturist and secessionist proposals such as the Ibarretxe Plan and I am sure that the new Constitution will represent an insurmountable obstacle to this Ibarretxe Plan and to anybody who wants to dismember the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ever since the advent of the common agricultural policy nearly half a century ago, the European Parliament has been little more than a consultative body when it comes to the making of laws.
Right up to now, the Council has been able to take decisions without reference to Parliament, and over half the European Unionâs Budget is disposed of without any democratic control.
This is something that the European Parliament, and the Committee on Agriculture in particular, have never accepted.
Unofficially, we have found ways of delaying final votes as a means of forcing the Council into a sort of codecision.
We have also done sterling work on handling such crises as BSE, which means that our being conceded codecision in principle is something we have, to some extent, earned, and that is something we welcome.
It has to be clear to us, though, that a number of points remain to be rectified.
In one article in particular, the Council has reserved to itself the right to vote on quotas, prices and restrictions on quantity, without, this time, consulting Parliament at all.
We still, then, have much to do in the future.
We will still have to draw on our creative powers in order to exert our democratic influence in these matters and in getting it stated, in principle, that agricultural policy will be subject to codecision.
If it is, though, Parliament will be given more responsibility, and I hope that this House will continue, as before, to give the interests of agriculture and of rural areas the attention they deserve.
Â Â  . Mr President, Members of the Committee on Fisheries are well attuned to opinion in Europe's coastal and island communities.
That committee, in a near unanimous decision, endorsed my opinion on this Constitution.
The most important paragraph in that opinion, which will be retabled tomorrow for voting as Amendment No 13 on behalf of my Group, refers to exclusive competence.
It 'considers that within the context of the other exclusive competences of the EU, which are detailed in the Constitution, the inclusion of the conservation of marine biological resources is anomalous and unjustified'.
The common fisheries policy has not been one of the European Union's success stories.
Decision-making is too centralised, too inflexible and too remote from the communities that it affects.
To entrench the CFP effectively in primary constitutional law is a major step in the wrong direction and one that will â I believe â be an obstacle to the kind of major reforms demanded by the fishing communities that I am familiar with.
Exclusive competence takes the CFP outwith the principle of subsidiarity, ensuring that regional advisory councils can never evolve into management bodies.
I hope that colleagues will support Amendment No 13 tomorrow and support the fishing communities, as the Fisheries Committee of this Parliament has done.
These communities strongly believe that exclusive competence is not only unnecessary but is indeed anomalous and unjustified.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs, particularly on the way in which they structured their report, in which there is little room for us on the Legal Affairs Committee to make further improvements, although what we have proposed has been incorporated, and for that I am very grateful.
We, in the Legal Affairs Committee, will, though, be dealing with the issues of special interest to us in an own-initiative report, particularly the reform of legal instruments and of the lawmaking process, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and the innovations in the justice system.
I believe that another issue that will demand our attention in the future is that of how we can guarantee coherence between parts I and III of the Constitution.
This opinion by the Legal Affairs Committee does of course concentrate on the rearrangement of the Unionâs instruments of action, of which there is at present a veritable plethora: the Convention counted 35 different types of them.
I would like to pay tribute to its Vice-President, Giuliano Amato, who achieved great things as chairman of the Working Group on Simplification, something that all those present who were involved in that Working Group will be able to confirm.
They can all, in any case, take pride in their own contributions.
That much about this European Constitution is unique as has already been said; I also contend that something else that is unique is the amount of simplification that this Constitution has enabled us to achieve and the amount of bureaucracy it has enabled us to do away with.
I am thinking only of the constitutional reform processes that are going on in Austria and Germany at the moment.
I also see this as proof that the EU is not the bureaucracy it is always depicted as being; on the contrary it is very much an institution capable of reforming itself and has shown itself to be more so than not a few nation states.
Our legislative instruments will in future be simple and readily distinguishable from administrative instruments â and, when the Constitution is in place, much else about our lives will be so much easier.
I also believe that, although these changes are less spectacular than some of what is going on in the institutions, they play a very important part in making the EU more democratic and bringing it closer to the people.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I congratulate the Members who have drawn up this important report.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs found it a pleasure, a great pleasure, to approve the revised contents of the Constitutional Treaty, because several issues relating to the area of freedom, security and justice will at last be addressed in a new way in keeping with peopleâs demands: clearly, when one talks of freedom one is talking of the most important thing in life for each one of us.
There remain, however, certain aspects â which I shall highlight â that the Civil Liberties Committee examined but which left us somewhat perplexed, although without detracting from our pleasure and hence our desire to have this report adopted unanimously by this Parliament.
As I was saying, we were left perplexed by certain points: the clause granting Member States alone the power to determine the volumes of admission to their territory of third-country nationals, thus precluding the possibility of establishing a genuine European policy for the management of legal admissions to the Union; the appropriateness of incorporating the âemergency brakeâ clause for judicial cooperation in criminal matters; the appropriateness of some Member States enjoying special arrangements for derogation from the Constitution; the European Parliament's limited role in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters as regards family law; and the fact that the provisions relating to the freezing of funds, financial assets and economic gains needed to achieve the objectives of the area of freedom, security and justice are limited, contrary to what was proposed in the Convention text, to the area of the prevention and combating of terrorism, and thus exclude the prevention and combating of organised crime and of trafficking in human beings.
Nevertheless, the Civil Liberties Committee was very pleased to issue a favourable opinion and therefore, on behalf of the Civil Liberties Committee, I call on all Members to express their approval of the Constitutional Treaty tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, the Laeken Declaration rightly called for the EU institutions to develop in a way which brought them closer to the people.
As the ratification process on the Constitution gathers pace, it must be said that those ambitions clearly have not been realised.
As a member of the Convention, I made great efforts to try to persuade my colleagues that the emerging draft was wrong for Europe in principle and wrong for Europe's citizens.
I argued throughout that Europe did not need a constitution but a simplifying treaty.
That would have been enough to modernise the institutions and the workings of the Union.
I even submitted a draft of a possible alternative.
Prime Minister Blair agreed with me then; now he embraces the Constitution as it has been drawn up.
There is nothing anti-European in opposing the Constitution.
However, British Conservatives and other colleagues in the PPE-DE Group think that it centralises more powers, makes the institutions more remote and reduces the powers of nation-states.
Europe has missed an historic opportunity to modernise its workings to meet the demands of an enlarged and more diverse Union.
A simplifying treaty could have tackled the real issues: relative economic decline, fraud and waste, and greater involvement of national parliaments in the decision-making processes.
At a time when the generosity of people across Europe and the world towards the victims of the tsunami disaster is evident to all, it is inexplicable why this Parliament is committing a considerable sum of money to a programme of events and receptions in support of the European Constitution.
Those funds would have been better directed to assisting in the disaster relief.
The Constitution is of such far-reaching significance that its rejection in one or more of the Member States in the forthcoming referenda would render it void.
However, rather than being totally negative, we should regard that outcome â should it occur â as a fresh opportunity for us all to establish a modern Union that respects and celebrates its diversity and which is accountable by the people and from the people, rather than one which demands too much conformity.
Â Â  We live in a very peculiar time in the history of the united Europe.
Even though it is very difficult to divide the recent past into sections, we witnessed, organised and became part of such events that clearly allow us to draw the conclusion and declare that we have entered into a new era.
Today, the united Europe consists of 25 Member States, and we know that expansion is still in progress.
The united Europeâs new face shows more and more defined characteristics and in order to maintain and preserve these traits, we now have a Constitution, which is the topic of todayâs presentation.
The Constitution proves that the united Europe will be able to meet the legal requirements of the expansion as well.
This Constitution allows for more opportunities to make Europe become the Europe of its citizens.
The role of Parliament, whose Members are appointed by direct election, has grown, and we believe that the decisions made by the European Parliament and the national parliaments should and will be built upon each other.
Thus, the range of norms that pertains to the whole of the Community may extend in the long run, especially in the area of social issues.
Hungary had already ratified the Constitution at the end of last year.
However, this document that is on the agenda today is very important to us as well.
There have been concerns that information has been suspiciously withheld.
I firmly believe that we do not withhold information and we do not have any secrets, we have nothing to hide.
It seems as if we have to force information on the European political systems and citizens of Europe.
It requires certain knowledge to be a European citizen and to be democratic.
In the so-called Lisbon process, we need to be familiar with the norms of the Constitution, its social norms and also know that norms require more and more guarantees in order to build a social Europe, strengthen solidarity and secure social tolerance.
The Constitution is our basic law, but as many have said before, it is not a final document set in stone.
Let me mention two areas that reflect our future challenges.
Firstly, the challenge of a multicultural Europe.
What I mean by this is not the question of Islam, but the challenge that our Europe is religious and secular.
Secondly, the question of minority issues.
During the ratification debate, the Hungarian parliament urged that minority rights should be strengthened in community legislation.
I believe that our common European citizenship is the key to overcoming discrimination and the insecurity of national identity.
Let us take advantage of the opportunities provided by European citizenship!
Â Â  Mr President, this part-session of the European Parliament is of historic significance.
A motion for a resolution has been tabled on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, and this House, Europeâs largest democratic institution, will send an important message to the nations and citizens of Europe by adopting it.
The resolution approves the Constitutional Treaty and calls for its ratification.
Adoption of the resolution will be an opportunity for all those who believe that Europe needs a Constitution not only to gain information on the Treaty, but also to convince Europeâs citizens that it should be adopted.
In addition, I believe it will also act as an appeal to the European Commission to become involved in convincing European citizens of the Treatyâs merits.
The Constitutional Treaty has been the target of much criticism in my country, and it did not live up to all the expectations held of it.
I have no doubt that, as it stands, the Treaty makes it possible to strengthen the European Union.
Firstly, both the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrined therein state unambiguously that respect for the dignity of the human being is the basis of our common values, thus confirming the significance of our Judaeo-Christian heritage.
Secondly, the Treaty strengthens the role of the Community institutions, notably Parliament, the European Commission and the Court of Justice.
Thirdly, the Treaty extends citizensâ rights and creates a European public space.
Fourthly, the Treaty strengthens the EU by creating the post of EU Foreign Minister, and it enables full continuity to be achieved by means of longer presidencies, without the EU being turned into a superstate.
Fifthly, it strengthens the EU as a community of states, nations and citizens, based on common values and solidarity.
This is the kind of EU we need.
Two new Member States, Lithuania and Hungary, have been the first to ratify the Constitutional Treaty.
I am sure that my country, Poland, in which the majority of citizens are in favour of adopting the Constitutional Treaty, will also demonstrate its unequivocal support for the Treaty during the referendum.
I believe this should be regarded as something significant and, in its own way, symbolic.
Twenty-five years ago, the Polish Solidarity movement removed the first stone from the Berlin Wall, and our German colleagues ought not to forget this.
Fifteen years ago, the Round Table talks in Poland showed that it is possible to make the transition from a totalitarian system into freedom without any disruption to international peace.
This was the beginning of the unification process in Europe, and the Treaty represents a great opportunity for this united Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the destiny of Europe is at stake.
I believe that I know what that means; my father survived the battle of Stalingrad; my mother emerged from the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau.
Are we not all, on this continent, the products of an endless succession of perpetrators and victims of ceaseless violence?
That is why I insist that Europe is a promise â a promise made 60 years ago on the brink of the abyss that was Auschwitz, and in the ruins of Europe.
The promise was that nationalism would be overcome, that democracy and the rights to freedom would be unrestricted and that Europe would be united politically.
Our actions must be measured against that.
This Constitution, which the vast majority of Greens will be endorsing, is a great step toward this promise being kept.
It is not the end; the tasks have not been completed.
It is for that reason that we will be voting in favour of it, and of the report as well.
This Constitution lays the foundations of a European democracy.
It establishes the Union as a community of fundamental rights.
Its policies are underpinned by a common code of all-embracing values and objectives; for the first time, it declares social rights to be human rights as traditionally understood.
It simplifies the Treaties, makes external actions subject to international law, makes the EU more effective and transparent, more democratically legitimate, and creates the possibility of its citizens sharing in its decision-making.
Indeed, it does create something that is a Europe of citizens rather than the Europe of state chanceries that once existed.
That is why we will be voting in favour of it, and that is why I am glad to see Mr Wurtz here to hear me say that I find his criticisms incomprehensible.
His amendment makes no reference to democracy, even though this Constitution is indispensable if Europe is to be democratic.
Why does he not mention that?
He claims that social progress is absent, yet this Constitution, for the first time in the 200 yearsâ history of human rights, acknowledges and enshrines social rights as human rights in the traditional sense of the word!
Despite certain contradictions, we have, for the first time, incorporated full employment and the social market economy in the list of this Constitutionâs objectives and values.
It is not true to say that we have agreed to make Europe a military power.
The whole process is highly questionable.
The issue of our relationship with NATO is as yet unresolved, and, although none can surely say in what way Europe will emancipate itself, we have made our actions subject to international law and to the UN Charter, while also, and for the first time, making civil conflict prevention a task imposed by the Constitution.
You cannot make things so easy for yourself.
I am worried about the ratification process, but that is not what we have to get through.
When the president of the Lithuanian parliament was here, when our Hungarian colleagues spoke, these ratifications took place without any information campaign on the part of the governments and without any public debate.
Is that how we want to win the Constitution?
We will not do it that way!
We have at least nine referendums ahead of us, and please can the rapporteurs, whom I want to congratulate and thank, allow us to say that this report is completely uncritical.
That puts a question mark against the credibility of this House.
We are not the Intergovernmental Conferenceâs court poets.
We are not here to sing the praises of a Constitution that is not without its defects.
We have not created a European social order.
European democracy is incomplete.
The shaping of a European peace framework still calls for great deeds to be done, and so I would have liked to see us not only vote by a large majority to adopt this Constitution, but also open up prospects for the continuation of the constitution-making process.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will make our contribution by setting in motion the first citizensâ initiative, which will demand a first amendment to the Constitution, completing democracy, peace and the social order in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, in defiance of the resolution passed by the majority of my party, the PDS, and of the majority in my group, I support this Constitution.
To their ânoâ I say ânoâ.
As a socialist and a convinced European, I cannot square rejection of the first European Constitution with my conscience.
It was through a democratic process that it came into being, and that is itself a first in the history of the European Union; I myself played a part in that as a member of the Convention.
Let me set out the reasons that have led me to this conclusion.
For centuries, the peoples of Europe have suffered from imperialistic wars and bitter animosities.
To these we are, as we must, putting an end.
On that the Constitution sets its seal.
Defining the Union as a community of values, the Constitution enshrines a canon of values ranging from the respect for human dignity, which is the highest good, to justice and solidarity.
All these values I count as my own, and I want to do everything I can to see them, in their entirety, actually made real in society.
The Constitution reinforces the rights of citizens; it makes the EU distinctly more democratic, above all, indeed, presenting new opportunities to create a social Europe.
The Constitution substantially advances European integration, making the European Union as a whole better prepared to face the future.
The Constitution is significantly better than the Treaty of Nice, by which the Union is at present held together in law.
My decision also has to do with the fact that the Left, during the course of the Convention, largely refrained from contributing any practical proposals of its own to the process, and with its failure to come up with any real alternatives to what it now rejects.
I find that unacceptable.
Whilst I would like to see a peaceful, democratic and social European Union and to see Europe united, this goal will elude us unless we are prepared to make concessions to one another.
I am convinced that Europe will never come into being if the political families declare their own standards to be points beyond which they will not go.
My saying âyesâ to the Constitution does not, of course, mean that I wish to gloss over or ignore its defects, and I want to continue to contend for changes in the EU.
I will, of course, take up the cudgels against neoliberal policies, and I will also fight against all that tends to turn the European Union into a military power.
My particular concern is that we must prevent the European Union from degenerating into an image of the power projected from America, and from its being weakened in economic and social terms by rearmament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a blank cheque is a cheque on which the recipient writes the amount concerned.
A cheque of this kind can be issued in an emergency, if the signatory knows the recipient very well.
Why, however, recommend to the electorate that it endorse an agreement that is to be given substance by leaders we cannot possibly know at present?
We do not know whether the most important and most sensitive issues are to be decided unanimously or by qualified majority voting.
The future unelected prime ministers will themselves be able to determine how they will make decisions, instead of giving the electorate the last word.
Nor do we know the content of important articles in which decisions are left to the Court of Justice.
In one place, a pledge is given on matters relating to countriesâ social systems; elsewhere, our welfare systems can be voted away on the basis of a majority decision or a judgment.
In one place, the status of the national church is maintained; elsewhere, the precedence taken by the Danish Constitution in matters relating to the national church is removed.
In one place, national identity is guaranteed; elsewhere, the Constitution has to give way if it is in conflict with a decision by officials in Brussels.
In Article III-375, the Danish Supreme Court loses the right to decide the limits placed upon the EU authorities.
In many places, there is freedom of choice as to whether a binding decision or voluntary coordination is to be used.
Thus, we do not know what we are supposed to endorse.
It is therefore wisest not to endorse anything until the amount is stated on the cheque, together with the identity of the recipient, and until we are also given the right to cancel the cheque.
In that way, we shall at least know what we are voting on and how we can overturn a decision.
Constitutions are for states.
Between states, agreements are made, that is to say treaties.
I want to see a Europe of democracies that solves practical problems by focusing upon cross-border issues, or matters that we cannot solve ourselves.
In that way, we should not be losing anything in terms of democracy, but should have everything to gain in terms of cooperation.
We should then have a democratic bonus instead of a growing democratic deficit that might end up with the collapse of democracy.
As the well-known poet Ebbe KlÃžverdal Reich pointed out, democracy without a is simply the exercise of power.
Government that provides no opportunity for adjusting a countryâs course at the date of the next election is not democracy, but oligarchy.
Europe deserves better, and that is the title of the alternative statement that I recommend be adopted instead of MrÂ Corbettâs and MrÂ MÃ©ndezÂ DeÂ Vigoâs report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Convention, in which this Parliament took part, drew up a text considered at the time to be the best possible compromise.
Then the Council, in turn, reached the most workable compromise, and the new Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome.
Depending on individual national constitutions, it is now a matter for the people, through referendums, or for the national parliaments to give final approval to the new path.
It is a path which, like it or not, regards Europe not as a federal superstate that has gradually eroded away identities, traditions and cultures, but as a Union of sovereign states that have freely chosen to breathe life into a common policy.
It comes at a time in human history when natural disasters and man-made tragedies require that not just the economic interests of our countries be represented on the world stage, but also the values of democracy, freedom and respect for human dignity â values that our continent has secured and set out at last after centuries of war and conflict.
If today, in this Chamber, we divide over something that no longer depends on our decision, but on ratification by the individual Member States and individual peoples of the Union, it will mean disavowing our Parliamentâs ability to plan the future and relegating it to the role of a talking shop in which plenty of fine speeches are made but little is decided.
That stands in stark contrast to the increase in our prerogatives which, after a great struggle, we have finally achieved precisely through the drafting of the new Treaty.
It would seem appropriate to recall that, while the values and principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights now included in the second part of the Treaty form the ethical basis for the Union, several parts of the Constitutional Charter are still incomplete and will need updating in the light of current circumstances.
Furthermore, we must ensure that the Constitution is not exploited for party-political purposes against governments that have been duly elected by their own citizens.
The European Union must not run the risk of becoming a place where political groups join in battle to attack freely made national decisions on ideological grounds.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we hear it said that the EU needs this Constitution if it wants to deepen integration, but, as we have just heard from one of its most forthright advocates, not everything in the draft we are to vote on is ideal.
It is, apparently, better than what we had before, so this is progress in any case.
That actually sounds pretty feeble.
We are also told, though, that this Constitution will in no way facilitate the development of a European superstate; on the contrary, it apparently strengthens the Member States in their identities.
If that is so, then the citizens of Europeâs states should be given a real chance to have the last word in the debate on its ratification, if at all possible by means of referendums.
For that, though, they need real information rather than just the one-sided propaganda celebrating the Constitution.
The Constitutionâs weaknesses, too, need to be discussed without accusations of anti-Europeanism being thrown around: for example, the fact that smaller Member States will have fewer ways to defend their interests; the fact that the European Parliament will continue to be a toothless tiger, particularly in matters affecting foreign and security policy; and also the fact that Europeâs workers are still exposed to the risk of wage and social dumping.
Only a frank and open debate on this Constitutionâs flaws and dangers will make it possible for the peoples of Europe and the citizens of the EU to see it as something more than a Basic Law handed down from on high.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what is at issue in todayâs debate on the European Constitutional Treaty?
I think that if we consider it as it stands, there are a number of things that I personally, my party, and our group â that of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â would like to have changed: we would have liked a reference to our Judaeo-Christian heritage, a clear demarcation of powers and responsibilities, a description of the European Unionâs geographical borders, public participation in the ratification process, since a constitution is actually an expression of popular sovereignty and something that ought to have been expressed somewhere in it.
On the other hand, though, this treaty makes a multitude of improvements over against the treaties that we have at present, and that is the comparison in which the Constitutional Treaty must come out best.
It brings us more democracy, strengthens the European Parliament, and involves the national parliaments in the lawmaking process.
Instead of weighted votes, there will be dual majority in the Council.
Instead of more general clauses, powers will be specifically conferred.
The Commission is to be limited in size, which will help to make it more democratic, and the Constitutional Treaty makes for greater transparency, which of course makes it necessary to involve the national parliaments.
Before we come to decide on something at first reading, the national parliaments will be given the chance to say something about it.
Not only in that it makes for transparency do I regard that as something important.
The Council will have to hold its meetings in public.
We are at last taking leave of the clandestine diplomacy that has characterised Europe for over fifty years.
To sum up, what that means to me is that the European Union will be concentrating on the tasks it can perform, rather than becoming a superstate.
Even if people still need to be more informed and more involved, this is still, on the whole, a respectable treaty.
I can speak for my own party, the CSU, but also for our colleagues in the CDU, when I say that we will vote in favour of this Constitutional Treaty without any reservations.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the European Constitutional Treaty has been written in a very positive spirit.
We seem to be commending a flawless piece of work, as if we were unaware of its weaknesses.
We should not, however, ignore the voices warning of the shortcomings of the present draft Constitution.
We may decide that, despite every effort, this Constitution is neither transparent nor comprehensible.
I am also struck by the fact that the motion for a resolution does not allow for much democratic discussion, thus branding those who have their reservations about the Treaty as anti-European.
The European Constitution is a practical instrument that will affect European integration for decades to come.
Europe can set out on the road either towards a bureaucratic federalist superstate, or towards the political opposite, a liberal and competitive Europe.
Let us make it quite clear that adopting or failing to adopt the European Constitution is a predominantly political matter, and not a prerequisite for integration.
It is therefore entirely legitimate to vote both for the Constitution and against it.
Ratification is often portrayed as an essential step which should not be open to too much discussion.
Advocates of the European Constitution sometimes even threaten that the Union will not allow itself to be held back by just a few countries not ratifying the Constitution, and that these countries will be marginalised and will have to content themselves with some lesser form of affiliation.
I consider this approach to be very unfair.
I have already repeatedly referred to the risk that democratic principles will be violated; I grew up in a political system where a cheerful and happy âyesâ vote was the only possible choice at every election.
I should now like to issue a warning against the use of these same principles.
I am not trying to target the Constitutional Treaty directly.
I simply wish to emphasise the need for open and democratic discussion, and to stress that a failure to adopt the Constitution is not a disaster, nor does it mean an end to the process of integration in Europe.
On the contrary, it might lead to more profound consideration as to where European integration is heading and where the voters would really like to see it.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my support, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Spanish Socialists, for the Corbett-MÃ©ndez de Vigo report, which marks the end of an historic process.
There have been two debates on the creation of constitutions in the European Union.
The first was the debate of the Congress of the European Movement in 1948, in which Churchill, Reynaud, Ramadier, van Zeeland, Madariaga and Adenauer had the opportunity to begin debating a Constitution for Europe.
The second is the one we are concluding today, which has changed the history of a continent on which more than a hundred million people died violent deaths between 1914 and 1945 and on which, today, peace is the norm, thanks to a process to which we are giving real form through this Constitution, which expresses our fundamental shared values, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with common citizenship and a Union based on citizens and on States: a secular Union and a Union with the ambitious objectives which have already been mentioned here.

Mr President, please allow me to refer to my country, which will be the first to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution, with a public and open debate which we believe is important for everybody.
It is true to say that the Zapatero Government, after winning the elections of 14 March, unblocked the process of approving the Constitution, but I would like to say â and I cannot see any Member of the Spanish Peoplesâ Party, and I would therefore ask the Vice-President of their Group, Mrs GrossetÃªte, to communicate this on my behalf â that the Convention began with the Spanish Presidency of the Council of Mr Aznar, and it was he who called for the referendum.
I therefore believe and hope that there will also be decisive support from the Spanish Peoplesâ Party â the support of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appears to be guaranteed â for the whole of this process.
I believe that in that way we will be able to ensure that we have a referendum which genuinely sets a positive precedent for the referendums in the other States which have decided to hold them and that there be a public and open debate.
I will end by saying that this concludes a process in which Europe has been constructed with passion and with good sense, and this has led it to change history.
Â Â  Mr President, any position on the European Constitution must be based on a balance between what this Constitution says and what it does not say â something that is not perhaps properly underlined in the report we are voting on at this part-session.
This leads me to say 'yes' to this Constitution because of what it represents and because it means a new step forward on the way to a stronger and more efficient, more transparent, more democratic Europe.
With this Constitution, Europe will have a stronger voice in the world.
Citizens will get better protection of their fundamental rights. Their freedom and security will be better defended.
Moreover, our values, including those which are behind our social and economic model, will be strongly proclaimed and protected to allow Europe's growth and, simultaneously, to protect Europe's social cohesion.
But that does not prevent me from acknowledging that the text reflects the unfortunate bias of some political majorities that existed in Europe at the time when it was drafted.
I particularly regret that it reflects a virtual Europe, a Europe that is not the real Europe, a Europe that does not exist in political terms, where everything that lies between individual citizens and states is just ignored.
Peoples in Europe, regions, and their political role in the construction of a diverse and plural Europe have simply been neglected, have been passed over in silence in this text.
But this is just not the reality of the Europe we are all building here together.
What is worse, some languages, such as my own â Catalan â which are stronger than acknowledged officially at European Union level, are blindly ignored in this Constitution.
Some of these problems can be solved outside the Constitution, and some of us will keep fighting for that.
I will therefore join those who support this positive step forward in the building of Europe and I will strongly recommend a 'yes' in the Spanish referendum, although I will fully comprehend and respect any other position taking a different view of this balance.
I will not take this text as something engraved in stone, but as an improvement that allows us to keep working for a Europe where all citizens and peoples can feel comfortable, and are acknowledged as they really are and want to be.
Â Â  Mr President, we European Greens are in favour of a âyesâ vote in the coming referendum on the European Constitution in Spain.
We will have the great responsibility of holding the very first referendum on the continent, and a result expressing the Spanish citizensâ firm support for the Constitution will send a clear and strong message to the other European countries and will provide the impetus to carry on building the Europe we want to see after ratification.
Our âyesâ is a demanding âyesâ.
On the other hand, we are concerned and confused by the position of the Spanish Peoplesâ Party.
I would ask the question: what has happened to those people who said they wanted to die for Nice, such as Mr Aznar?
I see that they are still alive and kicking and that they are currently creating confusion, double language and alarm in relation to the coming referendum in Spain, putting narrow-minded party-political interests above European integration.
This double language, together with an attitude of saying or doing little in relation to the Constitution, and confusing the people with other issues which have little to do with the Constitution, does very little to promote European integration.
Some people are calling for a âyesâ without any real conviction and sending confused and contradictory messages to their own voters, seeking only to erode the current government of Spain.
The demanding âyesâ that we Greens advocate means choosing to take advantage of the new European political area constructively in favour of the social and ecological Europe we want.
The Constitution is not the end of the road, it is not the final destination, and is not even an inn.
We believe, like Antonio Machado, that the path is made by walking; we believe that this Constitution is a step forward and we will continue along this road in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must again point out the wisdom contained in the Norwegian Mountaineersâ Handbook.
In the event of a discrepancy between the map and the terrain, follow the terrain.
Otherwise, we end up in tragedy or farce, something we are well on the way towards.
This is due to the fact that, in crucial areas, the Constitution goes against the democratic intentions that are invoked and correspondingly deprives genuine democracy of vital sustenance.
The Constitution involves a huge concentration and centralisation of the EU elitesâ political power, especially over the judiciary and police.
The EU Constitution constitutes a genuine abolition of living democracy in civil society, especially since the expansion of the EUâs power makes real democratic control impossible.
The only hope in this process lies in the forthcoming referendums.
The EU elites are trying to abolish this ultimate democratic element too.
Democracy is now so deeply compromised that it is openly practised as the power of the elite to govern the people.
The fight against the EU Constitution is a fight for democracy, and one that we intend to win outside this House.
Â Â  Mr President, it is pretty clear that what we are involved in here is a one-sided exercise in selling this Constitution to the peoples of Europe.
Listening to some of the talk, you would think the Second Coming of the Lord was being debated.
Starting this week, you will be spending large amounts of taxpayers' money telling people what they should think and how they should vote.
I suggest that first you ought to put your House in order.
Some weeks ago I revealed to this Parliament Commissioner Barrot's past and the affair was whitewashed.
Now it has emerged that during his hearing, Siim Kallas, who is in charge of the anti-fraud drive, gave deliberately misleading information and inaccurate dates, and used a misinterpretation as a means of shying away from a vital question.
Yesterday afternoon, President Borrell denied me the chance to make a one-minute speech to mention this to Parliament.
You will not win your constitutional battle by burying the truth and by failing to have a proper debate.
The whole process will fall yet further into disrepute, although, given the fact that I, along with many colleagues here, will be campaigning for a 'no' vote, perhaps I should be grateful for the manner in which you conduct yourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there have been times in the course of this debate when one might have been forgiven for thinking that noÂ criticism of the Constitution had ever been voiced.
I believe that this will change when the Members of this House return to their countries and encounter diverse and varied criticism of the Constitution from a number of very different quarters.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, in common with many of the other political groups in this House, is divided on the issue of the Constitution.
The members of Law and Justice who constitute the Polish element in this group are opposed to it, not because it would be a bad thing for Poland, but because it would be a bad thing for Europe.
To begin with, the Treaty alters the system according to which votes are counted, to the disadvantage of countries with a particular interest in policies relating to Eastern Europe, cohesion and agriculture.
This applies to Poland in all three instances, of course, yet it is not the implications for Poland that are the most significant problem, but the weakening of whole sectors of European policy.
The Treaty strengthens the EUâs powers over economic, employment and social policy within the Union.
It does not yet go so far as to grant exclusive competences, of course, and no decisive step has yet been taken.
Nevertheless, it substantially strengthens the EUâs powers.
Yet it is not harmonisation of economic policy that Europe needs, but systems competition in this field.
Harmonisation will consign Europe to the margins of global competition.
The Treaty is a significant step towards use of the Community method in the field of foreign policy.
Again, no final decisions have yet been made, but a step has been taken in that direction.
It is difficult to say where a line can be drawn between the Community method and the inter-state method in foreign policy, and MrÂ Rehn, the new Commissioner, admitted as much during his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Finally, the Treaty is based on false premises from its very first lines.
An example of such falsehood and extreme prejudice is the removal from the preamble of references to Christianity and God, whose presence is still felt in the majority of the European Unionâs Member States.
These are all reasons why today we must say ânoâ to the Treaty and ânoâ to this motion for a resolution in order to say âyesâ to Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, not only is the draft Constitution far from being ideal, it is also far from being the compromise it could have been.
Those in favour of a Constitution and a better European Constitution would do best to reject this draft, as I am in no doubt that a subsequent one would be an improvement.
The members of Self-Defence will vote in favour of AmendmentÂ NoÂ 102, an extremely important amendment by MrÂ Bonde to which I have put my own name.
The democratic deficit would be increased if national parliamentary competences were to be handed over not to the democratically elected European Parliament, but to the unelected European Commission, and this would be most undesirable.
It would also be undesirable to abandon the principle of âone country, one Commissionerâ.
Yet it would be a good idea to hand back to the nation states all matters which are not in actual fact of supra-national importance, and more freedom and less centralism is a good principle to follow.
In conclusion, I should like to say that the members of Self-Defence are open to the idea of an EU Constitution.
We do not reject it as such, but we cannot vote in favour of the motion for a resolution as it stands.
We have doubts, and these doubts are shared by millions of inhabitants of the EUâs Member States.
Yet we are open to dialogue, as this is what the millions of inhabitants of our countries want.
We will therefore abstain from voting in the final vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, on their remarkable report.
I should also, however, like to thank ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, without whom, I am sure, we would not be here today debating this historic stage in Europeâs development.
We are in a position to gauge how far we have come.
The greatest danger for Europe would be to fall back into intergovernmental methods.
Indeed, we must deplore the fact that European governments have not followed all the proposals made by the Convention, the consequence of which is that we shall gradually have to adapt the Constitution as we go along.
In fact, what we need is more Europe in a globalised world confronted with terrorism, migratory flows, climate change and major economic disruption.
We need more Europe, more Union â a Union based on our universal values â and more democracy.
The Constitution will bring all of this, strengthening Parliamentâs role and involving national parliaments at the same time.
Those rejecting this Constitution speak of Brussels bureaucracy, of a loss of national sovereignty and of a European superstate.
For want of arguments, they trot out the same backward-looking slogans, which are today devoid of meaning because they bear no relation to reality.
This is typical of their inability to look to the future.
How else can we explain that all 25 of our governments agreed to adopt the Constitution?
They certainly did not intend to commit .
Because we must work collectively together in the service of the European citizen and for future generations, we say âyesâ to the Constitution for Europe.
Europeans must choose between insularity and paralysis, on the one hand, and openness and modernity, on the other.
The choice is simple â if we want a free and responsible Europe, we must ratify the Constitution for Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a French socialist and as a European socialist, I shall be voting tomorrow, with emotion and pride, in favour of the report by the two Members of this House.
I shall therefore turn my speech into a tribute â a tribute to Altiero Spinelli, who drew up the first European Constitution in this democratically-elected House.
I never forget that he was a veteran of the young communists and I turn to my fellow socialists and say to them ânever forget where you have come fromâ.
He was an old anti-fascist militant, an old federalist, and I pay tribute to those Members of Parliament who voted for this draft during the sitting of 14Â FebruaryÂ 1984.
Mr Poettering voted in favour, Mr HÃ€nsch voted in favour, Mr Wurtz voted against and Mr VergÃšs voted against.
They will do so again, loyal as they are.
If you re-read the text on which we shall vote tomorrow, you will notice that it takes up a number of elements of that old text.
Let me give you some examples.
Article 3 of the Spinelli report enshrines the principle of European citizenship; ArticleÂ 4, respect for fundamental rights; Article 6, legal personality; Article 9, the Unionâs objective of full employment; Article 34 speaks of European laws; Article 44 mentions sanctions; Article 82 of Part 4, which is Part 3 today, speaks of ratification, and I could go on.
What I am trying to say is that tomorrowâs vote forms part of the context of this long history, and that this Constitution has not simply fallen out of the sky; it is part of a major historical movement.
The seam was first mined over 50 years ago and yielded the raw material of reconciliation.
The single currency, the euro, which is more than ten years old, was Germanyâs currency of reconciliation.
Let us therefore view this Constitution as a hand proffered to the peoples who have joined us again, now that the dark night of totalitarianism is over.
Â Â  â Mr President, current events demonstrate that we need Europe now more than ever.
We need Europe to protect us, and to initiate and drive forward an original social model.
We need Europe to generate growth, to coordinate our economic policies and to combat unemployment.
We need Europe to implement a genuine research and development policy, like the one pursued by the United States.
We need Europe to protect and preserve our environment and, finally, we need a Europe that carries weight in the world, with military and civil European defence, and a genuine foreign policy.
The worldâs balance depends on Europeâs continued existence.
In order to address this enormous expectation we need more effective, more transparent and more democratic institutions.
We need institutions that move away from a way of working that is all too often intergovernmental, whereby decisions are always taken without the citizens ever being involved.
We need institutions that favour Community decision-making, because this is the only truly democratic method of decision-making.
We also need strong institutions, enabling us to move towards a more integrated Europe, despite the timidity of the Heads of State or Government.
This is why we support both this excellent and well-written report and the draft Constitution.
Even if it does not go as far as we would like, this Constitution is a symbolic and significant step towards a more unified, stronger and more democratic Europe. We owe that to our citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, for the Catalan Republican Left â the â and for the other parties in our European coalition â for example from the Basque country, Aragon and Andalusia â this is not a good Constitutional Treaty.
It does not recognise our wish for internal enlargement.
Stateless nations will not have any recognition in this Treaty.
We would have accepted the Treaty if only it had included a small step forward â official-language status for the Catalan language.
Today, in Parliament, about 2% of Members may not speak their mother tongue.
Of this 2%, the vast majority of us are Catalan speakers.
I am the fourth Catalan-speaking Member â after President Borrell, Mr Guardans CambÃ³ and Mr Hammerstein Mintz â to speak here this morning in a language other than our own â
We reject this constitutional Treaty because we want to be directly involved in Europe and want a stronger, more united and cohesive Europe, built on its own diversity; just the opposite of a nation-state built on the basis of the French model and against plurilingualism, diversity and plurinationality.
Working nation-states do not make a good basis for the construction of Europe.
Europe should be built on the basis of national diversity comprising stateless nations, nation-states and constitutional regions, for the purpose of establishing a new European citizenship.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the primary duty of a parliament is to represent the people.
Our duty in relation to the Constitutional Treaty should be, first of all, to measure the gap between the peoples of Europe and this Treaty: without the people there can be no Constitution.
To the democratic deficit in the drafting of the Treaty we can now add the lack of democracy in its adoption: if we cannot have a single referendum for all of Europeâs citizens, we could at least have held a referendum on the same day in all the countries of the Union.
Instead, however, everything is done haphazardly and people are just as divorced from the Treaty today as they were yesterday.
Europe is in danger of going the way of the titles of a famous trilogy by the great European intellectual Italo Calvino: from to to .
There are no people and there is no constitutional spirit in the Treaty; it lacks any idea of its place in the world and in time.
That is all very serious, at a worrying time when war and terrorism have come to predominate in politics, when natural disasters like the one in South-East Asia speak of the social injustice and the intolerable poverty of this world.
In a globalised world, Europe is in danger of declining: there is a feeling of malaise in Europe linked to its internal crisis of social cohesion, while instability has become the key social factor of our times.
This Treaty represents the abdication of politics in the face of all that: a silent Constitution.
In it, peace is a vague aspiration, not a repudiation of war.
In it, the rights of people, women and men, workers and migrants, are a variable dependent on a balanced budget and monetary stability.
Democracy is an optional extra.
The Constitutional Treaty does not provide for rights, apart from those of the market; it does not propose reforms; it has no future; but instead it keeps Europe stuck in its present crisis.
It is not just inadequate: it is the wrong direction altogether.
That is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is declaring itself against this Treaty and will be campaigning against it in every country.
We need to free ourselves of this encumbrance in order to build the Europe of the future.
Â Â  Mr President, today, the European Parliament is debating a treaty that is, as regards its nature and content, a constitution, or at least that is what the rapporteurs tell us we are doing.
In the report, they take as their starting point the apparent opposition between the Council and Member States on the one hand and Parliament and the citizens on the other.
In doing so, they overlook the fact that the European institutions owe their existence to the voluntary transfer of powers by the Member States.
Moreover, citizens continue to identify primarily with their own state.
A European identity that has been imposed from above, with its own symbolism, will not change this in any way.
The treaty endows the European Union with the characteristics of a state.
One unfortunate illustration of this is the Foreign Affairs Minister, a joint figurehead who has to cover up the lack of joint policy, and it is equally unfortunate that this person himself becomes an institution.
The rapporteurs have to recognise that the dual responsibility on the part of the Council and Commission creates confusion and sows the seeds of potential conflicts of loyalty.
I cannot describe this treaty as anything other than an impetuous leap in the dark.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a Lithuanian I ought to be proud that my country's parliament was the first to ratify the European Constitution.
However, the majority of Lithuania's citizens have not seen, read or discussed it.
It was not even debated by Lithuania's Parliament.
On the other hand I am sure that for the most part this Constitution is in keeping with the interests of my nation and state.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to Part 1 Article 8 of the Constitution, which lays down that the word euro â the name of the common currency of the European Union â must be used in the same way in all European Union languages.
It goes against the fundamental principle of the Constitution and that of the creation of the European Union itself, that is, respect for national languages and cultures.
According to this article, which is based on Council Regulation No 974/98 of 1998, there would be an unprecedented intervention in the grammatical systems shaped over thousands of years and in semantic relations expressed not in word order, not in words with one form, but in the declension of words, of the languages of the seven new countries of the European Union, among them the Lithuanian language.
The Regulation mentioned, announced six years ago, before the new countries were admitted to the European Union, does not allow the word euro to be declined.
Such a ban contradicts Article 314 of the European Community Treaty and Article 53 of the Treaty on European Union on the true equality of the European Union's official languages, as well as European Community Treaty Article 5 on subsidisation and Article 151 on the limits of cultural policies.
I asked the Commission and the Council why these circumstances have not been taken into consideration and four months later Mr Almunia, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, replied that the non-declinable word euro is used in the Constitution because this was laid down in the Council Regulation.
Back to square one, and disrespect for national languages remained.
If such a ban remains in the Constitution, then in the Lithuanian version and all legislation we will have an abundance of not only ungrammatical but absurd statements.
I hope that Parliament will take these arguments into account.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  â Mr President, a Constitution is the founding act of a State, and it was an entirely conscious decision to choose that term, just as it was to give the EU a flag, an anthem, a motto and even a national celebration.
Despite your pathetic denials, the European Constitution is, therefore, without doubt, the founding act of a European superstate.
It represents the death of our often ancient nations and their transformation into a number of powerless provinces within this bureaucratic, omnipotent and centralised State.
I know that you blithely accuse those who do not share your blind belief in the benefits of the Europe of Brussels of lies, of mediocrity and even of stupidity. This is a handy tactic and entails never having to explain.
It also makes it possible to follow the peremptory statements of the happy few, who know â or think they know â what is good for the, in their view, uncultivated, masses.
The fear instilled in you by the fact that referendums are to be held on the Constitution is an illustration of the contempt in which you hold the citizens.
What, for that matter, are the benefits of which people speak?
I have seen with my own eyes, as a direct consequence of European policies, the destruction of our farming and of our economies, company relocations and deindustrialisation, endemic unemployment and poverty, the disintegration of our social protection systems, the opening of our borders to immigration on a massive scale, to terrorism and to international crime.
The Europe of Brussels is not, of course, solely responsible â it could not have created or exacerbated these problems without the collusion of governments, of all political hues, which have decided to sacrifice their countriesâ independence and their inhabitantsâ freedom to the Brussels Leviathan.
The European Constitution will put the finishing touches to this monstrous edifice, which was begun over 40 years ago.
That might be what you want, but we are rejecting it because Europe and the Europeans deserve better than this soulless superstate.
We are rejecting it in the name of freedom, in the name of independence, in the name of the sovereignty which belongs solely to the people and which is inalienable, and in the name of those peopleâs right to self-determination.
The Members of this House have betrayed their homelands.
Their guilt is there for all to see.
They will be cursed by history and by future generations.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we would be making a serious mistake if we considered the Union to be merely an economic entity or a vast free-trade area, or even a kind of superstate replacing the national states.
Europe is primarily a great ideal, and it was an ideal for the founding fathers Alcide De Gasperi and Konrad Adenauer, from Robert Schuman to Altiero Spinelli, from Gaetano Martino to Helmut Kohl.
Europe is our history: it is the synthesis of our cultures and our languages, our identity and our future.
It is the Europe of values, of the central importance of the individual, of freedom, solidarity and subsidiarity.
We cannot think of a Union shut in tightly within its borders; we cannot think of Europe as a machine â albeit an efficient one â run by a bureaucracy that keeps changing the rules.
On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity itself, Europe must instead solve the major problems of its citizens which other institutions are unable to address.
Does the Constitution interpret these values?
The answer is substantially âyesâ, even though we cannot hide our profound regret that there is no reference to the Unionâs Judaeo-Christian roots.
Such a reference would have represented not a religious choice, but the identification of our undeniable historical roots.
The decision to sign the Constitution in Rome was, for our country, an important acknowledgement of the work carried out during the six months of Italyâs Presidency.
To be effective, a fundamental law needs to have life breathed into it; in other words, it has to be put into practice and invested with political power.
That is why Europe, through the Constitution, really must speak with a single voice in foreign policy.
It must win a seat on the new UN Security Council and it must be an exporter of peace and not just of special interests in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East.
The world of globalisation needs this Europe, the Europe of solidarity, subsidiarity and human rights â the political Europe of the people whom this Parliament truly represents.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
There can be no doubt that Europe, the Member States, and, above all, Europeâs citizens need a European Constitution.
The present framework of the Treaties is too narrow for an enlarging Europe.
What was adequate for 15Â Member States is no longer adequate for 25Â Member States.
After all, one would not try to dress a fully-grown 25-year-old in the same suit he wore when he was 15 years old.
He would need to be bought a new one.
The same is true for Europe, and the enlarged European Union must therefore have a legal and organisational framework that corresponds to its size, intentions and ambitions.
The European Constitution creates such a framework.
The Constitution is a good document as it represents a compromise.
It makes the EU more citizen-friendly, more efficient and better.
It also makes the Union a place where human beings are valued and where democracy and security are safeguarded.
Moreover, it provides for a high level of protection of citizensâ personal rights, and grants them better access to the affairs of the entire EU and influence on the European Unionâs legislative capacities.
The EUâs citizens are well aware of this, and this is why they support the European Constitution in such large numbers, even if they are not entirely familiar with the details of its contents.
This is the case in my country, Poland.
I am proud to be able to tell you that 73% of Poles are in favour of the European Constitution, despite the reservations previously expressed by my government with regard to the draft Treaty, and despite the campaign that has been conducted against the Constitution within the country.
It has become apparent that it is a mistake to exploit the Constitution in domestic political disputes.
No political party has the right to call for the Constitution to be rejected, even if it is in opposition.
Referendums on the Constitution should relate to its contents, and not turn into anti-governmental plebiscites.
The citizens of the European Union are aware of this, and this is why they know better than politicians what is good for them.
They subscribe to the view that whoever is in favour of Europe is in favour of the European Constitution.
We should listen to them.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution, or Constitutional Treaty, is a better legal basis than any we in the European Union have previously had, and, as it is a good and acceptable compromise, our group really can vote to endorse it.
We should regard the European Constitutional Treaty as being, above all, a great chance to construct a shared European identity.
That is what we in Europe need: a sense of being âusâ, a feeling of belonging together, with us all seeing ourselves as Europeans and also Germans, Westphalians from the north of the Rhine, and, in my case, citizens of Cologne â all this made possible by this European Constitutional Treaty.
We have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty, thereby making this old continent into something of a new world, for the wonderful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defining in precise terms what holds us together.
If this feeling of being âusâ, this identity, is to come into being, it is quite vital that all Europeans should be able to decide for themselves whether they want this Constitution.
That is why we are campaigning for referendums on it in every European country, for although most of the people can now vote on the Constitutional Treaty, not all Europeans can.
If the people of Europe are to know, firstly, that this Constitution exists, and secondly, having given it some thought, that they want it, it is vital that they themselves should be asked.
We should therefore let people themselves vote and make an effort to ensure that referendums are held in every country.
It will not, unfortunately, be possible to organise it so that they are held all on the same day, but, if people themselves are asked, it will in any case enhance their sense of identity, their awareness of being âusâ.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would invite you to see this Constitutional Treaty in perspective and not as the finished article.
The European idea has never been fixed, and it will not now be fixed in the wording of this new Treaty.
This Constitution is an important, essential and indispensable staging post, but it is still only a staging post.
MrÂ GiscardÂ d'Estaing said of this document that it was unhoped-for.
I prefer to say of it that, broadly speaking, it can still be improved, given the extent to which, and despite the unquestionable advances it entails, the dross from the previous documents still clings to it.
Our fellow citizens are prepared to live with this document as an interim report on their common history but have no desire to be taken hostage by it for decades, with all movement on what was the European compromise at the beginning of the twenty-first century indefinitely postponed.
That is the whole point of Amendment No 17, which I have tabled on behalf of my group and which a great many of my fellow MEPs have co-signed.
Through this very clear and very brief amendment, our Parliament, and I quote, â[a]nnounces its intention of using the new right of initiative conferred upon it by the Constitution to propose amendments to the latterâ.
I would thank our two co-rapporteurs, MrÂ Corbett and MrÂ MÃ©ndezÂ deÂ Vigo, for having supported this amendment, as it is the medium through which our House indicates that, while remaining forever the driving force of European development, it is attentive to the social and democratic advances awaited by our fellow citizens. If the document were to be set in stone, there would be a danger of the same thing happening to the Constitution too.
Moreover, any stone out of which the Constitutional Treaty were to be carved would not, whatever MrÂ GiscardÂ d'Estaing may think, be that out of which the equestrian statue commemorating the President of the Convention would also be carved. It might, rather, be that marking the grave of the European project.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would therefore again invite you to embrace a progressive Europe, as the constitutional process is still in its early days, and its strength and interest lie specifically in its newness.
Â Â  I once wrote a book on the emergence of human rights theory and on the American Constitution, so I have some understanding of the positive aspects of this document.
What I do not understand, however, is why the European Parliament wishes freely to condemn itself to a second-class position by supporting this document.
Article III-330(2) reads as follows: âA European law of the European Parliament shall lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members.
The European Parliament shall act on its own initiative after seeking an opinion from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the Council.
The Council shall act unanimously on all rules or conditions relating to the taxation of Members or former Members.â
This preserves the supremacy of the Commission, the executive, which has more rights than we do, and it also preserves the unjust disparities between us as legitimate representatives of the European people.
Only we are truly legitimate, with all the other European bodies being derivative, and so I believe that this provision must be omitted.
Although Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has just said that we would have more democracy, I do not think that it is more democracy we want, but merely democracy, pure and simple.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you gave the Constitution, or whatever you ultimately call it, to a cartoonist in any country of Europe who respects the principles of democracy, of national sovereignty, of the values of the historic and cultural heritage, he would draw it like a mincer from which various parts of various animals, from sheep to cows, come out in the form of minced meat.
But people are not animals and it is a crime to treat them like minced meat.
Fascism did it with weapons and some people appear to envy its intentions, and 65 years later certain other weapons such as money and propaganda are being used for the same reason.
We therefore say no to the canning of the peoples of Europe, no to the law of the jungle which throttles the weak, no to the imposition of underhand approaches and people and no to efforts to turn citizens into docile robots in the hands of multinationals and banks.
We say yes to the right of opinion and rejection, yes to the Europe of sovereign nations, yes to Christianity and human rights, yes to the pride and dignity of the peoples.
'I recognise you by the fierce edge of your sword.
I recognise you by the look which measures the earth with force.â
And force used on the spirit is worse than force against the body.
There is still time for resistance.
We have time to reverse globalisation and the new order of things. '.
Â Â  MrÂ President, since the first six countries joined forces, the European Communities have developed a form of cooperation that is not perfect but that is nonetheless a form of cooperation between states of equal value whose governments have the last word concerning the statesâ cooperative participation.
What is more, the adherents of this Constitution have not today concealed the fact that Europe is to be governed not by the countriesâ governments but by a strong Commission whose parliamentary legality lies in the directly elected European Parliament.
My party and I dispute the sense and validity of this construction.
This Constitution removes countriesâ independence in favour of a non-transparent regime pursuing objectives that, in all too many cases, do not have grass-roots support.
My countryâs oldest constitutional document, the Jutish Law of 1241, states, for example, and I quote: âThe law shall be honest and just, tolerable in terms of the countryâs customs, appropriate, useful and clear, so that everyone might know and understand what the law saysâ.
It may be said of the Constitution that we are debating in this House today that it is not honest about the intentions behind it.
If it is just, it is only so in the eyes of those who wish to amass power throughout the whole of Europe.
It is not tolerable for the majority of Europeans, for it only corresponds to the customs of a few countries.
It is of no use in terms of free cooperation, and it is not clear, for no one can know and understand what the Constitution says.
This draft Constitution must be rejected. Otherwise, the EU will end up as a regime of the big powers, which will damage the EU as a whole.
I recommend the minorityâs amendment.
Europe deserves better.
Â Â  Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to use my time to explain the actual supplementary proposal, to digress a little from the spirit of the previous discussion.
The proposal I refer to, Proposal No 10, corrects one of the discrepancies introduced by the Constitution, those discrepancies about which so much has been said today.
In fact, the text of the agricultural policy is out of date in the Constitution, fifty years out of date.
The legitimate aim of agricultural policy half a century ago was to produce sufficient food.
Today the situation is reversed, Europe has the problem of disposing of its surpluses.
The European Parliamentâs AGRI committee has even pointed, in its views on the Constitution, to the direct conflict between the original aims of the common agricultural policy and the Constitution.
On the other hand, increased competitiveness is a priority aim of all the reforms which have been and are being made in the common agricultural policy â but this is not included in the Constitution.
The draft amendment rights this wrong.
It would also be desirable for the European Parliament to adopt this draft amendment because, in the entire resolution of the European Parliament, this is actually the only reference to the most important common policy â the agricultural policy.
Â Â  The subject of our debate, the Constitution, may be the first joint creation of the reunited Europe.
The Member States may also regard it as their own, as we, including myself, participated in the work of the Convention drafting the Constitution for a year and a half.
It is, perhaps, not by accident that two new Member States, Lithuania and Hungary were the first to ratify the Constitution.
The Hungarian parliament even proposed an amendment including minority rights among the fundamental principles of the Constitution.
It is an important basic principle, since Europe is also the Europe of minorities, and everyone is a minority in Europe.
At the same time, it is important that minority rights are exercised collectively and mutually and that the Constitution allows for this as well.
This is, therefore, very pleasing to us.
