Â Â  â First, let me say how very grateful I am for the precision of your answers, which is a breath of fresh air.
I would also like to know what you mean, in this planning, by the terms âprogressiveâ and âlong termâ, and whether you have other intentions in mind as regards heavy utility vehicles.
Â Â  . I can, today, give only a report on the general mood as regards the specific requirements.
The main thing that came out of the Councilâs general debate was that the environment ministers unanimously welcomed the proposal for a drastic reduction in the particulate limit values for private diesel vehicles to 5mg per kilometre, whilst the Commissionâs 20% reduction in NOx limit values was regarded as inadequate.
Such is the present state of the debate, which we will continue in June.
A broad majority of the Member States has already expressed itself in favour of a second stage of reduction in NOx for Euro 6, that is to say, of taking a more ambitious approach to NOx reduction â which we see as having gone a very long way as regards particulate threshold values â along with a vision for even now guaranteeing industry the security to plan ahead even beyond Euro 5, which means, then, not adopting Euro 5 right now, irrespective of the details of the limit values, and then embarking on the next debate in two or three yearsâ time.
Over and above that, we must give industry a signal as to how things are to go in the future, and I see that â which is the approach we want to take â as a sensible thing to do.
Â Â  â Euro 5 is a big step in the right direction.
We also need to see how many percent by way of a reduction we can manage with and over what period of time.
Does anyone, at this early stage, have any idea about the timetable and the transitional periods?
Â Â  . As regards the timetable and the transitional periods, it is probably too early to give any indications concerning these, although I am involved in dialogue with most of the Member States.
The problem we had in the last general debate was that we were guided by the Commissionâs specifications and used them as the basis for the evaluation, but we have not yet got to the point at which I can sum up for you the sense of the meeting as regards the percentage reductions and the periods of time over which they are being contemplated.
It is, however, my intention, over a period of years â over a decade, indeed â to sketch out a vision and to set out the approximate stages by which these things may be implemented in practice, while setting out even now the further steps whereby we are contemplating the implementing stage of Euro 6.
The clear message, then, is that, rather than wanting to complete Euro 5 with a mere compromise and then promptly starting again with something new, we want, over and above that, to put down an unmistakeable marker.
Â Â  . On the subject of European forestry, we want, in June â that is, before the end of the Austrian Presidency â to put down a marker by opening a debate on the question of a forestry strategy for Europe, a subject on which we have as yet had no joint debates, but one that has now become all the more important to us since the decision on the promotion of rural development through the European Fund for Agriculture and Rural Development is making it possible for the Member States, between 2007 and 2013, to implement a development programme for rural areas that incorporates the protection of woodlands.
The intention is â and this is important â that this forestry measure should in particular enhance the competitiveness of forestry â as stated in ArticleÂ 20 â and promote the management of wooded land.
I would remind the House that the funds made available for this purpose at national level will be â as specified in EU Regulation 1698/2005 â co-funded by the Community and the Member States.
The Communityâs contribution towards the forestry strategy and support for forestry will amount to between something like 50% and 55%, with upper limits clearly set out in the annex to the regulation.
The total amount of aid to be granted for forestry programmes in Ireland for example in the 2007-2013 period, is being planned by the responsible authorities, who will submit to the European Union their plans for the allocation of national resources and for cofinancing by the European Union, for which provision has been made in legislation on rural development.
Â Â  I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
I want to ask him whether he believes that by-products of the European forestry industry have a potentially important role to play in the future in providing renewable energy sources.
Â Â  . I regard that scenario as absolutely necessary.
We must not, in Europe, make a mistake of the kind that we have sometimes made at national level, for example in energy policy, by discussing ambitious goals to the exclusion of all else.
How big should renewable energyâs slice of the energy cake be?
What we really need is an evaluation of potential.
What long-term potential is there in Europe for the production of renewable energy from biomass, wood, biogas, wind energy or water?
What is the workable potential when account is taken of sustainability, and by what means do we want to inject funds into rural development in order to make use of this potential on the energy supply market in ways that make good, effective and cost-efficient use of resources?
That is what the forestry strategy, on which we are now embarking, and the biomass action plan, which is already underway, are intended to enable us to discuss.
The Finnish Presidency of the Council will be making the forestry strategy one of its core priorities, and now, in June, we are playing the overture to it.
There must be greater emphasis on resources in debates, not least in those on rural development, as we, indeed, are doing in Austria, where, since 47% of our land surface is wooded, we will, in future, be prioritising the sustainable supply of biomass as a raw material, using, funds for rural development and a programme specifically for that purpose.
Â Â  . The Community measures for the promotion of sustainable forest management in the European Union form part of the EUâs forestry strategy, which comprises several components, namely rural development, the protection and monitoring of forests, the maintenance of biodiversity and the alleviation of the effects of climate change.
Woodland performs a very wide variety of functions, and rural development policy is â as I said in response to the previous question â the main instrument for implementing the forestry strategy at Community level.
Under the heading of rural development over the period from 2000 to 2006, the Community made available funds to a total of some EURÂ 4.8Â billion for forestry in Europe, amounting to 10% of the total funding allocated to rural development.
Over and above that, the new regulation provides for even more to be done for forestry as part of the promotion of rural development between 2007 and 2013.
This amounts to a forthright commitment to forestry and both to producers and consumers in the forestry field.
What are the future areas for support in forestry to which we refer?
One, for a start, is first afforestation on agricultural land, the initial setting up of agricultural forestry systems on farmland, the initial afforestation on non-agricultural land, payments under Natura 2000, forest-environment payments, the restoration of forestry potential, the introduction of prevention actions, and also support for non-productive investments.
What will be important in determining the direction we take in the future is the fact that we must not, in the debate on the forest strategy, forget one thing, namely that forests have a task to perform in terms of the biodiversity of flora and fauna, that they provide space for relaxation, that they have an environmental role to play, that they help us to deal with climate change, that they prepare the ground for sustainable energy supply, while at the same time having an enormous part to play in Europeâs economy.
It is vitally important that this be considered as a whole, and the forest strategy also needs to include extensive discussion of these issues.
Â Â  â Of course I am satisfied with your answer.
Nevertheless, given the environmental protection responsibility and Parliament's resolutions on natural disasters and the regional, environmental and agricultural scale thereof, describing in detail the tragedy most keenly felt in Mediterranean Europe, especially last year in Spain and in my country Portugal, which were attributable to the continued destruction of vast forest areas, and which led to a heavy cost in terms of human sustainability, of the depopulation of rural areas, of the growth and development of these areas, I should like to ask you, MrÂ PrÃ¶ll, if there are any moreÂ âŠ
Â Â  . The honourable Memberâs question specifically relates to a region in which forestry has historically been beset by problems, particularly with forest fires and all the other things that are matters of concern around the Mediterranean, and it is clear that the forestry strategy can be not only a strategy for the European countries with productive forests and a great deal of land covered by them, but also that we must, at the same time, take into account the problematic aspects that he has mentioned.
I therefore take it as read that very serious attention will be given, under the Finnish Presidency and its successors, to the issues of afforestation, environmental action and fire prevention, among others, in the countries and regions to which you, MrÂ Fernandes, have referred.
We also have to devise appropriate action for the most disadvantaged regions, and it matters to me that we should do so.
The forestry strategy is planned to be not only for such countries as Sweden, Finland and Austria, but is also to take account of all circumstances throughout the European Union.
Â Â  â Further to your reference to Natura 2000 as one of the possible sources for afforestation strategies, the problem we have had with this, over and over again, is that a very large number of landowners ended up with obligations, and some of them had no help whatever with discharging them.
Does the programme or the Financial Perspective make provision for financial facilities to meet this?
Â Â  . That, MrÂ Rack, is a matter that is not so much of direct relevance to the European Union as to the manner of implementation at nation state level, but it is important, in the forest strategy, Natura 2000, and all other measures that have an effect on property â which protective measures for animals and plants certainly do â that local landowners be involved in their design and practical implementation.
That is a task for those who have to put Natura 2000 into practice.
Lack of experience has meant that many mistakes have been made, and Natura 2000 in the broadest sense of the term has for that reason often got a bad name for itself, but, in those regions and countries in which it has been implemented well, not only with dialogue with landowners in devising the management plans but also with an appropriate range of direct payments on offer, the system has been effective.
One can point to a number of exemplary instances of this, but what is necessary is that the landowners be involved in the development of strategy and of management plans, and there must then be no doubt about what is on offer: if the environment is to be used, then, in the forest, appropriate compensation must be made for that.
Â Â  . The question that I am trying to answer in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council is not only a very specific one, but also one that I am, in particular, bound to answer as a national minister.
By adopting Directive 2060/EC, Parliament and the Council agreed on a comprehensive regulatory framework for Community measures in the sphere of water policy; the directive has, , the objective of progressively reducing the introduction of hazardous substances into water.
It provides for cooperation between the Member States in respect of cross-border water courses, an area in which the Commission can, where necessary, act as a mediator.
Turning to the specific question you put to me concerning the Raab, I can only report that foaming does occur along the river mainly on an occasional basis, that it is very much restricted to the local area, and, in particular, occurs downstream of protective overflows.
There has to date been no evidence of this foaming having any detrimental effect on the Raabâs water system, yet, nevertheless, Austria, not least as a result of the efforts of my experts, in its report analysing the pollution and its effects in accordance with ArticleÂ 5 of the Water Framework Directive creating a regulatory framework for Community measures in the sphere of water policy, described the chemical state of the affected stretch of the Raab as being associated with the risk of failing to achieve a good standard of water.
In accordance with the rules contained in the EU Water Framework Directive, further samples are being taken with the aim of determining the causes and the extent of, and possible solutions, to the problem, in order to put the programme of measures on a secure footing.
Speaking from where I am, I can assure you that I have the utmost interest in finding, in an ordered and positive relationship with our Hungarian neighbour, a solution to that which is provided for in the common European water policy plan, and will do everything in my power, in consultation with the officials responsible in the regions, specifically in two Austrian federal provinces, to get the problem taken seriously and progress made towards a solution that benefits Hungary as well.
I have an absolute interest in that; I will ensure that it comes to pass, and, in Austria, I have already taken appropriate action to that end.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, I would like to thank you and the Austrian Government for what you have done, and for your promise that starting from 1Â July, the polluted water from the Jennersdorf leather factory will no longer be discharged into the river Raab.
I think we agree that the Austrian-Hungarian border, as a green belt of a certain kind, should become a citadel of ecotourism.
Therefore I would like to ask you whether we may also be able to resolve the problem of the geothermal project at FÃŒrstenfeld, which pollutes the river Lapincs (Lafnitz) via the river Feistritz.
Â Â  . In both instances, and especially in the case of the Raab, to which you refer, we have set up bilateral commissions in order, together, to ensure that your objections are addressed, so that you, by naming a date and a specific factory will ensure that improvements are made, and I have also approached the appropriate regional authorities directly.
I have a great deal of interest in this and will see to it that we succeed in both cases, since I, as the Minister for the Environment of the Republic of Austria, have an equal interest in being heard in your proceedings, for example in respect of the nuclear power station at Pacs.
Being neighbours, we have shared interests in the region; there is give and take, and I trust that that will be the case as regards water just as much as it is already in matters relating to atomic power.
Â Â  â Since Austria is, of course, well known for clean lakes and clean rivers, I would be interested to know how the European rules compare with the Austrian ones.
Is it at EU level or in Austria that the inspections are more rigorous?
Â Â  . When compared with that in other countries, the quality of Austrian water is very good.
Problems do occur from time to time â there is no doubt about that â and we must, together with Hungary, work towards finding solutions to them, but, taken as a whole, water in Austria is of outstanding quality, as can be measured against the standards laid down by the European Unionâs Bathing Water Directive.
It was at one of the first debates that I, as a young minister, was allowed to attend, at the first Council of Environment Ministers in March 2003, that we first discussed the Bathing Water Directive in which these standards are laid down, and so I am able to tell your House today that we have been able to make constant improvements in the quality of running water, and that the water in all Austrian lakes is fit to bathe in and, in most, even fit to drink.
That cost us billions of euros in terms of investment in purification plant, but it is nonetheless important.
It is in the same spirit that brought us that development that we want to join with Hungary in working to resolve the problem on the Raab.
Â Â  . As was firmly reiterated in the Councilâs annual presentation to the March 2005 Spring Summit, the Council is prioritising, among other things, the practical ways in which the European Community applies environmental law and the requirement for further improvements in European policymaking with balanced consideration of the economic, social and environmental factors involved.
The EU-Mediterranean ministerial conferences regularly consider the complex issues around the environmental sustainability of the Mediterranean area, and â as part of the implementation of the outcomes of the two EU-Mediterranean ministerial conferences on environmental issues held in Helsinki in November 1997 and in Athens in July 2002 â efforts are being focussed on the laying down of a strategic framework and the promotion of a common approach and joint initiatives towards improving institutional and technical capacities in the region.
The primary intention in doing this is that greater attention be given to synergies with other programmes than has been the case in the past.
The Seventh Foreign Affairs Ministersâ Conference on 30 and 31 May 2005 in Luxembourg once again confirmed the Commissionâs initiative to remove pollution from the Mediterranean by 2020, the object of which initiative was to address all sources of pollution including industrial emissions, municipal waste and urban waste water, in order to improve the development prospects for tourism, increase the fisheries stocks, and make safe drinking water available to millions of members of the public in these regions, and the Mediterranean partners were to be supported in this by the provision of appropriate funding.
The objectives I have enumerated were confirmed at the EU-Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona.
Demands were also made for the drawing up of a timetable for the removal of pollution from the Mediterranean by 2020, and for consideration to be given to comparable experiences with sustainable development already gained from the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea regions.
Five action plans have been negotiated and formally adopted under the European Neighbourhood Policy, these being with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and the Palestinian Authority.
Negotiations on similar plans are underway with Egypt and the Lebanon, with a particular and urgent interest in environmental protection and the supply of water, but also in the disposal of waste water and the EUâs experience with environmental impact assessments and the work of the European Environment Agency.
It has, in any case, been our intention that deeper bilateral cooperation should include the implementation of multilateral environment agreements on the protection of the Mediterranean.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, thank you for your reply.
As you said, the Mediterranean is the most important tourist destination and maritime environmental policy is therefore extremely important.
Does the Council therefore intend to use the procedures you mentioned, such as partnership agreements and the Barcelona process, to promote something along the same lines as the maritime strategy framework already being promoted in the European Union under the relevant directive?
The reason I ask is because we already have a strategy in the directive in question.
Do we therefore also intend to promote this strategy through our partnerships in the Mediterranean?
I believe that this would make maritime environmental protection much more effective.
Â Â  . I very definitely take the view that the partnership agreement requires of us greater input as regards what form the financial resources should take.
Mechanisms were already in place in the past in order to support the Mediterranean region as a whole in performing its highly diverse and necessary functions and in meeting the demands of its peculiarities and vulnerabilities, not least in its ecosystems.
The Council will indeed have to give greater consideration to the issue of direct support.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Paolo Costa (A6-0194/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security (COM(2005)0429 â C6-0290/2005 â 2005/0191(COD)).
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we have here a piece of draft legislation that the Commission and the European Parliament regard as an important initiative.
The proposal adopted by the Commission on 22Â SeptemberÂ 2005 is important because the fight on all fronts against the terrorist threat remains a priority and because we need to learn the right lessons from the implementation of current legislation.
We must continue to seek ways of improving the protection of the European public and of reconciling security requirements more effectively with the operational needs of all stakeholders, be they public authorities, airports or airlines.
The legislation in force establishes rules for the security of civil aviation.
It was drafted with the utmost urgency in the wake of the terrorist atrocities of 11Â SeptemberÂ 2001.
The aim of the present draft is to consolidate that legislation on the basis of subsequent experience.
The rules in force are fairly detailed, as becomes plain whenever we try to introduce any new technology or to make the system more flexible in order to deal with specific risks.
A need for simplification has become apparent in the light of experience.
Without prejudice to the subsidiarity principle, the Commission believes that harmonisation of security requirements in the European Union is indispensable, and it is in the interests of European civil aviation that this harmonisation should be enhanced.
We must meet that expectation.
Experience gained through the inspections conducted by the Commission has shown that some provisions of the Regulation require further clarification.
The Commission has proposed a rebalancing of the channels through which its implementing powers are exercised within the context of the comitology procedure so that it can respond more rapidly to technological change and increase the confidentiality of rules that must remain outside the public domain.
I am convinced that, if this revised draft on aviation security is adopted, it will not only afford the public better protection but will also establish a consolidated framework that strikes a good balance between the extension of controls to counteract specific risks and the minimisation of their operational impact, giving due consideration to the interests of all parties.
I note with satisfaction that the draft report presented to us today reproduces the line of argument underlying the Commissionâs initiative as well as addressing the specific operational requirements that have become apparent.
MrÂ Costa has produced a very valuable piece of work, and I wish to thank him for the quality of his report and for the cooperative spirit that was evident in his dealings with the Commission.
Knowing the Commissionâs proposal, the balance of opinion within the Council and the amendments proposed by the European Parliament to the most technical part of the proposal, I am very hopeful, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, that an agreement can materialise quickly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we can try this evening to make progress with this regulation and its subject-matter, which will enable us to conclude a piece of legislation initiated in the wake of the 11Â September terrorist attacks.
It is quite right that all the consequences of that experience should be examined and that we should be even better prepared to tackle the situation now developing.
I should just like to highlight two aspects of the work we have done, because the Commissionâs proposal is an excellent one that just needed to be made more explicit on a few points and developed further on a single point.
The proposal needed to be made more explicit regarding the idea that we can only be certain of achieving a good outcome for aviation security if we have a single system that provides a level of security guaranteed by every airport and every airline.
The system as a whole has been redefined precisely to that effect.
The idea of implementing a single security system is essential if we are to provide the strongest possible protection for all European and non-European citizens who fly in our skies and use our airports.
I believe there is one point that has been neglected ever since 2002, which is the fact that, if at least a basic level of common security is to be imposed throughout Europe, effective funding mechanisms also need to be provided.
Support for such funding may come from two sources: one resulting from the general public concern that we must defend ourselves against possible terrorist attacks, and the other resulting from individual fear, in that each passenger as such produces a demand for additional security.
Currently, the situation in Europe as regards the way these measures are funded is extremely varied and not necessarily very fair or correct.
That is the reason why we have insisted â and continue to insist â on the need to lay down rules for funding these basic security measures, keeping in mind the possibility of redistributing the funding equally between the two sources.
That is the subject of the amendment that we have put forward, which was supported by a large majority in committee and I hope will likewise be accepted in this House tomorrow.
With our amendment, therefore, we invite the Commission to make some technical suggestions on the subject.
The European Parliament will, for its part, do everything possible for the amendment to be accepted.
I am aware of the fact that this is a sensitive subject for the Council, but I believe that, if security is indeed regarded as a supreme good and a primary objective, it is essential to create the right conditions to guarantee it.
Precisely because the security funding situation in Europe is highly varied at the moment, it is important to ensure that the issue is made explicit, that the citizens understand what they are contributing towards, and that the funds intended for security be used transparently and effectively.
In drawing up the common rule, we have also had to address matters of detail that are very much in the public eye, such as the problem of on-board security.
In that regard, Parliament suggests imposing a ban on having weapons on board, except in special, duly authorised cases.
I consider this an acceptable solution, and I hope that tomorrow Parliament will effectively help to make the report and the regulation progress.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted at the proposal for a regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
If it is adopted, we can hope for greater cooperation within the Union, so that we can live in a more secure Europe.
I endorse the idea of a single security system, the aim of which is to make further checks unnecessary if the Member States are reasonably sure that the basic security rules have been followed at the airport of origin.
I am not overjoyed, however, that the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I am the draftsman, and which was actually adopted by a very large majority, has not been taken into due consideration.
I believe, in fact, that the Member States should keep the power to apply more stringent security measures both internally and in the context of bilateral relations with third countries, should they consider them necessary on the basis of legitimate risk assessments.
Such more stringent measures should in all cases be proportionate and in keeping with civil liberties and free market principles, as in fact is pointed out in the opinion that I have drafted.
While I believe that the Commission should confine itself to laying down minimum standards and carrying out checks by means of regular as well as unannounced inspections, I consider it excessive that the Commission should be able to decide by itself whether a State can continue to apply more stringent measures or not.
In addition, I am consoled by the fact that, at least in the area of on-board measures, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has seen fit to take up my amendment extending the definition of âpotentially disruptive passengersâ to people whose behaviour is a source of genuine concern.
I am very pleased at the acceptance of my amendment calling on the Commission to draw up an annual report on the application of national security programmes.
In short, I felt that the proposal needed to be accepted, including by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as it aims at making the various programmes the subject of an annual report by the Commission to the European Parliament and the national parliaments, informing them of the application of the national security programmes as well as the results achieved by the new regulation.
Â Â  . Mr President, since the start of this Parliament I have worked on several reports dealing with security issues in the transport sector.
I notice that on each occasion we seem to have exactly the same debates, whether the report deals with seaports or, as in this case, airports and aviation.
Different industries face different threats necessitating different security measures.
However, the report in front of us today is one that will probably have the greatest impact on the safety of Europeâs citizens.
In general I welcome this proposal.
Clear rules for security across Europeâs airports are absolutely necessary.
However â and here I speak personally â I have some concerns about some of the measures.
Firstly, within the proposals before us, the Commission attempts to accrue more power for itself.
What I refer to is the issue of special security measures.
Those generally short-term increases in security, based on national intelligence, should not have to be approved by the Commission before being implemented.
The Commission does not have the facility of intelligence-sharing, nor should it have, in my opinion.
Therefore it does not have the ability to carry out that task effectively.
In some cases that particular position could jeopardise security itself.
It is for Member States to decide on what extra measures they deem necessary.
The Commissionâs role should be to coordinate, not to dictate.
The issue of in-flight security does not belong in this regulation.
Again, those are measures for individual governments and their own air carriers.
My greatest concern is the proposal contained in some of the amendments adopted in committee to extend the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency to take on security.
When the EASA was originally set up, it was generally agreed that it would deal with safety issues and have no influence on security.
I remember well the problems caused in some languages by that definition.
Since then the EASA has not proved itself competent, even in this area of work.
I do not see why, given that failing, extra powers should be given to it.
Despite these reservations I see the benefits of common security standards across the Union.
With the heightened terrorist threat to aviation today, improvements in security must and should be encouraged.
Thus, with the support of a number of colleagues, I have tabled some amendments that not only address my concerns but all of those across the industry.
I hope we can achieve a workable solution to these issues.
Common standards, not draconian regulation, are required for the continued safety for all Europeâs citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Costa, and the other shadow rapporteurs for the excellent team effort.
Apart from a few minor details, we can more or less agree on everything, or at least the gist, and we as Parliament will be able to put forward a forceful opinion.
Since 11Â September, safety is, of course, more than ever, an important topic, and it goes without saying that aviation requires our particular attention, given the potentially devastating effect of attacks involving aircraft.
To my group, this means that we must always strive for the highest level of protection, but that this must be accompanied by a sufficient level of transparency and with respect for civil liberties.
The protection efforts and related costs must be proportionate to the safety risks.
In that light, the committee of experts which issues implementing decisions of this framework legislation should not simply be given to make any proposals without any opposition. That is why AmendmentÂ 61, which formally provides for the establishment of an Advisory Group for interested parties, is important.
We feel that not only industry, but also other organisations should be able to sit on this group, including passenger associations and, possibly, organisations that can give advice about civil liberties.
We also ask for an annual report to be drawn up about the application of this regulation.
A second element on which we are agreed, and to which the rapporteur has already made reference, is that it should be clear who should cover the costs of security at airports.
By extension, there should, of course, also be clarity about the distribution of the security costs in the entire transport sector.
Is it the customers, industry, or perhaps the government?
It will, of course, need to be a combination of the three, but what is important is that we must seek to establish the same European rules wherever we go.
We talked about this during a previous meeting, Commissioner.
You are supposed to present an initiative by the summer, and we are awaiting this with anticipation.
A major improvement in the Commission proposal is the fact that the chapter on safety on board civil aircraft has been added.
It is about, amongst other things, the notorious sky marshals, armed security officials on board aircraft.
We are, in principle, opposed to the presence of arms in aircraft because their misuse or accidents can have devastating consequences.
As such, we are not fans of these measures.
The problem is that the deployment of security officials is a matter for the Member States to decide, and that is also how it will be in future.
Some countries, including France and the United Kingdom, have already used them, while others, such as Greece and Spain, have not.
In that light, we welcome this additional measure as an opportunity for regulating this issue at least partly at European level by, for example, imposing uniform procedures and strict security regulations or by providing for cross-border training.
We too have tabled two amendments.
The first is a formal amendment with regard to Gibraltar Airport in order to bring the text into line with existing agreements.
The second is an amendment in which we ask for a European system to be set up for the certification of equipment which is used for the protection of airports, including X-ray scanners and such like.
This issue should be tackled at European level, not least because not all Member States have the expertise needed to make the right choices about the security equipment, which is becoming ever more modern.
Moreover, the maze of standards is a handicap for European industry compared to the US industry.
I should like to ask for your support in this connection too.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst congratulating Mr Costa on his excellent report, I wish to bring to the attention of this House four areas of concern in relation to civil aviation security which, in my view, are not adequately dealt with by either the existing or the proposed legislation.
The first relates to the non-inclusion in the proposal under consideration of improvements in the measures to prevent unauthorised access to the flight crew compartment.
Such measures are currently covered only by ICAO provisions.
These provisions are, unfortunately, outdated and need revision based on experience.
Such experience is provided, for example, by the tragic crash of the Helios airline jet in Greece last summer in which 121 people died.
On that occasion, the two pilots lost consciousness as a result of ensuing hypoxia and a steward, who was a qualified pilot himself, could not enter the cockpit in time to prevent a crash because of the currently-applied security locking system of the cockpit door.
The second area of concern relates to the attempt to broaden the definition of a âpotentially disruptive passengerâ to include people whose behaviour is potentially a source of dangerous disruption.
This is welcomed, but unfortunately the most common type of disruptive passenger â the drunk passenger â is not dealt with here.
Furthermore, there is no attempt to prevent such situations: alcohol continues to be served in plentiful quantities and, on many flights, free of charge to passengers.
The most logical thing to do would be to ban alcohol use on flights.
The third area of concern has to do with the security screening for potential weapons.
Passengers are forbidden to carry objects which, only with the greatest stretch of the imagination, could possibly be considered to be of any offensive capability, such as nail clippers; yet glass bottles of alcoholic beverages, for example, are allowed on board.
I need not point out that a broken bottle held by the bottle neck is a most dangerous weapon in the hands of an assailant.
The wise approach would be not to allow glass bottles in the passenger cabin.
The fourth area of concern is the controversial issue of flight marshals. The general approach of the legislators is that no weapon-carrying security officers should be present on aircraft.
The main argument put forward in favour of this position is the alleged catastrophic risk of a weapon firing accidentally during flight. This is not accurate.
Certain states such as Israel have for many years now had armed personnel on their national airlineâs flights, and I am not aware of any such accidents occurring to date.
In fact, modern weapons such as double action pistols with built-in advanced safety mechanisms cannot fire accidentally, but even if they did this is very unlikely to cause a crash.
Indeed, there have been numerous occasions where firearms were used on board aircraft, and yet this in itself did not severely affect flight capability.
On the other hand, the presence of air marshals could be crucial in neutralising a hijack situation and certainly could act as a strong deterrent in preventing one from arising in the first place.
Â Â  . â Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating air safety for a long time, and quite rightly too; it is hardly surprising that it was necessary to update it in view, not only of what happened on 11Â September 2001, but also of our experience of other terrorist acts on board aircraft.
We had a major argument about how this was to be funded, that being crucial when it comes to making things safe, only then to ask oneself who is meant to come up with the necessary money.
The whole committee, and all the Members of this House, would, however, have found it very helpful if we, at the very outset of the debate, had had sight of the Commissionâs documents on a process reviewing the measures taken in response to 11Â September 2001; that would certainly have made our discussions more straightforward and afforded us many more options.
It does, nevertheless, make sense to take joint basic measures in matters of security.
That is in any case more transparent than confrontation between different nationsâ highly divergent ways of dealing with this, which may â and I deliberately say âmayâ, although many are probably aware of what I am talking about â be capable of being misused to distort competition or exclude certain practices.
When it comes to the financial arrangements, there is a matter pertaining to the future that we have to address, and MrÂ ElÂ Khadroui has already mentioned it: we cannot stop at air transport in debating who is to take in hand security measures in connection with large-scale transport infrastructures.
We also have to devise a financial measure that gives fair treatment to all means of transport in order not, from the very start, to give preferential treatment to certain of them in the funding of security measures or when it comes to the extent to which they are to be funded through the sale of tickets, by the taxpayer, by the airlines or by other bodies.
This is where the European public have every right to expect transparency; that is a core requirement.
Further to what Mr Matsakis had to say on the subject, I think the debate on the need to bar certain passengers is perfectly justified.
Passengers under the influence of alcohol are one aspect of this, but the original effect of this proposal would have been to limit it to asylum seekers being sent home or to prisoners under escort.
The extension of this term in the course of the debates in committee was urgently needed.
Where sky marshals are concerned, I take a very firm line.
I do not believe that the presence on board of armed personnel makes for greater security. The plain and simple fact is that there are circumstances under which that can mean that there is one weapon more available on board for terrorists or for those persons who plan or want to commit terrorist acts.
Let me end, though, on a positive note: the idea of a usersâ committee is a very important step in the right direction, and I hope that such committees will have a positive impact on the way measures are further developed.
Â Â  Mr President, harmonising protection regulations in civil aviation can increase the level of security.
In this respect, we must ensure that there is sufficient democratic control over the decisions that are taken in the framework of comitology and that therefore largely remain outside of the public domain and out of Parliamentâs control.
As this involves sensitive and confidential information, it is understandable that people should wish to keep this out of the public domain, but it does make it all the more necessary for Parliament to be able to closely monitor the implementing measures that were agreed behind closed doors.
As a consequence, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports Amendments 61 and 62 which provide for democratic supervision.
We think it would be a good thing if the Advisory Group did not remain restricted to professional organisations, but was extended to include representatives of passenger interests organisations and of groups that campaign for the protection of civil liberties.
Another aspect that caught our particular attention is the so-called sky marshals.
In order to prevent arbitrariness and accidents in future, it is necessary to draw up common rules for deploying armed security officers on board aircraft.
Along with other speakers, I doubt whether an armed presence on board would enhance security.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, MrÂ Costa, and to congratulate him on his work.
Today we are dealing with an issue that is very important for public security, namely increasing protection measures â I repeat, protection measures â in the field of civil aviation.
It is the next step towards a reduction in the threats, especially terrorist threats, associated with the use of civil aircraft to transport people and goods.
We must admit that the 2002 regulation currently in force contains too many specific and formal solutions which make a flexible response to operational needs difficult.
It is vital to retain an appropriate balance between the need for an effective and hence rapid response and an appropriate level of protection and control.
Of course, it is also necessary to make the right decisions regarding the cost of the action required.
It is a shame that the draft regulation does not cover this issue.
I would be happy, Commissioner, to know at least an estimate of the necessary expenditure.
It is good that the Member States are given the responsibility for drawing up appropriate plans for civil aviation security.
Air carriers and operators are responsible for implementing programmes and technical conditions that ensure the right level of protection.
Appropriate training for personnel is also required.
We should also pay attention to the need for safety standards, and not lower them in an attempt to make savings.
The next very important issue is to draw up appropriate agreements or contracts with countries outside the EU.
It is therefore good that the regulation contains relevant provisions in ArticleÂ 17 referring to that problem.
I am glad to see that the annex to the regulation is clear and has a structure that permits, if necessary, the introduction of specific implementation guidelines.
I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to draw your attention to the necessity of using measures and methods which will not be unnecessarily onerous or even humiliating for passengers. This applies to disabled passengers or parents with small children.
Strange situations also occur, for example when a passenger has a very small nail file confiscated and shortly after, on board, if she is travelling business class, is given a metal knife and fork.
Finally, I would like to state my conviction that the draft regulation presented by the Commission will be improved thanks to the approval of a series of very rational amendments, something I support on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
Perhaps you know what one mother is supposed to have said to her pilot son: âOnly fly slowly and lowâ.
I would put it differently: âLet us fly fast and as high as is necessary, but let us always fly safelyâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, some of what my esteemed colleague MrÂ Bradbourn had to say was his personal view; I can assure the House and the Commissioner that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is â with the exception of one amendment â right behind the Costa report, and I will take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to the Chairman of the Committee and to the rapporteur for their very constructive cooperation.
I just want to say something about two peculiarities in this Houseâs amendments.
The first is that I believe that the costs of all security measures at airports should be split between those who use the airports and the Member States, for the measures put in place at airports are not primarily for the benefit of the individual passenger, but serve to avert dangers to all and sundry; that, traditionally, is one of the functions of the state, and it is the state that should pay for it to be done.
By way of comparison â and on this evening it might well be an appropriate one â let me point out that my own country, when football matches are being staged, has hundreds of police officers on duty before, during and after the match, and not one spectator is required to pay even a cent for them.
If, then, the cost of protecting people against danger at football matches is borne generally, then the same ought, even if only to some degree, to apply at airports.
Secondly, we must make sure, once and for all, that the system of a single security check is brought in on flights not only within the European Union, but also between the European Union and secure third countries.
It is surely not acceptable that someone should arrive at Frankfurt airport by air from Israel and be subject to a second security check before he travels on to Hamburg, and the same is true in the case of the USA.
It must be possible for people arriving from a safe country to avoid going through additional security checks when they change flights within an EU Member State.
This would be a sensible arrangement, and I hope that we, together with the Commission and the Council, will adopt it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank MrÂ Costa for a constructive report.
I welcome the fact that plenary is now revising the existing regulation adopted directly after the terrorist attack on New York on 11Â September 2001.
I am deputising for MrsÂ Hedkvist Petersen in the committee.
I was shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, where I tabled the amendments that were adopted by the committee and that are to be voted on tomorrow. These are about the distinction between postal mail and traditional cargo and about protection against terrorist attacks.
We need increased security but also a balance between freedoms and rights.
To have their post distributed efficiently and within a reasonable period of time is an important right for all EU citizens, especially for those who live in sparsely populated areas or outside cities and population centres.
Quite a few Member States have airmail services, which are not at the same kind of risk as other forms of aviation.
The period within which mail is distributed should not be several days, a state of affairs of which Europeans would take a very dim view.
The amendments concerning mail and postal services guarantee that people will not receive a worse postal service because of the regulation.
I also wish to comment on AmendmentÂ 22 concerning passengers who are potentially disruptive or whose behaviour is manifestly abnormal.
It is important to make it clear that we are not referring to people with physical or mental disabilities.
The fact is that, through ramps and other aids, we have made aviation accessible to everyone. This regulation must not make it inaccessible.
It is also important to have clear and strict rules for when airlines have to have guards on board.
The report strikes a clear balance between, on the one hand, the fight against the appalling terrorism that has hit aviation and against which we want to protect ourselves and, on the other hand, safe and efficient aviation and postal and cargo services.
I applaud the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is now obvious that the measures being taken as part of the fight against terrorism are to a degree unavoidable.
However, it is also clear that measures may become excessive and restrict the civil liberties of those they are supposed to protect.
It is of paramount importance to have effective mechanisms which function as safety valves in order to avoid infringements of civil liberties.
The letter of the law is important and must be controlled, but its application must be equally controlled.
It is, however, worrying that more and more powers are being transferred to the centre of the Union, especially the Commission.
Subsidiarity is being undermined slowly but surely.
Another question which arises is how the information which is collected and disseminated will be managed and who will have access to it.
All of this has been said before in connection with similar measures with similar objectives.
We have our reservations, but we also recognise the Union's right to protect its citizens.
Our differences therefore lie in the methods used.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a saying that you can never have too many security measures.
In fact, this has become a commonly used truism.
Is this really the case, however?
Is it true that the more security measures one has, the smaller the risks of exposing oneself to danger?
Of course, I ask these questions in the context of one issue, which even today is hotly debated, namely the possibility of special civil aviation security services that are authorised to carry weapons.
I have no doubts that there should be a categorical and unequivocal ban in this particular case. This is not only because the use of these weapons, though obviously only in defence of passengers and crew, in itself poses a danger in the rather fragile environment of an airplane, but also for another reason, namely that weapons may provoke passengers who might otherwise have boarded the plane without any aggressive intentions.
This is particularly the case if they are psychologically unstable. These kinds of passengers can after all also be found on board aircraft.
It also seems unfortunate that neither ChapterÂ 10(4) of the Annex or AmendmentÂ 79 addresses this matter.
I repeat that I am in favour of a total ban on weapons on board aircraft.
Someone may well ask âwhat about extraordinary situations where there is a suspected threat of dangerâ?
To this I would say that this flight should not be allowed to take off at all, and must be cancelled.
I, for one, would certainly not want to be on that flight.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate MrÂ Costa on this report, which puts its finger on those aspects that were left out of the first Regulation, which, as a result of the horrendous 11Â September attack, was put together by the various institutions with laudable speed and capacity to respond.
It is the case, however, that, at that time, certain important aspects were left out of a negotiation which was carried out in response to what was a significant moment in terms of security.
It is also the case that MrÂ Costa, in these proposed amendments to the Regulation presented by the Commission, which is now established as a framework Regulation while the contributions made by means of commitology and the application of experience are assessed, has improved â I believe â those aspects that were most necessary: those which introduce the concern and interests of the parties involved, both from the point of view of the Member States and from the point of view of the airlines and airports, and also the aspects which have not yet been dealt with in relation to funding and which are so dear to MrÂ Costaâs heart, who has made great progress in relation to them.
We feel that there is a point in MrÂ Costaâs proposal, however, that, in his enthusiasm for improving this Regulation, has introduced some confusion: the package of clauses which relate to the application, which has been traditional and historical since 1987, of all of the legislation relating to safety in civil aviation applied to the Gibraltar airport.
There is an amendment that we have presented from various perspectives which, without in any way jeopardising the safety applied to the Gibraltar airport, does preserve and protect the problem of an historical dispute, which is now on the point of being resolved.
I would therefore ask MrÂ Costa not to add a further point of conflict to an agreement that has been under negotiation since December 2004 and which, with regard to the Gibraltar airport, will prevent that suspension and neutralisation.
We would therefore ask you to accept this amendment, which simply restores something which has been historical, without in anyway prejudicing the safety of civil aviation.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the Chairman of our Committee on Transport and Tourism, MrÂ Costa, for his excellent report.
His draft introduces provisions that will undoubtedly serve to improve the security of civil aviation.
Nevertheless, there are still two points I wish to pick up. Several of you have referred to the first of these, namely the funding issue.
We are speaking here of security, not of air safety.
In other words, it is not just a matter of protecting users of air transport but all people in Europe who could be the target of attacks in which aircraft are used, as was the case on SeptemberÂ 11.
It seems unfair, as MrÂ Jarzembowski said, to burden aircraft passengers with the cost of these measures, especially since they are already overtaxed in a sector where new taxes are being invented all the time, as was the case only recently with the introduction of a tax on air tickets in some countries.
I therefore believe that it would be preferable not to make air travellers foot too much of the bill for these measures.
The other point I should like to raise concerns the obligation contained in Amendments 41 and 42, which would require Member States to consult and inform the Regulatory Committee before applying their own security measures.
Although I understand and respect the idea of transparency that underlies these amendments, I wonder about the practical applicability of such proposals.
If it is necessary to wait for the committee to be convened, informed and consulted every time an airport wants to deploy an additional security guard, I am not sure whether an obligation that took so long to fulfil would be conducive to aviation security.
It would certainly be preferable to strike a better balance between the need for transparency and the need to act quickly.
Â Â  Mr President, it is with real pleasure that I once again express my appreciation to CommissionerÂ Barrot for proposing an excellent solution to us.
Commissioner, it really is a contribution to creating a safe European airspace.
I would like to congratulate MrÂ PaoloÂ Costa, the Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on his report.
Under your guidance we have achieved a high level of agreement, irrespective of a few individual reservations.
Protecting citizens gives them a feeling of security, and protecting air transport stabilises the aviation market.
These are the aspects I wanted to highlight today as particularly important, especially from the point of view of those countries in which this market is in its infancy.
In my country, air traffic is increasing by around 30% a year.
However, I do not share the reservations concerning the supposedly excessive new competences of the Commission and the Aviation Safety Agency, as they are necessary.
We have had five years of experience since 11Â September2001.
In the draft regulation mentioned above, we have defined tasks for governments and states, we have defined the responsibilities of airports and airline operators, we have defined the competences of civil servants and air security workers, and we have also defined the guidelines for acceptable passenger behaviour.
The draft regulation also mentions how this programme is to be funded.
I would urge against minimising costs as an aim in itself.
After all, we have the responsibility to monitor air traffic security.
Neither do we have any objections towards the proposal presented by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I therefore believe that our fears concerning restrictions on human rights and civil liberties are not entirely well-founded.
The fact of the matter is that this regulation will have a positive, even perhaps excessively positive, influence on the competitive dominance of the airline industry compared to other transport sectors.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the Committee Chairman, MrÂ Costa, for his excellent work.
My thanks also go to all the speakers, whose contributions testify to the importance of the subject of this eveningâs debate.
The European Commission is able to accept a large number of the amendments proposed in this report.
I shall transmit the necessary information on each of the amendments through the usual channels, MrÂ President.(1)
I shall take this opportunity to reply to some of the speakers on the question of firearms on board aircraft.
In the Commissionâs proposal amending the Regulation, chapter 10 of the Annex proposes in-flight security measures. ParagraphÂ 4 stipulates that no firearms must be present on board an aircraft unless authorised by the Member States concerned, subject to fulfilment of the security conditions.
The Commission is not proposing that firearms be permitted on board aircraft, but experience has shown that there are cases in which firearms are carried on aircraft by statesmenâs bodyguards or by security officers known as âsky marshalsâ.
Accordingly, the Commission wants to ensure that the conditions laid down in paragraphÂ 4 are met in such cases.
So much for the problem of firearms on board, a difficult problem for which we have tried to find a few benchmarks.
The Commission, MrÂ Costa, can endorse the creation, as proposed in recitalÂ 9, of a solidarity mechanism that could be activated in the event of a terrorist attack, but we must bear in mind that the consequences of an act of terrorism can spread far beyond the transport sector.
For this reason, the Commission believes that this matter should be dealt with in a wider context.
Let me move on to the funding of security.
Back in April, I promised you a report on the financing of transport security.
We are in the process of finalising that document, which will be with you before the summer recess.
The report will describe the current situation and will show what is desirable to protect the public on the one hand and to guarantee the proper functioning of the single market and fair competition on the other.
According to the study on civil-aviation security, the cost of security is borne to a great extent by users at the present time.
For flights within the Community, security-related taxes and fees levied by governments and carriers account for one to two per cent of the average ticket price.
I therefore agree with your committee and its chairman, MrÂ Costa, on the need for greater transparency with regard to taxes and fees.
That is the way to avoid any risk of distorted competition.
The next task is to examine the situation that would develop if some Member States were to set additional requirements.
I certainly understand the reasons for all these amendments that relate to funding, but is it necessary to try and resolve all of these funding problems in the context of a technical regulation?
The regulation is there to set technical standards for the security of civil aviation; for the rest, it is true that the simplification of certain procedures can lower costs, but I really must remind Parliament that we have to take care not to delay the improvement of this security legislation.
This is why the Commission has misgivings about the amendments on funding, especially Amendments 35 and 43.
It is true that the funding problems require clarification, but let us be wary of delay in the adoption of this revised draft. I believe every speaker has acknowledged its usefulness, particularly in providing a European approach to security standards.
Lastly, I should like to say to the lead committee that we cannot support the amendments which would entrust additional tasks to the European Aviation Safety Agency at this time.
We cannot ask it today to assume this additional responsibility, because it already has very important functions and has some difficulty in performing them with the resources that are currently at its disposal.
In spite of these reservations, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to offer Parliament, along with its rapporteur and committee, my sincere thanks, because we consider that the Commission can accept the great majority of the amendments.
In conclusion, I fervently hope that we can proceed towards the rapid adoption of this proposal.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 37, 40, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 55, 56, 58, 60, 61, 65, 66, 67, 68, 73, 77, 78, 82, 89 and 91.
The Commission can accept Amendments 9, 14, 18, 23, 25, 39, 42, 51, 64, 72, 79, 81 and 84 in principle.
The Commission can agree in part to Amendments 5, 20, 21 and 57.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 19, 22, 32, 35, 36, 38, 41, 43, 44, 45, 50, 52, 54, 59, 62, 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 80, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 90.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Michael Cramer (A6-0183/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the deployment of the European rail signalling system ERTMS/ETCS (2005/2168(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude for the constructive cooperation on the part not only of the Commission, of the Committee secretariat, of the railway companies, and of the railway industry, but also, and not least, of the groupsâ shadow rapporteurs, for it was also thanks to them that it was possible for this report to be adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism with nobody either voting against it or abstaining.
The effect of ERTMS is to incorporate digital technology into the infrastructure of railways, with the prospect, after many decades, of the twenty different signalling systems still in operation today being consigned to the past and ERTMS, as a single system throughout all the EUâs Member States, replacing them.
The system improves safety, reduces building and maintenance costs and increases capacity to a considerable degree, while also resulting in a considerable reduction in the cost of locomotives, which it will be possible to manufacture in greater numbers.
This standardised train security system will make interoperability considerably simpler and speedier, enabling the benefits of long stretches, particularly in goods traffic, to be experienced in travelling across Europe; any substantial increase in the number of such journeys is made an impossibility by the technical and political patchwork quilt that we have now, and so it pays to make investment in ERTMS a priority and to emphasise the need for it.

Investments in ERTMS are regarded as equal to investments in infrastructure and treated as cross-border projects, resulting in up to 50% co-funding from the EU, not only for ERTMS-compatible locomotives, but also for infrastructure â for those sections that cross borders, at any rate.
I firmly endorse the memorandum of understanding by which the EU and the national railways have agreed to equip six corridors with ERTMS.
These corridors are symbolic of the reunion of Europe, and the implementation of ERTMS in them will, among other things, overcome national egoisms, since it will be necessary to think and act in a European way.
If these projects were to be successful in the short term, it would encourage further initiatives, but what is also necessary is that the issue be kept at the top of the agenda, and not only by those who take decisions in the EU; the Member States too, along with industry, infrastructure manager and rail operators must make ERTMS a priority and all push and pull in the same direction at the same time.
If, though, trains are to be able to travel speedily into the future without damaging the environment, there are important framework conditions to be put in place.
The external costs of the Eurovignette must be internalised, and, as an example of how to do this, we may take Switzerland, where tolls are four times what they are in Germany, are levied on all road and on all goods vehicles.
Up to now, competition in the EU has been unfair; in Germany, for example, added on to the massive fiscal drawbacks, track charges constitute a rail toll on all trains and on all lines, whilst lorries have up to now been charged tolls only on motorways and only if they weigh over 12Â tonnes.
Not only does ERTMS offer Europe an opportunity to grow together, but it is also essential to the medium and long term development of the rail industry and to the 15Â 000 highly-skilled jobs in it.
Even today, the railway industry is a hit on the export front, with orders for locomotives placed by Korea, Taiwan, India, Saudi Arabia and China, and infrastructure projects in those countries, clearly demonstrating its market potential.
If ERTMS can build on the foundation of a strong market in Europe, it can be the standard for the world.
I have a vision of a European rail network from Lisbon to Tallinn, from Paris to Warsaw and from London to Athens via Budapest.
With ERTMS, it will be taking a mighty step further forwards.
It is with that in mind that I hope that we will all, tomorrow, confirm the committeeâs vote, and would ask you to reject all the amendments that have now been tabled.
I would also ask the Council, when it votes on this, to follow this Houseâs example.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I read MrÂ Cramerâs report with great attention and interest.
I should like to congratulate him on the quality of his report, which is the fruit of cooperation with all stakeholders in the railway sector.
You spared no effort, MrÂ Cramer!
Not content to organise a hearing on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), you travelled all over Europe to raise technical and political questions relating to the system.
You consulted closely with MrÂ KarelÂ Vinck, European Coordinator for ERTMS.
These are the reasons for the high quality of the report you compiled, which was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Your report clearly presents the advantages of ERTMS and spells out the three challenges that have to be met if it is to be deployed successfully.
First of all, ERTMS is recognised as the best system in the world today for indicating permissible speeds to drivers and for monitoring those speeds automatically.
As MrÂ Cramer has just emphasised, the success achieved in exporting the system outside Europe to countries such as Taiwan and Korea testifies to the potential of this system as an exportable product.
Secondly, many lines in Europe are equipped with national and even regional systems, most of which are dated and mutually incompatible.
MrÂ Cramer spoke of a âpatchworkâ, which very aptly illustrates the wide disparities between these systems in terms of safety and performance levels.
In order to operate on a given line, a locomotive must be equipped with the appropriate system, which is why the Thalys trains need to have seven control systems on board.
Thirdly, as long as ERTMS is not being widely used on the European rail network, railway companies are hesitant to invest in it.
Conversely, as long as trains are not equipped for ERTMS, infrastructure providers will also hesitate to invest in it.
As a result, it is often in rail companiesâ interests to wait for others to take the first step.
There is a need to break out of this circle of inertia and convince all players in the field of rail transport that they should adopt what is ultimately a win-win strategy.
We can also rely on MrÂ Vinck, the European Coordinator, to use his powers of persuasion.
The major freight corridors will only be competitive if locomotives are not brought to a halt at national borders by technical barriers, and to that end the Community strategy must be clearly enunciated, as MrÂ Cramer has shown in his report.
It is essential to ensure that ERTMS is put in place wherever it is compulsory, especially on all the new high-speed lines.
European funding should be confined to rail projects in which ERTMS is taken into account.
Substantial financial incentives must be offered to the first infrastructure operators and the first train operators to equip themselves with ERTMS.
A great deal of work has been done to make ERTMS a success, but we must step up our efforts, and to that end, MrÂ President, the contribution of Parliament is warmly welcomed.
Thank you, MrÂ Cramer, for your work on this report.
We must move together in the same direction, namely towards a competitive European rail environment that is able to deliver high-quality service.
That is how we can shift part of the volume of freight traffic from road to rail in order to save energy and come closer to the Kyoto targets.
All of this, MrÂ Cramer, certainly does require a bold and ambitious strategy for the introduction of ERTMS.
In this respect, your report bolsters our case appreciably, and for that I wish to thank both you and the European Parliament.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I hope that the introduction of the single train system will be quicker and more punctual than the way we are going about things, for we are already â again â running twenty minutes behind time, and I am sure you will not mind if I go pretty soon, as I want to watch another match somewhere.
I do not need to repeat what the rapporteur had to say, since all the groups on the committee managed to achieve compromises on essential points, and I also share the view expressed by the Vice-President.
There are just two things I would like to point out.
The first â and it is for MrÂ Cramerâs benefit â is that we should not be talking in terms of percentages, for we have as yet no idea as to how much money is in the pot for ERTMS, and, moreover, we do not yet know which projects are actually ready to go ahead.
One project â the route from Rotterdam to Genoa â does admittedly appear to be ready apart from the last stretch into Genoa, but funding from the Member States for the other projects has not yet been secured, and so we should not be promising something that the Member States are unwilling to produce, for they, the network operators and the railways must contribute their shares.
All we can do is add a topping of money from the TEN budget; if the Member States stonewall, then nothing will happen.
Secondly, I hope that those Member States that can get money from the cohesion fund or the regional fund will use it for ERTMS, but, if they use it to build roads and then complain that the railways are not properly organised and too slow, then all I can say is that it is their own fault.
With this report, we have sent out the right message, and the Commission, too, is ready to do its bit, but it is now down to the Member States, to the network operators and the railway companies to make use of this co-funding.
If they fail to do so, then we will have moved a good idea forward while achieving nothing, and so let us all hope that the Member States may, perhaps tomorrow, read the reports of what we have been saying and decide, after all, to give this project proper support.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ Vice-President, first of all, I would like to use this opportunity to express to MrÂ Cramer my warmest thanks for his good cooperation, particularly in view of the technically very demanding and difficult nature of this report.
We have managed to guide the report to the vote with a great deal of speed and accuracy, and that augurs well for the future of Europeâs railways.
It is relatively clear just why this is such a pressing matter: as MrÂ Cramer has already mentioned, there are currently, in Europe, over 20 different signalling and speed monitoring systems, the cost of which is measured, firstly, in space on board, not to mention money, and also, of course, maximises to the utmost the possibilities for error and ultimately constitutes a safety problem.
There is, then, a massive obstacle to interoperability, one that certainly â as you, MrÂ Cramer, have said â makes the railway sector less competitive, particularly in view of the constant increase in traffic and the urgent need to move it from road to rail.
I hope that what we are hearing about the White Paper that is due to appear is no more than a rumour; the planned system is certainly needed.
We have been able to satisfy ourselves as to the systemâs operability; everything that has been said about its perhaps not working or about its working badly or something of the sort, is nonsense.
It works in practice; it works on passenger trains.
That is why it is of the utmost importance that the Member States should, without delay, come up with a strategy for conversion to it and for the implementation of it.
I would like to avail myself of this, my last, opportunity to point out that, in my view, ERTMS will do more to secure the social position of workers in the rail sector, in which jobs will require better skills and high qualifications, and so the further training and qualification of workers in this sector must not be overlooked.
Let us make use of ERTMS as a great opportunity for rail transport, and let us do everything possible to move the transfer from road to rail forward in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ Barrot, MrÂ Cramer, thank you for the work you have done.
You said all the right things in your report, even down to the last detail.
It is all set out very clearly.
It is a little ironic, though, that in 2006, already some way into the 21st century, we should still be debating the benefit of a single rail signalling system.
At a time when other modes of transport have made much more headway, cross-border European traffic has evidently never been that important to the monopolies.
They at any rate never poured the money into it that they should have done; nor did they come up with the ideas to move things along.
It is a little odd that we still find ourselves debating the basics where rail is concerned.
We are pleased that, during the hearing you organised, the infrastructural people were keen to apply the European rail signalling system (ERTMS).
That in itself is a success, in our view.
They could quite easily have turned round and said that they were not really interested on account of the cost and that, for the sake of those few trains that cross the border, it might be better to use lorries after all, because they can be traced by satellite.
They could have left the trains for what they were.
The enthusiasm we display does not really seem to be shared by those who should help to get things moving, namely the Member States, the railway companies and the infrastructure managers.
I am, of course, following MrÂ Cramerâs approach here, who said all the right things.
We have to consider the entire corridor, from beginning to end, down to the last mile.
There must be EU funding for the cross-border sections, and one corridor should not be singled out in favour of others.
The project must be considered in its entirety and we must keep an eye on the bigger picture.
The ultimate goal is to rig out the entire European railway network, or at least the major lines.
We will therefore need to find a little more than those EURÂ 5Â billion spread over 10 years.
The amounts involved will be of quite a different order.
I would like to see whether the railway companies and Member States are prepared to actually put that money on the table, because that bit of European funding is only a drop in the ocean.
There is no use pretending: we cannot act as if we are going to put a pile of money on the table.
One cannot expect miracles with just 1% of the Gross Domestic Product.
Member States and others refuse to face this reality and think that Europe, even if it has no money, should still be the driving force behind initiatives such as these.
Railway companies too will need to prove that the funding they have received is being spent wisely, that they will look after, and attract, customers with a view to achieving ERTMSâs main goal â namely improved use of the network â so that rail becomes a mode of transport that can compete with other modes of transport.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the past, only the differences in rail width represented a barrier to cross-border and through trains.
Since electrification, the differences in voltage and protection systems have cut the railway network up even more.
We desperately need a common electronic protection system.
It looks like a number of variations on ERTMS will become the generally applied standard in 20 to 30 yearsâ time.
The initial investments in ERTMS have been made, and many are sure to follow.
The certainty of constant growth is of huge benefit to industry.
If everyone wants to apply this system as early on as at the development stage, then this may lead to shortages and prices shooting up.
Moreover, there is every chance that at least the first software version will need to be upgraded in the foreseeable future.
People who work for the railway companies need a great deal of preparatory training before they can start using ERTMS safely.
For the time being, it mainly comes into its own as a secondary system alongside one of the 20 tried and tested systems.
In the Netherlands, this has already contributed to delays in the use of new railway sections.
Where ERTMS is applied without support of that kind, this initially leads to major delays and has, consequently, played havoc with timetables.
In Switzerland, the average train delay during the first four months was 18 minutes and only then did things gradually change for the better.
These teething problems mean that the system has not so far been hailed as a success by the interested parties.
That is why, in order to turn this project into a success, we must draw a clear distinction between the experimental initial phase, during which it can be tested selectively so as to build up practical experience, and a fully-fledged phase, at which point we can rely on it 100%.
European Union funding must focus on this experimental phase with a view to making versions 2.3.0 and 3.0.0 reliable and to possible further developments without filling the coffers of industry unnecessarily.
Until it can be fully introduced, we must make sure that the tried and tested protection systems are not neglected and prevent a further shrinkage of the railway network from becoming a means of quickly reaching good statistics with ERTMS.
The only way we can probably raise the necessary funds is to impose an extra levy on freight transport, as is the case in Switzerland.
That is why the previous decision on the Eurovignette needs to be adjusted.
Â Â  . The competitiveness of rail is being hampered by a variety of things.
The lack of a uniform safety and signalling system is one of those.
Given the role that rail is supposed to play in the logistical process, I am pleased with the attention ERTMS is now getting.
I can identify with the essence of MrÂ Cramerâs report, which covers most relevant aspects of ERTMS, and I share his view that ERTMS is an instrument that can help rail move forwards into the future.
Current services are hindered by barriers that prevent competition with other modes of transport.
Some of those barriers can certainly be attributed to the historical relations within and outside the railway sector.
The existence of nationally-geared protection systems is without a doubt part of this.
This fragmentation hinders the development and implementation of crossÂ border transport and thus adversely affects the competitiveness of freight transport by rail.
Since the introduction of ERTMS can cancel out this negative aspect, it is important that the transitional period between the current systems and ERTMS be kept to a minimum in order to restrict additional costs and functional discomfort as a result of the use of the dual systems.
It is also important that we should have an ERTMS version that works adequately at our disposal.
That is the case at the moment, and I hope that all those involved will make the effort to have an economically justified and technically up-to-date system in operation, now and in future.
An important topic during our discussion was the financial aspect of the introduction of ERTMS.
Both in the Community, in the Member States and among railway companies, only limited resources are available.
It is therefore necessary to weigh up carefully how they should be used.
In that context, my group has proposed a number of amendments, which emphasise that, in terms of projects, we should back clear favourites and maturity, both politically and economically, so as to make maximum use of the means available.
I am also aware of the interest in this system from outside Europe.
This represents prospects for industry and more employment.
It strikes me as impossible at the moment, though, to make exact predictions about the expected effects on employment.
Hence an amendment to exercise caution in that respect, which is also true of the beckoning prospects.
For the rest, I am pleased about the attention that is being devoted to the importance of the full participation of those involved, namely the Community, Member States, industry and railway companies.
The development, introduction and implementation of ERTMS equipment can only be a success if everyone does their bit.
Finally, I should like to thank MrÂ Cramer for his work and the sound cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, and express the hope that all those involved will back the processes that have either been set in motion or that are yet to be embarked on.
Â Â  Mr President, we, in the EU, have for a long time been working to balance the relationship between road and rail, with regulations on the treatment of HGV drivers and train crew under social security and labour law, with injections of support and finance for rail traffic, with tolls and other levies for heavy road traffic, and, last but not least, with technical regulations on intermodality and interoperability.
Most recently, by means of Marco Polo I and II, we made a direct attempt at supporting more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, and now, with NAIADES, we are attempting to create new opportunities for internal shipping.
All things considered, though, we have not really had much success with this.
On the contrary, the gap has widened.
In freight transport, rail is continuing to lose out to road, so perhaps we will, in fact, soon see our dream melt away; after all, according to media reports today, the Commission will shortly be changing strategy and abandoning its policy of pro-active transfer from road to rail.
Whatever the truth of those reports, we must continue to do everything in our power to equip railways and upgrade their technology.
The new magic formula in this is âERTMSâ, which is intended to help make train systems mutually interoperable, so that perhaps, even if a long way down the line, rail will be given a new chance.
We worked together on the Cramer report in order to find a common solution, and â as MrÂ Cramer rightly emphasised â we succeeded in this, so let us congratulate the rapporteur and the Commission too on the document we have and wish railways all the best for a good and safe future.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am a staunch partisan of the European rail system, the success of which depends on three things: interoperability, funding and opening rail networks to competition.
In this report, the political centre of gravity tends to be the opening of networks to competition, in other words the market is paramount; whenever that is the case, road transport is always the winner.
I believe we actually want to focus on interoperability and find a way to finance it.
Moreover, the main issue at the present time concerning the introduction of ERTMS is how to fund it in such a way that the huge investment burden does not further handicap the railways in their efforts to compete with road transport.
From this point of view, may I congratulate our honourable colleague, MrÂ Cramer, on his report.
I am not sure that there was a need or obligation to assign priority to particular rail corridors.
On the contrary, I believe it would have been better to say that, every time a network is upgraded or a new line is opened, it must be equipped to the new standard.
I can scarcely imagine that any new line would not automatically be equipped in accordance with the new standard.
There is also, of course, a crucial question with regard to funding during the transitional period when the old and new systems have to exist side by side.
If this key question is not answered, national companies are liable to be wary.
If it is answered, Commissioner, I believe we shall win the day, and we need to win, because each of the Thalys power cars, as you said, has seven different command and control systems installed, and they also cost 60% more than other locomotives.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a comprehensive report.
In supporting him, I would like to underline that coordinated deployment of the European Rail Track Management System, a strategic part of the Trans-European Network, should be applied uniformly to all European rail infrastructures.
An effective signalling system with automatic speed control will help to avoid lethal accidents and will further improve the safety level of rail transport.
Implementation of the ERTMS will provide increased security by ensuring continuous monitoring during train operations.
It will also ease the strain on the roads and shift transport flows to the railways.
The ERTMS is superior to national systems because it is cheaper as far as new acquisitions and maintenance are concerned and safer at all speeds.
I agree that the old systems and the ERTMS should not exist side by side for too long.
The transition to the new system should be as quick as possible.
The 20 different train protection and signalling systems that still exist today should be replaced by a single system in all EU Member States in the near future.
The sooner trains are equipped with European train control systems, thus allowing them to travel on major interoperable corridors, the sooner it will be possible to make savings on maintenance costs and eliminate costs associated with the use of multiple systems.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unanimous adoption of the Cramer report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism basically tells us two things.
The first is what you, Commissioner, and the Members who have already spoken have stressed, which is that the rapporteur has done some excellent work, and therefore the thanks that we owe him are far from being a formality.
The second point is that, although the concerns and the emphases may vary, I feel that there is broad awareness of the fact that we may be facing the implementation of a system that appears to be a genuine industrial project of excellence for Europe.
That is what we need for the transport sector, and also in general to increase our competitiveness in the right direction, namely towards safety and improved quality.
I shall confine myself to highlighting a few needs, which are already in the report but which I feel are worth pointing out.
The first is that MrÂ Savary is certainly right in saying that the new system should include everything that is new.
At the moment, however, as we are faced with the financial difficulties that we are all aware of, I think we should support the installation of the system at least along the main corridors that the European coordinator, MrÂ Vinck, has examined and proposed to us as the first step towards overall coverage.
I should like to point out that the timing and procedures need to be right for the migration of the whole European network and for the current standard to be maintained, thus guaranteeing compatibility with future technical specifications.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like warmly to congratulate MrÂ Cramer on the exhaustiveness of his report, which deals in a skilful and in-depth manner with all of the problems that we need to overcome in order to achieve full interoperability and facilitate the removal of rail borders.
We must also accept that the vote in committee â I believe â improved his initial proposal, by extending it and making it less restrictive, amongst other things acknowledging the efforts of those countries that are already applying it.
I am talking about countries such as my own, Spain, where forty years of dictatorship left us completely isolated â as is currently the case with the Baltic countries which are historically linked to Russia, also by a railway of a different gauge â as a result of a different gauge of track, in addition to problems with mountains.
The enormous efforts that we have had to make in Spain in order to renew our rail network with European funding have led us to directly apply the European signalling and speed control systems, which we are currently discussing.
It seemed natural to the Spanish to overcome our historical backwardness and to allow ourselves to be led by our Europeanism, opting clearly for an integrated system such as the ERTMS, which represents the future of the railways.
In fact, I am delighted because over recent weeks â and I hope that the delegation from the Committee on Transport and Tourism that will visit my region next week will be able to see this â we have managed to overcome and resolve a technical problem involving the ERTMS, which has meant that we have been able to reduce the distance enormously and make passenger transport by rail in Spain even more attractive.
In the future we will clearly have to resolve certain problems relating to goods transport by rail, such as level crossings with barriers.
Â Â  First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur MrÂ Cramer for the positive outcome we have ended up with.
It was not easy, given the sensitivities surrounding this issue.
The compromise amendments that were eventually approved are very important.
One of the points of discussion springs to mind, namely whether or not one corridor should be singled out.
Eventually, we decided in favour of six main railway corridors.
That is important, because we are thus sending out the message that they all count.
Whether progress will be made or not will depend on the efforts and willpower of the Member States and companies involved.
ERTMSâs ultimate aim must be for it to be universally applied, because a single European railway market cannot become competitive compared to other modes of transport if we continue to apply more than 20 different signalling systems.
That means, indeed, that we must tackle entire sections rather than opt for a piecemeal approach.
The main problem remains, of course, as most fellow Members have already mentioned, the funding of ERTMS, as well as that, moreover, of the other trans-European networks.
That is why we must be creative and extract funds from, for example, the Cohesion Fund and, possibly in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, collect additional funds.
These resources should at any rate be distributed evenly, but should also be spent wisely and effectively.
I wish the Commission and the ERTMS coordinator much success in this difficult balancing act.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate centring on MrÂ Cramerâs excellent report.
I shall restrict myself to four remarks.
The first expresses my utter astonishment at MrÂ Rackâs allusion to a change of strategy, suggesting that we have not always been determined to give priority to rail, which, as we know, has a number of advantages in a context of energy and environmental problems.
I refer MrÂ Rack to the White Paper that will be presented next week; anything other than what is set down there is sheer speculation.
My second remark is this: there is undoubtedly a need to offer incentives, involving significant cofunding by the European Union, in order to ensure that the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is deployed.
MrÂ Savary has emphasised the risk of penalising the railway system.
This is why we opted for 50% cofunding of the introduction of ERTMS.
Time will tell, but for my own part I believe it is a good motivating factor.
Thirdly, while it is true that the specifications of such a system are always open to improvement, it can be said today that the system works.
The Rome-Naples route in Italy is not behind schedule and has been operating very well since the end of 2005.
What we can say is that the current version of the specifications already suffices to guarantee interoperability and can therefore be used in calls for tender. Even though ERTMS will have to be perfected, there is no reason, on the basis of the present specifications, to postpone the installation of ERTMS.
My fourth remark concerns the corridors.
It is true that the Coordinator selected corridors with a view to obtaining a clearer picture of the costs and benefits of deploying the system and trying to encourage the various players to work together.
That, however, does not predetermine the inclusion or exclusion of particular corridors.
The Commission, acting in accordance with the Financial Regulation, will favour the best projects and the corridors that will be capable of providing high-quality projects within an appropriate time frame.
These are the remarks with which I wanted to accompany my thanks to Parliament and its rapporteur for this excellent contribution to a policy which is essential if we want tomorrowâs railways to become a European rail system and a rail system with the potential to relieve the road network.
That is really the crux of our efforts, and I am delighted with the contribution of Parliament, to which I extend my heartfelt thanks.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by SeÃ¡n ÃÂ Neachtain, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on inshore fishing and the problems encountered by inshore-fishing communities [2004/2264(INI)] (A6-0141/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin with , as we say in the Irish language â meaning âa few wordsâ â on the title of this report.
Following the final vote in committee I was asked if I would be prepared to accept an amendment in plenary to modify the title of the report, which refers to âfishermenâ, so as to implicitly recognise the important role played by women in that important sector.
It will not come as any surprise to you that I fully support the MiguÃ©lez Ramos/Kindermann amendment, which is totally consistent with the contents of the report and simply introduces the notion of gender equality in the title.
Like you, I learned on Monday that this amendment was inadmissible.
Like many of you I found that hard to believe.
However, you will be pleased to know that this evening the Conference of Presidents has approved the change in the title of my report.
From the outset, had I been allowed to draft this report in the Irish language, the problem would not have arisen because I would have used the word , which, unlike the English word âfishermanâ, is gender-neutral and embraces all those involved in the sector.
There is an urgent need to comprehensively address the multiple problems in the inshore fishing sector in the European Union.
This aspect of the fisheries sector is the poor relation that has been ignored for far too long.
The subject matter is vast and varied.
It concerns every single coastal Member State, in most instances in totally different ways.
That is one area of the fisheries sector where there is the odd reference, here and there, among the plethora of EU legislation, but no Community rules and regulations that specifically cater for the sector.
I believe that anomaly has to be corrected.
Inshore fishing essentially takes place in waters that come under exclusive national jurisdiction, and yet inshore fishermen, in many instances, are subjected to common fisheries policy regulations while reaping few of the benefits.
Inshore fishing is about the economic and social fabric of our small coastal communities.
It makes a vital contribution to local economies where, in many instances, there is precious little else in the way of work.
Inshore fishery activities essentially maintain the social fabric of those communities.
They are also essential for the preservation of cultural traditions and practices, which must be preserved.
And yet that sector has been ignored for far too long.
The future development of the inshore fisheries sector is dependent on social change.
It is dependent on the existence of appropriate representative bodies.
It is dependent on creating demand for improved added value produce through appropriate marketing structures.
It is dependent on resolving the economic aspects that influence operating costs.
Most importantly, it is dependent on the adoption of appropriate EU programmes specifically designed to help the sector.
The inshore fisheries sector is badly in need of development and modernisation. That includes boat modernisation, notably where safety on board is concerned.
We must devise measures to minimise the effects of the increase of variable costs that results from high fuel prices.
If that means adapting boat engines so that they can run on a high percentage of alternative fuels such as bioethenol then we must take the necessary measures to adapt boat engines accordingly.
We must do all we can to attract young men and women to the sector in order to ensure its continuity.
I fear that will be impossible if we do not implement adequate vocational training systems geared towards concerned groups of the inshore fisheries population, not least the development of marketing skills.
I believe that we must develop new ways of commercialisation and fully integrate coastal fishermen into the marketing process.
We must also enhance cooperation and communication channels between organisation and stakeholders concerned.
My report is not â as some lobbyists would believe â an attack on recreational fishing in any one Member State.
It is about the specific social, economic and environmental problems of the entire small inshore fishing sector in all Member States of the European Union.
It is about promoting sustainable fishing.
This report is a contribution to resolving problems in the inshore fishing sector, not to creating new ones.
My approach is to try to find the appropriate solutions so that different economic interests are catered for in a mutually acceptable way.
It would be incorrect for any interest group to read any other interpretation into the text.
Commissioner Borg, this report and this Parliament are calling on you to consider a new Community initiative for this important sector of activity.
The men and women involved in the inshore fisheries sector are calling on you to consider a new Community approach.
I believe that we have an obligation not to disappoint them.
Knowing your personal commitment to fisheries, I know that you will not disappoint them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Ã Neachtain, who has presented an excellent report.
I should also like to extend my thanks to the whole Committee on Fisheries for having taken up this important subject in the form of an own-initiative report.
It is clear that small-scale coastal fisheries are in many ways different from fishing activities conducted by larger boats.
Many of these differences are highlighted in the report, and I should like to mention just a few.
Small vessels stay close to the coast and mostly conduct fishing trips of a single day.
The businesses are small and mainly family-based, and in most cases only one person operates the vessel, with the maximum being not more than three.
The catches are landed and also often marketed locally, thus making this segment more dependent on the local economy.
This part of the fishing industry is fragmented and not equally represented in shipownersâ organisations.
These vessels operate in coastal areas, which are often biologically fragile, and where there is a lot of competition with other users, such as other fishing vessels or recreational fisheries and tourists.
However, I should like to stress that not all of these differences are disadvantages.
In fact, some of them are distinct advantages, such as the freshness of the landed fish.
However, it is also true that coastal fisheries have handicaps, and I agree with most of your conclusions in this respect.
I absolutely agree that it is not an easy task to define coastal fisheries, but this is exactly why I would strongly recommend basing ourselves on the definition which is used in Community legislation: vessels of up to 12Â metres not using towed gear.
This definition was agreed almost ten years ago and is a good basis for further action.
However, it does not mean that at national or local level additional criteria could not be used when defining the role of the different players in coastal fishing areas.
On the contrary, coastal management actions and plans should include further criteria depending on the specific settings of the area and the fleets involved.
Let me now turn to your specific suggestions.
Here, again, I agree with most of your proposals, and in particular the establishment by local fishermen of coastal management plans, the harmonisation of data on coastal fisheries, the improvement of training for men and women involved in this type of fishing, better coordination of all aspects affecting coastal areas and fishermen, the improvement of vessel safety and of the safety culture for those involved, the need to recognise the role of women and improve their legal work status and, last but not least, the better involvement of coastal fisheries in decision-making and representatives bodies, such as the RACs.
But this leads me to the question: who does what?
I am deeply convinced that it is first and foremost the local fishing communities themselves who have to come together, get organised and propose actions and initiatives.
Secondly, many of the aspects that were mentioned are under the responsibility of the Member States, for example education and vocational training, jurisdiction over coastal areas up to 12 nautical miles, and the control and enforcement of safety standards, etc.
However, I also agree with you that we have a role to play at European Union level.
You, the European Parliament, have started with a study, the hearing of last November and this own-initiative report we are discussing today.
The Commission has already started work too, and I have proposed specific treatment under the European Fisheries Fund, which will hopefully be adopted next week.
Among other possibilities of particular interest to coastal fishers: the proposed European fisheries fund reduces to 20% the private contribution for the modernisation of vessels for owners of smaller ships.
It gives them more favourable treatment in the conditions for engine replacement and urges Member States to give âsafety tonnageâ, preferably to smaller vessels.
I think that this is a package of better treatment for this segment, which will contribute to bringing about some of the improvements mentioned in your report.
In addition, there are several areas of the common fisheries policy where coastal fisheries are treated differently or exempted from obligations, such as the requirement to use a logbook, remote sensing and VMS requirements.
In relation to conservation, however, small-scale fisheries have to take full responsibility in the management of fish stocks, because coastal waters are often the place where fish spawn and grow in the early stages.
Before concluding, let me just mention that my services have recently commissioned an important study, which is under way at this very moment, and which will give us a new and up-to-date insight into several cases of small-scale fisheries located in different regions and seas of the Community.
The findings of this study are expected in the coming year and I am sure that they will help us to assess whether further action is needed and how to tailor it.
I take up your suggestions and, building on your valuable work, will join forces with all the stakeholders, the Member States and, last but not least, all those who make a living from coastal fisheries in order to engage in concrete action to improve the situation and the conditions for this segment of the fishing fleet.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality and I must say that the work done by women throughout the fisheries sector and particularly in inshore fishing, should be given greater legal and social recognition.
Although just 3% of women take part in extractive fishing, many women are intensely involved in the other activities relating to fishing.
With an economic structure made up mainly of small family businesses, the majority of women work very hard but have no economic or social rights, since they do not have a sufficiently clear work status, and in many cases they work in conditions that are highly prejudicial to their health.
As we state in the report, therefore, it is urgent for both the Commission and the Member States to take the measures necessary to guarantee all of these women their rights.
Furthermore, women working in this sector should have access to funding, to credits and professional training under equal conditions to men.
We must also guarantee that women participate in the decision-making, representative and advisory bodies of the communities dedicated to inshore fishing.
At a time when the sector is undergoing restructuring, significant changes are taking place that affect women directly or indirectly and both men and women must therefore take part in the search for solutions.
We would therefore like a recommendation from the Commission to the relevant bodies to the effect that they should take the appropriate measures to ensure that they contain a balance of men and women.
The lack of data broken down by gender makes it extremely difficult to seek solutions to the problems faced by women working in the sector.
We would therefore call upon the Commission, by means of the European Gender Equality Institute, to find a rapid solution to this issue.
Making these women more visible also requires using correct language to reflect the fact that there are men and women in the fisheries sector, and not just men.
I am therefore very much in favour, and we support, the proposal that the rapporteur has also just advocated to change the word âfishermenâ to âfishing communitiesâ in the title of this report.
Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow groups such as women working in inshore fisheries to go unprotected.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality calls for greater recognition of the work of these women and for solutions to the specific problems stemming from that work to be found.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on behalf of my group on his magnificent report, which could not have been produced if he had not been generous enough to accept many amendments and suggestions from other Members representing different fishing regions with very different views of small-scale fishing.
We must not forget that these vessels represent around 80% of all Community vessels and this kind of fishing is practiced in all of the coastal Member States, although in each one it has special characteristics.
It is precisely the treatment of this aspect, which seems to me to be one of the greatest achievements of the report, since it has stipulated a series of criteria, which can indeed be common to the majority of the small-scale fleet, which in some Member States is defined by length, in others by the type of processing of the fisheries product, by distance from the coast or by the duration of tides, or by a combination of several criteria.
The definition of small-scale fishing on the basis of the twelve-metre length, as in the case of Community legislation, therefore, is not in line with reality, and we hope that the Community legislation will be amended in this regard in the near future.
It is also appropriate to stress this fleetâs responsibilities and obligations in terms of the conservation of stocks, since, although they are small or medium-sized vessels, we must not forget that there are very large numbers of them and they fish in waters that are very vulnerable to over-fishing, since these areas are characterised by a high concentration of young.
I would finally like to point out that a high proportion of the fleet still has to deal with the issue of safety.
I would therefore like to insist once again that the future European Fisheries Fund must take account of the modernisation and renewal needs in terms of safety and also in terms of energy saving, with a view to alleviating the crisis faced by the fisheries sector as a result of the rise in oil prices.
I do not believe that the agreement adopted in Coreper and which is going to be presented to the Council of Ministers offers all of the measures that this Parliament called for in the Casa report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFP), in which there were many more measures which would undoubtedly make the renewal and modernisation of small-scale fisheries much more flexible.
Â Â  . Mr President, by means of this report, the European Parliament is explicitly acknowledging the fundamental contribution of inshore fishing, not just to local economies, but also to the maintenance of the social fabric of coastal communities, which are so much in need of cohesion elements.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain, on his fine idea of proposing this initiative report at a particularly sensitive time for small communities, which are facing problems that need to be dealt with urgently.
Firstly, their ancient vessels, whose modernisation we must continue to support, particularly with a view to improving the living and working conditions on board and to establishing a culture of safety, which must start with safer and more modern boats.
Secondly, the lack of young people.
I agree with the rapporteur that a Commission initiative is required in the field of training in order to encourage young professionals to join the sector.
Training must go further, however.
It must include work safety on board, the protection of resources and the protection of the sea and coastal areas.
Properly regulated inshore fishing is an essential factor in the conservation of the ecosystem.
Training must also consider improving the quality of catches, their marketing and the management of small businesses, because these issues can help small-scale fishermen to consolidate their business results and improve their living standards.
I would finally like in particular to congratulate the draftsman for the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, MrsÂ Riera, who has made very valuable contributions that have enriched the report.
Women play a fundamental role in the sector and, properly organised, they can make a significant contribution to the socio-economic development of communities dependent on fishing.
Â Â  . Mr President, we think it is a good thing that the specific problems involving inshore fishing are recognised in this report and that the Regional Advisory Councils have come up for discussion in this.
My group has two objections, though.
First of all, we would like to call attention to subsidiarity.
The differences between the regions are too significant to attempt a harmonisation process in this sector.
Also, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe feels that the EU funds should be used to promote sustainability in inshore fishing, for example by reducing fuel consumption, rather than to increase capacity.
If our amendments on those two points are not pursued, my group will be forced to abstain in this respect.
We would in any case like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that he has brought inshore fishing to our attention with his own-initiative report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain, for his initiative in highlighting the special needs and the economic and social importance of the inshore fishing sector.
It is a vitally important network of mostly small, mostly family-run businesses, which are the lifeblood of most of our small coastal communities.
Around the coast and the many islands of Scotland, it is a sector that is of the utmost importance and it undoubtedly has not benefited from the political support it deserves.
Unfortunately, though, Scotlandâs offshore fishing industry has not had a happy experience as a result of the common fisheries policy.
So there is not a great demand â to put it mildly â for new EU legislation specific to inshore fisheries.
However, support for initiatives in, for example, the fields of vessel safety, fuel economy, training and investment funding is worth pursuing at local and EU level, through the European Fisheries Fund.
In Scotland it is not just the CFP that has been bad for our fishing communities.
Over the years, the Scottish and UK Governments too have failed to support EU initiatives by cofinancing.
I hope that if, as a result of this report, we move towards some specific new programmes to assist coastal fishing, the Scottish Government will be persuaded to provide the necessary support.
Our small coastal communities have a very long history, with generations of families making a living from fishing.
I would like to see those communities returned to a state where the young and the future generations have some hope of being able to follow in that tradition.
Â Â  . â Mr President, inshore fishing, especially small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries, make a considerable contribution to the socio-economic well-being of coastal communities, both in Portugal and in other coastal Member States.
As we have pointed out, inshore fisheries make a considerable contribution to the socio-economic wellbeing of coastal communities, contributing to local development, job preservation/creation both upstream and downstream, supplies of fresh fish and the preservation of traditional local cultures.
The economic and social crisis affecting the fisheries sector is of particular concern for the less competitive fleet segments, especially the inshore fisheries.
In our view, this crisis is also associated with the guidelines and implementation of the common fisheries policies, insofar as it fails to recognise the specific needs of inshore fisheries.
Accordingly, this sector of the fleet needs support at both national and Community level.
Broadly speaking, we welcome this report.
We should like to highlight the reference to the need to acknowledge the specific nature of small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries in the CFP, to adapt the current instruments so as to meet the needs of the sector, and to continue with the granting of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the small-scale traditional fleet under the future European Fisheries Fund.
That being said, the report falls short of what is required as regards the immediate response to the problems associated with the current crisis and the new instruments needed to carry out a proper assessment of the specific nature of this sector of the fleet.
Against this backdrop, we tabled two amendments.
The first relates to the need to set up a Community programme to aid small-scale traditional fisheries, which will support specific projects and help to focus the instruments and channel funds into inshore fisheries.
The second takes account of the need for emergency measures to respond to the desperate socio-economic situation in the sector, and accordingly proposes to establish emergency transitional compensation to offset the effects of the increase in the price of fuel.
We hope that these proposals will enjoy Parliament's support.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the clarity and thoroughness of the report he has presented.
We have been highlighting the need for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries, particularly in the Mediterranean, for a long time, repeating what has been confirmed with due emphasis in the report we are debating today.
Unfortunately, the short time I have available will not allow me to examine in any depth some interesting points such as gender equality in the fisheries sector, safety on board fishing boats, alternative energy sources in view of high diesel prices, and modernisation of the fleet.
I am pleased to point out that inshore and traditional fishing â and I say this as a man from the south of Italy, who lives in close contact with the seafaring world on almost a daily basis â not only represents an extremely important source of income for thousands of European families living around our continentâs coasts, but also brings with it a centuries-old tradition that Europe must, in my view, support and preserve.
Supporting inshore fishing means, , protecting it from unregulated fishing by vessels flying the flags of third countries that brazenly carry on their activities subject to no controls and without any regard for the quantity, quality or species of the fish they catch.
Southern Italyâs fishing community has recently protested about this for the umpteenth time, this time in Bagnara in Calabria.
The European Union should not force our fishermen to accept restrictions and sacrifices while leaving non-EU fleets in the Mediterranean completely free to do as they like.
The inshore fisheries sector can and must make this important economic activity compatible with preservation of the marine environment, which is both necessary and incumbent upon us.
On these and other grounds I fully support this report.
I must particularly stress paragraphÂ 16 of the motion for a resolution, which calls on the Commission to recognise once and for all the specific nature of inshore and traditional fishing in the common fisheries policy, since it has been poorly treated so far.
Â Â  Mr President, I commend the rapporteur for his hard work in drawing attention to the needs of an often neglected sector in fishing.
In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, our sector is equally feeling the pressures identified in this report, and indeed a recent political decision to deprive the white fish fleet of tie-up aid, as compensation for losses inflicted by the cod recovery scheme closure has put added pressure on the inshore sector and on inshore fish and shellfish stock, because those denied tie-up aid are forced into the domain of that sector.
However, UK fishermenâs experience of the common fisheries policy, whatever the Conservative Party might now say, has been so negative that, in consequence and in conscience, I could not advocate what amounts to the full extension of the common fisheries policy controls to the inshore sector.
This is where I part company with the rapporteur. He thinks that the answer for the inshore sector is more Europe.
I disagree, for two reasons.
Firstly, yes, we need marketing assistance, fleet modernisation, fuel assistance, and proper recognition of the potential needs of inshore fishing, but the imposition of European harmonisation â fishing gear control, data collection, a new Community initiative â is the path, I fear, to restriction, not to growth.
Secondly, only some countries would take up the match funding opportunities which might arise in return for EU regulation and competence.
Countries like mine, the United Kingdom, would not take that up and therefore disparity in this sector across Europe would intensify, not diminish, and my inshore fishermen would have all the pain of EU regulation, with none of the gain of available assistance.
For those reasons I am obliged to say that I cannot support this report, although I readily acknowledge the genuine motivations the rapporteur had in bringing it forward.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ã Neachtain, and to welcome the Commissioner here.
I too believe that the inshore fishing community is very much the backbone of our fishing community.
However, after our experience with the common fisheries policy in the south-west of England we dread it extending its tentacles even further.
I think we have to look at the overall take of fish â not just what has been caught inshore, but also what has been taken further out to sea â because, whether we like it or not, there is a limited number of fish and the future of inshore fishing relies greatly on adding value to the fish that is caught.
When talking about inshore fishing we must also not ignore recreational fishermen and anglers, because they are very much part of the future.
We really must make the most of the fish that is caught.
Fuel prices and costs are an important factor and there again we need to look to the future.
We might not have electrical boats now, but we could in the future.
The vessels up to 12 metres long, which is what we are referring to, are quite large vessels and capable of catching a lot of fish.
So we have to be careful about the size of the nets.
That is where I disagree with Mr Allister, because we have to sustain fish stocks and ensure that the larger fish are caught and the smaller ones are left to grow.
If we do not face up to the fact of diminishing fish stocks, whatever policy we bring in will not create the extra fish that we all need.
Â Â  â I should like to join in the congratulations on MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtainâs excellent report and his consistent commitment on this issue that is so close to our hearts.
I should like to say that inshore fishing is a concept that should be defined in terms of its economic, social, environmental and technical aspects, as well as the geographical reality to which it applies.
In this regard, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Members of this House to the reality of life in outermost regions such as the Azores and Madeira, where there are no continental shelves and where the coastal equivalent is effectively the coastal banks, which are sometimes a long way from the islands, but which to all intents and purposes represent exactly what the coast close to the land represents for other continental situations.
This is extraordinarily important to us because if this adaptation does not take place, we will not be able to understand the real situation in these regions.
I would therefore strongly urge the Commission to take this into consideration.
Â Â  Mr President, the report on inshore fishing and the problems facing inshore fishermen accurately describes their current situation.
In Poland a large number of old vessels were scrapped as part of the reforms.
The limited viability of catches as well as a lack of financial resources means that it has been impossible for them to be replaced.
A large number of family businesses involved in fishing and fish processing have closed down.
At the moment, on the coast itself, it is difficult to buy fresh fish, something that used to attract tourists and holidaymakers.
There has been a significant flow of people, and young people in particular, away from the fishing industry.
The measures proposed in the report include access to cheap fuel, financial and investment aid for fishermen and family enterprises and career training and education for young fishermen and those interested in a career in fishing.
These measures can successfully counteract the marginalisation of this fishing sector.
The implementation of these measures would facilitate the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs in regions where there is currently high unemployment.
This kind of aid is important in social and economic terms and guarantees consumers the uniqueness of a local cuisine based on fresh fish.
The launch of the European Fisheries Fund is particularly important.
Adopting the report and implementing the proposals it contains will be welcomed with great gratitude by fishermen.
I would like to thank MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain for drawing up this report.
I support the rapporteurâs recommendations.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain for the work he has done in performing a careful analysis of the problems facing inshore fishing in the European Union.
The report quite rightly considers the role of women to be important at last, recognises their difficulties in operating in this sector, refers to the subject of on-board safety, and highlights the importance of professional training and the role that inshore fishing can have in protecting and conserving the coastal marine environment.
I should, however, like to mention two aspects that are important for my country, Italy, and not only for the south of the country but also for the northern Adriatic.
First, I believe that inshore resources need to be protected and that legislation is needed to ensure that fishing is sustainable and does not harm the environment.
However, the proposal to ban all fishing techniques that threaten the survival of inshore resources and the economic sustainability of the social fabric associated with fishing may well be a fair provision but it would leave many operators in difficulties, in that they would be left without work for lack of any feasible alternative proposals for a sector that is already going through a serious unemployment crisis.
Secondly, insufficient attention has been devoted to producersâ associations and the positive role that they could play in contributing to the socio-economic development of fisheries-dependent communities.
Being able to relate the management of local fisheries to local conditions and to the Member States would reinforce the principle of subsidiarity that our fishing communities would like to see in the management of inshore fishing, and would bring their problems closer to the source of solutions.
The Regional Advisory Councils themselves should encourage dialogue between the European Union and local actors.
These councils, seven of which are planned although only four have been set up, are considered neither functional nor powerful enough to manage small-scale fisheries resources, since they are only advisory bodies.
To conclude, I should like to thank CommissionerÂ Borg for the important work he has done, particularly in connection with the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy, which proposes making the various sectors involved in the management of maritime policy interact with each other.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to express my satisfaction with all the findings and proposals set out by the rapporteur and to make a number of comments.
We all know that inshore fishing is the basic economic activity in disadvantaged and isolated regions of the European Union.
For example, in Greece, inshore fishing has the largest number of boats (96% of the fishing fleet) and the highest rate of employment.
The sector needs financial support in order to replace and update the fleet.
The arrival of young workers in inshore fishing, apart from any family connections they may have, means that certain support policies need to be applied, given that even the report talks of the financial difficulties of both owners and workers and their limited borrowing capacity, factors which have an adverse impact on attracting young people to this profession.
In addition to vocational training, this policy could include specific incentives for young fishermen.
The role and contribution of women in family inshore fishing businesses needs to be acknowledged.
The European Union should help to organise inshore fishing by helping their associations to create infrastructures, move products and improve fishing methods.
It should be pointed out here that their organisation prevents them from being properly represented in decision-making bodies and at public hearings.
The active participation of coastal organisations throughout the European Union in a dialogue during which priorities and completion deadlines at local, regional and European level are determined must therefore be one of our objectives during the consultations.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtainâs report is an interesting case of the rapporteur searching for the root cause of a very complex problem, one which is not easy to assess.
This problem is that of inshore fishing.
This is because in the general sense this term still covers industrial, artisan and holiday fishing.
As is the case with any field that is hard to define and that is ambiguous, it is doomed to be marginalised and to remain outside the main current of Union funding and investment programmes, when inshore fishing in fact makes up around 80% of all sea fishing.
There is a lack of investment in the sector, it is neglected and faces great technical, social and economic difficulties.
The shortage of funding to modernise fishing equipment results in increasingly defective fishing vessels and, what is worse, cases of vessels sinking.
Everyday conditions are getting worse, and catch statistics are falling.
This popular and long-traditional fishing sector simply seems to be running out of clear prospects.
The appeal for action is thus entirely justified.
Action is needed to secure the fundamental bases of inshore fishing.
The Member States need to implement common protection mechanisms that will guarantee its existence.
These mechanisms are more effective if they take into account the specific situation of this kind of fishing and the inherent conditions, technical needs and economic framework of the relevant inshore zones.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the truly wonderful report he has prepared for us.
Inshore fishing is of great importance.
It is of economic, social, cultural and environmental importance.
It is of economic importance because it secures an income in what are often poor remote island areas.
It is of social importance because most are small family businesses and, if this type of fishing is lost, they too will be lost.
It is of cultural importance because these areas have a strong element of tradition and, if these fishermen go, a slice of European culture will be lost with them.
It is of environmental importance because this type of fishing does not damage or causes the minimum possible damage compared with other types.
We must not forget that 44% of the labour force in fishing is engaged in inshore fishing and that 75% of the fishing fleet in the European Union is engaged in inshore fishing.
These two statistics tell us a great deal.
I wish to say that inshore fishing needs to be protected and, when we say protected, we mean safe boats.
People who go out fishing must believe that they will return home safely, which is why we must support modernisation.
Young people need to be attracted to this profession because the population is aging, they need to be able to sell their products, so that middlemen do not eat up money which should end up in the pockets of fishermen and consumers, problems need to be addressed, such as rising prices and, finally, we need to make a huge effort to keep our seas clean, so that we have fish in our seas for a thousand and one other reasons.


Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for the valuable remarks they have made, and I have taken note of the various points raised.
I shall try to reply briefly to some of them.
First of all, I agree that women should be given and should take every opportunity to establish gender parity.
The Commission will do its utmost to bring this about by all available means with regard to fisheries, particularly coastal fisheries, where women are more prominent than in the other fisheries sectors.
On three specific points that have been made, the granting or otherwise of tie-up aid is a national matter and the reporting and control are aimed more at larger vessels than at smaller ones.
Smaller vessels are in many instances either exempt, or have less stringent requirements to comply with.
With regard to the specificities of inshore fisheries, I need to underline again that up to a distance of 12 nautical miles these are largely subject to Member State jurisdiction.
The EU is not really involved in the control of fisheries within the 12-nautical-mile limit, other than in exceptional cases.
I also agree that the specificity of different coastal areas has to be taken into account.
We are actually doing that in the Mediterranean proposal, and I hope that later this year I will go back to Council to try and have the Mediterranean proposal adopted.
As I said in my opening remarks, there is quite extensive provision for the promotion of small coastal fisheries in the European Fisheries Fund.
I would also like to say that, after a long and difficult balancing act, we have finally hammered out a compromise deal allowing Coreper to agree on the European Fisheries Fund, and it will now feature as an âA itemâ at this Mondayâs Agricultural and Fisheries Council.
To outline how the European Fisheries Fund seeks to attain this assistance to small coastal fisheries, first of all there is a reduction of the private contribution to modernisation of vessels for owners of smaller ships to 20%.
The European Fisheries Fund gives them more favourable treatment and conditions for engine replacement for vessels of up to 12 metres, in which case engines can be changed without reduction of capacity on a one-to-one basis.
Member States are urged to give safety tonnage, preferably to smaller vessels.
The European Fisheries Fund also allows for young fishers to be offered favourable conditions for training and the purchase of a first second-hand vessel.
The Fund can also be used for projects aimed at bringing about gender equality.
It provides for the promotion of processing and marketing, which could be beneficial to coastal communities and fishers.
The Commission will carefully examine the results of the study it commissioned earlier this year when they are available, and will decide, on the basis of the findings, what measures can be proposed next year and whether there is scope for a Community initiative on coastal fisheries.
Mr ÃÂ Neachtainâs report will also be taken into account.
However, my view is that we should not over-regulate in such a sector; we should help mainly by providing assistance for coastal fishers to overcome the handicaps that they face in exercising their profession.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â The economic and social crisis that is affecting the fisheries sector in Italy, which has been hit by management costs of over 40% and losses of income of around 25% in the last three years, is hurting the less competitive elements in the fleet most of all.
The inshore fishing industry has been hit particularly badly in that it is more affected by the highly unstable fuel prices and the rise in variable costs.
In addition to economic difficulties, the inshore fishing sector also has to face the lack of a specific legislative framework.
The European Union must take a realistic attitude and agree to adopt definitions that are not too strict.
The future regulation for the Mediterranean, for instance, should provide for adjustments to be put forward at a national level.
The Commission needs to recognise small-scale inshore fishing and traditional fishing as a special case within the common fisheries policy, while taking account of the fact that certain coastal areas, particularly in island or outermost regions, are heavily dependent on fishing and the satellite industries that it generates.
It needs to analyse how adequate the current instruments are for responding to the sectorâs needs, and it should involve representatives from the industry to a greater extent in the decision-making process.
Â Â  In Ireland, inshore fishing is an industry with special social and economic importance, providing jobs, maintaining remote coastal communities and preserving traditional cultures.
It requires skills and knowledge passed from generation to generation of families.
It is important that such an industry thrives.
The exclusion of inshore fishing from current Community legislation is creating an environment in which mere survival is questionable.
It is so important that inshore fishing be developed, making it attractive to the employment-seeking youth.
The job is generally associated with low wages and unreliability.
Many must seek further part-time work to supplement their income.
In Ireland, the Celtic Tiger economic boom has resulted in higher-paying, stable occupational opportunities for young professionals.
An issue which should be addressed concerns the sourcing of funding aid through the European Fisheries Fund for inshore fishermen badly affected by legislative or policy changes relating to their fishery.
From 2007 on, 1200 Irish salmon fishermen face the loss of their livelihood due to such legislative and policy changes.
Inshore fishermen are very vulnerable to the implications of the designation of Special Areas of Conservation.
It is necessary that provisions be made to compensate those affected by such designation.
Â Â  The next item is the statement from the Commission on LevelÂ 2 implementing measures for Directive 2004/39/EC, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID).
Â Â  .
Mr President, on behalf of my colleague, Mr McCreevy, who could not be here tonight, I should like to thank Mrs Kauppi, who has been an outstanding rapporteur in terms of her mastery of this difficult and highly technical subject and her willingness to work constructively with the Commission and all parties.
She has done a first-class job, along with Mrs BerÃšs, the chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Thanks also go to the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work.
Under the terms of the Prodi Declaration, the Commission is committed to taking the fullest possible account of Parliamentâs view.
We have more than met that obligation.
Indeed, we have incorporated around 90% of Parliamentâs amendments into the Commissionâs draft measures, which will be voted on by the European Securities Committee at the end of this month.
On all the key points we agree.
The level of institutional cooperation on this file has been exemplary.
It shows that Parliament, the Commission and Member States are able to work together in a sensible and pragmatic way in order to achieve the right result for Europeâs financial markets and Europeâs investors and consumers.
The Lamfalussy procedure, which we have all worked hard to develop over the past few years, works.
Of course it is important to agree as soon as possible on the European Parliamentâs legitimate right of call-back, which the Commission supports.
We believe that Lamfalussy procedures will serve us well in the years ahead, allowing us to adapt our legislation rapidly to keep pace with market and technological developments, while maintaining essential democratic checks and balances.
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive will intensify competition among investment firms, stock exchanges and other trading venues and improve standards of service to investors and benefit companies by lowering the cost of capital.
It will update the single passport for investment firms, allowing them to operate across the European Union on the basis of an effective single authorisation and across a wide range of financial instruments.
Aside from stimulating cross-border competition, it will diversify the range of products and services that investors can access and markets that firms can tap into.
But crucially and essentially, investor protection rules will be harmonised at a high level so that investors can feel confident in using the services of investment firms wherever they are in Europe and wherever the investment firms originate from in Europe.
Furthermore, these rules are principles-based in that they put the onus on firms to behave and to always act in the best interests of their clients.
The rapid globalisation of financial markets is an opportunity for Europe.
These implementing measures for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive mean that we are well placed to stay ahead.
Our financial markets are in good shape.
They are growing strongly and are set to grow even faster in future as the Union enlarges further, as our middle class expands and as people increasingly take responsibility for their own pension provisions.
Our common regulatory framework is more or less in place.
MIFID is the last piece of the jigsaw where markets are integrating fast.
The European financial landscape is becoming commercially more attractive.
Leaving politics aside, the potential stock exchange measures represent a vote of confidence in Europe, in our stock exchanges, our technological prowess and our regulatory system.
In the end what matters is that the cost of capital in the EU remains as low as possible overall for all EU economic actors, that European Union financial markets are properly regulated by European regulators, that European Union markets can grow strongly, that cross-border clearing and settlement costs are significantly reduced and that the European Union, through its new regulatory regime, can influence and develop strongly its financial relations with the rest of the world, using its good emerging model of regulation as its passport.
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is a key step towards positioning Europe as a global leader in financial services.
That is why the Commission is particularly thankful to Parliament for its cooperation on this vital subject.
Â Â  Mr President, we can all be very satisfied with the resolution before us.
It is based on a remarkable effort by the Commission, the European Parliament, the European Securities Committee Regulators and market players, which has resulted in the successful conclusion of the implementing measures for MIFID.
The directive itself is nothing short of revolutionary in the way it opens up investment markets in the EU and achieves better guarantees for investor protection than in previous legislation.
The implementing measures before us, which establish some 17 key provisions of the directive, represent balanced and measured regulatory arrangements for bringing these twin promises to fruition.
The procedure by which these implementing measures have been drawn up is also highly significant.
This is the first time the European Parliament has been fully involved in concluding implementing legislation at the comitology phase.
In the end, the percentage of Parliamentâs amendments scheduled to be adopted by the ESC is about 87%.
This compares highly favourably with, for example, what we obtained in the underlying MIFID directive, where that percentage was about 50%.
All the parties involved can feel justified pride in the way we managed to overcome potential interinstitutional pitfalls since, as we all know, Parliamentâs role in comitology is the topic of an often heated debate.
In fact, we are still awaiting some answers from the Commission and Council.
I should like to address special thanks, however, to the Commission for its open and forthcoming cooperation with me and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was instrumental in bringing about this very positive outcome.
I agree with the remarks made by the Commission on Monday to the effect that we have achieved something historic not only for the financial markets but also in the manner Level 2 legislation and other comitology legislation is framed.
Despite the positive outcome, I should like to mention a few points.
I am somewhat perplexed that the Commission did not accept our modification which sought to clarify the best execution obligations of investment firms towards clients when dealing on their own account.
I hope that the Commission and national regulations will interpret the resulting provision in the light of the agreement reached in the LevelÂ 1 Directive.
Furthermore, I should have liked to have seen more flexibility on the delayed reporting of large trades.
We will have to be vigilant and promptly invoke the review clause if it becomes apparent that premature reporting of large trades is harming the provision of liquidity to clients, making it more expensive or rendering EU markets less competitive than markets in other parts of the world.
Finally, I had hoped that a more modern interpretation of the business in derivatives could have been found.
It will be important to amend the Level 2 measures promptly if it becomes apparent that new clients and new markets, especially transactions using the Internet, are being disadvantaged.
The number of criticisms is nonetheless dwarfed by the overall positive result.
I should like to thank all the participants and all my colleagues who helped in this endeavour.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, you can tell MrÂ McCreevy that, here in the European Parliament this evening, we have followed the entire Lamfalussy procedure for the first time.
The European Parliament has contributed to that effort in a way which, I believe, will be commended by everyone for its quality and professionalism, and it has also defended, at LevelÂ 2, the balance between the achievement of open markets and the transparency principle we defined for LevelÂ 1.
What we have done here in the European Parliament has focused primarily on the parliamentary contribution to the proper functioning of what is known as the Lamfalussy procedure and on our reasons for hoping that the agreement on the exercise of the implementing powers assigned to the Commission will guarantee the rights of Parliament.
We also welcome the Commissionâs acceptance of a number of our proposals designed to improve the balance in the areas of transparency and consumer rights.
Lastly, allow me also to draw your attention to the content of our resolution regarding the role, powers and intervention rights as a market regulator of the Committee of European Securities Regulators, which coordinates the activities of national regulators.
The Member States must accept their responsibilities and give this body the resources that will enable it to ensure the proper implementation of this Directive, on which the efficient financing of our economy depends.
Commissioner, when we began this whole adventure, some members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs argued that, besides the market itself, we should concern ourselves with what happened further down the chain, with what are known as post-trading activities, namely clearing and settlement.
As you yourself observed, these post-trading activities are too costly today.
For this reason, although I am not one to glorify market forces, I believe that what is applied elsewhere should be applied here, namely decoupling, which ought to be a good way to reduce costs.
I hope that the Commissioner will not intervene too belatedly or too timidly in this domain, as he has indicated to some market operators.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my warm thanks to all those who took part in the preparation of this resolution and documents, especially the amendments, creating legal premises for the emergence of a united investment services market.
For me, as the representative of a small and new European Union Member State, the kind cooperation of competent and more experienced colleagues is the best proof that we can work together in an enlarged Europe and implement important reforms together.
I believe that I really must stress this.
Another thing I would like to mention is that we have to look to the future, as the rapid and ambitious development of financial markets brings new tasks every day.
I am sorry that MrÂ McCreevy is not participating in our debates today, and that neither he nor the European Commission have played much part in the current reorganisation period of Europe's financial market.
Therefore, based on experience I have gained myself, I would like to point out the things we ought to emphasise when discussing the global challenges of the world's financial market.
I feel that our strategic goal ought to be the aim to follow the development route of our own distinctive European financial market regulation model.
We need to stress this more and more as we seem lost amid aggressively expanding markets.
We have our own particular European financial market traditions and must foster these and mention them more often.
I agree with the opinion of the Commission Member that Europe now has great opportunities to become a leader in the field of financial market regulation, considering the very thorough regulation practice of the United States of America and the problems faced by states with new developing economies in the field of regulation.
What should the elements of that distinctive European model be?
First of all, we must state clearly that we will use principles-based regulation, and not strive for detailed rules-based regulation, as the former is far more flexible and means it is possible to react to changes in the global market more rapidly.
While preparing the MiFID documents, it was said that a more detailed regulation would guarantee a united approach in implementing the anticipated measures in all European Union states, but it is possible to achieve the same by better coordinating the work of supervisory institutions.
The second element of the model ought to be provisions encouraging the convergence of the interpretations and requirements of supervisory institutions.
No rules will help avoid, let us say, the different financial cultures which exist in southern Europe, Great Britain and northern Europe.
Thus, we must rely on and the experience of the northern market as we coordinate a united interpretation of legal norms.
I take a sceptical view of the proposals by the European Central Bank to create harmonised standards or proposals to provide more legal documents in order to establish the market.
We have sufficient documents; we simply ought to devote more attention to their convergence.
Clearly, in future, the financial market will possibly need its own united supervisory institution, but this is a prospect for the future and not very practical at the moment.
The third thing I would like to mention is that financial market efficiency must be assessed by taking into account the views of the end consumer, which would mean the separation of services, the disclosure of the internal expenditure of huge financial conglomerates and the management and exposure of conflicts of interest.
Â Â  â () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start thanking not only MrsÂ Kauppi, the rapporteur, but also all those, the shadow rapporteurs in particular, who have worked on this highly complex topic, for their great effort.
Once again, I have to say how deeply disappointed I am in our Bureau; today is an historic date, and on it we have been provided with evidence of how effective parliamentary participation is in the committee procedure.
Within the institutions, we â the representatives of the citizens, of the people of Europe â are actually achieving something, and, as we debate it shortly before midnight, we are enjoined to keep things brief.
This is not the first time this has happened.
I know that the Bureau and the powers-that-be are not interested, yet, all the same, I shall not tire of saying that we should concentrate on showing the public the rights that this House possesses.
At the moment, we are discussing the reinforcement of Parliamentâs rights in respect of committee procedure, specifically the Lamfalussy procedure.
In the week in which the decisive sessions are to be held, the Bureau schedules debate on it for just before midnight; no worse message could be sent about the subject.
The good thing that has emerged from this evening is that we have demonstrated that this House plays a cooperative role in dialogue with the Council and the Commission, and that this is not our fault.
I call on the Council, both this week and next, to take this positive example to heart.
We have demonstrated that we, through the procedure of our committees, can come to decisions that are more efficient, that make possible better regulation and hence also the continuation of the Lamfalussy procedure, that is to say of this Houseâs right of review, with this House notified in good time and the perspective afforded by the institutionalisation of the call-back.
We should adopt something to this effect.
I see that the gavel is about to come down; in this House, time is the most important thing.
Even so, the Commission should take care that, in the financial markets â for that is what this directive is about â there should in future come into being a European model in which the strengths of all parties are taken into account.
Â Â  MrÂ Radwan, I must point out to you that it is not the Bureau that sets our agenda but the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to support the remarks made by various speakers on this being a historic moment.
I am not referring to the time of five minutes to midnight, but to the historic moment in which we reached this sound agreement and were able to modify the proposal.
I say the proposal, because the Commission did not like that terminology, but I think this is what has been done, through the good cooperation and professionalism of the people involved.
I would also like to emphasise our adherence to the Lamfalussy procedure and cooperation between the different players in the field, and to underline what Mrs BerÃšs said about the role of the regulators and the importance of getting the tools to enforce the legislation and measures we have now adopted.
This enforcement needs tools and instruments and it is up to Member States to provide them.
The last point I want to mention is something I think we have to discuss with the Commissioner responsible, Mr McCreevy.
I hope we can invite him to the next Strasbourg session and have a debate â maybe not at such a late hour as this but earlier in the day â on the developments in the stock exchanges.
I was particularly surprised by something he said the day before yesterday in a speech in Ireland.
He compared the globalisation of the financial markets with an ocean steamer and said that the European Union is on the bridge, in control and taking the lead in this process.
We are not sure that this is in fact the case, because the Commission is not proactive in what is happening at the moment in the market.
We are keen to debate this with him.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank Parliament for the very valuable contribution it has made to the whole process.
I consider that this is a perfect example of how well all three institutions can work together to the benefit of the European financial markets.
Europe should be proud today to give itself a regulatory framework for financial markets which will put it at the forefront of the worldâs financial centres and improve the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole.
I congratulate everyone for achieving this result.
On two proposed amendments which were not accepted by the Commission â Amendments 4 and 7, to which the rapporteur made reference â I should like to say that with regard to the disclosure of the identification of the client, the Commission favours a more flexible approach.
Practices, as well as assessment of the usefulness of requiring identification, vary in Member States.
It can be an invaluable tool in the investigation of market abuse.
The Commission prefers to leave this issue unharmonised at this stage.
The Commission is not in favour of Amendment 7, which relates to deferring the publication of information relating to portfolio trades.
Our current proposal on portfolio trades is that the block regime will apply with respect to each constituent share.
If accepted, the amendment could weaken transparency requirements.
By including only one transaction for which delay is permitted in a portfolio trade, a delay for the whole portfolio would be obtained.
Finally, I am certain that Commissioner McCreevy will gladly accept your invitation to discuss this subject further with you at the next part-session in Strasbourg.
Â Â  I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 96 of the Rules of Procedure provides that our activities shall be made public, and therefore I believe that it is important to acknowledge the possible consequences of the statements made in this Chamber too.
I refer to the declaration made by MrsÂ De Keyser on Monday concerning the eight deaths in Gaza, a declaration in which she claimed â I quote word for word â that the killings were a deliberate act and that, in 1987, the first Intifada was started by a less serious incident.
Since this statement, which met with applause in this House, has been disproved by an Israeli investigation from which it turns out that the incident was probably caused by a bomb, I believe that, in our capacity as Parliament, we should be more circumspect when faced with news of this kind and wait to hear how the events actually unfolded, because, otherwise, our statements are liable to have repercussions that we do not want.
Â Â  I am sorry, but that is not a point of order.
We take note of what you say, but it is not a point of order.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0185/2006) by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud â 2004 annual report [2005/2184(INI)].
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to this report on fraud for the year 2004, we should keep in mind that the irregularities, and I stress again that these are irregularities and not fraud â since fraud usually only makes up a fraction thereof â remain relatively stable at hardly 1% of the EU budget.
It is of course interesting that within the budget there are certain shifts that may be observed over the medium term and the long term.
In this connection, we above all welcome, and can even note with pride, the fact that in recent years we have achieved massive reductions in irregularities in our biggest area, namely agriculture.
From 2003 to 2004, losses were reduced by approximately 50%, from EURÂ 170Â million to EURÂ 80Â million.
Conversely â and unfortunately â we have to note that losses from the Structural Funds have increased from EURÂ 482Â million to EURÂ 694Â million.
We can unanimously ascribe the receding figures for agriculture to the fact that the Integrated Administration and Control System is obviously having an effect.
Wherever it is applied, there are positive results; so of course we must insist even more firmly that the InAdCo System is indeed applied.
In our report we note critically that, as long as seven years after the expiry of the implementation deadline, an old Member State, namely Greece, has not yet applied it.
Of course we encourage the Commission to attend to this matter, because these methods of proceeding must be applied across the board.
The next point to attract our attention relates to pre-accession aid.
Everything that has to do with enlargement is politically sensitive, but we have to make sure that, in this area too, things are done properly in budgetary terms.
The extent of the suspected irregularities is cause for concern, but far worse is the fact that the Commission, by its own admission, does not really know what kind of irregularities these are, and consequently does not know either what is recoverable or how it may be recovered â and this in as many as 90% of cases.
In other words, the Commission is practically blind in this affair, and so we must take precautionary steps.
We know that the administrative capacities of the accession countries are indeed somewhat smaller, but I would ask Parliament and the Commission to take this into consideration in future budgets.
We do not want to pour extra water into barrels that are already full, since in the end this will cause them to overflow.
In last yearâs report on the fight against fraud we dealt with cigarette smuggling as a top priority, and we are â frankly â proud that important work has been done here by the Commission and by OLAF.
Twenty-four countries, including the new Member States, have now entered into the agreement with Philip Morris â with one exception, which we regret: Great Britain.
We would certainly like the Commission to spend the payments due from Philip Morris â in total around EURÂ 1Â billion â in a sensible way, and we think it regrettable that, so far, it has been unable to do so.
The Commission should provide concrete suggestions and initiatives for the use of this income.
We estimate that, in the EU in 2004, cigarette smuggling caused the loss of customs revenue worth around EURÂ 418Â million â and this trend is set to increase.
