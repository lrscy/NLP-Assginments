Thirdly, if the US Government continues with its policy, what specific steps do you intend to take against a third country that is violating European policy and law?
Fourthly, can you assure us, Commissioner, that you will not propose or agree to any change in the current PNR agreement, the common European visa policy, or other European policies?
Such change will lead to the unlimited violation of European citizens' personal data, a policy unfortunately promoted by the United States?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my understanding of the frustration of the Czech Republic and other non-visa-waiver countries.
However, it would be highly destructive if the Czechs were to go it alone, and we should not fall for US 'divide-and-rule' tactics.
I hope that the Commission and the Council have learned an important lesson: that a proper mandate and approval of the European Parliament is not an obstacle for negotiations but, rather, strengthens the position of the European Union.
The US should act as a loyal and reliable ally and respect EU law.
Concerning PNR, I wonder why it should be included in the memorandum of understanding at all if it is already covered by the EU-US agreement.
The ink on the EU-US PNR agreement is not even dry yet, and not all Member States have ratified it, so what else is it that the Americans want?
Has the Commission been able to establish whether the implementing measures of the memorandum of understanding are in line with the EU-US agreement and, if not, can we then assume that the agreement has become invalid?
Because, if that is the case, then the agreement no longer exists and we should engage in new talks, and I then assume that there will be codecision for the European Parliament.
With hindsight, it is even more regrettable that the Council and the Commission have accepted the EU-US PNR agreement on such vague and open terms, because it leaves much room for the US to further widen the scope of the EU-US PNR agreement.
Finally, I think the EU will only have a proper position vis-Ã -vis the United States if we speak with one voice, because if we do not - if we are divided - then our rules are made in Washington and not here or in Brussels.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the business of data exchanges between the United States and the European Union has been fraught with major problems from day one.
The debate on the transfer of passenger name records and the difficulty with the PNR agreement and its legal basis have been enough to show us that there is simply no such thing as balanced negotiations on these issues.
The US side keeps stepping up its demands and asking for more material, while the European Union finds it difficult to speak with one voice and continually resist these unreasonable requests.
These matters are arousing grave concerns among the people of Europe, particularly as regards the privacy of personal data.
They fear that their data will be misused, which is why the approach adopted by the European Union, whether on the transfer of passenger records or on visa policy, has been the focus of huge public interest.
We must not give in to the attempts being made here to create divergences between Member States, for we shall only weaken one another if we do.
Nor can we allow some Member States to be singled out by the United States for different treatment in terms of special demands and requirements.
The Commission has made two requests in this matter: besides the united approach, it especially asks for backbone, backbone and more backbone.
Constant kowtowing to the United States only leads to more onerous demands.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me say categorically that we must not permit the United States to split Europe.
The European Union must act as one, because that is the only way for it to make its distinctive mark and to carry weight on the international stage.
This applies especially to its dealings with the United States.
A single Member State naturally possesses less clout than the European Union as a community.
Nevertheless, by going it alone, a Member State can weaken the Union as a whole and indeed seriously weaken it.
Such an approach gnaws at the very core of Europe's credibility.
It virtually gives the United States a hammer, served on a silver platter, with which to drive a wedge through Europe, enabling Washington to obtain from individual states what it cannot obtain from the Union as a whole.
The negotiations between the United States and the EU that culminated in the agreement of July 2007 on the transfer of passenger name records showed that it was scarcely possible for the Union to secure US acceptance of any of its positions.
In the view of many Europeans, and in my opinion too, that agreement already lets the United States access too much information on European air passengers.
Moreover, we do not even know exactly how these data are being used or to whom they are being passed on.
The fundamental question is whether these stacks of data serve any purpose at all in the fight against terrorism.
I therefore find it downright grotesque that individual Member States are now going even further than the agreement requires and are letting themselves be drawn into a kind of horse-trading in which visa waivers are being bartered for the transfer of even more data.
That cannot be in the interests of the general public.
Citizens of these Member States would certainly be given the right to enter the United States without a visa, as other EU citizens already can, but at what cost for all of us?
No, such an approach exposes Europe to the risk of blackmail.
If the Member States do not act together and show solidarity, and if they do not nurture the cohesion of the Union, we should not be surprised if people in the United States do not take the European Union seriously.
(PT) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have five brief points to make.
First: divide and rule.
The American administration's strategy in seeking to negotiate bilaterally with EU Member States does not surprise me.
Divide and rule is an old and understandable tactic, but we cannot allow EU Member States to aid and abet that strategy.
Second: weakening of the European position.
Negotiations between the Commission and the American administration have been protracted.
It is regrettable that any Member State should decide to sign a bilateral agreement, thereby weakening the European Union's common position in relation to US demands, particularly on the eve of the European Union-United States ministerial troika to be held this Thursday in Slovenia.
Third: collapse of solidarity.
As European Parliament rapporteur for Schengen, I followed the calls for the early enlargement of the Schengen Area and the abolition of internal borders.
The demonstrations of joy just two months ago now seem to ignore the fact that we are managing a common area.
I roundly condemn this lack of European solidarity.
Fourth: the legality of the agreement.
There is a worrying cloak of secrecy over certain still unknown details of the agreement.
It will be particularly serious if it seeks to bypass the agreement between the European Union and the United States on the sharing of data under the PNR Agreement, and is particularly unacceptable if it directly or indirectly allows the United States to access European databases such as the VIS or SIS systems.
Fifth and final point: the freezing of these agreements.
I call upon the Council to reach a consensus on freezing these undesirable bilateral agreements as a matter of urgency, and call upon Commissioner Frattini and the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to bring all the instruments at their disposal to bear.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people have already said this, but I must say it again: I believe that this is a particularly serious matter.
It is serious firstly because our American allies have deliberately - it must be borne in mind that they have done it deliberately - chosen to deal separately with European Union Member States on matters which they know very well are part of the competences of the European Union, taking advantage of that to make unreasonable security demands.
It is also serious, though, from the point of view of the Union.
It is a sad sight to see the Member States lining up separately in order to be able to offer their citizens the prospect of a trip to the United States without a visa, in exchange for security measures that the Americans could not negotiate with the Union as such.
I believe that this mess is the unfortunate result of a tragic lack of political strategy on our part.
Until now, the Commission and the Council have dealt with the United States administration pragmatically, on a case-by-case basis, each time at the request of the Americans, without ever having the courage to demand real reciprocity from the Americans.
I am not addressing that remark to Mr Frattini, because I know he has tried, but he was not supported.
If I understand it correctly, given the seriousness and urgency of the situation, the Commission is now asking for an explicit negotiating mandate to ensure that the Americans comply with what they should have complied with from the outset, Community law and Union competences.
We shall support the efforts by the Commission on this point, but the Commission must not forget that it will be needing Parliament, especially when the Treaty has been ratified, because nothing that is being done now can enter into force if Parliament does not authorise it at some point.
The Commissioner should tell that to his successor, whether temporary or permanent.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as we heard earlier, the situation is untenable.
Three years after the enlargement of the European Union there is inequality between the old and new Member States and the negotiations between the European Commission and the United States on eliminating this inequality have not made much progress.
There can therefore be no objections to bilateral negotiations between the countries concerned, in particular since they do not represent a breach of any part of Community legislation.
On the contrary, the Czech Republic included EU requirements in its Memorandum so that the Memorandum was fully compatible with EU law. This is also reflected in the opinion of the Council Legal Service.
Community competence in the matter of common visa policy has not been breached either because the Electronic Travel Authorisation System that is being set up is not a visa.
It is certainly true that the US is willing to negotiate on including countries in the visa waiver programme only on a bilateral basis since it is obliged to do so by its domestic legislation.
Only countries can be admitted to the programme, not international organisations or communities.
That is the reality of the situation.
No precedent for other countries has been created.
In my opinion, the Czech Republic and other countries should and can continue bilateral negotiations with the United States.
Of course they will always be prepared to be transparent in their actions, to share information and to discuss their next step with the European Commission and with the presidency.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his realistic attitude, demonstrated in his presentation.
I would just like to warn against any outside pressure at EU level on some individual Member States that might involve political risks and discredit the image of the European Union, especially now when ratification of the new Reform Treaty is taking place in the individual states.
(NL) The Americans' 2008 tactic of divide and rule sets the pattern in transatlantic relations.
But more than anything else we should realise that ultimately we have only ourselves to blame for this.
This time the Czechs were the first to be targeted and the first to yield.
Last Thursday the Commission was unable either to deny or confirm that European law and rules had been contravened.
How bizarre is that?
When are Member States going to realise that each of them, to a greater or lesser degree, is a voice crying in the wilderness?
In political dealings with the rest of the world and thus with the US it is crucially important that Member States should speak with a single voice.
Transatlantic relations are indisputably very important, but none of the EU Member States - however loyal - is ever going to become the 51st state of the US union.
This has to stop.
The ball is in Europe's court.
And quite frankly I am furious that the Council is not represented here in the House at the moment.
That shows a total lack of understanding of what urgency means.
Madam President, as others have said, this memorandum of understanding is illegal under European Community and EU law, which confers competence on the Community or Union for visa policy, key aspects of anti-terrorism and security policy and transfer of passenger data.
It must surely be illegal for the Czech Republic to transfer to the US any information from common EU databases, such as the Visa Information System.
But, almost more importantly, it is politically disastrous.
Some of us learnt early last year on a visit to Washington how damaging the bilateral lobbying efforts - not only those of the Czech Republic, by the way - were to the attempts by the Commission and Presidency to present a united front in the interests of the whole EU.
But no, some Member States just could not get it.
Sure, I understand the frustration of countries whose soldiers are fighting and dying alongside Americans, not only in Afghanistan but, controversially, in Iraq, at the fact that their citizens are suspected of terrorism when they want to visit the US.
There is an irony in there somewhere.
But how stupid to fall into this 'divide-and-rule' trap!
This is so far from being in line with EU aspirations to have weight in the world that it causes one almost to despair and exposes the Council as a whole to ridicule.
Like Ms Hennis-Plasschaert, I note that they are not here to answer that charge tonight.
(SK) Slovakia, as well as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and some other EU Member States have long been struggling, just like the Czech Republic, to get on the list of countries that will not need a visa to travel to the United States.
Any progress in the journey towards the abolition of visas is very important for our citizens because it means achieving equality for all EU citizens.
I trust that both the Commission and the Slovenian Presidency will realise that a legal action against the Czech Republic, taken because the country signed the Memorandum of Understanding with the US, would not be a good signal from Brussels just when the Lisbon Treaty ratification process is under way.
I am in favour of adopting a compromise between a single EU approach and rules according to which the Member States could also engage in bilateral negotiations with the US.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, let us remember that, with the exception of Slovenia, all citizens of the new accession countries travelling to America must obtain a visa.
Unlike other Europeans, these citizens must queue at American embassies and pay substantial sums, and for years they have been waiting in vain for the Union to support their efforts for inclusion in the visa waiver programme.
Among the old Member States, only the Greeks are in the same situation.
It is true that the European Union has long been in discussions with the United States on this issue and that, especially following the expansion of the Schengen area, the officials in Brussels have stepped up the pressure on the Americans to include the new Member States in the visa waiver programme.
However, four years have passed since our accession and nothing has happened so far.
That is why the Czech Republic has decided to go it alone and grant its citizens their wish.
The Memorandum signed between the Czech Republic and the US must therefore be seen as a contribution to collective efforts to give all members of the Union the same rights.
Let us remember that this step is fully in accordance with EU law and no one should dispute it.
(DE) Madam President, we also discussed this issue in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and there is no one on that committee who does not sympathise with the situation in which the new Member States find themselves, particularly with regard to visa policy and bilateral dealings with the United States.
Yet there are also older Member States - Greece was mentioned in this context - which are similarly waiting for a change in US visa policy.
No one, then, is questioning their right to break ranks, but we must ask whether what is legal is necessarily legitimate.
In this case it is not legitimate, because it undermines a united approach on the part of the European Union and thereby obstructs the conclusion of an agreement that would apply to the whole territory of the European Union.
A step-by-step approach is essential.
We have just managed to deal with the new members' accession to the Schengen Area.
The next step is to consider how we can obtain a general arrangement on the visa issue.
One final word: I find the threat with the Treaty of Lisbon utterly disgraceful.
(CS) Allow me to elaborate a little on the debate held here a few minutes ago.
It was said many times that we, meaning the European Union, must pursue a single and common approach when dealing with the United States.
This is what the whole issue seems to be about as far as most speakers are concerned.
It is not about individual benefits for individual members of individual Member States: it is about a common anti-American policy.
Let me tell you that for the overall majority of Czech citizens the visa waiver programme represents the symbolic final touch to the historic occasion of our return to the fold of democratic countries.
I also want to assure you that the process of visa waiver ratification by the Czech Parliament will be much quicker than the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty.
Madam President, like many colleagues, I also think that the unity of the European Union is very important, not only in visa policy but other issues related to the United States of America.
I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner specifically: do you think that the US is now demanding from those Member States who are trying to independently negotiate a visa waiver programme different levels of requirements based on other reasons than security?
Do you think that the US is playing EU Member States against each other and trying to use other issues also linked to the matter?
Or is it just security concerns from the US side?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions.
As freedom of movement is, in my view, a fundamental right of our fellow European citizens, which we recognised by enlarging Schengen, the first thing that has to be said is that the European Commission and the European institutions must work towards an absolute and not a relative result.
All the citizens of all the Member States must be allowed to travel to the United States without a personal visa.
That is our clear objective and, as a result, I understand the apprehension and concern and also the unease of some Members from Member States which have been in the European Union for many years, such as Greece, or have been members for four years.
A first aspect has to be clarified, however, if we are to have a fair picture: it is not true that we have achieved no results!
Our work at a European rather than a national level has provided significant results, very recently with Canada, for instance.
I visited Canada last year, at a time when none of the new Member States were included in the visa waiver programme with Canada.
Twelve months on, they all are.
We have agreed a system of parity of treatment with Australia, with the result that there is no discrimination between the old and new - in inverted commas - Member States of the European Union.
We have yet to achieve such results with the United States, it is true, but I should like to remind Members who spoke of four years, that is to say the date on which they entered the European Union, that the United States changed its law less than a year ago, in August 2007.
It is only since that date that the United States has said that it is willing to extend the visa waiver programme.
It is not therefore possible to speak of four years, leaving aside the fact that negotiations with the United States date back even further, but of less than 12 months of negotiations on the basis of a new law.
What we negotiated before, on the basis of a law which has now changed, is obviously no longer of any relevance.
In my view, we must work with the United States to bring all European citizens within a regime where they do not need personal visas, without some Member States thinking that they can achieve such a result before the others.
I say that very frankly.
Why?
Because that would give the upper hand in negotiations to our interlocutor, in this case our American friends, who may well be our friends and allies, but are nevertheless conducting negotiations, and will press on with those negotiations if they find any weaknesses in Europe's house.
We must ensure that we do not show any weakness: that is the point and we must be very clear about it.
You will remember that when I presented the Europe-United States PNR agreement to this House, an agreement which some criticised and others welcomed, I said that the agreement would place Europe in a stronger position vis-Ã -vis the USA.
I should now like to say that those who supported the European PNR were right, because one of the key points of the mandate that we are requesting is that there can be no exchanges of data and information over and above what is provided for in that agreement, and if such requests were to be made, the European Union would reject them.
Therein lies the proof that such a European agreement makes up for the weak position of Member States from which further data have been requested - and there is no doubt that they have been requested - as well as access to databases which belong to us, to Europe.
As a result, however, of that agreement which some criticised and others supported, we can now tell our American friends very clearly that it is not possible to go beyond the European PNR agreement.
That is a sign, in my view, of strength and not of weakness.
We already know what can and cannot be done.
Our regulations, European laws and the agreements that we have signed and initialled set that out.
In that respect, it is obvious that Europe has to speak with a single voice when tackling these issues, and it is also obvious that the 'divide and rule' approach is the most mistaken approach of all from a European point of view and is an approach which we must resist and which the Institutions obviously have to oppose.
Why, however, are we discussing this issue in this House today?
Because even though there are clear laws, even though there are detailed agreements, there has been a temptation, if I may put it that way, to jump ahead.
A temptation which may be politically comprehensible to the citizens of those countries involved, but which is not institutionally acceptable.
It is for that reason that we have had to react, obviously in a spirit of solidarity with all the Member States, including those aspiring to enter the visa waiver programme.
What have we done?
We have asked Coreper, that is to say the ambassadors of the Member States, to agree on a baseline document.
We consider that document to be a red line: it reiterates what can and cannot be done.
We have also asked the Member States to ensure that any political negotiations abide by that red line, that key point, and have reiterated, for instance, that exchanges of information over and above those for which the European agreements already make provision cannot be agreed to, and that issues such as the return of 'overstayers' have to be negotiated at European and not at national level.
Matters of a kind that, frankly, it would not have been necessary to reiterate had there been a formal mandate.
We have done so for the sake of clarity, to say once and for all that we understand the concerns of the Member States which are not at present in the visa waiver programme, but that the rules of the European Union take precedence over those concerns.
Were we to call that into question, even once, it would set a precedent that would be followed by many more, each more dangerous than the last.
In conclusion, Madam President, we are working this week to propose a negotiating mandate to the US that will make it very clear that all the Member States, unanimously, even the representatives of the Czech Republic and Estonia, have agreed that the baseline cannot be overstepped in individual negotiations.
Are there margins for individual negotiations?
Yes, certainly, in areas for which Europe is not competent, that is obvious.
However, for all those issues for which Europe is competent, and they are the overwhelming majority, the Member States are giving us a unanimous mandate; that, I may say, is a line that the Slovenian Presidency is absolutely determined to follow.
Tomorrow I shall ask the Commission for a formal mandate to inform the United States of our line and, as regards that line, there can be no concessions or retractions.
Mr President, as often in these debates I find that we do not get an answer to our questions.
I put a very precise question to the Commissioner: whether he has been able to establish if the implementing measures regarding the PNR part of the memorandum of understanding are in line with the EU-US agreement, and, if not, does that mean that the agreement would be invalid?
The Commissioner said that some Members opposed the agreement and others endorsed it.
I would like to remind him that when we passed a resolution in this House last year in July, it was passed with near unanimity and it called the agreement substantially flawed.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief.
I thought I had made myself clear, but let me reiterate: there will be no implementing rules, contrary to the document approved by Coreper and the mandate that I shall request.
There are no implementing rules as yet, because the Czech Republic has agreed to our request not to present implementing rules until a common European position has been found.
We have found that position and the government of the Czech Republic will abide by it.
The debate is closed.
Data protection and consumers' rights (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on data protection and consumers' rights.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to begin by pointing out that Directive 95/46/EC (the 'Data Protection Directive') applies to data controllers established in the Community.
It also applies to controllers not established on the territory of a Member State when such a controller uses equipment situated on the territory of a Member State, unless such equipment is used only for purposes of transit through the territory of the Community.
The Directive ensures rights to all individuals, whatever their nationality or place of residence and regardless of whether they act as consumers or not.
It lays down substantive provisions imposing obligations on data controllers and recognising the rights of individuals.
It also prescribes sanctions and appropriate remedies in the event of breaches and establishes enforcement mechanisms to make them effective.
We follow closely developments in technology and associated challenges, in particular those relating to the protection of privacy and personal data.
As far as transatlantic cooperation is concerned, we maintain regular contact with the United States authorities responsible for monitoring safe harbour - the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission - in the context of which questions relating to the protection of personal data are addressed.
Issues posed by new technologies and their worldwide deployment are also examined.
In this particular case, which is the merger of Google and Double Click, the case is still being analysed by the Commission in order to decide whether the envisaged merger is in line with Regulation 139/2004/EC (the 'Merger Regulation').
We will adopt a decision soon.
However, it can be said that the Commission has carried out an extensive analysis of the economic aspects raised by the proposed merger in order to determine whether it is compatible with common market rules.
Companies are required to comply with national data protection laws implementing the Data Protection Directive, and national data protection authorities are the bodies responsible for enforcing compliance by those entities which process personal data within their territory.
A merger between different entities does not exonerate the parties to the merger from their obligations under national data protection principles.
Indeed, any decision the Commission may take to approve a merger is without prejudice to the obligations imposed on the parties by Community legislation on the protection of privacy with regard to the processing of personal data.
Irrespective of the approval of the merger, the new entity, in its day-to-day business, will have to respect the fundamental rights recognised by all relevant instruments, including, but not limited to, privacy and data protection.
National data protection authorities are therefore charged with the task of ensuring this compliance and, if necessary, taking appropriate measures to enforce compliance.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Internet is a great boon.
None of us can imagine working without this new technology today. It also permits exchanges of data on a staggering scale.
Nothing, however, is perfect, and the imperfections become clear when billions of file records are stored over long periods of time.
On the case under examination, Commissioner Frattini made it clear that the legal framework of the European Union had to be activated to examine the merger of Google and DoubleClick.
We shall await the findings of that examination and then draw our political conclusions.
This does, however, beg the basic question as to how we deal with data protection on the Internet, because user companies, large or small, are not indifferent to the way in which their data are protected.
There are no easy answers, because at the heart of this issue is the unanswered question whether an Internet Protocol address constitutes personal information.
In the case of providers that allocate static addresses it does, but with a multitude of other providers the IP address does not automatically reveal the user's identity.
In such cases, we believe there is actually a net loss of data protection, because collected data can even be disclosed to third parties.
Whether legal rules are needed must always be judged in the light of necessity and proportionality.
Users, of course, obtain a host of benefits by publishing their data.
The crucial point is that they take a conscious decision to pass on their data and that they can determine how the said data may be used.
This means that users must have information rights, that is to say the right to be told what data pertaining to them are stored, and there must therefore be clear rules governing the transfer and sale of data to third parties.
For this reason, we should begin with voluntary commitments, ideally adopting a transatlantic approach - because we simply cannot regulate the Internet in the absence of common global initiatives - and if the voluntary commitments prove inadequate, we shall then have to discuss legal measures too.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, when ordinary users go online, they are unaware that their most sensitive personal data, such as their political and philosophical beliefs, finances, purchases, travel and interests generally, are recorded while they perform simple searches, make purchases or take part in discussions.
Indeed, private companies collecting such data are often not even European.
Today neither European laws nor international agreements prevent large private companies from using our personal data.
I would go so far as to say that nothing prevents third-country security authorities from accessing such data.
Why does Europe have the responsibility and potential to become involved in this?
Because, as Mr Frattini rightly said, the Data Protection Directive applies to electronic and Internet service providers within and outside Europe.
Our personal data does not lose its importance and interest simply because a company is outside Europe.
I have three specific proposals, Mr President:
Firstly, private citizens themselves really must be called on to give their express consent to any collection, let alone use, of their personal data as, in any case, the directive I have mentioned stipulates.
This must be posted not in small print, but clearly and explicitly.
At present, even those citizens wishing to delete their data or prevent it from being shared with third parties are usually unable to navigate their way around confusing web pages.
Sites are designed to be complicated, so that companies using special tools and software can later discover the users' interests and sell them products, or so that the security authorities can subsequently locate users for other reasons.
Secondly - and I am glad Mr Frattini has said this - the European Commission really must understand that the mergers of those companies are important in terms not only of financial analyses, but also of citizens' personal data, which is probably being abused by others, or could be in future.
We are not merely a community of money and markets; we are, first and foremost, one of values.
Thirdly, Mr President, allow me to conclude: today's discussion opens up a very broad topic the surface of which we have barely scratched, although it concerns a worldwide problem.
An international Charter of Fundamental Rights for Internet users is needed.
Nothing of the sort exists at present.
In this day and age, however, Big Brother will not appear, Mr President, because some dictatorship puts him there. Big Brother will do so because our whole lives are now recorded in the form of electronic traces on the Internet.
If all of us together cannot find some basic principles to protect us, we shall wake up tomorrow to a very different and, I believe, far nastier world, however user-friendly, enjoyable and magical everything may seem to us today.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) I would have liked really to see Mr Frattini's colleague Mrs Neelie Kroes sitting alongside him today, because I think the strict differentiation between market rules and privacy rules is outdated.
We know that the merger between Google and DoubleClick is going to happen and of course the European Parliament does not want to meddle in the details of that merger, but we do want to know what guarantees of privacy will be given.
Personal data have become big business.
Information on clients, users and their habits and preferences gives companies an invaluable competitive edge.
So the protection of personal data should no longer be viewed in isolation from competition policy.
The Commission has opted for a very traditional approach to competition which is no longer adequate to deal with 21st-century behavioural advertising.
Competition must include privacy and consumer safeguards if mergers are going to result in mega-concerns that hold a lot of information on their users, as is the case with Google/DoubleClick, for example, or would potentially be the case following a tie-up between Microsoft and Yahoo, Yahoo and Rupert Murdoch, or Reed Elsevier and ChoicePoint, etc.
Personal data can be misused to exclude newcomers from the market and the point is that in a healthily competitive situation the consumer can insist on privacy, companies can be disciplined by consumers, as happened with Facebook, for example.
And we have rules for media concentrations too.
So why do we not include privacy protection in competition policy?
IP addresses can be regarded as personal data.
And that has potentially far-reaching implications for the industry, but for the user too.
So European, but above all international, standards are urgently needed for this sector.
The European Union must give a lead here and work on this whole issue with America, in consultation with the industry.
I thus suggest that this be placed on the agenda for the Transatlantic Economic Council.
Lastly, it is in the interest of businesses too that people should feel confident that their privacy is properly safeguarded.
Just now I mentioned the case of Facebook, where consumers used their muscle to make Facebook more careful about privacy.
So I would urge the European Commission to take a different approach which combines competition policy, consumer protection and the protection of personal data or privacy into a single whole.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we are concerned about a merger which is not really a merger: it is the union of two complementary undertakings. One undertaking, Google, which has a myriad of data, more data than anyone in the world, and another undertaking, DoubleClick, which has the capacity to process those data on consumer habits, manipulate and channel them.
This matter should be of concern to the European Commission because it is a dangerous marriage for the citizens of Europe, and for the privacy of our daily habits.
The structure of the merger may endanger that privacy, yet the national authorities do not have the capacity to know how those data are being manipulated, and neither will consumers know where their data are going or how they are being used by third parties.
. - (SV) Mr President, the consumer is defenceless on the Internet.
If you want to use popular services, you cannot select the option 'do not collect data on me'.
Nor can you find out what happens to your data.
You do a search, you buy something.
If one and the same company is able to combine all that information, it can gain an enormous marketing advantage and amass a wealth of information on all those who use the Internet.
The same applies if you want to download a film legally on the Internet. Then you have to use the software of a single company, i.e. Windows.
We cannot protect ourselves against these large companies unless our legislators help us.
How flimsy data protection can be becomes apparent when, for example, the fight against copyright infringements is also factored in.
A file sharer gets his computer searched and all his private information perused.
This information is then sent to media companies in order to establish what was copyright-protected and what was not.
When media companies have access to police investigation material, how can you protect consumers?
It is time data protection was given a powerful boost.
(DE) Mr President, I must admit that I like this 'catch the eye' arrangement, particularly the part before the countdown starts.
We undoubtedly have much to discuss in the realm of data protection.
Some members from the Greens Group addressed the subject of data pertaining to private businesses and individuals.
Mergers like the one between Google and DoubleClick certainly do raise some questions.
Nevertheless, care should be taken not to confuse one thing with another.
However many frogs croak, the result will only ever be a croaking sound.
What I mean is that we should not forget the need to understand the underlying technical processes too.
We - and my political group is certainly no exception - often take a particularly close interest in matters relating to the Internet and, of course, data privacy and frequently respond to them in a highly emotional way.
If I am to grasp how the Internet and data capture work, however, I must first understand the underlying technology.
In this respect, I believe there is much to be said for Mr Weber's approach of ascertaining first of all the extent to which IP addresses might constitute personal data within the meaning of Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications, for in some cases the IP address in conjunction with user data certainly can be the key to the collection of personal information.
On the other hand, given the state of technological development today, when fridges, for example, can automatically retrieve recipes from the Internet, the question whether the IP address of my fridge truly constitutes personal data is obsolete.
(DE) Mr President, as the previous speaker rightly mentioned, the technical background to these rules has to be examined.
We have a case here that is somewhat awkward in that it does not fall entirely under the heading of competition law, and yet it involves overstepping a critical mass, which poses serious problems.
At the end of the day, it will be more than difficult for national data-protection authorities and data-protection legislation to deal with any infringements arising from this merger, because the data passed on to DoubleClick will be further processed in a completely different way.
We have a technical difficulty here that we must resolve.
I believe that the accumulation of so much potential in the hands of one group is extremely bad for the market, because it excludes new competitors.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also believe that the concerns expressed by many speakers are concerns that we all share, in the sense that we do not as yet have a satisfactory system for protecting personal data as far as the new technologies and the Internet are concerned.
The same attention, possibly even more, has to be paid to protecting personal data during a counter-terrorism investigation as it does when my personal data are revealed not to a court, but to a private industrial group.
These are therefore serious concerns and, obviously, although relatively new, the idea that Mr Lambrinidis has put forward of a sort of world data protection map is completely in line with the global nature of the Internet.
As you know, and as I have just pointed out in my introduction, the existing rules are applied with reference to the territory in which a particular provider is established, but this geographical limit is not really in keeping with the Internet.
That is therefore the direction in which I believe our work should be moving, and I also believe that it is important to find a link between competition aspects and aspects of policy to protect consumers, including their personal data.
This is something about which we are only beginning to talk and, as you know, the Commission is following developments in many spheres of data protection that are not covered by European legislation. These include initiatives by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the International Conference on Data Protection.
Nevertheless, there is a risk that we have to keep in mind.
Let me put the following question: might a world data protection map not weaken protection as it would have to cover an extraordinarily large number of people?
If anything, that makes it clear that we have to consider our European legislation as an example - if I may be so bold - to be exported and not accept weaker data protection rules solely because those rules are to be applied in a much broader geographical context.
In conclusion, I can tell you that in order to set practical work in motion, the so-called 'Article 29 Working Party', of which all those involved in this work are aware, and which is a Working Party responsible for coordinating data protection measures, is preparing a reasoned opinion on data protection in relation to search engines and service providers.
In other words, we are tackling this aspect, and a questionnaire that will provide a starting point for this reasoned opinion has been sent out; the questionnaire covers data protection policies and has been sent to a very large number of senior figures, search engine managers and service providers.
My view is that that the responses gathered and the opinion which, I am sure, will be published as swiftly as possible, hopefully before the summer recess, could perhaps for the first time provide a coordinated answer as to the problems involved and the directions that work should take.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) Nowadays more and more European citizens use Information Society services, be it financial services, intelligent transport systems, taxation systems for road infrastructure usage, computerised systems for healthcare, the Internet, surveillance and monitoring cameras, or use of biometric data.
The security and safety of such services is vital for user confidence.
The security of electronic networks and computerised systems along with technologies for enhancing personal data protection are the main concern of the Strategy for a Safe Information Society, adopted by the Commission in 2006.
In a Communication dated May 2007 the Commission presented , the potential risks related to the use of information technology, such as identity theft, surveillance or even fraud.
In order to achieve a safer Information Society the specific products and services should include mechanisms for data protection even from the design stage.
Likewise, it is necessary that the processes and principles applicable to providing security in the Information Society be defined and accessible to all those involved in the design, operation and use of computerised systems.
I ask the Commission to examine the necessity of certain Community regulations on the security of electronic communication services and computerised systems.
Any supplier of services specific to the Information Society must observe the national and international legislation on data protection.
Common rules in the field of civil aviation security (debate)
The next item is the report by Paolo Costa, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 -.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are today celebrating the conclusion of a procedure that started as far back as September 2005.
The road that we have travelled has been long and in some cases difficult, but ultimately I feel that it was worth the effort.
The issue at stake is the security of civil aviation.
The regulation that we had in force, that has been in force up to now, was adopted in the emotional climate surrounding the attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001.
It had a difficult birth, but was then approved and applied and, while it has had some success in recent years, there have been practical gaps and inadequacies.
It is for that reason that we are now about to revise it.
The aim is to provide a more flexible response to technological, psychological and behavioural changes in the fight against terrorism, obviously taking account of the experience that we have gained up to now.
Security and protection from terrorist attacks are an obvious priority, but cannot be discussed in isolation.
They have to be seen in a slightly more balanced context.
Checks have to be stringent and efficient, but should not overly inconvenience passengers, and their application should not entail unnecessary costs.
Costs should possibly be shared and should not be borne entirely by passengers.
It is for that reason that new checks cannot be introduced without adequate democratic scrutiny.
It is on those two points - costs and democratic accountability - that Parliament's delegation focused its attention during the conciliation stage of this procedure.
As regards costs, I am happy to be able to inform this House that an article, not a recital, has been included to lay down that they - security costs - must be shared between passengers, airports, air carriers and national governments.
Under a further article, not an interinstitutional declaration as in 2002, but an article, the Commission is to examine the problem in more detail and to put proposals before this House and the Council in order to resolve the problem through an appropriate sharing of costs between taxpayers and passengers.
As regards democratic accountability, we successfully managed to achieve the use of enhanced comitology or comitology with scrutiny, especially when any new check, control or limitation on passengers' lives is introduced.
Were Parliament to decide in future that a security measure is disproportionate, it will be able to call for a public debate in order adequately to examine such considerations.
Overall, I feel that the balance between an effective fight against terrorism and, at the same time, respect which is as broad as possible for privacy, practices, and pointless irritations for passengers, has in this way been achieved.
Obviously, only actual testing of its application will tell us whether this has been fully achieved.
It is for that reason, Mr President, that I would recommend to the Chamber, to our House, that it approves the agreement reached in conciliation so that the Commission can make an effective start on its work.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you a proposal for a new framework regulation on aviation security, with which you are all familiar.
I appreciate all the work and effort you have put in to achieve a positive outcome in a long and difficult conciliation procedure.
We have now come to the final stage for a new framework regulation, further evidence of better regulation.
On 4 March the Council formally completed the third reading of this balanced and beneficial text, which is important for both the industry and for passengers.
It is now up to members of the European Parliament to conclude the process.
I am grateful to Mr Costa for asking Parliament to agree with the text and thus ensuring a successful outcome for the conciliation.
Everyone has shown a spirit of compromise in the conciliation process, but I think I can say that Parliament came out the winner, because most of the amendments and ideas suggested are in the text on which you will be voting.
I understood your expectations regarding the financing principle.
I made a very strong personal commitment in the conciliation process.
With your permission, I refer to my previous statement that I intended to submit a draft legislative proposal to the Commission on the division, between taxpayers and users, of the costs arising from the stricter aviation security measures the Member States can adopt in addition to the basic rules laid down in this new regulation.
That does not prejudice the right of initiative of the Commission or compliance with domestic procedures, in particular conducting an appropriate impact study before any legislative proposal.
Furthermore, with the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the change to the new 'comitology' decision will give the European Parliament greater power over the general rules the Commission has to draw up after the adoption of the framework regulation.
Whilst allowing more flexibility in the system for adapting the legislation in the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, all this provides a counterbalance in the general implementing legislation.
Thus we are making institutional progress in all these situations.
As regards Article 4, I draw your attention to the statement made.
The Commission is declaring its intention of proposing general measures as indicated in the current Article 4(1)(a), and detailed implementing measures within the meaning of the current Article 4(2).
The Commission intends to use Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to propose any additions that are needed to the common basic standards laid down in this regulation.
The Commission notes that it is important to allow detailed implementing measures to be devised by methods that can not only ensure effective detection and deterrence, but also provide the necessary flexibility and speed, whilst at the same time keeping sensitive documents confidential in order to protect passengers.
The Commission also points out that the continuity of the implementing rules will be maintained until they are replaced by new measures adopted under this regulation.
As for the substance, the new regulation allows the development of more appropriate legislation that is better able to address security issues holistically and flexibly, rather than dealing with them through a series of individual and repetitive approaches.
Initial estimates by the Association of European Airlines suggest that the more flexible methods can reduce costs by up to 500 million.
To summarise, when this new regulation is adopted it will make it easier to adopt rules with non-member countries that have equally high air security standards.
This one-stop security concept is in the interests not only of passengers but also of the European Union aviation sector.
Besides that, I hope that the latest technological developments will enable us to amend the total ban on liquids on board aircraft by the beginning of next year.
As soon as the appropriate technology is available to detect liquid explosives, I shall endeavour to take that new factor into account in the regulations.
The European Parliament will be able to review any plans for a change of rules in that area.
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a lengthy process.
It has taken a great deal of effort by everyone to arrive at the compromise needed for the adoption of this new regulation.
Not only will this new regulation help us improve security in the air, it will also reduce costs, simplify the rules and protect civil aviation more effectively.
So I thank Parliament for its work on drawing up this legislative proposal and I am obviously hoping wholeheartedly for your support and adoption of the text.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, as both the rapporteur and Commissioner Barrot have said, following long negotiations in the conciliation process, Parliament and the Council have finally reached an agreement, which I believe to be positive and worthy of our support.
In the light of the ongoing terrorist threat, we believe that clear rules for security and, importantly, common implementation across Europe's airports and airlines are absolutely necessary, and this proposal delivers on both counts.
Whilst we have been unable to reach an agreement with the Council on the issue of financing these security measures, the Commission has agreed to come forward with a separate proposal on financing these measures within the next few months.
I hope that this will be sooner rather than later.
I want to make it clear, here and now, that when coming forward with this proposal both the Council and the Commission should take heed of Parliament's strong and united position on the issue.
Parliament must not be seen as another hoop that the Commission and the Council must jump through, but instead as a serious and equal player in the process.
Passenger safety and security are of paramount importance and, as such, I hope that the Commission's forthcoming proposal will reflect our strong stance.
Despite this sticking point, this report should be applauded.
I can see the benefits in common security standards across Europe.
And, given that the heightened terrorist threat to aviation today is one which is ever growing, this proposal offers important improvements for passenger safety and security.
I therefore urge the House to give this measure its full support.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and other subsequent threats have made us realise how vulnerable the aviation sector is and how deadly the effects of an attack using an aircraft or perpetrated inside one can be.
And what an enormous impact those effects can have on the economy and thus on each and every one of us.
Consequently it is important that we do everything necessary to ensure maximum security and it goes without saying that we must have maximum harmonisation on the matter at European level.
But at the same time we must also seek a balance between security on the one hand and comfort, privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand, as the rapporteur says.
That was always our view as the European Parliament's delegation during the negotiations, and I think we worked well together across party lines with Mr Costa, Mr Jarzembowski, in the conciliation procedure too.
We all pulled together and we came out of it with a good compromise deal, as the Commissioner rightly points out.
That is not to say that we are one hundred percent happy.
Everything will depend on how the agreements reached are implemented on the ground.
And in two essential areas: firstly, implementation of the measures.
We have secured a significant continuing involvement for Parliament via the new comitology procedure with scrutiny, and we have de facto obtained a kind of veto, for cases where we think the proposed measures are disproportionate.
So there is room for interpretation, for debate, and I think the liquids ban made it clear that this is necessary.
We cannot allow a committee of experts to have carte blanche and not be accountable; and so to me this new form of democratic scrutiny is altogether a plus point.
We can perfectly well take on that job if the Commission keeps us continuously informed and briefed, and I think this will be something very important.
We must also devise the right procedure in-house which will enable Parliament to do this adequately.
Secondly, we did not quite get what we wanted as regards the financing of security measures, we know that.
We wanted to remain consistent in our thinking.
Our expectation is that the security measures agreed by Europe will be adequate for everyone.
If Member States need or want to do more, then they should bear the cost of that.
We did not manage to get that accepted, but I am sure, Commissioner, that the undertaking you have given will lead to a new debate and genuine results in future.
In any event, as of today we have a framework that should allow us to take security measures quickly but will at the same time provide democratic accountability.
It remains to be seen whether the system works to everyone's satisfaction.
My Group too will support this.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) To be blunt, there is no doubt that aviation is and remains a popular target for terrorists.
So the need for stricter security rules for air transport, with the extra cost and burdens that entails, is immediately obvious.
But when it comes to maintaining the basic framework for this, it is truly essential that the measures in place should be effective.
In that respect this agreement, whilst not perfect, nevertheless represents an important step forward.
Regarding the enhanced role of Parliament, I very much hope we shall make full use of this.
More than ever we need to apply a measure of realism to assumptions concerning the effectiveness of our laws and rules.
It is of course important that collective stress should be properly managed. At the same time, the air traveller does have to be taken seriously.
Costly but sham security does no one any favours.
Terrorists are getting more and more ingenious.
The answer is not to confiscate bottles of water, shower gels or contact lens fluid.
The solution lies in the efficient operation, across borders, of police, justice and intelligence services.
I look forward accordingly to the phased plan which the Commissioner has just described.
The importance of aviation safety should not and ought not to be ignored and I am full of praise for the work that has been done to bring about this solution which ensures the safety of air passengers and workers.
When we draft and implement these types of regulations, we need to be careful that these regulations aren't regulations for the sake of regulations and that we consider other aspects of the aviation sector as well.
On that basis, I welcome the provision in the Report which states that certain passengers - those who come from countries which have identical safety measures as the Union - need not go through extra security checks.
It is a great pity that the same approach is not taken with regard to duty-free goods and transit passengers.
As it stands, if a person comes from the United States to Ireland and changes planes in Paris, any duty-free goods bought in the United States will be taken from that person in Paris.
This nonsensical system means that passengers and retailers are loosing out.
I agree that security concerns are a priority.
However, the solution that was agreed in Singapore shows that the two things can be done.
Why is it then that those arrangements cannot be made with other countries?
We know that there are plans being made, but it is happening too slowly for passengers and retailers who have to bear the consequences.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this has been a very long-running saga, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Costa. In the negotiations, including those with the Council, he remained steadfastly committed to the position formulated and supported by the Members of this House in committee.
One of the points at issue, as has been mentioned, was the funding of security measures - the reason why is fairly obvious.
For example, these security measures lend themselves very well to the concealment of what would be less than entirely legal funding arrangements for the various national airlines.
I presume this is precisely why there were all sorts of resistance in the Council to a set of rules that imposed greater transparency in this area, and of course it was our Group's clear and unanimous desire to have transparent, straightforward funding provisions that were designed to help preclude problems.
The second point was the arrangement whereby Parliament was to be more closely involved in the continuing development of the security provisions.
This was fiercely resisted too, although I could not comprehend why, because the European Parliament, after all, had only tried to indicate an escape route that could be used, for example, to get out of measures that had once been adopted but had subsequently begun to prove inexpedient.
I can just about support the compromise, but I would have wished for more.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) The European Parliament and the European Commission have been debating aviation security for several years.
The purpose of the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of 16 December 2002 is to ensure an improvement of the common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
The resulting document, however, is not very clear.
So that not only myself but also many other Members of this Parliament can raise their hands in favour of the result of the conciliation procedure, I want to hear a clear answer to my question.
Commissioner, Monsieur le Commissaire, c'est pour vous: since the new Regulation does not guarantee a common procedure for testing pilot safety, how will this issue be solved once Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 is abolished?
Can you confirm that the European Cockpit Association and the Commission have agreed on the preparation of a regulation establishing a common procedure for testing pilot safety?
If yes, when will this text be presented?
Your answer will determine how we will vote tomorrow.
- (EL) Mr President, let me begin by expressing my deep satisfaction with the agreement that has at last been reached on the amendment to the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, on his work, as well as the representatives of the political groups, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr El Khadraoui, who, together with our rapporteur, formed the core of our negotiating group.
Armed with their detailed knowledge of the subject and its technical dimensions, and with their unwavering dedication to the European Parliament's position on transparency and respect for citizens, they have fought hard and unrelentingly to achieve this objective.
I should also like to thank all the members of the European Parliament Delegation, of which I had the honour of chairing, for their cooperation at all stages and especially at critical moments.
Let me commend the Portuguese Presidency's continuing efforts to achieve mutual understanding and agreement.
I should also like to single out the European Commission's constructive and decisive contribution, to which Commissioner Barrot contributed so much.
The new regulation is not merely the result of successful negotiation.
In the final analysis, it represents a shared view of the relationship between security on the one hand, and private citizens and our political objectives on the other.
The new regulation is the fruit of the experience we have gained through applying the security rules.
It is a better expression of the need for transparency and responsibility on the part of all the agencies involved.
It provides an effective framework for the safe movement of passengers in a globalised environment, while enabling Member States to adapt their policy to new developments and the special needs that may arise during a particular period.
The regulation also requires Member States to maintain transparency and bear part of the cost - vital conditions, according to the European Parliament.
As well as the Member States having to honour these obligations, the European Commission has undertaken to draw up a report at the end of 2008, which will contribute enormously to this endeavour.
The European Parliament will then prepare to play an effective role in enforcing the necessary measures.
(RO)I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr. Costa and all colleagues that took part in the negotiations relating to the third reading.
We are discussing this document after more than two years from the regulation being proposed by the Commission in 2005, with a view to replacing the regulation of 2002, adopted following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
Air transport has experienced an accelerated development over the last years.
If in 1970 there were approximately 200 million passengers in the EU-15, in 2000 their number reached approximately 600 million.
Unfortunately, the terrorist attacks of 11 September caused , a decrease between 2000 and 2001 of approximately 2% in the number of passengers using air transport.
The European Parliament believes that the safety of passengers and of the personnel working in the field of air transport is highly important.
The debates as part of the conciliation procedure mainly focused on the distribution of costs related to the necessary security measures, the uniform performance of security inspections, the impact of certain programmes for the safety of civil aviation, adopted at national, airport or air carrier level.
Common security standards should subsequently be adopted using the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, so that the European Parliament will have an important role in this process.
The costs related to the additional measures for civil aviation safety should be incurred both by Member States and users.
By 31 December 2008 the Commission will submit to the European Parliament a report presenting the measures to be imposed, so that taxes related to the security measures be used only for this purpose and the required transparency on the calculation and use of such taxes will be provided.
As regards the use of security officers on board aircrafts, each Member State has the competence to decide on the registered and authorised aircraft in the Member State in question, but their role was improved by the enforcement of certain provisions on the training and security terms imposed thereon.
(PL) Madam President, air transport needs defined legal rules, but they must be as flexible as possible and at the same time sufficiently harmonised, especially with regard to flight security.
The document we are discussing today meets those criteria.
It is, in my view, a difficult but good compromise by the members of the Conciliation Committee, and I thank them for the work they have done.
In this connection Mr Costa and Commissioner Barrot deserve special praise.
Since time is short, I shall confine myself to a few points.
First: charges for air security must be transparent and relate only to actual cost.
Second: measures taken in this area must not interfere with competition among airports and carriers, which is natural to the free market.
Third: the principles governing civil aviation security need to be standardised at world level.
It is therefore to be welcomed that the document refers to cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the ICAO.
Fourth: security standards must also be met by third-country carriers, otherwise our European measures will be ineffective.
Fifth: suitable procedures must be prepared for dealing with crisis situations, which may never arise but are always possible in the event of a terrorist attack.
Finally, let us jointly strive to make the passenger, including disabled passengers, the subject, rather than the object, of the action taken by all parties involved in air transport - especially when it comes to security measures, which involve a degree of inconvenience.
Madam President, I am pleased to see that progress has been made on this issue, because Parliament has always indicated that we should be very thorough on these measures improving security for air passengers.
I want to applaud Mr Costa, my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and especially Commissioner Barrot, who has worked to ensure that the arrangements for financing the measures are properly set out and that comitology is used to scrutinise the definition of common basic standards.
EU cooperation is needed to provide consistency on this so that passengers are better informed.
As I said late last year, mutual recognition of our differing legal traditions is the way forward in an EU of 27 Member States, but basic security standards should be established in the EU.
When the Commission outlines the principle of financing later this year, I will argue strongly that Member States should be allowed to go above and beyond these, should they feel the need, as long as they are prepared to pay the costs.
This comes on the back of reports which claim that the British Airports Authority is to fingerprint and photograph all passengers checking in for domestic flights at Heathrow and several other airports.
I believe these measures should be scrutinised to make sure they are effective.
The use of biometric technology as proposed by Commissioner Frattini is in order to produce greater efficiency, and must not alienate public support.
The public have already tolerated a massive amount of inconvenience through security measures which may be desirable, but there appears to be a lack of clear objective analysis of their effectiveness.
The random nature of some of the provisions is particularly disruptive and we should surely be asking for consistency in the approach of airport authorities across Europe, if not on a global basis.
The EU should be proactive rather than reactive with regard to all these security issues.
We must be one step ahead of the threat by developing more sophisticated technology and by sharing best practice and pooling intelligence.
I believe that this report certainly takes us somewhat in that direction.
(ES) Madam President, we are extremely pleased to reach the end of what has proved to be a protracted battle to achieve better security in a core sector such as aviation, which is essential to the economy and competitiveness of Europe, and of which the success and credibility are rooted in a high level of security.
This was demonstrated in the starkest way possible on 11 September 2001, when security itself was one of the key aspects which was shown to need improvement both on a global scale and particularly with reference to the European zone.
All the efforts made by the Commission, not only in this dossier but in others that the Commission has worked on - the whole issue of blacklists, and of gradually improving and implementing security measures - are, I believe, essential.
We particularly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, whose tenacity, although exasperating at times, has achieved an agreement, a matter on which I congratulate him from the heart.
The best agreement possible.
Moreover, that agreement is on two fundamental topics.
First, a topic fundamental to the absolute requirement of security, and more specifically the crucial aspect of funding it.
We all agree that security is very important, but another key aspect is who pays for that security and how we try to improve transparency and a better distribution of costs.
To that end I believe that the cooperation received from the Commission in proposing the study for the precise purpose of identifying and improving transparency in the cost-sharing between taxpayers and users will help us improve future measures and implement them.
Secondly, a topic fundamental to Parliament as an institution.
From the institutional point of view Mr Costa has managed to increase comitology in relation to methods of scanning and I believe that in future this too will put right a few misunderstandings which have arisen in the past, for example in relation to liquids; this is another area where I believe we must improve.
For the future we hope to complete all the key security dossiers for the aviation sector, having regard to the key factor, namely the human factor.
I hope also that the Commissioner will be able to update us on how things are going with the schedule for the social package both for cabin crew and for pilots as far as training and certification are concerned.
We are aware that the EASA is working on this area, but would like to see a greater number of specific measures on this matter, which will be the central factor in this increase in security.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, passenger security is a fundamental principle, but how is it actually protected?
As top Italian football coach Giovanni Trapattoni would probably put it, 'Belts off, bottles empty, shoes off!'
Do these measures actually secure anything other than additional jobs for poorly paid and poorly trained security staff?
Besides, long queues at airports, hassle and economic disadvantages are once more being associated with Europe, even though in many cases these annoyances are the result of exercises in diligence on the part of bumped-up local and regional sheriffs.
Surely we can do better than that!
Let us revise the implementing provisions on liquids as quickly as possible, and let us replace them with more and better technology and with better cooperation between the security services.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like in particular to draw attention to the technological modernisation that is necessary to avoid the collapse of civil aviation.
My plea is for progress to be made in the CESAR project to promote technological innovation in aviation and make sure that civil aviation is no longer held hostage by certain forces on the ground.
I should like to ask what progress has been made in the Member States on transfers of rights?
Would that not have a great many benefits for passenger safety, protection of the environment and aviation as a whole?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to your speeches.
As you have all underlined, the challenge with our air security policy is to find a reasonable balance between the need to protect passengers against terrorist activity and, of course, the operational aspects at airports in order to avoid over-complicated checking procedures.
The Commission proposal was aimed at significantly improving the chances of striking a reasonable balance.
As I said before, the adoption of this regulation will enable us to establish more modern and flexible rules, using new checking technologies, to introduce the one-stop security concept for flights from non-member countries, with a high standard of security, to abolish certain duplicated requirements, to codify the participation of stakeholders in decision-making on the implementing measures and, of course, to involve the European Parliament more in the process of decision-making on the implementing rules.
I personally undertake to launch initiatives in all areas of security funding in order to improve the current situation, ensure greater transparency and make the financial commitment of the Member States more visible.
So, as I said, I shall reply to some of your comments, although I am not claiming that I will answer them all.
The general rule the Commission will follow in future is to publicise all applications of the regulation, unless it is shown that awareness of the regulation might aid terrorists.
That is very different from the present situation, in which the default rule is not to publish anything.
That point is very important, because it means that Parliament can be fully informed.
So I shall reply to a few points. In answer to Mr Ã Neachtain, for me the duty-free issue is still important.
We have drawn up a regulation that allows for derogations.
Through negotiation with Singapore, we have managed to introduce this rule for all dealings with Singapore, and we are now continuing with a number of non-member countries in preparation for further derogations.
Obviously, though, these non-member countries have to cooperate much more actively with us and we are letting them know of our interest in that.
The Americans and Canadians are working with us, but it is absolutely vital - and, believe me, this is something I personally am very concerned about - for us to sign many more agreements with non-member countries if we are to make any progress on the duty-free issue.
Mr KohlÃ­Äek and Mrs Ayala Sender mentioned pilots and crew.
We are working with the pilots.
Consultation is under way, but I cannot prejudge its outcome.
What is true is that we are paying close attention to the problems to which we need to find the right solutions.
It is true that, as has rightly been said, we need a very coherent approach at European level.
I am obviously keeping a close watch myself on how the regulations are applied and it is true that, as Mr Kirkhope pointed out just now, we clearly have to harmonise the rules and procedures for their implementation as well.
We also have to guard against some Member States taking initiatives that are more or less improvised and unilateral.
It is not easy; we know the battle for funding of security measures and more transparent and balanced financing will be hard.
Mr Costa has experience of that.
I should also like to express my thanks to Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who chaired the Parliament delegation and was a great help to us during the long and very difficult meetings.
Finally I should like to say something to Mr Costa, because his report and his work as rapporteur gave us a real feeling that Parliament was genuinely seeking the common good of Europe, the welfare of passengers, and also, of course, a system of protection that is effective but at the same time flexible enough to allow for changes.
As I said earlier, we are keeping a close eye on the new technologies that will, I hope, enable us to simplify these procedures. The detection of explosives in liquids seems now to be well on the way.
I hope we shall be able to make use of those technologies.
They will obviously be welcome.
I thank you, Madam President, and I thank Parliament in particular for the high standard of this debate and all the contributions it has made in the course of the debate.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation is a framework regulation and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, when it is applied.
As matters stand, we have merely compared recipes.
I believe that we are both aware that there are still two major problems.
The first is that the problem of terrorism has heightened security and the problem of terrorism cannot be considered a matter for the individual.
Imagining that every passenger has to be responsible for financing counter-terrorism activities is an idea that obviously does not work.
Passengers are jointly responsible; and it is that line that should to some extent, sooner or later, come to the fore and make states more responsible for such activities.
The second is that unfortunately terrorism is forcing us to change the way we behave.
We must not, so to speak, shirk the task of introducing rules which place limits on each of our activities, because the terrorists cannot be allowed to win out, but we must at the same time make every effort to ensure that we do not, little by little, help terrorism to win because terrorism is forcing us to change the way we live.
This is a difficult balance.
We have fielded all the possible arms: codecision, enhanced comitology, simple comitology.
Those are all the tools we need.
We have much work to do in that direction, but I think that a good foundation has been laid.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The harmonisation of actions taken by Member States, airports and airlines concerning the provision of civil aviation security represents an imperative requirement in order to deal with terrorist threats.
Nevertheless, a balance must be established between the enhancement of security and the provision of comfort to the users of air transport services.
It is mandatory to take all necessary measures to enhance the technical performances of screening equipment, as well as to apply a single check in the case of transit flights, which would enable a reduction of processing time and, in the mid- to long-term, the effective decrease of actual costs.
On the other hand, the lack of transparency in the calculation and application of taxes related to security measures distorts the competence in the field of air transport, as well as understanding of the way in which the money is used in the direct financing of such measures.
The issues related to financing must be clarified as soon as possible, so that taxpayers in the European Union, as well as the users of transport services have a clear picture about the allocation of amounts collected, thus dissociating the financing of direct measures from the insurance costs, as well as from any state aid in support of additional security measures that a Member State may enact.
Sustainable European transport policy, taking into account European energy and environment policies (debate)
The next item is the report by Gabriele Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on sustainable European transport policy, taking into account European energy and environment policies.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on sustainable European transport policy has now reached the stage of debate in plenary.
The text has already been favourably received, without giving rise to major controversy, by the Transport Committee in January.
Only forty or so amendments were tabled.
My main objective was to make this own initiative report as succinct as possible, no longer than twenty or so paragraphs, so that the European Parliament can put its recommendations to the Commission and the Council as effectively as possible.
As the issues addressed are so vast - European policies on transport, energy and the environment - going into too much detail and producing an undue number of paragraphs would have weakened the report, and Parliament's final resolution would have been less clear and incisive.
For the same reason, some issues have been left out.
An own initiative report cannot tackle all the questions raised by transport, energy and the environment in an exhaustive way.
However, this document may be of use to the Commission for future legislative proposals and to show what European citizens are expecting from the Community institutions.
Eight amendments have been tabled for this final examination in plenary.
They do not, in substance, add anything new with respect to the debate in the Transport Committee.
I should nevertheless like to comment briefly on them.
The Green Group has tabled six amendments and has called for a split vote on paragraph 16.
That request removes the reference to the use of electricity of nuclear origin by rail transport, something with which I cannot agree.
Rail transport is the mode of transport with the smallest carbon footprint, thanks partly to the use of nuclear as a source of electricity.
Amendment 6 asks the Commission to intervene to set a single speed limit for European motorways in all countries.
Our German friends have already shown on a number of occasions that German motorways are safer and the number of accidents is lower than in many Member States of the European Union which have such a limit.
The principle of subsidiarity should undoubtedly continue to be applied in this case.
Personally, I find Amendment 2 more coherent, especially the first part relating to transparent air transport costs and ticket pricing.
Mr Blokland has tabled Amendment 8, on behalf of the Independence/Democracy Group.
This text refers to paragraph 2 and analyses the measures that citizens need to take to improve urban and suburban mobility.
Here, I have to call for a vote against, as the amendment takes an entirely opposite line to that of the text adopted by the Transport Committee.
Lastly, my political group has again tabled an amendment - Amendment 1 relating to paragraph 11 - tabled in the Transport Committee, concerning the revision of the Eurovignette directive.
Personally, I was and am not against the possibility of looking at this issue at the appropriate time in June.
The European Commission has already announced that it will issue the proposal for revision at that time.
I consider, however, in line with what has already been proposed in the Transport Committee, that there should be a free vote on the amendments in question.
I should like to thank Members for the interest that they have shown in this report and in my work and, as I am aware that many others have asked to speak, I shall give them a chance to do so.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I thank Mr Albertini for his excellent report.
Obviously there must be a broad consensus between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the need to reduce the environmental and energy impacts of transport.
At the same time, though, we need to maintain the mobility that is essential to our competitiveness and our quality of life.
How can we achieve this sustainable mobility?
It is an enormous challenge. By 2020, we have to have cut greenhouse emissions by 20%, reduced energy consumption by 20% and increased the renewable energy in our energy consumption by 20%.
Obviously transport will need to play a large part in the attainment of those targets.
I shall start by trying to outline our various initiatives in this area. The development of the Trans-European Networks, in which, as Mr Albertini has just pointed out, we are banking on the development of railways, brings about a modal shift which obviously leads in that direction.
We have the TEN-T project and the Marco Polo programme in support of highways of the sea.
We are supporting inland waterway transport with the NAIADES programme.
Obviously research will also enable us to develop greener and more effective technologies.
I would also draw your attention to the recent proposal for a clean vehicles directive, on which the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will be starting work.
To provide a clear picture of all these measures, the Commission will be presenting an inventory of all European initiatives.
This will take stock of all the action taken and draw lessons from it for the future.
I have a very particular personal interest in this inventory.
Secondly, we are moving towards a strategy for internalising external costs for all modes of transport.
The package I shall be presenting in June will contain an external costs internalisation strategy for all modes of transport, something for which the European Parliament has been pressing.
This initiative meets a need.
The external costs for our economy and our environment - air pollution, noise, congestion - are heavy, which also has an adverse effect on transport mobility.
If we want sustainable mobility, we have to make sure that the external transport costs are integrated into what users pay.
Our 2006 proposal that aviation should be included in the European emission duties exchange system was a step towards the internalisation of external costs in the aviation sector.
I intend to couple this internalisation strategy with a proposal for amendment of the directive on charges for heavy goods vehicles.
That will allow Member States - allow, not oblige - to include external environment costs in tolls if they wish, and not just infrastructure costs, as is the case currently. At present they cannot do so, except in a very few cases.
This amendment will allow internalisation of external costs in another sector, railways.
The Community legislation provides that external costs for the railways can only be internalised if the other modes of transport also internalise their external costs.
In short, we are moving towards intelligent tolls, educational tolls, which will make it possible to penalise more heavily the lorries that have the lowest environmental standards or use major routes at times when congestion and traffic jams are at their worst.
In addition to that, we shall be taking a series of initiatives in the second half of the year.
I shall be making an announcement on measures to reduce railway noise.
There will be improvements on the roads, too; it will be possible to reduce congestion with an intelligent transport system.
We shall be aiming at one-box interoperability.
That will be helpful in organising the logistical rules at European level.
The Albertini report also stresses the need to establish a real Single European Sky.
Mr Albertini is right, that is the proper way.
Also, as has been said earlier, we really have to make progress on the CESAR project. It must play an essential part in developing the technology required for the attainment of that goal.
Initiatives are planned to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions in the aviation sector and noise around airports.
We are also working on shipping measures.
Obviously urban transport will also need to be involved: 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other polluting emissions come from vehicles in towns.
Within the European Parliament, I am very grateful to Mr Rack, who is working on this, and I hope that this autumn we shall be able to produce a set of instruments that towns can use.
These are a few examples of wide-ranging action which is, it must be said, one of the main priorities in my term of office: greening transport, whilst at the same time ensuring that all the citizens of Europe have access to transport.
It is true that, as Mr Albertini has said, his report comes at just the right moment.
Parliament and the Commission are more or less in agreement on sustainable mobility and I should like to thank Parliament and Mr Albertini for this excellent work, which also does a great deal to clarify our own work in the Commission.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (PT) I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, and informing him that the Environment Committee believes that various measures must be combined to ensure a sustainable transport system for future generations.
These measures include traffic management, better logistics, fiscal incentives for transport and environmentally friendly fuels, safe, environmentally friendly, efficient and affordable public transport, rail modernisation, non-motorised mobility, etc. Information and education campaigns for young people are also required.
We agree with the inclusion of aviation in the European emissions trading scheme and support similar legislation for the maritime transport sector, as well as the adoption of ambitious and binding CO2 emission limits for cars, making them more fuel-efficient.
The European Union should therefore support research to develop the technologies required to create sustainable and environmentally friendly transport, for example the development of alternative and renewable fuels such as hydrogen and fuel cells.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (HU) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, transport policy is about to undergo a paradigm change: the fuels, the technology, the regulations, and the expectations of society will all be different.
The transport sector is entering a new era.
Is there anything that is not going to change?
Yes, mobility, because it would be wrong to restrict mobility.
If we do not want to restrict mobility, however, then we ourselves must change.
The question is, in what way?
Technological development is unstoppable, yet we need to spend more and target spending to a greater extent on vehicle development in order to get environmentally friendly vehicles on the road as soon as possible.
Alternative fuels have already been making great and sometimes controversial strides, but we must select the second-generation biofuels and hydrogen-related options carefully so that they can come onto the market as an outcome of research and development.
As regards financing in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme, European Union funds, national contributions and private capital must all be set in the same direction.
Intelligent solutions such as the CESAR or Galileo programmes are progressing too slowly, and we must accelerate these.
In the interests of achieving our objectives we must transform the economic environment on the basis of the 'user pays' and 'polluter pays' principles.
Last, let us not tax vehicle ownership, but ensure payment is made for vehicle use.
Then we will be in a position to change our habits as regards driving, vehicle use and travel.
Madam President, we thank our fellow Member Mr Albertini for his work and for his thorough and circumspect report.
With these additional points, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy supports the report and at the same time commends it to the attention of the Commission for its forthcoming green transport proposals.
Thank you.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, as we have heard from Mr Albertini and the Commissioner, this is a very timely and important report and we welcome it.
In his introductory remarks, Mr Albertini said that this gives us a chance to outline our transport policy, bearing in mind the environment and fuel efficiency, something about which this Parliament has consistently felt very strongly and expressed its views.
Mr Barrot, in his contribution, called the whole issue a huge challenge and one, I know, that all our governments are looking at.
As Mr Barrot said, we have to recognise transport's clear contribution and the need for the 'greening' of transport.
In this respect, I am very proud of the fact that London has led the way with a number of initiatives, be it the congestion charge, the new low-emission zone or higher charges for less environmentally friendly vehicles, something which had been opposed by London's Conservatives.
Mr Barrot also spoke about the need to recognise the external costs of transport and Mr Albertini spoke about some of the amendments.
However, I think there is a contradiction in the PPE-DE Group's position - one I know the PPE-DE Group has debated internally - and there is a contradiction in this report.
Recital B, for example, talks about energy consumption and highlights 'road transport, accounting as it does for 83% [...] of energy'.
Against that, Amendment 1, by the PPE-DE Group, and co-signed by some Members from the ALDE Group, is quite clearly trying to change the position adopted in committee to one that favours road transport over rail transport.
That does not fit in with a package that is arguing for sustainable transport over forms that are not friendly to the environment.
I ask Mr Albertini, when he winds up, and I ask the ALDE Group, which has also supported this, why they are trying to turn it round and why they are trying to favour road transport.
I suggest that perhaps the person whose fingerprints are really on this is not here to answer that tonight.
I must say that my group will be considering whether we would support this whole report were that amendment to go through.
I look forward to it.
Other than that, the principles in the report are fine.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, around a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union are from transport.
We therefore obviously need to reduce emissions from transport.
The pollution load from transport has to be lowered.
Air transport is entirely excluded from international treaties on climate.
It is nevertheless causing more and more emissions all the time, and should be included in all agreements.
Someone said here that the 'user pays' principle is a good one.
I agree.
It is a good principle if one also takes circumstances into account.
In Europe there are sparsely inhabited countries and areas where there is no public transport and therefore no means of getting about other than by private car.
Then the 'user pays' principle is not very appropriate.
It is one thing to go for a drive for pleasure and quite another to use your car because yon have to and in situations where it is not possible to use public transport.
In the future we need to try and get freight transport off the road.
Generally speaking, we need to aim to move away from means of transport reliant on the use of fossil fuels to those based on renewable fuels.
We have much to do at EU level if we really intend to reach the targets we have together committed ourselves to, i.e. to reduce emissions.
It is a matter of will, and because we have decided the matter together, all nations must together make an effort to ensure that these decisions are carried out.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the draft resolution on sustainable European transport policy, taking into account European energy and environment policies, attempts a complex approach to a highly sensitive issue.
The rapporteur, Mr Albertini, must be complimented on his approach to the problem and his constructive proposals.
Among other things, Mr Albertini correctly points out that the role of rail transport, particularly in the transport of goods, is not properly appreciated and its development is neglected.
We must remember that road building alone will not solve the problem and rail projects are essential.
To those who have not noticed this, I would recommend a drive across Poland, which has been criss-crossed by international lorry traffic in recent years.
The second problem requiring urgent attention is traffic congestion in large conurbations and the concentration of exhaust fumes in cities and intercity transport corridors.
Here too the role of rail transport, i.e. high speed trains, is not appreciated.
The third important issue is the use, alongside rail transport, of inland waterway and sea transport, which are less polluting.
Here there are many more problems, ranging from technical, energy and cost control issues to social awareness and behaviour.
To cope with all these problems, we need a complete analysis of the transport situation in its environmental context, plus concrete integrated action.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the report contains many fine suggestions, but it proceeds from the assumption that constant growth in the volume of traffic is something like a law of nature and that technology can solve most of the problems.
There are two particular points I would like to underline.
Firstly, calculation of the total cost of transport operations, including their social cost, must begin with the Eurovignette, because heavy goods vehicles impose the greatest burden not only on the road network but also on people and the environment.
Even though Commissioner Barrot, who is responsible for transport, has promised that the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention will be ratified during the period of the French presidency of the Council, I believe that we, the European Parliament, should make explicit mention of this protocol here in the report.
Time and again we hear fine words on the subject of transport.
The fact is, however, that the volume of CO2 emissions from transport increased by 32.1% between 1990 and 2005, and the volume emitted by air transport rocketed by 90% over the same period, while emissions of the climate-killer carbon dioxide from all other areas of activity were reduced by 9.5% in accordance with the aims of the Kyoto Protocol.
Too often in this report we content ourselves with lofty aims and pious hopes.
What are needed, however, are hard and fast requirements and effective measures, including sanctions, otherwise everything will carry on in a way that proves the truth of the saying, 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions'.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the UK should make its own laws, so I reject this proposal.
But I do not dispute the fact that more efficient cars are a good idea and that working from home cuts down pollution.
What concerns me about this report is words like 'pricing policy' and 'tax on fossil fuels', because no current serious alternatives exist and these taxes are very inflationary.
The future must be about encouraging innovation and technology, not about tricking people who have no alternative into paying more tax.
Most public transport systems are good for the commuter but do not fit the needs of the businessman who must drive into work in order to use his car to visit clients later.
But the city of Strasbourg provides a first-class tram system, with a tram stop outside this very building, so why are MEPs here in Strasbourg not leading by example?
They do not visit clients, they just come here to misrule Europe.
Yet almost all of them use chauffeur-driven limousines and ignore the trams.
If MEPs complied with their own words, then perhaps the public would listen.
In simple English, Madam President, this House is guilty of gross hypocrisy.
What were MEPs saying about sustainable transport, please?
Because, like the no-smoking rule in the Parliament dining rooms, MEPs ignore it!
(RO) The implementation of an integrated strategy on the development of sustainable transport must be an absolute priority, both for the Commission and for the Member States.
Investments in transport infrastructure must be accelerated, especially environmentally-friendly ones, such as: railways, inland waterway transport and Sea Motorways.
A comprehensive assessment of internal costs and in particular the negative impact of transport on the environment is compulsory.
Such negative impacts must be ascertained and assumed by their inclusion in the prices paid by users.
Consequently, it is highly important that the internalisation of external costs be carried out for all transport means at the same time.
Thus, the break-down by form of transport used would improve, favouring less polluting transport means, as well as the development of the trans-European network and intermodal freight transport.
I believe that better logistics and the improvement of management, especially via the intensification of research and application of new technologies in the field of intelligent systems, represent steps forward in better traffic planning, management of flows and elimination of traffic agglomeration and jams.
Romania is making concerted efforts coming into line with European standards, especially by attracting investments in disadvantaged areas to lay the foundation for a reduction in the development discrepancies in infrastructures.
At the same time, Romania supports and promotes actions aimed at making energy consumption more effective in order to take part in the reduction of the negative environmental impact of transport and supports investments in alternative energy sources.
I hereby ask the European Commission to reassess the multiannual financial frameworks for financial resources in the field of transport, as well as for the field-related research with a view to obtaining cost effective and energy-enhanced products and services.
At the same time, I recommend that the Member States support public - private partnerships and, by way of consequence, private investments in the said field and that they make full use the funds made available to create a sustainable transport sector, to improve traffic safety and the health of the environment in which we live.
(RO) The European policy concerning sustainable transport, taking account of the European policies on energy and environment, concerns and directly affects approximately 490 million of European citizens.
I asked the Commission and the Member States to examine the way in which transport infrastructures and the applicable tariffs influence urban development and future demands for transport services.
I asked the Commission and the Member States to intervene in the modernisation of port infrastructure, with respect to the European Union sea ports, as well as the ports located on the inland waterways, in order to enable the rapid transfer of freight and passengers from one transport system to another, thus facilitating the reduction of energy consumption in the field of transport.
In 2007, the European Union firmly and unilaterally committed itslef to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 base values.
The implementation, especially in large urban concentrations, of intelligent transport systems in order to control traffic will prevent traffic jams which cost the European Union approximately 1% per year of its gross domestic product.
At the same time, the development of the European railway system will contribute to compliance with European policies in the field of energy and tackling climate change.
In this context, I believe that one of the development priorities in the field of trans-European transport should be to design a high-speed railway network linking all the capitals of the Member States.
High speed trains should also go through Bucharest and Sofia.
(PL) Madam President, Mr Albertini's report deals with all the decisive factors in a sustainable European transport policy, taking account of European energy and environment policies.
Transport takes up over 30% of energy consumption, and that figure is set to rise by 30% in 20 years.
The transport sector uses 70% oil, and in cities and built-up areas it accounts for 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of emissions of other harmful compounds.
The rapporteur is in favour of technological innovations and other energy-saving methods.
The European Union needs swift, effective measures.
Given the huge rise in oil prices, the form of energy most beneficial for the environment and the economy is electric power. It should play a greater part in transport, including urban transport, for example, through the production of cheap electrically powered urban motor vehicles.
The increasing demand for this form of energy should be covered by the latest generation of nuclear power stations that do not emit noxious gases.
(NL) We are all aware of the way in which the transport sector is contributing to climate change.
To my mind Mr Albertini's report offers a fair and succinct assessment of the practical and technical measures which may perhaps be applied to reduce that contribution.
And since one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs, these measures will inevitably be painful to those concerned, both professional transport operators and the individual citizen.
In contrast to the belief expressed in paragraph 2, my view is that not only the professionals but ordinary citizens too understand and support the need for extreme measures, provided they offer demonstrable benefits for the future.
The first major objective to be attained is that of the air quality standards, to be met by 2015.
Transport will play a big part in meeting these targets, certainly in urban areas.
So available methods and measures, both at-source and end-of-pipe measures, must be applied and implemented without delay.
Madam President, my thanks to Mr Albertini for his report and I hope that everyone concerned will play their part in the efforts required.
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Albertini and make a few comments.
1.
With regard to taxation as an instrument, I can accept that it needs to be applied uniformly to all modes of transport.
At the same time, we must take into account that tax cannot simply be increased ad infinitum, as this would cause serious inflation and could lead to increased costs and reduced competitiveness in the whole sector.
We cannot therefore have uniform taxation for everything, for excise duty on petrol for example.
I would like to point out that I think it is a good idea to link taxation to actual air pollution - for example in the vehicle registration tax system.
2.
In the case of air transport, we must take into account that expansion of emissions trading represents an additional cost factor, and this will be reflected in prices.
This also needs to be taken into account regarding the idea of introducing indirect taxation that is sometimes put forward.
3.
A genuine effort needs to be made to reduce urban congestion and thus also air-polluting emissions.
For the new Member States, however, the main challenge is not just promoting electric-powered urban public transport; constructing bypass roads perhaps presents even more of a challenge.
In relative terms it is in this regard that they are lagging behind the most, and this should be given greater emphasis as a priority use of European Union resources.
4.
As regards internalisation of external costs, I agree that we need to create sector neutrality.
For hauliers in the new Member States, however, the provisions of the Eurovignette already present a major challenge due to the increasingly stringent standards for vehicle emissions, etc. In the new Member States internalisation must therefore be implemented more slowly and according to special principles.
Our hauliers should not be punished for the fact that the infrastructure is less well developed and therefore traffic jams are bigger.
5.
It would be good if support of a practical and not just verbal nature were also given to inland waterway transport in the new Member States, especially on the River Danube and the River Tisza, and if the Commission would assist in this regard.
Transport intermodality is important, and may provide the biggest boost to modernisation of the rail network.
Let us discuss this too, rather than closing down railway lines.
Last, I hope that when the high-speed rail network is constructed, the eastern regions will at last be included on the map, because in the long term this is the only mode of transport that can compete with private cars.
Thank you very much.
(PL) Madam President, Mr Albertini has done a good job.
My thanks to him.
I also identify with Commissioner Barrot's comments.
What I particularly like is this combination of policies on technological development, market instruments and accompanying measures that are acceptable to the public and designed to achieve a more rational use of transport facilities.
I would add to this an efficient transport policy, both on the micro and the macro scale.
I am pleased to see that this combination of measures also takes account of the Baltic coastal area - an undoubtedly positive approach.
I like the idea of the Trans-European Networks, but we were expecting EUR 20 billion in 2008 and what we get is 8 billion.
I appeal to you all: let us pay more attention to efficient use of the part of the cohesion fund that is allocated to transport.
That applies to the new Member States, where the situation varies considerably but is generally not too good.
Let me also state clearly that the internalisation of external transport costs has its limits.
That limit, Commissioner, must be set by the refusal to allow a negative impact on the competitiveness of the EU economy.
Finally, the unified European rail network must become a reality.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report, and I know that in Commissioner Barrot we have a champion of sustainable transport policy.
Transport can pose a particular risk to our economic growth in Europe if it does not function properly.
In this domain we need more European responsibility, not less, for whenever Europe has fewer powers, there are national particularities and there are borders, and these are detrimental to transport operations.
This is why we must try to seek European solutions, as we have just been doing in the realm of air transport or as we did with the railway package.
I can only ask the Commission to step up a gear in the search for more and better European solutions, but success will surely also depend on our finding prices for the individual modes of transport that reflect their full cost.
Here, too, the Commission has adopted the right approach by starting with road transport, for road transport is certainly the mode that generates the highest social costs at the present time, although these are not met in full by road users.
Commissioner, you were in the Tyrol, a sensitive Alpine region, and you know what damage is caused there by heavy haulage traffic.
That impact also shows us that it is high time for action to introduce the European road-tax disc, to actually present the framework you have announced and to continue working hard to apply the principle that users should pay the true cost of road transport.
I must also direct some criticism at my own group here. The group has come down in favour of Amendment 1.
I wish to express my opposition to that amendment and to pledge my full support and that of my fellow Austrian Members to the effort to ensure that the Commission presents this general framework in June, beginning with road transport, and does not postpone its presentation until the next blue moon on the grounds that the package must cover all modes of transport.
There is an urgent need to act.
Let us begin with road transport.
(ES) Madam President, Mr Albertini's report sets out the enormous challenge we face in sustaining the low-cost mobility for all through access to new means of transport and new routes, mobility which has been made possible by the free movement of persons, goods and services, the foundation of the success of European integration, enlargement and social, economic and territorial cohesion; at the same time, however, it must be achieved without the high environmental impact caused mainly by emissions, to say nothing of noise, congestion and safety.
The challenge lies in maintaining the positive and necessary aspects of that mobility but in the most intelligent way possible, in other words, achieving sustainable mobility and thereby minimising the impact on our environment and health.
To achieve this, as Mr Albertini says in his report, we need innovative measures and instruments.
Although included in the report, I would have liked to see more space given over to the future role of logistics as an instrument for intelligent mobility, streamlined through innovation and planning.
I am nonetheless grateful to him for including urban logistics among the aspects of urban transport and also for the support he gives to priority projects associated with logistics.
I also believe it is correct to include airports and require them to be integrated with railways and to place emphasis on developing the new concept of 'green corridors'.
As for road-pricing, which has been much referred to here, including the Eurovignette, I would of course like the Commission to bear the social impact very much in mind.
Looking forward, following on from what some of my colleagues have said on the need to diversify fuel sources, I would like to ask the Commissioner about the possibility of including hydrogenerating networks in trans-European energy networks in the future.
(GA) Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Albertini for presenting us with a very important and comprehensive Report.
I believe that this Report gives a realistic overview of the challenges facing us as we try to devise a suitable transport policy.
I would like to welcome the pledge on intermodal transport.
I come from an island where the economy is dependent on sea and air routes and I believe that this infrastructure should be connected to rail transport.
However, this is not the case in Ireland.
Rail transport isn't used to carry freight.
Since 1990 energy consumption has increased by 225% because of road transport.
In terms of the Kyoto Agreement, we are falling short.
It is clear that there is a need for a great deal of investment in mixed transport in Ireland.
However, that will not happen until the local authorities and governments change their outlook and policies.
While these policies favour increased investment in roads, they neglect the development of rail transport in not only towns and cities, but in rural areas as well.
In conclusion, I advise the Commission to recognize the right of every Member State to set their own congestion charges and taxes.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this own-initiative report Mr Albertini has emphasised the need to establish a cross-cutting policy taking all aspects into account: transport, energy and the environment.
Human movements are a source of wealth for society in various respects, economic, social and cultural, but they use energy and very often have a disastrous effect on the environment.
Every society, in particular not excluding the European Union, has to seek a balance, which is a difficult task.
It is in this context that the European Union shows its true value by playing a decisive role in the harmonious development of transport: a single European railway market, a Single European Sky, Trans-European Transport Networks, a European port policy.
By setting ambitious targets with the energy-climate package, talking about shared aims now has to be followed up by action.
To quote Plato: 'It is for us to follow the upward path and avoid the downward path'.
Coordination and cooperation are the keywords of this cross-cutting policy.
The coordination of infrastructures at European level to obtain an overall view of transport networks, cooperation with the local actors best able to take a practical and realistic view of the issues, because that is what Europe is.
The will to harmonise by pooling all efforts, by exchanging best practice in the interests of citizens and the environment, with - not to be forgotten in this somewhat eclectic list - substantial extra financial support in order to implement the priority trans-European transport projects as quickly as possible.
Above all, though, if we focus on the local aspects, it seems to me that the integrated approach can only be efficient with an intermodal approach financially supported by Europe, especially in congested metropolitan and urban areas, to ensure safe, secure and affordable mobility, in short, ecological and sustainable mobility.
(HU) Madam President, never before have human beings travelled as much as they do now.
The necessity of travelling, in addition to being a major waste of time, is a significant economic problem and a serious burden on the environment.
One third of the energy we use goes on transport.
In Europe, our primary mode of transport is the car.
In the past ten years, the number of cars per thousand people has increased from 400 to 460, while car use has risen by 18%.
In the past fifteen years, carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector have increased dramatically, in some Member States by more than 100%.
According to Commission forecasts, transport sector energy demand in the European Union will increase by at least 30% between now and 2030.
This could well spell failure in terms of meeting our Kyoto commitments.
It is a pity that road transport projects continue to receive greater emphasis in Europe than rail projects, despite the declared principles.
Bad examples are infectious: the balance has also shifted in central and eastern Europe, which used to be much more public transport-centred.
In my country, Hungary, the share of public transport had fallen to a mere 40% in 2007.
Reducing pollution caused by motor vehicles is a question of traffic management, of technology and of economics.
Expansion of the use of environmentally friendly technologies is a function of internalising environmental costs and introducing a taxation system based on carbon dioxide emissions.
Emissions-based differential take-off and landing charges are needed at airports.
Offering free parking, reduced congestion and road charges, a lower rate of vehicle taxation, vehicle duty and circulation tax for 'green' cars could set in motion a spectacular shake-up.
Expenditure on transport-related health problems is enormous.
It is unfair to make the whole of society pay for these.
I believe the costs of air and noise pollution and transport accidents in this regard, too, must be borne by the transport sector.
Thank you.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, I would like to focus on three points in Mr Albertini's excellent report.
First of all, as your rapporteur on the subject of urban mobility, I am pleased that he has already given us some highly significant keynote messages to consider on that very important subject.
I assume that we shall pursue the discussion in that direction in our committee and subsequently in the chamber too.
Vice-President Barrot, you referred to the initiatives that the Commission will be taking on this very subject in the course of the present electoral term, and I hope we shall enjoy dealing with them.
My second point relates to another matter that has already been raised, namely the internalisation of the social and environmental cost of transport operations.
Every mode of transport must cover the costs it actually generates.
In the light of this principle, great importance attaches to the issue we spoke about at the time of the Eurovignette discussion, namely the fact that those who operate heavy goods vehicles on our roads should actually pay a reasonable price, in other words all the costs they generate must be chargeable to them.
Some of my fellow Members who expressed criticism of this principle have already slipped off into the night.
I think I can say that the PPE-DE Group comprises not only supporters of Amendment 1 but also a number of opponents.
We, for our part, shall certainly vote against that amendment.
The third point to which I attach importance is referred to in paragraph 22, namely research.
The aim here is to give vehicle manufacturers clear targets, clear indications of the direction in which the European transport sector is meant to go.
Only then will they be able to deliver what we need at affordable prices when we need it.
I would like to reiterate my special thanks to Commissioner Barrot for having planned such a busy programme for the rest of this legislative term.
We need this programme, and both the environment and our transport system will be the better for it.
Let me finally say to the Parliament-basher in the back row that I have a half-hour walk every day to and from the hotel here in Strasbourg, and so I have no need of either limousines or trams.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mr Albertini on his excellent work and excellent proposals.
The matter under discussion is extremely important, and the public expects clear answers to the problem.
It is not a very simple issue, when we consider that the European Union's basic pillars incorporate the notion of the free movement of people and goods. Both are bound to grow in the future.
Obviously, too, we need to think about where we are going, how we are getting there and what sort of means we are using to do so.
The decisions we take will be enormously important.
As Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki has mentioned, it is very hard to imagine, in my country, for example, a situation in which movement in itself is dramatically restricted.
The distances are long, and people have to use their cars to get to work as there is no public transport.
When we come to consider how Parliament should behave, I agree that Parliament could set an example.
We have to think about whether we are travelling needlessly.
Can we cut back on unnecessary travel?
How are we travelling?
Parliament has an official car service which most of us use and which works very well.
We need to think, however, about what sort of cars we travel in.
What sort of fleet do Parliament, the Commission and the Council have at their disposal?
Hybrid cars could be acquired for use by Members of Parliament.
The example we set is immensely important.
We cannot expect the public or European companies to do something which we do not do ourselves.
We therefore have to set a good example.
Madam President, while the details of some individual proposals in this report require careful study in relation to the principle of subsidiarity - especially any tax-related matters - the overall aims of the report deserve, nonetheless, to be supported.
From July 2008, Ireland will see major changes to our existing annual motor tax regime and to the vehicle registration tax (VRT) system.
The new VRT system will see the introduction of a seven-band system based on carbon dioxide emissions and not on engine size.
Despite ongoing gridlock in our capital city, the Irish Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, said in the last week that congestion charges will not be considered for Dublin because the shambolic state of public transport offers little alternative to the private car.
Inadequate bus frequency, two light-rail lines that do not interconnect either with each other or with the main-line rail system, no link to the airport, no metro and still no integrated ticketing system - so much for efforts to reduce hydrocarbon use and greenhouse gas emissions!
This picture of Dublin flies in the face of the European Parliament's efforts and proposed measures to optimise the use of public transport, especially in urban areas.
(BG) Mme Chairperson, Mr. Commissioner, The sustainable transport policy, taking into account the energy and environmental aspects, includes transport infrastructure, employment through transport, mobility of people and free movement of goods.
The pan-European transport networks call for equal quality and environmental security. This implies accurate stock-taking, especially of the railways, assessment of the current condition, and targeting of measures to countries that have not reached high European standards yet.
Reliable financial instruments need to be involved.
It is particularly important to put an end to the practice of turning some new Member Statses into old vehicle depots for Europe.
This is definitely environmentally undsound.
I am always concerned when EU reports mention the names of some geographic regions and omit others.
The Black Sea Region, too, is of great importance.
Sustainable intermodal schemes are needed there, as well.
Besides, it is within the framework of this report that we could possibly discuss the charges and the traffic on the Danube Bridge between Russe and Giurgiu, between Bulgaria and Romania.
(CS) Madam President, allow me to make a comment on the debate that just took place: although most of us want to make the transport policy greener and agree that it is necessary to do so, at the same time no one wants to limit mobility.
We differ a good deal in our views of how to go about this.
We have not sorted out our priorities and that is the problem.
On the one hand we want to be sector-neutral as regards the different types of transport, and on the other hand we feel guilty for not favouring rail transport over road transport.
Can you imagine this happening without the introduction of a significant environmental tax on road freight traffic or without giving significant priority to railways?
Objections against the internalisation of external costs are raised on the grounds that it will affect competitiveness.
There are no studies available on the social impact of the introduction of a Eurovignette in road transport.
Should we not be clear, first of all, as to what our main priority is?
What about calling a Europe-wide referendum on these priorities?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be fairly brief.
I have listened with interest to the speeches on the report by Mr Albertini.
It can be said that the concerns so well expressed by Mr Albertini in his very clear and concise report are entirely in line with what the Commission and your Transport Commissioner want.
In short, it is true that mobility has to be changed rather than reduced.
That is the whole problem.
I shall not reply to each remark and observation. We have taken note of all of them.
I should, however, like to mention in passing that we need infrastructures if we are to bring about the modal shifts that are required.
I would say to Mr Albertini that that point needs to be stressed, because Europe is not sufficiently aware that it will need infrastructures and investments in order to be able to introduce the modal shifts.
Furthermore, it is true that we also need extremely advanced research into new engines and new energies if we are to meet the challenge of sustainable mobility.
I cannot let it be said, as I heard just now - although everyone was positive - that these would be pious hopes, good intentions, because I should, all the same, like to draw attention to what has already been accomplished. For instance, the classification of lorries in Euro categories based on rising standards, up to Euro 5.
It can be said that that lorry classification has enabled CO2 emissions to be reduced by 30 to 40%.
To take another example, in future the European Union wants emissions to be cut to 120g CO2/km. That is a target that the whole of the motor industry is working on at the moment.
That also leads me to repeat the very sensible remark by Mr Rack that we need to be careful, because the industry must be made fully aware of the targets and the future framework in order to adapt.
That is a point that concerns me greatly: we have to set clear objectives so that all the research and the industry as a whole comply with those objectives.
There it is, I am not going to dwell on that too much.
I shall say, of course, that the action to be taken must maintain the necessary mobility and must be effective in reducing adverse effects, whilst at the same time remaining acceptable to the public and to industry.
In June we are going to use that method to calculate the external costs and we shall see how each mode of transport - gradually, because it cannot all be done at once - can be integrated into the charges. We can then have tolls that really educate and that enlighten not just transport operators but also passengers on which modes of transport cause the most pollution and which are the most environmentally friendly.
I really hope that the Albertini report will be, if I may use that term, another Bible for everyone, because now it is absolutely essential for us to find ways to achieve this sustainable mobility.
I am grateful to Parliament for its contribution on this subject, which has been extremely valuable for the Commission.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a few seconds to thank Members for their constructive comments, not just those who have supported the report and highlighted some of its aspects, but in particular those who have commented on it and the few who have criticised it on reasoned grounds.
Particular thanks to Commissioner Barrot, not just for what he has been so kind as to say, but in particular for the very vigorous action that he is undertaking in respect of the subject matter of the report and for his willingness to enter into cooperation between Parliament and the Commission so that we can play the effective part that we are all keen to play in changing mobility - as he has rightly said in his brief statement -rather than reducing it.
Mobility reflects the progress of our civilisation, and represents what is modern about us; it represents development and progress and we should certainly not stifle it.
We simply have to improve it and use it when there is no other choice.
A final comment, one that perhaps strays somewhat from the issue that we are discussing, but one I feel I should make because it opens up prospects far greater than those we are discussing in relation to transport.
We are concerned by the pollution and all the critical problems that transport and its use entail.
We should perhaps take a more general view, especially as regards CO2 emissions and the CO2 generated by other sectors of our industrial civilisation.
I should like to quote you some figures and conclude with this simple comment: while it is true that transport accounts for 23% of total CO2 emissions throughout Europe, electricity generation accounts for 43%, industry for 19%, and residential housing and commerce for 15%.
If we want to achieve a 20% cut in emissions of these unwanted effects of our civilisation by 2020, we shall perhaps have to take more intensive action and pay more attention to other sectors as well which, as you are aware, lead the field in CO2 emissions, rather than just focusing on transport.
In that respect, nuclear is a term that cannot be avoided.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.
Amending budget No 1/2008 - Solidarity Fund - Mobilisation of the European Union's Solidarity Fund (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by KyÃ¶sti Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on Draft amending budget No 1/2008 of the European Union for the financial year 2008, Section III - Commission, and
the report by Reimer BÃ¶ge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in application of point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management - C6-0036/2008 -.
rapporteur. - (FI) Madam President, the European Solidarity Fund was created in 2002 in the wake of the disastrous floods which struck in central Europe, affecting both EU Member States and candidate countries.
At the time it was agreed the fund should be EUR 1 billion a year.
This fund was meant to bring relief to those who had suffered damage due to major catastrophes.
The extent of catastrophic damage must be at least EUR 3 billion or no less than 0.6% of the Member State's GNP.
If the damage is restricted to a small area, it could be less, but regionally it could be relatively more.
The damage now under discussion was the result of the large-scale flooding in the United Kingdom in June and July 2007.
The damage is put at EUR 4.6 billion, so it is eligible for compensation.
The Commission is proposing EUR 162 million.
In its budget, the Committee on Budgets is recommending support for providing finance in the manner the Commission is suggesting.
However, it requires Parliament to approve mobilisation of that support.
For that reason, Mr BÃ¶ge's report on the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund needs to be adopted first.
In other respects, the first amending budget mainly concerns agencies and the administrative management of the Galileo Programme.
In the budget a European Research Council Executive Agency was set up.
Its creation accords with the budgetary procedure agreed for this year.
Under the amending budget a joint executive agency, the Research Executive Agency (REA), is created, for the other programmes under the Seventh Framework Programme for research too.
This is also in line with the earlier budgetary procedure.
Similarly, the amendments to the staffing timetable for the border control agency, Frontex, which Parliament had called for have been made.
Parliament increased the funds for this agency by EUR 30 million in the budgetary procedure, and these now constitute the necessary additional funds.
The toughest problem relates to the Galileo satellite navigation programme.
Parliament's great achievement was that it succeeded in the budget negotiations in guaranteeing the programme's funding by increasing the amount set aside for it by EUR 2.4 billion for six years.
This partly came about through an adjustment to the muiltiannual financial framework.
The project thus clearly became an EU project.
Now it is a matter of administering the project.
The Commission is proposing EUR 2 million in the form of a transfer from operating appropriations to administration.
The project's administration, however, is in a mess.
It has mainly been managed in the EU by GSA, the Galileo Supervisory Authority. It task has been mainly concerned with permits and partnership discussions between the public and private sectors.
The private sector having been excluded in the initial phase, the GSA's role is unclear, as is that of the Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA).
It was at first thought that the ESA would be responsible for implementing the project's technical side, which the EU would oversee and fit out.
The division of labour between the various actors, such as the Commission and the separate agencies, is, however, unclear.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is therefore proposing in Mrs Barsi-Pataky's report that the GSA should be abolished.
Given these circumstances, the Committee on Budgets could not agree to the transfer of the appropriation to the Commission, but instead simply proposes the creation of a PM line.
The Commission promised that it would effect the transfer within the scope of its competence before Galileo's entire administration system had been agreed.
Changing the amending budget in this respect would therefore not delay the project, but it would ensure Parliament's negotiating position.
I hope that the plenary will be able to go along with the Committee's unanimous position as regards the first amending budget.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur on the 2008 budget, KyÃ¶sti Virrankoski, has really covered all the essential points.
So we are speaking today on the basis of a proposal from the Commission about the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in application of point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
While it is true that the Solidarity Fund and other special instruments do not represent large sums of money in relation to the general budget of the European Union, they ultimately serve to help stricken regions and their people in the event of natural disasters, and, as we all know, these disasters - be they storms or raging fires - have become a somewhat regular occurrence.
Before we took our decision, we in the Committee on Budgets made a point of holding a hearing, to which we invited representatives of the affected regions of the United Kingdom, of local organisations and also of the national administration.
At that hearing we were reminded very clearly of the challenges facing the stricken people and regions and of the extent of the damage caused by the flooding in June and July 2007, estimated at a total of EUR 4.6 billion.
On the basis of this hearing and our talks, we fully endorsed the Commission's proposal that EUR 162 387 000 be made available from the Solidarity Fund for this special case.
Let me also make a point of mentioning that we can expect further mobilisations of the Solidarity Fund in the coming months. In such cases, to be sure, it is not only the European Community that is called on to show solidarity: in view of the increased incidence of such disasters, the Member States should be giving more thought to preventive crisis management, in other words assessing the state of their civil-defence systems, checking how local fire brigades are equipped and examining how they can perhaps develop different strategies in future on issues such as building work in flood-prone areas.
These things are an integral part of any long-term strategy if we want to maintain our credibility.
Another requirement - and we are somewhat better placed in this respect on the present occasion than in other cases - is that we should all make it our common aim, as a matter of basic principle, to ensure that the processing of future claims on the Solidarity Fund is completed in a maximum of six months.
That is a challenge to everyone: the national authorities must submit all the requisite applications and documents within the prescribed period, the Commission must deal with the case in hand on the basis of the applicable provisions, and we in Parliament must also expedite matters by means of prompt deliberation.
Allow me to refer to one final point, which relates to the amending budget.
In view of the difficult negotiations and of the pending completion of the legislative procedure on the Galileo satellite navigation system, I strongly endorse the stipulation made by the rapporteur that the budget line created for expenditure on administrative management should be a pro memoria item.
That is a step in the right direction if the appropriate administrative structures are to be established within the Commission.
We are not yet satisfied, however, with the arrangements for future interaction between the Commission, the European Space Agency and the Galileo Supervisory Authority.
In the course of the legislative procedure, there is a need at least to indicate a way of avoiding duplication of effort and developing the appropriate management structures in the new circumstances of the Galileo satnav system.
There is still a certain need for discussion, which I hope we can satisfy as soon as possible.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on 18 January the Commission adopted the proposal for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund for the United Kingdom, and we are happy and satisfied that the Committee on Budgets' opinion is quite positive towards our proposal.
Along with amending Budget No 1/2008, we also proposed the allocation of EUR 162 million from the solidarity fund for the UK in order to compensate for the serious damage caused by last summer's floods.
As the chairman of Committee on Budgets has already said, we have recently received requests from two Member States - Greece and Slovenia - and we will probably be presenting a new proposal very soon.
Of course, this proposal is not only about the solidarity fund.
It is only the solidarity fund that will have financial implications: other elements of the proposal are more technical.
The Galileo question, of course, is very sensitive to all of us and I fully understand the concerns of the Committee on Budgets.
However, I must say that the proposal of the Committee on Budgets to change the Commission proposal will delay delivery of the solidarity fund by about one month because it will have to go back to Council for another vote, but we understand the sensitivity and we cannot argue with the decision of the Committee on Budgets on this matter.
However, I very much hope that our proposal in general will be supported this week in Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to say that I support this amending budget, and there are one or two items which I would like to comment upon.
Firstly concerning the Solidarity Fund: this, of course, was the allocation in respect of the floods in Britain in June and July last year.
Much of this flooding happened in my region, and I can testify to the appalling damage and hardship which it brought on many residents of my area.
I was interested - but not surprised - to note that this was the third largest claim in the history of the solidarity fund, the claim being EUR 4.6 billion and the allocation being to the sum of EUR 162.8 million.
I am aware that my friend and colleague Reimer BÃ¶ge said that, of course, in the grand order of things it is not a great deal of money.
Perhaps it is not, but as a gesture of solidarity, please believe me that it is well and truly appreciated, and on behalf of the people of that region, I want to express my thanks: firstly to the members of the Budget Committee, who were unanimous in their support of this aid package - which is truly a gesture of solidarity.
But may I also express my appreciation to the Commissioner and her colleagues who turned this claim around in seven months.
I thought that was a remarkable achievement, Commissioner, and I thank you for your efforts to do that.
I shall, of course, watch with interest over the next weeks and months to see how the United Kingdom Government disburses those funds, but it is clear to me that, with the increasing evidence of extreme climatic events, these issues are going to occur with a greater regularity throughout the European Union, and it is clear that, when expressing solidarity, it is in fact speed of response that is the most important element in that mechanism.
On the issue of Frontex, I also wanted to say that I support the additional funding for Frontex - we doubled the funding for the Agency.
I thought that was exactly right, and I note that this request is for the creation of 25 posts.
But I do believe that it is important that we continue to monitor the distribution of funding, to ensure that it delivers value for money.
In the same way, I supported thoroughly the Lisbon objectives which the Commission set for themselves, particularly in the field of research and development.
I therefore recognise the need for the research executive agencies; but again, I express my anxiety at the proliferation of agencies which, I have to say, historically have not been renowned for their effective delivery of value for money.
Finally, on the subject of Galileo: this new budget line will do a great deal to give greater transparency and accountability.
However, I do agree with my colleagues on the Budget Committee when we say that we will proceed with caution.
If I may say so, Madam Commissioner, this is a massive undertaking, and - borrowing some space age jargon - may I say that the Commission here is 'boldly going where no Commission has ever gone before'.
I therefore agree with my colleague Reimer BÃ¶ge when he says that we support this, but we would insist on inserting the PM line.
Mr President, I support the amending budget and am happy to do so.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am replacing Mr Titley, the leader of the Labour MEPs, tonight, but I can speak on behalf of all those MEPs in welcoming this amending budget and the decision to grant EUR 162 million to the UK regions affected by flooding.
As Mr Ashworth has said, it is a small grant towards covering the huge costs of the damage done by the floods in the UK, but we are appreciative to our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, who voted unanimously, and also to the Commission.
I understand it was the quickest payment ever made: within seven months.
