Let us get on with implementing the FLEGT action plan.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I have noted your answer, but am compelled to express my disappointment at the slow progress of the process of implementing the Forest Law Enforcement, Government and Trade (FLEGT) Plan.
Wood logged illegally in various parts of the world, such as tropical wood from the Amazon Region and Africa, is known to be traded here in the EU.
This sometimes leads to serious civil unrest and even, as previously mentioned, to people being killed.
I was in Brazil recently and had the opportunity to talk with various Brazilian social organisations.
They are extremely concerned at this state of affairs, and indeed the government and other authorities have expressed similar concerns.
I therefore feel that measures must be taken as soon as possible to put a stop to this phenomenon.
This whole process has far-reaching consequences, both for the countries illegally exporting this wood and for our own countries.
Consequently, dozens of EU businesses have drawn up a document calling for measures to prevent the continued import of illegally logged tropical wood.
This practice must be stopped.
The effects are not only social but also environmental.
We are playing a part in jeopardising the survival of key forests and biodiversity; we are having a direct influence on the climatic conditions, the people and the employment situation in both the producing countries and the importing countries; and, in so doing, we are damaging the businesses that act legally and destabilising international wood markets.
The broad goal for the regional or inter-regional bilateral agreements set out in the EUâs action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade, which the Commission tabled in 2003, was to contribute towards sustainable development.
It is therefore impossible to understand why progress has been so slow in implementing the various undertakings under this plan.
I cannot understand, for example, why a planned study into legislative options, which was to have been presented by the middle of 2004, has not been carried out; why detailed measures intended to ban imports of illegal wood and wood products, regardless of the country of origin, have been shelved; and why a network has not been set up between customs and administrative and legal authorities to facilitate the exchange of information on the illegal wood trade.
It is therefore crucial that the Commission table a detailed legislative proposal â and it says that it is drawing up such a proposal â that provides more information and that alters the legal basis of the regulation.
Parliament can then discuss this proposal and make a positive contribution to this whole process.
The political will must be there if we are to put a stop to this illegal trade, which facilitates corruption and money laundering.
Urgent action must be taken.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we look to you to take a lead.
We look, first of all, for you to get this legislation which, as you said, was approved by the Commission on to the statute books.
It is now two years since the Commission gave the approval, but where is it?
It is not stuck in this Parliament, that is for sure.
We have no say over the matter.
It is stuck in Council.
That logjam needs to be unblocked.
I hope the UK Presidency will give you support in making sure that happens but, if there are Member States which are standing in the way, which are making life difficult, then we look to you to name and shame them.
Let us have these NGOs putting pressure on them.
As Mr Bowis said, people are dying to save the forests and some Member States are just showing reluctance to get a sensible, positive measure of this kind up and running.
And where were the Commissionâs resources?
Minimal resources were being devoted to this behind the scenes.
I am told by some people that you have about one person devoted to making this legislation happen.
That is pretty minimal.
Please wave the flags, say you need more.
Last month you met a delegation of Members of this House to discuss the possibility of introducing legislative options.
I know that you are not yet convinced, but you explored some very interesting ground then.
You said you might be able to put some proposals to the Commission in September.
Can you still stand by that statement?
And have you considered the possibility of introducing legislation as a back-up means, to use your own words, as a âcarrot and stickâ to encourage countries to sign up to voluntary agreements with the threat of a more difficult regime to follow?
Commissioner, there is nothing more to be said, except that we all know that the forests are disappearing at a huge rate.
The best we can possibly hope for is to slow that pace of destruction, but we simply cannot stand by.
We need you to help us focus our efforts, produce results, and we want to give you as much support as we can in achieving that objective.
Â Â  First of all, I do not want there to be any misunderstanding, MrÂ Davies: I stand by what I said to you at our very useful and interesting meeting.
I will return in September with proposals and with a new attempt.
Like you, I find it regrettable that implementation is being delayed.
We have already debated this problem at length.
Nevertheless, I have been doing some investigating: in its FLEGT action plan, the European Union sets out its commitment to analyse the available options for supplementary measures, in particular the feasibility of legislation to monitor imports of illegally logged timber into the European Union.
The progress of this work has been monitored very closely by Parliament, which has invited the Commission to propose legislation of this kind.
Now, let us be quite clear: the analysis of these options has been delayed, but it is now in progress.
It is true that we also lack the human resources to deal with this dossier, particularly given that it is extremely difficult, but we are rather short.
A further reason for the delay, which is not so easy to remedy, is that this analysis remains a delicate and somewhat controversial subject between the various services of the Commission, which have expressed significantly divergent opinions on the best way to proceed.
I am trying to bring some order to all of this, so that we have a clearer picture.
I can tell you that the Commission is committed to reviewing and analysing the feasibility of additional legislation to support the FLEGT action plan.
I will attempt to relaunch this discussion.
I have already said that this work was held up by delays connected with confirmation of the active participation of the Member StatesÂ -Â you are clearly aware of this, as you have spoken of it yourselfÂ -Â and by our decision to concentrate our scarce resources on implementing the voluntary approach set out in the action plan.
The evaluation is in progress and is taking place in close collaboration with the Member States, since many of the potential measures are matters of national competence.
The options evaluated include public procurement policy, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, in addition to the feasibility and practical aspects of the new legislation on monitoring imports of illegally logged timber.
I hope that this work will be completed during the course of 2005.
MrsÂ Hall, you said that we should quite simply ban illegal timber.
I agree with you, but we also need to find a system that will enable us to check that legal timber is not illegal timber.
In other sectors triangular trade does exist.
I have even requested a report from the Joint Research Centre in Ispra on this subject.
I assume that you are familiar with the problem.
You should be aware that, during a very short mandate as Commissioner for Research, I went to that Joint Research Centre, where I saw some very interesting things: for example, that is where they produce the satellite maps that can show, virtually down to the nearest square metre, the crimes that are being committed under the gaze of this satellite; they also show reforestation, the quantity of trees lost, and so on. These are the kinds of technical and technological resources that we should perhaps consider implementing in order to address your concerns.
There should not be any problems within the Commission, but I will need to convince a number of Member States to agree to go down that path and to use the means at our disposal, in order to be more coercive.
As regards the legal base, the Commission considers that the voluntary import licensing system should be implemented on the basis of ArticleÂ 133 of the Treaty, on commercial policy.
Parliament and certain Member States do not share this view and suggest that ArticleÂ 175 of the Treaty, on the environment, would be a more appropriate legal base.
Why has the Commission retained ArticleÂ 133, or commercial policy, as the legal base for the regulation establishing a voluntary licensing scheme for imports of timber?
The Commission believes that this legal base is the most appropriate, inasmuch as the regulation seeks only to regulate trade in timber products between the European Union and the partner countries.
Personally, I think the Commission is right; I also believe that ArticleÂ 133 is the most appropriate.
However, do not see this as a religious war.
The most important thing is to be aware of your legitimate concernsÂ -Â which I fully shareÂ -Â that you expressed to me during our meeting.
This matter is therefore not closed; I promise you that I will bring all my leadership to bear on it.
Obviously, I cannot promise you that I will succeed, but I will do all I can to move this matter on in the direction that you want, as I share your concerns in this regard.
I will ask the Research Centre to consider what techniques might be used, for example to do what you say, because that would be a big step forward.
The establishment of some kind of certificate of origin would in itself constitute major progress.
We will still need to convince the Member States, but I promise you that I will return in September with some ideas on the issue.
I cannot promise you any more than that at the moment, but things are moving and I will also tryÂ -Â although this is not entirely in my handsÂ -Â to strengthen the taskforce responsible for this matter.
Â Â  I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Clearing and Settlement in the European Union [2004/2185(INI)] (A6-0180/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, clearing and settlement are not only the back office of the financial institutions, they are the backbone of the securities market and hence of the capital markets.
They constitute all the provisions that investors and financial operators need to hold and transfer securities.
Clearing and settlement do not affect the capital markets: they the capital markets.
They contribute to the smooth functioning of the financial world and of the economy of the European Union.
It is widely acknowledged that cross-border clearing and settlement are hindered by a number of barriers, the nature and impact of which vary, as you know.
This situation considerably increases the costs of clearing and settlement at European Union level in comparison to national systems, and particularly in comparison to the situation in the United States.
It also increases the risks, legal and otherwise, of cross-border transactions.
It therefore clearly constitutes a major hindrance to cross-border investments, to the diversification of portfolios, and so on.
It is undeniable that we have not yet achieved a European Union market in this field, with the result that we cannot benefit from the advantages of the growth in the European Union that an efficient clearing and settlement system could bring, and that we will not be able to compete effectively at global level.
To put it bluntly, the objective of all issuers of securities being able to reach all investors is still a long way from being achieved.
That is why the Commission welcomes the interest that the European Parliament is taking in this issue in responding to the Commission communication of AprilÂ 2004.
The Commissionâs declared objective is to promote the creation of secure and efficient clearing and settlement systems in the European Union, guaranteeing conditions of fair competition for the various issuers.
We want to eliminate the obstacles to cross-border clearing and settlement, and thus to enable clearing and settlement service providers, if they so wish, to access other markets in the European Union and provide their services in those markets, within a commonly accepted regulatory and supervisory framework.
In other words, we want to create a genuine market in clearing and settlement.
Our aim is to make cross-border clearing and settlement just as cheap, just as efficient and just as secure as the national clearing and settlement systems in the European Union.
In 2004, the communication launched very extensive consultations on our initial approach to the policy to be adopted in this field.
Our policy sought not simply to manage the current market situation but to improve the future environment for clearing and settlement in the European Union.
This environment would enable the operators to implement their strategy, firstly without being hindered by superfluous barriers, and secondly in full compliance with essential public interest objectives such as the security of the systems, fair competition, efficiency and so on. The aim, in cooperation with the private and public sectors, was to eliminate the Giovannini barriers.
In addition, we considered it essential to ensure that clearing and settlement service providers were not prevented from entering other EU markets and providing their services there, nor faced with unreasonable conditions when they wished to do so, simply because the competent authorities refused to recognise the equivalence of the regulatory systems or supervisory practices of other Member States.
If this type of barrier were not lifted, the benefits of lifting the Giovannini barriers, which is the responsibility of the private sector, would be diluted or not fully exploited.
These are complex issues, which is why we are being rigorous about applying our twofold commitment to have ongoing consultation and an in-depth impact assessment.
With regard to ongoing consultation, we have set up three groups that are working very intensively.
The CESAME Group monitors and encourages the progress made by the private sector towards lifting barriers.
As you are aware, this groupâs authority and visibility are already indisputable.
The Legal Certainty Group examines issues related to cross-border legal certainty with respect to legal compatibility when securities are held via intermediaries.
The Fiscal Compliance expert group (FISCO) examines cross-border differences with regard to fiscal compliance and aims to reduce the burden of fiscal compliance in this field.
In order to assess the possible impact of any regulatory intervention, a team representing all the services of the Commission is currently conducting a huge impact assessment with a view to gaining a robust instrument, before deciding whether it is appropriate to propose a directive on settlement and clearing and, if so, of course, to determine its precise content.
This approach corresponds perfectly to the point of view expressed in MrsÂ Kauppiâs report.
We think that we will be able to meet the deadline of the first half ofÂ 2006 for completing the impact assessment.
The scale of our commitment to consultation and impact assessment is also illustrated by the contact that we have had with the various rapporteurs responsible for this report.
Following an initial draft report on the basis of relatively clear-cut theories, all of the parties concernedÂ âÂ the rapporteur, the experts advising the Commission, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission secretariat and staffÂ âÂ put a great deal of effort into this matter.
This openness to debate, dialogue and consultation on the part of the many parties involved in this matter is a model of cooperation for the work that we do together and I would like to thank the European Parliament for taking this approach.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a pity that Mr McCreevy cannot be here.
It would have been nice to talk to him personally.
When I took over this report from Mrs Villiers, who deserves considerable thanks for her thorough approach and hard work, it was quite clear to me what the outcome should be.
It is even clearer now.
As we know, the Commission recently produced a Green Paper on financial services.
It explicitly stated that any new European proposal for financial services legislation and implementing rules should pass a number of economic tests.
They involve a careful study of the expected economic benefits as well as âthe extent to which measures facilitate cross-border business and enhance the competitiveness of Europeâs financial markets, while, at the same time, protecting internal stabilityâ.
The Commission paper also states that there is clear market evidence suggesting that genuine financial integration is under way in many key sectors, such as in clearing and settlement. That sentiment is strongly echoed in our daily dealings with the financial services industry.
The report before you sends a clear signal to the markets that the achievements will not be hampered by unnecessary regulation.
That message is a result of a broad cross-party compromise and it has the strong backing of market participants.
Some of the amendments that have been tabled depart from this functional approach and seek to prejudge the need for regulation.
I appreciate and respect the cultural differences in regulatory philosophy, which lead some to these conclusions.
However, it would be a serious mistake to apply this philosophy in the case of clearing and settlement.
We have agreed to wait for the results of the regulatory impact assessment and of the different working groups set up by the Commission, to which you referred, Commissioner, in order to determine whether there is any market failure and whether a directive is the right solution after all.
More importantly, our clear signal in support of the developments that are taking place in the clearing and settlement markets should not be diluted with confused concerns regarding potential developments sometime in the future, for which no evidence currently exists.
I refer here to some Membersâ wish to implement competition rules for clearing and settlement service providers.
There is no need for that at this stage, as evidence suggests that markets are, in fact, generally developing towards more open and transparent competition.
The call for new competition legislation is a misguided call for a short-term directive, with the risk that it will develop into wide-ranging legislation on clearing and settlement before we have the results of the different Commission impact studies.
Instead, the plenary tomorrow should fully endorse the committee line, that we should focus our efforts on the removal of the âGiovannini Barriersâ.
Here I fully support the initiatives of the Commission.
The removal of such barriers promotes openness, equal access and transparency in the industry.
We should not seek to implement some arbitrarily defined single utility or service model across the EU, as that would hamper ongoing market-led cross-border integration and consolidation, along with the tangible benefits accruing to customers of clearing and settlement services.
As the Commissioner has stated, this is not a technical, minor issue.
It is a very important field of the single market.
I fully appreciate Commission efforts in this respect.
I would like to thank all your staff who have worked hard with Parliament in reaching this compromise.
I hope we can continue this very fruitful cooperation in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, clearing and settlement is a subject that looms large in the European debate, although its actual economic importance and its true structural effect on the markets are sometimes overestimated.
It is certainly a good thing that our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has reached a sound compromise on this subject and I would like to thank MrsÂ Villiers and also my colleague, MrsÂ Kauppi, for that.
This compromise relies above all on market players finding solutions to the problems that arise.
This is a good approach because this sector has not broken down: it is operating effectively.
Let us therefore retain free competition as a basic principle, so that this sector can evolve, innovate and, above all, remain competitive at international level.
We know that the Commission is in the process of assessing the need for legislation in this field.
I would strongly encourage it to use the impact assessment to demonstrate the necessity, the costs and the benefits of each measure.
At this stage of the debate, the Commission has a duty to go beyond general explanations and to show all the stakeholders that its actions are resulting in real progress.
I do not need to remind you that publishing this impact assessment before proposing a text seems to me to be the only valid way of ensuring an open discussion on this topic.
For its part, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agrees that priority should be given to removing the barriers defined in the Giovannini reports.
This aspect is worth emphasising, since the Commission, in its communication, showed very little enthusiasm for attacking the legal barriers that are responsible for the excessive expense of cross-border transactions.
In contrast, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is not convinced of the benefits of greater regulation and rejects the concept of public utility for this sector.
The report itself prefers the concepts of non-discriminatory access and transparency of pricing structures.
This too is a good balance and Parliament has a duty to accept it.
My final point, MrÂ President, is that the additional amendments tabled in the plenary seek primarily to distort competition between the various different types of institutions and, in fact, to reduce competition in the sector, which must not be the aim.
In my view, these amendments should therefore be rejected.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, on her well-balanced report, which is supported by most of the political groups and a large majority of the financial services industry.
She has been active in finding compromises.
We are still working on it: Mrs StarkeviÄiÅ«tÄ from the Liberal Group, Mrs BerÃšs and myself So you can see that the issue of clearing and settlement in the EU is really a ladiesâ world.
Mrs Kauppi took over from another lady, Mrs Villiers, who left the European Parliament to become a Member of the House of Commons in Britain.
My Group was not very happy with her approach.
In the explanatory statement of this report you can still find a reminder of her approach, which was very much anti-legislation and principally and vehemently against a directive on clearing and settlement.
My Group and the PPE-DE Group do not exclude the need for a directive.
This was also the starting point in the Andria report from a previous parliamentary term.
We have chosen not to engage in an ideological battle about whether to have legislation, but to list pragmatically the issues to be taken into account politically, to assess the necessity, feasibility and desirability of legislation or other forms of regulation, and to wait for the factual impact assessments that the Commission is currently carrying out before making up our minds definitely.
This is a more pragmatic and wise approach and I am happy that we managed to achieve it.
Nevertheless, I wish to repeat some concerns.
I should like to see a decent system of integrated European supervision â also in relation to competition rules.
The Commission should keep a close eye on anti-competitive developments that could take place in this fragile clearing and settlement market, particularly in relation to possible consolidation of stock exchanges in Europe.
I have noted that the Bundeskartelamt has just given the green light for a possible merger of Deutsche BÃ¶rse and the London Stock Exchange, although this is no longer a real option.
The UK Competition Commission will very soon deliver its opinion on this possible merger or on the other combination of Euronext and LSE.
However, we have already raised the question of whether the European Commission should be more proactive and not leave it to the national competition authorities to judge the developments, because the financial markets â in particular the post-market activities â can have an enormous impact on these markets.
At least we should monitor the various aspects from the point of view of competition and the impact on the smooth functioning of the European financial markets.
My Group does not exclude competition rules as a consequence.
Unbundling of different elements in the clearance and settlement value chain is not something we propose at this stage, but I would like to have more assurance that cross-subsidies do not exist in this industry and that custodian banks are free to transfer securities outside their home conglomerates.
Let me finish by saying that CESR â the Committee of European Securities Regulators â has already been active on this issue, which has not always been welcomed by our committee, because what it was doing was not very transparent.
It must be said that at least it has been proactive.
I hope we can improve on the cooperation and the further elaboration of this regulation on clearing and settlement.
Â Â  . This important financial question has ended up in women's hands in Parliament, but women usually do everything very methodically.
I believe that we will be able to begin to solve this problem, as it is one of the European Union's economic policy decisions that has already been the subject of lengthy debate, although the results have yet to be seen.
It is the cause of the backwardness of the European Union's financial markets compared with other financial markets in the world.
We need to make considerable progress.
What needs to be done to achieve this progress?
Firstly, I want to address market participants.
They must make mutual concessions and begin to look for common ground and compromise.
I understand perfectly that it is difficult to renounce those positions that have already been reached as settled systems on a national level, as this is linked to new expenditures, as well as problems and uncertainty in the future.
For this reason, we the Members of the European Parliament must reach an agreement and clearly show the market the way to develop a clearing and settlement system, so that it is possible to ensure the forecasts and clarify these predictions.
We must assure that we solve the questions related to price structure clarity, levels and the true rights of access for all participants, as well as those questions related to equal competition in the market.
These are the three main segments.
If we manage to reach an agreement (and I trust that we shall), then national governments will be obliged to act more decisively to remove the obstacles indicated in the accounts.
I doubt whether any national government can afford not to listen attentively to requests from the financial sector.
After all, they are the governments' main creditors.
I would also like to address the Commission on this point: you now have sufficient work groups and the power for all technical decisions, legislation and amendments to be adopted as quickly as possible.
Why do we need to hurry?
Now is a perfect opportunity for the European Union's market to become the world leader.
Probably most specialists know that uncertainty lingers in the US market due to the methods of regulation chosen.
The countries of Asia are still forming their markets.
We have a splendid chance to break into the lead, and must not miss such an opportunity.
Thus, our compromise today and mutual concessions may yield significant material benefits and recognition as a separate, strong power in the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, I find myself wondering if the Commissioner feels at home in amongst all these women.
I do not mind admitting that I rather do.
Recent years in the European Union and the United States have shown that financial markets are very sensitive and sometimes react strongly to external developments.
The stability of the markets cannot be taken for granted, but the effective management and smooth settlement of transactions on the basis of clear legislation does help to foster it, and so Mrs Kauppiâs report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities transactions does deserve our undivided attention.
Securities trading is organised in complex ways, and it is also difficult to monitor.
Solutions imposed by means of a directive do not always produce the desired outcome.
I should like to stress that solutions must be transparent and verifiable if confidence in the financial markets is to be maintained.
In this connection, it is vital to monitor the development of aspects of competition.
The resolution of 2003 contains the urgent request for more studies into aspects of competition with a view to developing a transparent market for the settlement of securities transactions.
I should like to back the rapporteurâs comments on the ramifications of introducing a directive.
The aim is to remove the Giovanini obstacles, but those can also be kept in check without a directive, by means of coordination and consultation.
I should also like to point out that another cross-border issue, the removal of obstacles to cross-border payments, was tackled very successfully at the time and also involved a complex number of organisations, rules and interests, thus demonstrating that it is possible to remove obstacles that appear virtually insuperable.
It is therefore time for the numerous settlement costs that hamper the internal market for securities in its cross-border activities to be done away with.
Finally, I should like to thank Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi once again for the work they have done on this directive.
I think they have produced an excellent piece of work that will help us move forward.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like, in turn, to salute and emphasise the excellent quality of MrsÂ Kauppiâs work.
This is a divisive subject, but we have succeeded in setting aside our national interests in order to reach, in my view, a sound and constructive compromise that will enable us to remove the existing barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement transactions.
This compromise is based on the idea of not pre-empting the results of the impact assessment currently being conducted by the European Commission.
Nevertheless, we felt it was important to remind the Commission of the principles that should guide the consolidation of this sector, which is so essential to a robust and smoothly functioning European banking system and thus to the financing of our economy.
First of all, free competition.
The system must guarantee undistorted competition between the various operators, whatever their size or activities.
I am pleased that the text does not rule out the separation of activities, when that same separation is advocated in all other industrial sectors as a means of avoiding cross-subsidisation and the dumping that ensues.
In addition, I hope that the Commission will be able to conduct a proper examination of dominant positions in the market, including in cases where turnover is below the required threshold, but where the impact of such mergers on our economies would certainly justify such an examination.
Next, transparency: even though our compromise does not, at this stage, allow me to recommend the separation of the various different post-market activities, it is vital to reaffirm that transparent pricing structures are an essential guarantee for those in this sector who might benefit from fair and undistorted competition.
Next, security, since the major challenge here is of course to ensure that the European financial system is secure and can guard against both systematic and operational risks, and also against the criminal activities of certain parties.
We therefore refuse, at this stage, to rule out any instrument, directive or free organisation of the market, or any model, with or without separation of activities, that could be used to consolidate post-market activities.
Nevertheless, I think it is likely that a legislative text will be necessary in order to remove legal and fiscal barriers, if appropriate to adapt the European rules on competition to these activities and, finally, to provide the transparency and accounting separation necessary to the existence of fair competition.
I will conclude by saying that it is time to make progress in this field, because European consolidation is underway, without supervision. Having successfully harmonised the markets, we urgently need to harmonise the post-market sector if we want to benefit from all our work in the context of the financial services action plan.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you for your remarks and comments on this important report.
Your contributions clearly confirm the importance of the issue, the essential role of cooperation between the public and private sectors, and also the need for an in-depth analysis prior to any subsequent decision on the possibility of legislation.
I think that this approach is perfectly in line with that of the Commission in the context of the internal market.
New legislation is only justified if the social and economic benefits are clearly established.
We are pleased that we will be able to continue the discussions and the exchange of information with Parliament as we receive more specific results from the various expert groups and from our impact assessment exercise.
To conclude, the Commission is satisfied with the final report that will be put to the vote in tomorrowâs plenary sitting.
We think it is balanced and open.
It supports our impact assessment exercise and is open to any well-founded new proposals that the Commission might put forward on the basis of the results of the impact assessment.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on progress made towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania with a view to the next progress report.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be with you here at this hour.
I am sure we all agree that quality compensates for quantity.
The urgent item concerns the elections that took place in Bulgaria on 25 June this year.
It is in the interest of Bulgaria to rapidly form a stable coalition government capable of delivering on the reforms necessary for EU accession.
Whichever coalition is formed, work must continue in Bulgaria towards meeting all commitments made during the accession negotiations.
We understand that there is a broad consensus across the party political spectrum on this objective.
The new government should present an EU integration programme for implementation on all pending issues.
I also note that President Parvanov yesterday signed a degree recalling the Parliament for Monday, 11 July, even though, under the Constitution, he had until 25 July to do so.
So, encouragingly, there are serious efforts to keep the preparations moving on and to limit as far as possible the interruption caused by the elections.
We also understand that there are plans to keep the Parliament working through the summer holiday period to allow progress in the key areas of accession preparations.
In my speech to the Bulgarian Parliament some weeks ago, I encouraged the members of the Bulgarian Parliament to use part of their summer holidays for urgent legislative work and take off for the Black Sea coast only once the EU-related work has been done.
I am glad that the response was positive and glad to find this kind of European motivation in Bulgaria.
It is the sovereign decision of the European Parliament to decide on the granting of observer status.
However, representatives from Bulgaria and Romania can play a key role in informing their citizens on EU matters, as well as informing us about their countries.
That is a case in point of the evolving European democracy, which is a very dear objective to this House.
Since the closing of negotiations in December 2004, both Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress in meeting the accession requirements.
However, the Commissionâs ongoing monitoring exercise clearly shows that they can spare no efforts.
Ensuring compliance with the accession requirements by January 2007 will pose a real challenge over the next 17 months.
Every day, every week and every month counts for both Bulgaria and Romania.
For Bulgaria, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, the environment and agriculture will be of decisive importance.
Similarly, in the case of Romania, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, especially the reform of the judiciary system and the fight against corruption, competition and state aid, the environment and agriculture will be crucial.
In June, the Commission sent early warning letters or âyellow cardsâ to both Bulgaria and Romania in which we indicated areas of serious shortcomings.
There were five such areas for Bulgaria and seven for Romania.
In conclusion, for the moment the jury is still out.
The Commission will continue to monitor both countriesâ progress closely and there is a constant flow of Commissioners and Commission officials to both Bulgaria and Romania.
They are there not for fun but for serious monitoring and the Commission relies on its characteristic objectivity and professionalism in the monitoring exercise.
The next significant step will be the comprehensive monitoring report, which will be issued on 25 October.
That will be an extremely crucial checkpoint for both Bulgaria and Romania.
I will underline what both President Barroso and I have said, which reflects the position of the Commission.
If necessary, the Commission would not hesitate to recommend the use of the safeguard clauses of postponement provided for in the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are certain things I would like to reiterate in order to firmly repudiate the insinuations and deliberate disinformation spread in recent days by the Liberals and Social Democrats about the reasons for this debate.
Why are we having this debate?
We are having it because the Conference of Presidents, having already decided to invite representatives from Romania and Bulgaria to come, one year ahead of their countriesâ accessions, to observe the work of this House and take part in it, suddenly reviewed the decision and â the Social Democrats having changed their minds â overturned it.
We are having this debate because, when the Conferenceâs resolution was revised, a date was set that anticipated the Commissionâs progress report and hence also the naming of a final date for the countriesâ accession, which means that they, and the countries that joined us in 2004, are not being treated equally.
We are also having it because the President of this House failed, on Monday, to inform us of the fact that he had already sent them a letter of invitation.
The issue has never been about when the accession of Bulgaria and Romania is to take place.
The political decision has been taken.
Now that we have decided what to do, nobody wants to apply the brakes.
Like most of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I voted in favour of the accession date for Romania and Bulgaria being 1 January 2007; what happens after that has also been decided.
The facts of the situation do, though, lead me to regard the decision by the Conference of Presidents as both premature and wrong.
I find it particularly regrettable that the President, on Monday, withheld from us important information concerning his actions.
Nobody wants to disinvite anyone we have already invited, and we look forward to having them working with us.
Our sole concern was and is with the issue of whether we take ourselves seriously, of whether the matter in hand is more important than the date, of whether equal treatment is more important than the small change of day-to-day politics.
The question of how we treat one another and the candidates for accession is too important to be handled with so much emotion, and to be the subject of so much disinformation, as we have seen from our competitors and rivals in this House since Monday.
Â Â  .
I am going to begin by refuting what my fellow Member, Mr Karas, said concerning disinformation.
I come from Hungary, one of the new Member States that was able to participate as an observer in the work of Parliament from the time the Accession Treaty was signed.
We would like the same to happen now, too.
Given that both Romania and Bulgaria signed the Treaty of Accession on 25 April, the road has been open for them too â in my view â from that day onwards.
The other comment I would like to make to my fellow Member, relates to âhow seriously we take ourselvesâ.
The Conference of Presidents â a body democratically elected by us in this House â decided on 9 June to send the letter of invitation to the representatives of the two countries in question.
I therefore think that we will be taking ourselves seriously if we keep our word regarding this letter, and actually welcome our new colleagues warmly to the Parliament from 26 September.
Aside from this, it is my opinion that on 25 October, when the monitoring report is issued, it would be a pleasure (for you too, I am sure,) if our fellow representatives were able to participate as observers in the work of the sitting.
After all, it is only by doing this that they will be able to take home first-hand news of areas where there are still shortcomings.
Only by being here with us will they be able to obtain first-hand information regarding their progress in eliminating the shortcomings mentioned by Commissioner Olli Rehn, on the legislative work under way all summer in Bulgaria, and on the implementation of existing legislation.
If they know what the problem is and how to solve it; if they know what proposals are being put forward (or reservations expressed) concerning them by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) or European Democrats or by the other side; if they are here and we are able to work together with them.
This is why I think we should welcome them, and I agree with what Commissioner Olli Rehn said regarding preparedness.
Eighteen months is indeed a long time.
We had less time, but the biggest reservation concerning these two countries continues to be that they are less advanced in terms of meeting the accession requirements than the ten countries that most recently acceded.
For this reason, I think that in their case eighteen months is not a long time.
By the time of their accession on 1 January 2007, they must learn how to do the work that we do here, taking each otherâs words into account and taking each other seriously.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in matters relating to enlargement, I do believe that quality should matter more than quantity.
The development and stability of the continent of Europe is to a large degree dependent on the simultaneous deepening and enlargement of the European Union.
Particularly in the Balkans, every extra square metre of European soil that sustains democracy, the rule of law and human rights also adds to the space in which conflicts can be peacefully resolved.
Enlargement must not, however, be taken too fast.
Every country must fulfil the requisite accession criteria: not only on paper but also in practice, in a reality that the people can apprehend.
Even though Bulgaria and Romania have made great strides since the fall of their Communist regimes, I find it regrettable that neither has yet developed much in the way of a political culture.
There are still too many problems involved in doing away with the cumbersome bureaucracy, despite the positive efforts that have been made to that end.
What is worthy of criticism is the failure to make much headway in reforming the justice system, the widespread corruption in the police and the judiciary, considerable shortfalls in the integration of minorities, the poor economic development and social and environmental problems.
The shocking success of the extreme right-wing Ataka party in the Bulgarian elections, which got into parliament with 8% of the vote, has done nothing to improve the overall political climate.
It is to be feared that this will make the task of forming a government more difficult and further slow the progress of reforms.
What is important is that we send a signal to those who hold responsibility in both countries.
Unlike most members of my group, I am persuaded that we should invite observers to this House only after the progress report has appeared and a decision on accession has been taken.
We should make clear to the governments in Bucharest and Sofia the fact that major reforms are still needed and that the sprint down the home straight to accession will not be accomplished without effort.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we called for this debate was that we wanted an opportunity to discuss at what point it would be right to invite observers.
Let me start by pointing out that it was not the plenary that took this decision, but the Conference of Presidents.
This is a highly political decision, and so there cannot fail to be some doubts about this.
The proper place for decisions such as this one is in this plenary and in broad daylight, and it is not very democratic for them to be taken by the Conference of Presidents and behind closed doors.
Turning to the matter in hand, Mr HorÃ¡Äek is quite right to draw attention to the continuing deficiencies in the processes of Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession.
We all want Romania and Bulgaria to become Member States of the EU; about that there is not the slightest doubt.
If, though, we impose conditions on their accession, we must ourselves take those conditions seriously.
I would add that one reason why the results from the French and Dutch referenda were so devastating was that many members of the public get the impression that, although we attach conditions to a countryâs accession, we do not ourselves take those conditions seriously.
That is why the enlargement process has got completely out of hand; the fact is that we cannot cope with enlarging the EU and deepening it both at the same time, and we must now be very firm in giving priority to deepening it.
Even so, it sent the wrong message to invite these countries to send observers over a year before an accession the date for which has not yet been fixed.
It is, after all, quite possible â as the Commissioner himself has just hinted â that accession will be put back a year in consequence of the situation that Mr HorÃ¡Äek has described so accurately.
Are the observers, then, to be with us in this House for two and a half years?
That would surely be inappropriate, to say the least, and so the right thing to do would indeed be to take the decision only once the progress report has been produced.
It is for that reason that we want to discuss that now.
Â Â  There is no question that the accession process must not be allowed to come to a halt, given that all of us believe Romaniaâs accession is necessary as the only possible means of providing this people, who have suffered so many trials and tribulations, with reasonable prospects for the future at last.
It can provide a solution to many as yet unresolved problems; many Romanian children â both Roma and non-Roma â may be freed from the dangers of poverty as a result; environmental protection, including the issue of Rosia Montana (Verespatak) may â I hope â be resolved in a European manner.
Perhaps Romaniaâs Hungarian minority may even gain independence.
Parliament must play a key role in this process.
We must be rigorous in calling Romania to account, as problems are not solved by sweeping them under the carpet.
The Commissionâs progress report in October provides the last chance to resolve any dilemmas that persist.
The issue is such a serious one and our task so laden with responsibility that we cannot allow it to become the subject of political jousting between parties.
The accession process must not be allowed to stall.
At the same time, accession is only really meaningful if every citizen of Romania gains from it â including the 1.7Â million-member Hungarian minority.
For this to become a reality in everyday life, and not just a pretty catch-phrase, compliance with the accession commitments is crucial.
It is this that will bring the much-needed modernisation to Romania at every level.
This is why your responsibility is huge, Commissioner, when preparing the report, and so is ours as a Parliament, when it comes, we hope, to deciding once again on the report.
These are the really crucial issues.
As you said, Commissioner, âevery day, every week, every month countsâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much regret that we are having this debate at this time, as it sends a confusing and essentially negative message to the people of Bulgaria.
I must say that, as Parliamentâs rapporteur on Bulgaria, I was not consulted or even informed about any suggestion that parliamentary observers should be delayed or indeed that some fresh emphasis should be placed on the possibility of delaying Bulgariaâs accession until 2008.
At the last meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Brussels on 21 June, attended by Commissioner Rehn, I asked for and received an assurance of the commitment to the timetable for enlargement, in spite of the failure of the European Constitution.
I recall the Commissionerâs words that Bulgaria and Romania were the last enlargement, not the next enlargement.
Their accession is guaranteed.
The question, perhaps, is when exactly?
We all recognise that much still needs to be done if Bulgaria is to be ready by 2007, but the task is eminently achievable.
The one mechanism for delaying accession is the safeguard clause.
In the case of Bulgaria, unlike Romania, this would require a unanimous decision of the Council.
I see no merit, therefore, in raising any false spectre of delay.
I remain optimistic that Bulgaria will accede on 1Â January 2007.
I have always underlined the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits and that the fates of Bulgaria and Romania should not be inextricably tied together.
It is widely accepted that Bulgaria has fewer problems than Romania.
I am only too aware that the elections in Bulgaria on 25 June have produced an unclear result.
The process of building a government coalition is urgently under way, with a view to convening the Parliament on 11 July.
The debate tonight merely adds to uncertainty, both in government circles and among the citizens of Bulgaria.
They are even beginning to think they are not wanted.
I strongly reassured them.
What is required in Bulgaria is continuity, stability, commitment and clarity, not uncertainty and negativism.
On the question of the observers â and I hope you will bear with me as the rapporteur for Bulgaria â I agree with the Commissioner and thank him when he says that the arrangements for the observers are a matter for this Parliament.
It was confirmed to me in writing just two weeks ago on 16 June by the leader of the PPE-DE Group.
He said as follows: âThe Conference of Presidents has decided on its last meeting to invite the observers from both accession countries Romania and Bulgaria to join the European Parliament for the September II session in Strasbourgâ, which means from 26 September onwards.
Observers from last yearâs ten accession states had been invited to join us as soon as possible after signature of the Accession Treaty.
That is the precedent we should follow.
Any other decision would send an unhelpful signal to our Bulgarian and Romanian friends.
I very much look forward to welcoming them here in September as observers and as full Members from January 2007.
Â Â  Mr President, our Parliament overwhelmingly approved the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria to full membership of the European Union during our plenary session in April.
The week before, our Parliamentâs JPC delegation, chaired by my group colleague Mr PodestÃ , visited our Romanian parliamentary colleagues and met with the President, the Prime Minister and the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers.
On 9 June the Conference of Presidents sent the invitation to the Romanian and Bulgarian Parliaments to nominate their European Parliament observers and for them to take up their duties on 26 September.
Last week I was invited to return to Bucharest to address the appointed observers.
I regret the European Parliament appears just now not to have maintained a consistent common approach, and that my own Group at present may not be wholly associated with the joint motion for a resolution to be voted tomorrow.
I have had the privilege of belonging to the PPE Group for over 15 years.
It is a privilege I firmly intend to preserve.
I hope, even at this hour, we may come back to a common agreed position.
We have given our word, expressed in our name by the President of our Parliament to the observers, that they should take up their duties from 26 September.
If we were to go back on our word, what signal would that send to Romania; to those brave statesmen, politicians and public servants who are struggling to bring democracy, economic, administrative and legal reforms?
They regard the prospect of EU membership as the guarantee that they will achieve their goal.
Let us remember the difficult history of these countries.
In Bucharest, before the Senate House, opposite the Royal Palace, there is a memorial inscribed with the words âGlorie martirilor nostriâ dated December 1989.
It commemorates the fact that over 1 000 young people, students and soldiers lost their lives demonstrating and defending the demands for freedom.
How should we honour their memory?
This moment of uncertainty in the EU is a time for our Parliament to show courage and perseverance.
We have given our word.
We intend to abide by it and welcome the Romanian observers as promised on 26 September this year so that together we may work for a further successful enlargement of our European Union.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, we are in favour of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. The speed of the accession process depends solely on the candidate countries and we respect the efforts currently being made in Sofia and Bucharest to this end.
With regard to the admission of observers to Parliament, however, I would echo precisely what MrÂ Nassauer said.
We must step down from our ivory tower and consider the consequences of the decisions that we, and in particular the authorities of this Parliament, are taking.
It is quite clear that we cannot accept observers prior to the Commissionâs report, and that we cannot accept them for Romania and Bulgaria earlier than we did for the other accession countries, that is a year before the proposed date of accession.
That is why we formally support the motion tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
We consider it to be extremely opportune in both political and legal terms.
I would add, MrÂ President, Commissioner, that in general I think that, given the crisis that Europe is currently experiencing and the distrust and suspicion that many people are showing towards the European institutions, now is the time for consolidation and reflection, not a headlong rush forward.
That is why I said myself that I was astounded at the way in which the Commission prepared the negotiating mandate with Turkey.
I think that the European institutions are living a thousand leagues away from the reality of the European people.
We must rejoin the reality of the European people, and to do that, Commissioner, we need to re-examine the negotiating mandate that you prepared with Turkey and, in order to re-examine it and to give us time to do so, we need to delay the opening of negotiations.
Consolidation will mean more Europe.
A headlong rush will mean a dispersed Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, the matter discussed this evening is a sovereign decision of the Parliament and I have, on behalf of the Commission, nothing to add to the points presented previously.
Â Â  I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6-0131/2005) by Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE +) (COM(2004)0621 â C6-0127/2004 â 2004/0218(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, most importantly, the rapporteur, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, for her detailed and constructive report.
My thanks also to the honourable members of the Committee on Budgets and Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives for their contribution to the report on LIFE +.
LIFE + is the financial instrument for applying Community environmental policy proposed by the Commission for the period 2007-2013.
Alongside application, the programme has resources for improving environmental governance and for financing information and communication actions.
This proposal is a positive arrangement for financing the environment.
As the reports which the Commission prepared for the Council made clear, LIFE + makes provision for an average annual increase in financing of 21% compared with current levels.
In addition, it makes provision for the new programme to shift from a project-based approach to an approach based on national programmes.
This safeguards greater flexibility for the Member States, so that they can deal with their most pressing environmental needs.
This approach implies even greater subsidiarity than at present.
Thus the regional and local factors which often lead the way in the application of environmental legislation will be able to have their say on the planning and application of the programme.
I am aware of Parliament's evaluation of the Commission proposal.
However, the Commission considers that most spending on the environment can be better financed by the financing institutions which are very strong financially, by which I mean programmes for the Structural Funds and rural development programmes.
So far there have been three noteworthy developments in our efforts to safeguard the integration policy: firstly, the adoption on 21 June of the regulation on rural development; secondly, the strategic guidelines on rural development relating to the regulation, in which clear reference is made to Natura 2000, and thirdly, the strategic guidelines on regional policy which the Commission adopted last Tuesday and which concern the protection of nature and species.
Consequently, the Commission is implementing the policy of integration in the environmental sector.
LIFE + will not be able to undertake projects of the scale and breadth for which provision is made in the programmes in question, which is why LIFE + is being called on to supplement these programmes by focusing on the development of environmental policy, as often called for by Parliament, by supporting the exercise of policy, a point on which Parliament has frequently expressed an interest, by improving environmental governance with the participation of civil society and by disseminating information, so that European citizens can understand the objective and repercussions of environmental legislation.
These objectives coincide with the wishes expressed by Parliament and, through it, by European citizens, which is why I consider that the Commission proposal is the right proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly allow me, as rapporteur, to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety as a whole for the work that it has done.
I should also like to thank its chairman for the support that he gave us in our work and, above all, the shadow rapporteurs, who really helped me to seek a compromise in order to propose something sensible and substantial.
I should like very sincerely and officially to thank the whole of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for following my strategy, so as to endow the Union with the necessary means to fulfil its environmental policies.
Overall, I believe that we have succeeded in gaining recognition, beyond the confines of our committee, for the fact that words are no longer enough for the environment and that financial means are required, as they are for every other policy.
I believe that, on that issue too, the message has got through.
I should, moreover, like to point out that, during a debate this week, one of your colleagues, Commissioner, reminded us that we should not lose sight of the main issue.
He is quite right and we are not losing sight of the main issue, as the main issue, today, really is the protection of our planet, because it is unique, because it is fragile, because it is suffering from the pressure we put on it, and we know this full well.
Today, with the European Union, we have decided to stop the haemorrhaging: we have to save what can be saved and restore what has been damaged.
The European Union is aware of the challenge that it has set itself.
It has already done battle and emerged victorious: Kyoto is the battle that it won, a battle for its signature, initially, and a battle for ratification later on.
We can hope today that the G8 will also shoulder its responsibilities with the European countries that are going to push for measures to be taken against climate change.
Neither, Commissioner, must there be any weakening of the Unionâs resolve to protect the environment.
On that issue, we have been rather anxious since Monday, since your president, MrÂ Barroso, made his statements asserting that the environment and the strategies related to it are too costly.
We believe that this really is a poor assessment.
The damage, we know, is global.
It is happening and the longer we wait to intervene, the higher the price that we will pay, as we all know.
It is therefore up to us, Parliament, to convince the Council and the Commission that, even in lean times, investing in the environment is, as it were, a prudent subscription to an insurance policy, indeed a life-insurance policy, against the threats weighing on our environment.
This report on LIFE + is without doubt very important since it concerns the sinews of war: it is a financial instrument.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety supports LIFE +, but we wish to improve it and we have already made that known.
The former LIFE programme, with its strands on nature, the environment and third countries, had unleashed innovative political impetus and had shown that investing in the environment was the path to follow in the context of sustainable development, and that it created jobs.
With the new LIFE programme, the Commission is counting on the environment, as you explained, being integrated in the various policies.
This is a good thing, we cannot deny it, but we are not convinced of the usefulness of delegating environmental policies to the Member States.
It is well known that, often, the main issue for the Member States is not the environment.
We will not, therefore, obtain results by renationalising the environment.
On the other hand, the European Union has to support NGOs, because they are absolutely irreplaceable and because they must be able to continue to carry out their work, which, as you mentioned, is in everyoneâs interest.
Finally, we believe, as you are well aware, that the most overlooked project is Natura 2000.
On that issue, in fact, we have decided to make everyone aware that Natura 2000 certainly has its costs but that it is not a bottomless pit: it is money that will be channelled into original local development based on respect for the environment and on respect for the people who work the land.
You explained to us that you were kicking things into touch and that it was the responsibility of the other policies, of the other funds to integrate Natura 2000.
We waited precisely until the end of the discussions on the Structural Funds, on rural development, to find out whether in fact we had the full guarantees that Natura 2000 would be taken into consideration.
I can tell you that the glass is half empty or half full, depending on how you look at it.
With regard to the Fund for Rural Development, we are very hopeful, but we know that it only concerns compensation, which is very positive because financial compensation is needed.
With regard to the Structural Funds, we know that it concerns investment.
In fact we are well aware that investment is something that is strictly defined and that we do not need to build any new roads to go and discover biotopes.
There is therefore a significant shortcoming.
That is why we propose to take a third of the sum that you agreed, that is of the EURÂ 21 billion, and to add it to LIFE + so that Natura 2000 can live and can genuinely serve to protect our environment, just as we are committed to doing.
Â Â  . Mr President, before commenting on the characteristics of this project, I would like to express my thanks not just to Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, but also to Mrs Lienemann, the other shadow rapporteurs and the officials and advisors who are working extremely hard to reach a consensus on this project.
We have achieved extraordinary consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: everybody has introduced their points of view and, although there are apparently not many amendments, a new spirit has been introduced and the LIFE programme has been enriched, in cooperation with the Commission.
How has it been enriched?
In my opinion, we have introduced several new aspects.
Firstly, this project has placed great emphasis on the management of natural resources.
It is also of great educational importance in terms of teaching how to govern and manage the environment.
Furthermore, we have insisted on an institutional presence in the form of the municipalities and regions as local authorities that have to re-evaluate their resources.
In this regard, I would also like to stress another element: the introduction of landscapes deserving of respect that have not been integrated into the Natura 2000 list, such as certain rivers, but which may be important shared spaces.
There is another innovation: the concept has been introduced, and the idea strengthened, of international projects and cross-border projects.
Why?
Because natural spaces are usually in border zones and in mountainous areas.
Rivers are a clear case in point: the logical thing would be to create a LIFE for rivers one day, because rivers cross many countries.
Furthermore, I must say something else: we have created a market spirit for Natura 2000.
We believe that, in this case, we must imitate United States policy by creating banks for wetlands and banks for natural areas, so that the Member States can compensate proprietors, creating, shall we say, an area of exchange of ownership for the Natura 2000 zone.
In this way, the companies and many others who also have to take initiatives on the ground may contribute economically to compensating, by means of the âpolluter paysâ principle, for their passage through those protected territories.
They may do so through active and positive policies for the conservation of the natural environment, funded by private bodies and by institutions.
This is therefore not just another LIFE programme; it is a project based on a consensus which I believe has been guided by great common sense; I therefore congratulate everybody.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, in my turn, to thank MrsÂ IslerÂ BÃ©guin, our rapporteur, as well as all of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the shadow rapporteurs, who have endeavoured to present to this House, as my fellow Member, MrsÂ GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, has just said, a point of view that is, if I may say so, unanimous or in any case likely to receive majority support.
LIFEÂ + and the LIFE programme constitute an extremely important part of our environmental policy, because they are the only budgetary tool that the European Union has released for its environmental policies.
It is true that we are often criticised at European level by our fellow citizens for enacting directives, constraints and rules, which is quite legitimate and must be done.
Europe has done a great deal for environmental policies, but people often say to us, âYou impose constraints upon us, but you do not release many funds to support us in implementing the policies concernedâ.
There are therefore shows of resistance and difficulties requiring the Union to provide financial support for implementing policies.
Support tools do exist, such as the integrated policies, on which progress has been made for a number of years.
I will come back to that in connection with the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy.
Yet we also require specific tools.
The LIFE programme has already shown its effectiveness in many areas.
I would stress the need to use LIFE to breathe life into the major framework directives, such as the one on water or our programme to combat the greenhouse effect.
MrsÂ IslerÂ BÃ©guin is, however, right to say that the core issue of our debate is Natura 2000.
It is positive that we have succeeded in having Natura 2000 taken into account in the EAFRD.
The reality is, however, that a whole series of expenditure, which is vital for managing the geographical area targeted and for implementing the directive, cannot be included here.
This is the case for two types of expenditure: those concerning the operation and those concerning certain geographical areas.
I am thinking in particular of those areas that are not directly included in agricultural areasâ wet zones, areas that are slightly separated from them and so on â and that cannot receive funding under mechanisms linked to the Regional Development Fund and the Fund for Rural Development.
We therefore need something in addition: we have proposed that 35% of the sum that you, Commissioner, have put at EURÂ 21Â million be devoted to the management of Natura 2000, within the framework of the LIFE programme.
I believe in any case that a specific budget attached to LIFE is a determining and essential factor for this House.
Furthermore, given that the Commission, since it was newly formed, has always been at pains to tell us that it would pay great attention to the views of Parliament, the wide agreement within Parliament on this issue ought to lead the Commission to support our points of view.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like, in my turn, to thank our rapporteur, MrsÂ IslerÂ BÃ©guin, for the quality of this collaborative work and her energetic commitment to this issue.
During the June part-session, our Parliament, in its resolution on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union, sent out a very clear political signal for protecting the planet, nature and biodiversity.
It is essential to ensure the smooth operation of the Natura 2000 network, the core issue of this debate.
MrsÂ Lienemann has just reminded us of this.
The experts in the Commission have, moreover, calculated that Natura 2000 will need EURÂ 21 billion over seven years.
We are aware that the Fund for Rural Development and the Structural Funds are not going to meet all of these needs.
We therefore have to strengthen LIFE +, the specific financial instrument for the environment with which we have been equipped since 1992.
I should therefore like to address two main criticisms to the Commission, which I share with our rapporteur.
The first concerns the initial sum of EURÂ 300 million, which is, of course, hugely insufficient.
Behind this battle of figures, it is Europeâs desire to take up major challenges such as air quality, water quality, spatial planning and sustainable waste management that is at stake here.
The second criticism is as follows: I believe that the European Commission must not offload its responsibilities with regard to the environment.
The strategy of integrating the environment in all of the Unionâs policies has its limits, Commissioner.
That is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support Amendments 42, 43 and 44.
The European Parliament will always support you in opposing this kind of environmental Europe, an environmental Europe that in certain respects is in decline, and in all respects is optional, and which is imposed by certain Member States that appear to have chosen to withdraw into themselves.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to add my own thanks to the rapporteur for all the work she â together with the other Members â has done, but I should nevertheless like to make a few observations concerning the proposal on which we will be voting later.
It would appear that some Members expect a great deal of support for nature policy from the European Union.
I share this hope, for I too take the view that the European Union, by creating ecological networks, can make a positive contribution to our continent.
We should not, however, pin all our faith on Europe, certainly where the funding of these Natura 2000 sites is concerned, for these sites are, after all, designated by the national authorities, assisted by European experts, and so it is acceptable that some of the funding for preserving them should come from the European budget.
Ultimately, though, the primary responsibility for them lies with the Member States.
In my view, it is very understandable that the funding should follow need, and various amendments underline this.
We should only do and fund at European level what Member States cannot manage for themselves.
We should not reverse the position by wanting to pay for everything and checking afterwards to see whether the Member States would like to make a contribution.
I would therefore call for Member States to be given a greater role in funding and for them to be helped out only as and when EU funding is actually justified.
Â Â  Mr President, the G8 leaders in Scotland are exercised about the sustainability of our world.
If they travelled a little way to the Cairngorm Mountains and the Abernethy Forest Reserve, they would see one of Europe's Natura 2000 sites, covering 13Â 000 hectares of ancient Caledonian pinewood, moorland, lochs and mountains, which is the habitat for rare species such as the capercaillie and the black grouse.
The former, which was previously thought to be the bird most likely to become extinct in the United Kingdom within 15 years, is now doubling its numbers.
The reserve, with its osprey centre, attracts some 100Â 000 visitors a year and GBP 1.7 million a year and provides 87 jobs in a previously poor rural economy.
We are seeing such results all over Europe, from Scotland to Spain to Germany.
The Iberian lynx in Spain has been saved by Natura 2000.
In Brandenburg, where the great bustard population had fallen from 4Â 000 in the 1930s to a few hundred, 9Â 500 hectares of monoculture have transformed its prospects and also brought economic benefit to an economically depressed area.
We are talking about our European heritage, which we have a duty to protect.
LIFE + is the new financial instrument that, with the Structural Funds and Fund for Rural Development, will enable Natura 2000 to continue to succeed.
On 8 June, Parliament voted for âa significantly strengthened LIFE + programmeâ.
I know that the budget will not be easy this year, but we pick up the proposal for a ring-fenced amount of EUR 21 billion over seven years in that resolution of 8 June.
We suggest how LIFE + could be significantly strengthened.
LIFE III, with its three components of nature, environment and third countries, has been a success in all respects, but particularly perhaps in the Natura 2000 sites of LIFE Nature.
LIFE + will take this forward and this report will help that process.
I hope that the Commission will respond supportively, constructively and imaginatively.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the intention is that LIFE + should be the sole financial instrument for the environment from 2007 onwards.
It is no bad idea to combine in one single environmental instrument the various programmes that have supported such environmental measures as actions within the scope of the Forest Focus Regulation and supported non-governmental organisations and local and regional authorities.
As one who is involved with the budget, I am particularly glad that we can take it as read that this operation will result in greater efficiency and effectiveness.
We know that, in order to be effective, energy policy must be implemented at ground level, throughout the EU and on a local basis everywhere.
For that reason, although the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are not open to criticism, it is urgently necessary, if we really do want the funding of environmental policy to add indisputable value to Europe, that the use to which the funds are put be effectively monitored.
Such monitoring will involve not only codecision by Parliament on the multiannual programmes, but also, and of necessity, evaluation at short intervals, in order to make it possible to make adjustments without delay.
The âLIFE-Natureâ part has been as good as dropped from the Commission proposal for LIFE, and with it has gone the funding for Natura 2000 measures.
That is something we cannot accept.
The Commissionâs proposal for the management of the Natura 2000 areas to be paid for out of the Fund is no bad idea either in view of what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has seen of the problems inherent in such a â essentially competition with other objectives laid down in various funds.
We eventually came to an agreement that LIFE + should be used to support those Natura 2000 areas that are not covered by one of the funds.
It remains to be seen how far this approach, which is at once perceptive, realistic and motivated by solidarity, will get us.
Despite this House, yesterday, prompted by the Committee on Regional Development, having struck every single reference to Natura 2000 out of the Structural Funds Regulations, I do expect not only our Committee, but also the NGOs and the Commission, to take the initiative â or go on the offensive â in order to persuade people.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the LIFE + environmental programme is crucial for supporting the implementation and development of environmental policy.
It therefore has to act as a stimulus for implementation and as a catalyst for innovation and change, and thus enable action to be taken across the board at European level on the priority areas.
Based on our successful experience with the current LIFE programme, LIFE + has to be the vehicle for assessing and monitoring conservation status, for drafting action plans on the recovery of species and for actions linked to the operation of the Natura 2000 European network.
Demonstration projects concerning the establishment and protection of Natura 2000 should continue to be funded since they provide European added value.
Environmental policy, however, amounts to more than just Natura 2000.
That is why I am against Amendment 35, which proposes allocating 90% of the LIFE + programme to the funding of Natura 2000.
LIFE + should actually adopt an approach that provides proportionate support for the four crucial subject areas in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme: climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, the environment and health, and the protection of natural resources.
Finally, I should like to say that I share the rapporteurâs opinion that projects must continue to be selected at Community level to ensure that they provide European added value.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I believe that words truly need to be turned into deeds, because delivering speeches about saving the planet and sustainable development is something that we do constantly in this House and elsewhere.
Unfortunately, when the time comes for us to equip ourselves with the means to act, there is no one to be seen.
Parliament is not in agreement with the European Commission, which has made choices with which we cannot concur.
Commissioner, we understand that the funding for LIFEÂ + must be integrated into the EAFRD and the ERDF.
That is a question of transversality; we can accept it even if we might also regret it.
However, we know how local elected representatives behave.
When choices have to be made between different priorities, economic priorities and environmental priorities, it is well known that, unfortunately, it is the environment that suffers and is the victim of those choices.
That is why Europe absolutely has to display authority in what it wants and why it is crucial to provide for specific funding, inter alia, in Natura 2000.
Natura 2000 is an important policy that Europe wanted, that it has been difficult to persuade local elected representatives on the ground to accept, that has been difficult to understand and difficult to implement.
Yet it is precisely now, when we need to manage the Natura 2000 sites, that the European Commission is taking a step backwards.
That cannot be true.
Today, the Commission no longer wishes to assist in funding the management of these sites.
Some of them will not be covered by the EAFRD and the ERDF because they are neither farming areas nor woodland areas.
What will we do in those cases?
I will remind you that LIFE + is a financial instrument and that we would appear not to be giving ourselves the ability to negotiate most effectively with the Council.
Commissioner, you ought to assist this Parliament in its financial negotiations with the Council.
We need you.
We are at the stage of first reading and we have to show our determination, our determination to protect the funding that is absolutely crucial to us.
We have a very good compromise, and yet we have the feeling of being abandoned by the Commission.
That really would be regrettable.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group feels proud and happy today with the report that has been handled so well by the rapporteur, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, and also by everybody whose work has enriched it.
Codesision is our strength, and this is inspired by the need to fulfil the environmental objectives that the European Union has always claimed are a priority.
With regard to resources for the Natura 2000 network, this report is not asking for the impossible.
The Commission is as aware as this Parliament of the difficulties caused by the financial perspective but, if you want me to tell the truth, I believe there are solutions that can be found through good will and decisiveness, as in this case.
Perhaps an increase in funding for the network must also be accompanied by a better redistribution of the necessary resources.
Of course, Commissioner, people should not be made to pay for the sins of others.
By way of example: we cannot carry on calling on the Andalusian rural agents to tighten their belts further, both for the maintenance of the network on the basis of their legitimate responsibility as farmers, and for very specific and necessary actions, such as the preservation of the Iberian lynx.
The Commission will remember better than I the excitement with which the Natura 2000 network was launched.
Since then we have seen a hopeful process with legislation and programmes that make our environmental priorities a reality.
All of this investment of resources and excitement cannot now come to nothing.
LIFE + must be a powerful guarantee of the maintenance and strengthening of what we have created so far, also with regard to habitats and the variety of species we have.
In this regard, and without calling into question the legitimacy of co-funding, nobody can deny that maintaining the network means â and this must be the case â high costs for certain Members and in particular for Spain.
My country, together with Denmark, has the greatest amount of protected area and, furthermore, 29% of this area is in my community, Andalusia.
Commissioner, sometimes we have to make efforts, take a position and be courageous.
I would urge you to continue investing in the protection of the environment.
It is worth it.
Â Â  Mr President, since 1992 LIFE â the Financial Instrument for the Environment â has been the major vehicle of European Community Environment policy.
It comprises three funds, for Nature, Environment and Third Countries.
The current LIFE III programme is due to finish at the end of 2006 when a new package, LIFE +, will be introduced as part of our new Financial Perspective on which we await a Council decision.
However, it is time for this Parliament to make a decision now.
Do we want to preserve our natural heritage?
Where our shared environmental heritage is concerned, the financing must fit the policy, not vice versa.
It is extremely difficult to quantify in monetary terms the value of our natural boglands, our native species of flora and fauna and natural habitats and public amenities, such as parks and woodlands.
Importantly, these are common treasures, enjoyed and owned by the general public.
The buck stops nowhere if not with us here in the European Parliament, where, through the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we are co-legislators with the Council.
We bear equal responsibility for maintaining and strengthening our efforts to prevent biodiversity loss and environmental degradation.
Without adequate funding for LIFE +, the positive steps to address these problems since the introduction of the current programme in 1992 will be reversed.
Important socioeconomic benefits of the programme will also be lost.
Up to 125 000 jobs are supported in the EU 15 in nature protection related activities.
This is a growing sector.
Mr Bowis has told us about the Scottish example.
The Scottish Parliament estimates that landscape tourism contributes EUR 560 million to Scotlandâs economy each year, much of this in economically depressed regions.
He mentioned the black grouse and the Iberian lynx.
Commissioner, can I ask that in seven yearsâ time the red squirrel be added to that list of biodiversity successes?
It is not just a question of the amount of money.
The money must be secure.
Without designated, ring-fenced funding specifically earmarked for the environment, we will not achieve our environmental policy objectives.
The current âintegrated approachâ to financing environmental policy being proposed by the Commission, whereby funding will come from rural development funding and structural funds, worries me deeply and I think it simply will not work.
Let us be realistic, there will always be something more immediately important than protecting the environment.
If properly financed, LIFE + will give us the means to promote our special areas of conservation and thereby promote biodiversity in Europe, which is being lost at an alarming rate.
Â Â  Mr President, let me, too, join in congratulating the rapporteur, whose report demonstrates the commitment that is called for and who, as we have seen from the debate so far, has the overwhelming majority of this House behind her.
This report makes good the immense deficiencies in the Commission proposal, and so it is vital that it be adopted by a large majority.
As I see it, the proposalâs most glaring defect is the failure to provide financially for the management of the Natura 2000 network during the period from 2007 to 2013, even though the Sixth Environment Action Programme gave high priority to, among other things, species diversity and the protection of species.
Within the Commissionâs plan for Natura 2000 networks to be funded by the Structural Funds lurks the immense danger that, in practice, not enough money will be made available for them.
Mrs Haug has already referred to the result of yesterdayâs vote.
It is also clear from the Commissionâs approach that it is unwilling to take responsibility for the way in which the Communityâs common environmental policies are implemented.
The Commission has also failed outright to put in place the clause ensuring proper management of the Natura 2000 networks, which is an essential condition for funding by the Structural Funds, and so we in this House need, by a convincing majority, to endorse the rapporteurâs approach, which entails integrating into the LIFE + programme the costs of implementing Natura 2000.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the proposal to integrate existing environmental support programmes into a single financial instrument, LIFEÂ +, is justified since it provides a guarantee that actions will not be duplicated.
It is also a sensible idea to harmonise and simplify principles and procedures.
The aim of the LIFEÂ + programme is to safeguard funding for actions that will be ineligible for support under the EUâs other financial instruments.
Given the current challenges we need to address in the field of environmental protection, this approach is entirely justified.
The key problem we face with regard to the LIFEÂ + programme, however, is fulfilling the tasks of co-financing, creating and implementing the NaturaÂ 2000 network.
The priorities set for the LIFEÂ + programme give due consideration to issues relating to the protection of nature and biodiversity, including the NaturaÂ 2000 network.
At the same time, however, it is emphasised that co-financing for the NaturaÂ 2000 network is only to be provided on a complementary basis, which means that support is to be provided under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund.
I am concerned at the fact that whilst the concept of the NaturaÂ 2000 network in Europe has evolved, this has not been backed up by an appropriate guarantee of funding for the creation and maintenance of this network.
No clear details have been provided regarding the principles according to which funding can be obtained for protection measures for NaturaÂ 2000 sites between 2007 and 2013, and this will undoubtedly mean shortfalls in funding for the NaturaÂ 2000 network.
It will then be impossible to implement many much-needed protection measures.
For example, the majority of areas designated as NaturaÂ 2000 sites in Poland and other countries will not be covered by the funds indicated.
Such areas include land that is part of national forests, or peat bogs, swamps, natural grasslands, dunes, moorlands and scrublands that are not used for agricultural purposes.
In the context of the European Commissionâs letter of 6Â JanuaryÂ 2005, which suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of extending the list of NaturaÂ 2000 sites in Poland, which could mean that up to 20% of the country would be covered by such sites, a guarantee of separate funding for the establishment of the NaturaÂ 2000 network has taken on even greater significance for Poland and other countries.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the LIFEÂ + Regulation is an outstanding piece of legislation.
The fact that it is a regulation means that it will be binding upon all Member States, and have greater force than any directives addressed to them.
The document has one flaw, however, which is that it only provides an indicative list of priorities, and leaves us in the dark as to how much funding these priorities will receive, if any.
This is particularly true for NaturaÂ 2000, which is an issue that previous speakers have already touched upon.
My message to the Commissioner is that it would be a mistake to force this programme to compete for support under the Structural Funds and the Fund for Rural Development.
This would be an unworkable approach, because it would unleash a dirty war over whose needs were greatest; the needs of local communities, of the needs of protecting the environment and rare plant and animal species or those of the people living in the areas in question.
Such a state of affairs would be intolerable.
The second point I should like to make relates to the funding of NaturaÂ 2000.
According to the Commission communication, the cost of such funding is expected to reach EURÂ 6.1Â million.
I am well aware that this is not a lot of money; in fact, it represents an absolute minimum.
Yet EURÂ 5Â million of this amount is to be earmarked for the 15Â old EU Member States, and only EURÂ 1Â million for the 10Â new Member States.
Is this an appropriate ratio?
Does the Commissioner not believe that distributing funds in this way runs counter to the principle of European solidarity?

Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, I do not envy you, Commissioner, your present position, for, on Monday, you had to account to the House for the deferment of the thematic strategies that the Commission had announced and on which it is now evidently unwilling to deliver, while today we are discussing LIFE +, the new financial instrument, and we are not exactly of one mind on that either.
This LIFE instrument, which first saw the light of day in 1992, is, however, something on which I very much want to congratulate the Commission, for in creating it, it fashioned a trailblazing programme for European environmental policy.
The important thing about it is that it was intended to implement the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Flora and Fauna Directive, and to provide the financial means whereby this could be done.
It was significant that the Commission opted for the integrated management approach, one that I too wholeheartedly endorse, for it is the remarkable thing about this programme and not to be found in any of the others.
We are now discussing the new proposal, which is to cover the period from 2007 to 2013, and is also intended to help achieve the objectives of the EUâs Sixth Environment Action Programme.
As a great deal is being said about Lisbon in this House, I would remind you that one of the objectives to be achieved by the âLisbon Yearâ of 2010 is to check the loss of biodiversity in Europe, and that, free-standing though this objective is, it also has socio-economic implications.
Speaking as one who comes from a region in which tourism plays a very major role, I can say that our capital consists principally in the biodiversity and natural wealth that our region possesses.
It is important that this new programme should continue to guarantee financial support for the Natura network.
Although there is no doubt that the Commissionâs choice of the integrated approach in collaboration with the Regional Development Fund has been the right one, I would like to raise the objection that this involves us pursuing different objectives, resulting in a conflict the resolution of which is absolutely necessary if we are to strike the necessary balance between both aspects â rational regional development on the one hand and the protection of nature on the other.
Â Â  Mr President, the amendments made to LIFE + by Parliament have significantly improved the draft regulation.
Increasing the budget tenfold over and above the recommendation made by the Commission is a tangible step towards realising the objectives of sustainable development and also serves the European Unionâs strategic objective of halting the reduction of biological diversity by the year 2010.
The budget increase makes LIFE + a substantial independent instrument in European Union environmental policy.
In its present form, LIFE + has only been used to shore up âcurrent financial gapsâ arising between structural funds and agricultural funds.
The promotion of nature protection objectives would, in this case, depend on critical domestic priorities and may be overshadowed by socio-economic objectives.
Both the structural funds and the Fund for Rural Development operate on the basis of allocation of funds to a specific applicant.
This leads to a significant risk that activities in areas of great natural value might not be financed due to the absence of a suitable applicant, or due to distance.
In the case of LIFE +, it would therefore be more beneficial to operate on the basis of the model that has been used in Estonia for many years, that is, subsidies for activities of importance for nature protection are distributed by place of residence: the recipient of a subsidy does not have to be a landowner, but may be a person implementing an activity of importance for nature conservation.
Member States need the European Union to provide a dependable and long-term financing strategy in order to ensure the protection of the network of Natura areas.
If decision-making is left solely to the Member States, the protection of objects of great natural value may be overshadowed by other domestic priorities.
In order to avoid this, it is important to leave programming decisions to Member States, while establishing minimum levels of financing of LIFE + activities at a European Union level.
It is essential that we all give our support to the amendments tabled by Parliament, in order to channel the Unionâs resources towards the conservation of natural objects of European importance.
Many thanks.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I too welcome the Commissionâs proposal for simplifying the funding and administration of the existing environmental programmes and, in LIFE +, combining them into one single financial instrument.
I, too, am all in favour of protecting the environment and of making whatever financial provision is necessary for it, and I would be happy if we were able today to make generous financial arrangements for the protection of nature.
I do believe, though that the failure of our financial planning for 2007-2013 means that it would be unrealistic to make specific financial demands today, and an illusion to believe that we can.
Right now, we do not know how much the overall European budget will add up to.
We all know that the whole house, the financial framework, must be standing before we can furnish the rooms.
We have given a very full description of the way in which the Structural Funds and rural development, on the one hand, compete against LIFE + on the other.
As things stand at present, we have to ask ourselves which measures it makes sense to promote through LIFE +, and which tasks should continue to be entrusted to the Member States.
Should not, for example, the protection of forests remain a responsibility and task for the Member States?
Why, for that matter, should the acquisition of land be funded by LIFE + money?
The assumption is being made here that the mere acquisition of a plot of land by an environmental organisation itself protects the environment, but what is at issue is not to whom the land belongs, but how it is managed; to put it another way, its management as a FFH area, a habitat for flora and fauna, has to be ensured and promoted, with the resultant tasks and costs being covered by LIFE +.
Proper management of areas of land is what protection of the environment is all about, and it ends up being much better value for money too.
I am strongly opposed to the institutional support of non-governmental organisations; LIFE + must not be used to underwrite such bodiesâ administrative costs, but to fund projects that are of practical benefit to the environment.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs BÃ©guin, and the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work which they have presented.
The need to finance LIFE + has a clear European dimension and value.
The deterioration in the environment and ever increasing environmental issues, often of a cross-border nature, make it necessary to change the pan-European and global approach.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary, together with investments in the environmental sector, for environmental actions under all programmes to be monitored both inside and outside the European Union, in order to ensure they function better and are more fully coordinated.
The concept of protection of nature and biodiversity needs to be introduced as a basic feature in thematic priorities for the financing of the LIFE + programme, as a basic line of approach and actions in the new financing tool.
This programme will need to be in a position to finance other actions, such as Natura 2000, which no other programme can cover.
Thus there will also be a commitment from other financing instruments to meet such requirements.
Commissioner, I believe that the increase which the European Parliament is calling for is the minimum required for the serious operation of LIFE +, which aims at basic aspects of environmental policy, which are information, awareness-raising among citizens and, most importantly, control of the application of this policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the speakers for their constructive remarks and their concerns regarding Natura 2000 in particular.
The Commission believes that the current environment programmes have served their purpose.
LIFE-Nature and LIFE-Environment have been excellent catalysts but, as set out in the mid-term evaluation of the LIFE programme, have done little for the development of environmental policy.
LIFE + sets out to make a difference.
Its purpose is to provide funding for policy development, but it would also permit, for example, local and regional actors to spread best practice for dealing with environmental implementation issues.
Spending on tangible environmental investment is best integrated into the funds that have financial muscle, those in rural and regional development areas.
I have already referred to the present success of the Commissionâs integration policy.
On 21 June the Agricultural Council adopted the Rural Development Fund Regulation.
This sets out that farmers and private forest owners can receive compensation for costs incurred and income foregone because of Natura 2000 actions.
Under that regulation, as regards farm investments, enhancement of the public amenity of a Natura 2000 area is eligible for support and the drawing-up of management plans relating to Natura 2000 can be financed.
The Council foresees a budget of EUR 82.75 billion to accompany the regulation.
At least 25% of that amount â or EUR 22.2 billion â would be allocated to compensate farmers and private forest owners in connection with Natura 2000.
Moreover, it is entirely possible for Member States to focus an even bigger share of their national envelope on Natura 2000 financing if they so wish.
Two days ago the Commission also adopted the strategic guidelines for both rural and regional spending.
The rural guidelines refer to Natura and the regional guidelines, clearly, to nature and species protection.
The Commission is, therefore, delivering on the integration of the environment into other policy areas.
Turning to LIFE + and the proposed amendments, the Commission finds it difficult to take into account most of the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to this proposal.
I am aware of the 44 amendments tabled by that committee and of a further four by the Committee on Budgets.
I should like to divide these amendments into three distinct blocks.
First, on scope: unfortunately, the majority of the amendments seek to enlarge the scope of the proposal.
This runs counter to the Commissionâs agreed integrated approach.
Many amendments concern Natura 2000, others set out more precisely what is already indicated in the text, for example, forest monitoring, networking, awareness-raising and NGO financing.
In addition, certain aspects, such as eco-innovation are clearly covered by other programmes, in this case by the competitiveness and innovation programme.
To contain this in LIFE + would introduce the risk of the double financing of projects, something the Court of Auditors feels very strongly about.
Secondly, on procedure: the Commission could accept some of the amendments in principle, for example those relating to assessing the impact quality of the programme.
However, others regarding the adoption of multiannual plans by codecision, would lead to a sclerosis in programme implementation.
Clearly, therefore, this could not be accepted.
In a similar way, the Commission cannot accept the additional demands arising in respect of the comitology procedure.
Lastly, on the budget, which is the most complex and difficult proposal for the Commission to deal with: the report on LIFE + increases its proposed budget by EUR 21 billion, but an amendment has been tabled to reduce this proposal to EUR 7.35 billion.
However, I am also aware that the Committee on Budgets proposed a zero budget for LIFE +.
Similarly, the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives did not put a budget figure on the table for LIFE +.
If Parliament were to provide an additional budget of EUR 7.35 billion for the environment, the Commission would do its utmost to ensure that these funds were properly included in the relevant structural programmes, thereby supporting Natura 2000.
In its turn, DG Environment would do all it could to ensure that such funds were effectively and efficiently spent on Natura 2000 matters.
Turning to the amendments in detail, the Commission can accept in principle Amendments 9, 32 and 33.
The Commission can accept Amendment 25 in part, as amended by Amendment 43.
The Commission cannot accept any other amendments.
In conclusion, the LIFE + proposal offers a flexible financial instrument for the environment.
I hope that we can find common ground in the short term to take this proposal forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if you will allow me to briefly react, could I ask you, Commissioner, which side you are on?
Did we not all agree to reduce the sum of EURÂ 21Â billion to EURÂ 9Â billion, which really is the minimum?
You say, however, that nothing has been agreed in the financial perspectives, while MrÂ BÃ¶ge stated that Natura 2000 cost EURÂ 21Â billion.
We need to have the guarantee that this EURÂ 21Â billion will indeed be shared out across the budget.
We believe that agriculture can take a third and that the Structural Funds can take another third.
It is therefore for the environment to take its third.
Â Â  . You are right that this EUR 21Â billion comes from a study that we carried out at the Commission and it proved that we need at least EURÂ 6.1 billion yearly for these programmes.
Of course, Mr BÃ¶geâs report had a reference to this.
The amount was brought down by the amendment to EURÂ 7.35 billion for the seven-year period, so actually the money you spoke of before was not made available by this report.
Again I have to repeat that, if we had this additional EURÂ 7.35 billion, we would ensure that it would be spent through the relevant funds for Natura 2000 and the other environment programmes.
I must underline that, with the integrated approach, we are going to use the structural funds, the Cohesion Fund, and the Agricultural Fund in order to get the money we need.
The guidelines that were voted on last week and two days ago will really help us in this respect.
The Fund for Rural Development, and especially Axis 2, which deals with land management, will get at least 25Â % of the rural funding of EURÂ 22.2 billion.
This will also help greatly with programmes which the Member States have an interest in financing as they have a legal obligation to finance projects relating to Natura 2000.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place presently, at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6-0193/2005) by Tokia SaÃ¯fi, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on textiles and clothing after 2005 (2004/2265 (INI)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, Commissioner, without implicating you, I can only regret the fact today that neither MrÂ Mandelson nor MrÂ Verheugen are present at this debate on an issue that has been at the forefront of the news for several months.
Commissioner, the European textile and clothing industry has a future and trade interests to defend.
Following the signing of the memorandum of understanding in Shanghai on 10 June between the European Commission and the Chinese Government, which has been ratified by the 25 Member States, the European Parliament today expresses its opinion on the future of the European textile and clothing industry, a future that we all hope is promising, and that despite the numerous upheavals that the sector has undergone in recent months.
I believe that this framework agreement, this free trade agreement, gives the European textile industries some breathing space.
I nevertheless believe that the European Parliament is duty bound to monitor carefully the management and the follow-up of that agreement.
Indeed, I believe that we should be able to keep certain safeguards in place and use the defensive trade instruments at our disposal within the context of the WTO when that proves necessary.
Furthermore, in the long term, the European Union and the national authorities must contribute to developing measures that will make it possible to capitalise on the production and sales potential of European manufacturers, in addition to ensuring that fair trade rules are respected on the international textile and clothing market.
I will therefore remind you of the maxim that states that a trade policy with the rest of the world should be based on two principles: fairness and reciprocity.
From that perspective, and with the aim of remaining competitive in this new trading environment, free access to third-country markets is a vital factor in the drive for growth.
That is why the Commission must encourage all of the WTO countries, apart from the most vulnerable developing countries, to use the Doha negotiations to secure reciprocal market access conditions, which are both fair and comparable, for large-scale textile and clothing producersA firm line must, moreover, be taken against those countries that are still closing their borders to European producers by raising non-tariff barriers to trade.
These practices need to be combated using the legal instruments available to the European Union.
With six months to go until the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting, Commissioner, I would stress the fact that removing barriers to market access for industrial products has to be a key objective of the Doha mandate.
It is also crucial, and this motion says so, to protect our European know-how, our European added value.
To do so, we must defend intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting and piracy.
The Commission must in fact go on the offensive to ensure that third countries comply with the TRIPS Agreement, particularly with regard to textile designs.
Similarly, it is necessary to establish ethical trade based on production processes that respect the environment, health, and labour standards.
Finally, in order to respond to the slowdown in the European textile industry and to guarantee its future and its competitiveness against the US and Asian regional blocs, we have to support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean production zone in the textile and clothing sector.
To achieve this, goods must be allowed to move more freely by applying cumulation of origin across the Euro-Mediterranean zone as quickly as possible.
In parallel with these trade measures, the European Union should implement a transitional practical plan to assist restructuring and retraining for the entire sector, with a view to helping textile-producing regions and safeguarding the future and competitiveness of the sector on international markets.
Commissioner, the European Commission needs to study in detail the points made in this motion and develop the recommendations made therein by introducing practical measures.
Furthermore, on behalf of the European Parliament, I call for the Commission to give a quarterly report, before the Members of this institution, on all of the recommendations issued in this resolution and on the actions that it has undertaken.
Finally, for the future of this sector to be genuinely promising, constant attention must be paid to developing it.
That is what I call for today for textiles and clothing, a key sector of the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should, however, like to say that if Peter Mandelson is not here, it is precisely for very good reasons that are, I might add, related to the matter in hand.
He was keen to take part in bilateral meetings in Great Britain, where he had the opportunity to meet a number of extremely important ministers, particularly in the context of the WTO negotiations that will be taking place in Hong Kong.
His absence from these meetings would have deprived us of certain opportunities to defend the priorities that you outline here.
As you know, these negotiations have a direct bearing on the textile sector.
I would therefore earnestly request that you excuse his absence; it really is for urgent reasons.
It was genuinely worthwhile for him to attend these meetings.
That said, I would like to thank MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi for her excellent report and I welcome the draft resolution.
It supports the efforts already made by the Commission to assist the European textile and clothing sector in also taking up the challenges set by the abolition of quotas since January 2005.
Our objective is clearly to lessen the impact of a historic agreement on trade liberalisation, which was finalised exactly 10 years ago.
We all recognise that the European Unionâs trade policy should guarantee the best environment and the best possible conditions for the sector so as to enable it to face the competition on equal terms.
The shake-up of the regulatory and trading environment ought to encourage us to turn to the future and go on the offensive, to find new commercial outlets and to create markets, rather than to seek only to protect ourselves from competition on the internal market.
I am now going to address the principal trade issues raised in the draft resolution.
Firstly, with regard to Chinese imports, I will speak about the EU-China agreement of 10 June 2005.
Following months of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached an agreement with China, which guarantees a more moderate growth in imports in the main categories of products.
This gives European industry an additional two and a half years in which to continue the process of reorganisation and adaptation.
The broad support given to the Commissionâs approach by the Member States indicates that a negotiated agreement was certainly the best means of confronting the influx of Chinese imports, and this for various reasons.
Firstly, most EU products are covered, that is to say around half of the imported products that were liberalised in January 2005.
Secondly, there is only a slight difference between the quantities agreed and what would have resulted from the mechanical application of the safeguard clause if it had been implemented.
It must be well understood that there was really no alternative solution.
Implementing the safeguard measures on a case-by-case basis would have been economically destabilising and politically very difficult.
The agreement will provide more clarity, certainty and credibility for businesses on both sides (producers, exporters, importers and retailers) and will promote textiles exports from developing countries and Mediterranean countries to Europe.
This agreement is therefore in everyoneâs interests.
The question of whether we will refrain from taking safeguard actions in the future and on other products remains.
The European Union has not relinquished its legal rights, but it is clear that we have entered into a transaction.
We do not rule out possible future actions if they are really justified.
Careful monitoring will therefore continue.
From now on, we have to focus our attention on the interests of the European Union, interests that we are going to defend forcefully, in the textile sector: market access; intellectual property, the Euro-Mediterranean zone, rules of origin and origin marking.
The action plan on market access, debated by the High-Level Group on 14 June 2005, should be officially adopted and implemented with the emphasis on intellectual property issues.
Increased convergence of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sector is also required.
It would be advisable to reduce customs duties within the context of the WTO.
They should be set at the lowest possible level for LDCs and vulnerable developing countries.
Non-tariff barriers need to be tackled effectively: that is a key objective of the WTO negotiations on market access for non-agricultural products the tariff reductions envisaged by the European Union would be acceptable if a significant number of countries, in order ideally to attain a critical mass, made comparable offers in return in terms of market access.
The Commission is considering putting forward proposals on origin marking and labelling.
These proposals will enable both appropriate information and guarantees on the origin of clothing items to be provided, whilst avoiding placing an unnecessary burden on businesses.
The new system of generalised preferences, which offers preferential access to developing countries, was adopted on 27 June and will enter into force on 1 January 2006.
A specific safeguard clause for clothing products has been introduced.
It excludes any country recording an annual growth in exports greater than 20%.
That clause is the only concession in a global stability agreement that will remain in force until the end of 2008.
China has been excluded from it and the status quo is maintained for India.
As regards the reform of preferential rules of origin, the Commission is going to carry out an impact study in the most sensitive sectors, including the textile and clothing sector.
We have to measure the effects of change on EU industry and on developing partner countries.
I now come to the Euro-Mediterranean zone.
We share your desire to establish a genuine Euro-Mediterranean zone in which goods can move freely and are exempt from customs duties.
Since the 1970s, textile products have entered the EU market exempt from customs duties and, in parallel, the Mediterranean countries have progressively abolished customs duties on EU exports.
The competitiveness of the Euromed textile industry depends less on customs duties than on competition from Asia, on the preferences granted by the European Union to Asian countries, through the GSP, on the relaxing of the preferential rules of origin and on unfair competition caused by Chinaâs lax compliance with employment law.
Although the cumulation of origin has been delayed at the Council, every effort is being made to speed up the procedure and to ensure its entry into force in autumn 2005.
Conclusions: the Member States overwhelmingly supported the agreement reached with China; the industry obtained an additional transitional period to improve its competitiveness both at international level and within the Union, and the Commission is going to monitor the programme of positive actions regularly and thoroughly with a view to securing the future of the European textile and clothing sector.
With regard to your request for regular updates, the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed of the implementation of its initiatives.
That said, I am not going to go so far as to promise you a report every three months, but I believe that it would indeed be quite reasonable for reports to be made to Parliament on a regular basis.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the import of textile sector goods from China is the first stage of a new phenomenon, which marks the start of an inexorable invasion of Chinese products into European markets.
Textiles are the first stage, and other sectors of production will follow.
We cannot deny that Europe does not have any effective response to this new phenomenon, which is a consequence of globalisation.
Let us be clear: Europe must compete with parts of the world where products are manufactured by workers earning the lowest salaries.
Yet Europe cannot compete â indeed no region can compete â with parts of the world where the currency is kept artificially undervalued, where depreciation on investments is not paid, where energy costs are not paid, where environmental rules are not observed, where slave or child labour is used, and all of this with the collaboration of the national authorities of the country in question.
The EU needs to reconsider its approach to talks on international trade agreements, so as to increase pressure to strengthen corporate social responsibility and to encourage strict compliance with International Labour Organisation rules and conventions, and international conventions on the environment and human rights.
These principles must form part of EU bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.
I also fear that textile imports are not being adequately monitored.
Information passed on to me by organisations working in the sector indicates that in June 2005 the quantities recently agreed between the EU and China for this year have been far exceeded.
I sincerely hope that the EU, in the guise of the Commission, demonstrates very quickly that it is capable of enforcing what has been agreed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs SaÃ¯fi for the work she has done on this report.
What we are proposing today to the House is an expression of concern about the difficult situation being experienced by the European textile sector and, furthermore, it proposes concrete measures for dealing with the enormous challenge facing it.
Firstly, we believe that it is essential to demand reciprocity.
In other words, we want equal ground rules for everybody, transparency in access to the markets and respect on everybodyâs part for social and environmental laws.
But, secondly, we are calling for practical support for speeding up the restructuring of companies in order to increase competitiveness and in order to guarantee their future within the new global framework.
We need a restructuring of the sector, which must be promoted at all levels, European, State and regional, and which must be based on social and institutional dialogue.
We need to resolve the fundamental problems by means of a modern industrial policy.
This resolution therefore requests from the Commission and the Member States a European strategy on textiles and clothing aimed at improving processes that add quality, at producing innovative and technologically advanced products, at attaching particular importance to trademarks, at increasing efforts in the commercial field, at including the techniques of the new economy and at ongoing professional training.
In order to fulfil these objectives, we will need a European textile plan that includes aid for restructuring and specific resources within the framework of the Unionâs funds.
Two instruments must make a decisive contribution to dealing with the future of the sector: the launch of the European technological platform, which will allow for the creation of a coordinated strategy in the field of research, and access by the sector to the Seventh Framework Programme, in accordance with the sectorâs own specific characteristics, such as the high number of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
European textiles are recognised throughout the world for their quality and their design, they have demonstrated their ability to adapt and now, if they receive the urgent support they need in view of the profound changes facing them, we can proclaim that they have a future.
Â Â  . â I should like to highlight a number of points and proposals contained in the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
Firstly, the abolition of quotas in the textiles sector may have harmful consequences in the EUâs least favoured regions.
This is a key sector for the EU with huge potential, a sector that is capable of helping to turn economic and social cohesion into reality.
The EU must support this sector as an industry, both at national level and across the Community as a whole.
A Community programme must be set up for the sector, and especially for the less favoured regions depending on it.
Support for modernisation and promotion of the sector must be regarded as an objective cutting across EU policies.
The safeguard clauses provided for in trade agreements need to be invoked as soon as possible, in order to protect the sector in the EU both at the present time and with an eye to the future.
The 'emergency procedure' provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clause should now be launched, with all the categories affected being included.
I should like to add a few additional points.
The prime concern of the so-called memorandum of understanding concluded between the Commission and China on 10Â JuneÂ 2005 is to legitimise the current situation, with its devastating impact on the sector, especially in countries depending on it, and this is something that we find unacceptable.
As organisations involved in the sector have said, on the basis of data provided by the Commission, what was agreed in the memorandum has led to exports increasing from 49% in 2004 to the 318% projected for 2005, a far cry from the 8, 10 12.5% figures announced.
Furthermore, by 20Â June, reported exports from China had already exceeded the 10 June agreement for almost all products.
Inexplicably, the Commission forfeited the right to the safeguard clauses, thus restricting its implementation.
The Commission and the Council have acted in a way that has clearly demonstrated their lack of commitment to defending this European industry.
They are therefore the main culprits for the terrible situation of thousands of businesses and for the destruction of thousands of jobs, with devastating social consequences.
Hence the proposals for amendments that we tabled.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that an analysis of the completed proposals and a European policy and strategy on the textiles industry are finally taking shape.
That is essential because millions of citizens have been turning to us in recent weeks and calling on us to act on these issues.
We cannot ignore their impatience, and at times anger, which is linked to the feeling of living in an era in which the phenomena of globalisation are in the end governed by the United States, used by large countries such as India and China, and paid for, in various ways, by developing countries and by Europe.
It is with this is mind that the report clarifies the fact that the policies and strategies for the textile industry do not amount to state aid or protectionism, but rather to full acceptance of the rules of trade.
It demands, however, that everyone should respect the rules and it points out the path to be followed: the opening-up of markets and competition should be seen as an opportunity, but at the same time the European Union needs to enhance its actions for the textile industry, for its modernisation and restructuring, for innovation, for research and for employee training.
The report also calls upon the Commission to adopt a clear initiative on three points.
Firstly, it calls for a policy guaranteeing that the rules of free trade are respected within all manufacturing countries, particularly China, and therefore that the state aid or hidden subsidies granted to businesses, which distort competition, are reduced.
Secondly, it strongly calls for the recognition and implementation of ethical, social and environmental clauses, aimed at widening the scope of workerâs rights and improving working conditions.
Finally, a more effective fight against counterfeiting, fraud and forgery is called for, which must be pursued by tightening up the penalties imposed on retailers and purchasers of counterfeit items and by adopting a traceability system.
I will conclude by stating that we would have liked more clarity on other points, for instance the inclusion of an active strategy for consumer awareness and more precise words with regard to the immediate introduction â and I am pleased that the Commissioner said it â of a mark of origin for all textile and clothing goods, precisely in order to protect and revive one of the strengths of our production.
Everything, however, now rests on the policy and on Europeâs ability to make itself heard and respected.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Commission, with our support, succeeded in coming to an agreement with China, the object of which is to protect the European textile industry from a veritable tsunami of Chinese textiles.
There is good and bad in this.
It is good that it gives the textile industry in southern Europe some breathing space, but let us also consider the agreementâs negative aspects: by reintroducing quotas, we are establishing barriers to trade, and that is what we always criticise the Chinese for doing.
Who is to determine which importer is allocated which quota?
Is it to be done on the basis of âfirst come, first servedâ, or is there to be preferential treatment for those who already have longer-standing contracts to supply?
Are there perhaps other variations?
If so, with what justification, and how does the Commission propose to determine that?
What about the supermarkets and traders who, in anticipation of the quotas expiring, have placed big orders in China?
Will they get their goods?
Will the shelves now remain unreplenished, or will someone pay them compensation if they have to buy their products less cheaply elsewhere in the world?
What about the European textile firms, who, in anticipation of the quotas expiring, have, on the one hand, relocated their production to China and, on the other, have further expanded their marketing and distribution in Europe?
Can they get supplies from their own factories in China, or will the reintroduction of quotas be just tough luck on them for having lost their livelihood and been obliged to lay off their workers in Europe?
What about the textile manufacturers who have spent the last few years and their own money restructuring themselves?
Will they now be penalised, while the companies that did not face up to the challenge get money from the Structural Funds?
To those businesses that have not so far come to terms with the new on the global markets we are giving a final chance to make good their omission, but it is no part of any European protection and subsidy policyâs remit to be the textile industryâs permanent insurance against the future.
We are talking here about what businesses, their managers and workers, are fundamentally for, and so I call on them to face up to this challenge.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I shall start by commending Mrs SaÃ¯fi on her outstanding work.
The issue before us is the need to draw up and implement a trade and industry strategy to ensure the viability of the European textiles and clothing industry in the context of the major opening up of the international markets.
For such a strategy to succeed, it will require both defensive and more proactive measures to be adopted.
The defensive measures relate to the need to help to regulate international trade in the sector, and in this regard, we welcome all initiatives aimed at ensuring reciprocal conditions of access to markets and at invoking all ethical, social and environmental clauses guaranteeing such proper regulation of the international markets.
This is not about protectionism.
It is about ensuring that international trade in this sector can take place on the basis of justice and fair play.
Proactive measures must be adopted, because this is also about the worldwide competitiveness of this industrial sector.
Such proactive measures entail the EU adopting a more aggressive industrial policy for this sector, which is a hugely important sector.
In this context, we also welcome all initiatives aimed at fostering greater investment in research and development, at promoting innovation and at improving access to funding, which is one of the key problems that these businesses have to face.
Over 95% of this business landscape is made up of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and one of the most serious problems that they face is precisely that of access to funding.
Against this backdrop, we feel that it is vitally important that steps are taken to invest in technological progress in manufacturing, to create mechanisms for fashion and new services, to invest in technical textiles and in non-technological innovation and to set up a technology platform with a view to strengthening this industrial area.
In this respect, there are, from our point of view, two components that should be brought to the fore: the trade component and the industry component.
If the two go hand in hand, it may be possible to make the EU textiles and clothing sector viable.
To conclude, I wish to repeat our call for the international markets in this sector to be regulated and the EU must table clear proposals in the context of the Doha Round, and when we say this we are not calling for protectionist measures to be adopted.
This is a sector that must be opened up, and that must strengthen its capacity to compete in international markets.
Yet we are only talking about regulation of international trade in this sector that has very specific characteristics.
It is essential that this take place.
Â Â  . Mr President, the issue of textiles and clothing after 2005 in many ways marks the demonstration of a new era in world trade practices and the growing strength of emerging economies.
This new era is one that belongs to the innovative, those with relevant knowledge and those who are able to recognise changing world climates and adapt accordingly.
There are many well-rehearsed arguments setting out the current difficulties that we are facing in the textiles sector here in the European Union.
Whether they are that, as a continent, we simply were not prepared for 1 January 2005, or that the Chinese state involvement in the production processes of its manufacturers distorts true market competition, it is certain that the experience we are having today with textiles will, in time, prove not to be unique.
Indeed, I just read a report in newspaper this morning that sets out details of the first round of imports of 4x4 vehicles from China, at a price that I cannot see any current suppliers ever being able to match in the EU.
That is the extent of the competition that we are now facing.
We must recognise that the economic world order is now changing at a pace as never seen before.
That creates for us many managerial challenges at EU level and it is here that we, as an institution, must do all that we can to empower our entrepreneurs with knowledge so that they may continue to compete and lead the field in our areas of expertise.
It is not desirable that management of the sort that we have recently had to endure through negotiations with the Chinese should happen again with any of our competing partners.
The Commission was right to take the steps that it did, but that is no long-term solution.
Our experience should widen our vision, strengthen our position, so that we may seize the opportunities that lie within the management challenges that we face.
I represent a constituency with a long history of leading in the textiles trade.
The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom.
Much of that has changed over the years.
Mills that once employed thousands now employ in the very low hundreds.
That change started in the 1980s, when changing conditions demanded computer-generated production processes and the longer-term efficiencies that they produce.
It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level, and many valued and skilled people found themselves with redundant skills overnight.
The vision, lack of provision of knowledge to empower and innovation was not catered for at a national level.
The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience, but rather a window in which we evolve our industry.
The report, as finalised by the Committee on International Trade, is one that I am able to recommend to this House.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I thank Mrs SaÃ¯fi for her timely report and believe that the end of the Multifibre Agreement poses a very great challenge to a great many countries around the world.
The World Bank and the World Trade Organization predict that as a result of the abolition of all quotas Chinaâs share of world trade in textiles and clothing will rise from 17% in 2003 to over 50% by 2010.
Some argue that to date Chinaâs imports have mostly grown at the expense of imports from other third countries which have seen their share of the EU market decrease, but it is already very clear that the EU textile and clothing industry is experiencing significant pressure.
According to the European apparel and textile organisation, Eurotex, the sector could risk losing 1Â 000 jobs a day and up to a million jobs before the end of 2006.
I welcome the steps that the Commission has finally taken to address the problem but I wonder what makes them so confident that a few yearsâ breathing space will really make any long-term difference.
Since the sector in the EU has already had ten years in which to make adaptations to this new reality, what more will they do in the next few years that they have not already done?
My concern in saying that is that the Commission is underestimating the size of the challenge we face.
Its response has been to urge European manufacturers to produce higher-value products rather than competing with China on basics, yet Chinaâs ability to climb rapidly the value-added ladder across so many sectors shows how unhelpful this advice is.
The Commission has also failed to acknowledge that this challenge is a systemic one, not a one-off sectoral one.
The textile sector is likely to be only the first sector among many.
As Mr Karim has just said, we already know that there are many other sectors that are about to cause us concern in terms of Chinese competition.
I am thinking of footwear, bicycles, machine components, and also high-tech goods.
But if the impact in the EU will be severe, in many parts of the developing world it will be devastating, especially for women who are disproportionately represented in these sectors.
In 2000 textiles and clothing accounted for 95% of all Bangladeshâs industrial goods exports.
In Laos they accounted for 93%, Cambodia 83%, Pakistan 73%, the list goes on.
The sector employed nearly 2 million workers in Bangladesh, 1.4 million workers in Pakistan.
Little wonder, then, that several dozen countries led by Bangladesh and Mauritius made an eleventh hour appeal to the World Trade Organization to save their textile industries.
It is very unfortunate that their appeal fell on deaf ears, because Chinaâs deflationary pressures are already driving down wages, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workersâ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive.
In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage will no longer apply to the clothing industry.
The Bangladeshi government has recently announced that it will increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restriction on womenâs night work.
Now, part of the solution undoubtedly lies in pressure on China to meet social and environmental standards, so that its competitive advantage is not based on the appalling exploitation of workers or the environment.
But that alone is not enough.
The challenge posed by China raises some fundamental questions about the logic and direction of free trade itself and it demonstrates the destruction that happens when a country has not just a comparative advantage but a more or less absolute advantage in so many areas.
The old theories about free trade always being a win-win arrangement are shown to be fundamentally flawed and therefore the Commission urgently needs to undertake more research in order to understand these new trends better and formulate appropriate policy approaches.
Finally, I just want to say that I regret that two of the amendments submitted today link textiles and REACH.
I think those amendments are very misleading and unhelpful and unfortunately, largely because of those amendments, my Group will abstain on the final vote on this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I cannot fathom the general uproar about the rapid increase in textile imports from China since 1Â January this year, for it was clear to all of us that this was precisely what was going to happen.
If you open up and liberalise the markets without imposing conditions, you simply have to expect other producers to seize their opportunity and benefit from it by rushing headlong into the newly-open markets.
Just take a look at Chinaâs main imports at present: aluminium smelters, casting machines, presses, moulding dies, and roller mills.
What that tells you is that we will have enormous problems in five yearsâ time â in the footwear industry, in the bicycle industry, in the car industry and in iron- and steelmaking.
Not even the stay of execution until 2008 provided for by special safeguard clauses will solve the problem; it will do no more than alleviate it.
It is naive to demand the same conditions of competition for trade with China and with other countries.
Does that mean that, from 2008 onwards, a worker in the European textile industry will have to take home the same pay as his Chinese counterpart in order to be able to compete?
The idea is absurd.
It is both an absurdity and a scandal that the European Union, by going as far as to subsidise those companies that transfer production to third countries, is sawing through the branch on which it sits.
The only chance of a solution lies in the complete recasting of the EUâs trade policies.
The EU must commit itself to a system of fair trade, and that involves abandoning the unfettered opening-up of markets and liberalisation.
A fair balance of interests implies the promotion of trade where it is rational and not an end in itself, alongside the maintenance and promotion of local production and regional economic cycles, not only in our own regions but also in developing countries.
This also involves something for which my own group has called, namely a commitment on the part of the European Union to improved working conditions and workersâ social security entitlements, as also to high environmental standards both in our own industry and in the production systems of our trading partners.
This means taking into account, as appropriate, developmental differences between our various trading partners.
It has to be said, though, that it is urgently necessary that the Commissionâs mandate for trade negotiations be redrafted once and for all.
The old mandate, dating back to 1999, has failed twice, in Seattle and CancÃºn, and it will fail again in Hong Kong.
I do not grasp how the Commission is meant â as this report itself puts it â to draw up its future mandate itself.
I endorse the rapporteurâs demand for targeted support for research and development in the textile sector, where priority should be given to the development of safe, chemical-free textiles by way of the consistent application of the principle of mutual recognition, wholly in the spirit of REACH.
I believe that there is also a need to ensure that consumers do not become specimens for the testing of textile products derived from every variety of nanotechnology before the effects of this have been adequately researched.
Â Â  . Mr President, since the abolition of the import quotas in January 2005, the global textiles sector has undergone drastic change.
Alongside spectacular growth in the Chinese textiles exports, there is a deep crisis in the textiles sector within the European Union and in the developing countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos.
I share the rapporteurâs concerns about the considerable growth in the quantity of Chinese textiles on the European market, and call on the Commission to closely monitor the implementation of the bilateral agreement between the European Union and China between 2005 and 2008.
Let me underline the fact that this agreement is just the first step in making the global textiles market fair and enabling it to function properly.
The Commission must continue the dialogue with Beijing to make it clear that a liberalised world market is dependent on a level playing field if it is to function.
Under no circumstances is it compatible with the principles of the free market that illegal state support systematic export subsidies should be paid, that intellectual property rights should be violated and that a countryâs own market should be insufficiently open.
These things cannot be explained by ignorance, given the precision with which Beijing reminds the European Union of its WTO obligations.
The rapporteur is right to ask that attention be paid to Chinaâs compliance with labour guidelines.
In many factories, the workers, including many children, are required to work under appalling conditions.
The Commission must actively pursue a policy aimed at improving working conditions in China.
That is not only vital for the Chinese workers, but also for textile workers in neighbouring countries.
As a result of the Chinese expansion, textile companies in those countries are forced to reduce production costs still further in order to remain competitive internationally.
I do think, though, that it is disappointing that the rapporteur should take so narrow a view of the future of the European textile sector as lying in a Euro-Mediterranean zone.
Within the complex global textiles market, the European Union should not primarily focus on cooperation with one region.
Moreover, concluding a trade agreement with a country such as Syria is, given the current human rights situation, unthinkable.
The Commission must clearly map the opportunities and threats within the global textiles sector without import quotas and formulate clear policy for the European textiles sector after 2008.
Only a commercial and innovative European textiles sector can retain a competitive position on the global market.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the action launched some months ago by the European Union, which has been hit hard by the intolerable increases in textile and clothing imports from China, has started to produce results by means of the memorandum of understanding.
Total liberalisation, however, will only come about in 2008.
The report by MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi, whom I truly thank for her excellent work, rightly insists that the utmost attention continue to be paid to verifying the good will of the Chinese authorities and to keeping a worsening situation under control.
By means of the amendments to the final text, I wished to emphasise a number of extremely important aspects for the European textile sector and for manufactured goods in general.
Suitable penalties today need to be laid down, such as putting a ban on trade with the European Union for a certain period of time for all of those found guilty of illegally importing goods or of importing counterfeit goods, and who are thus implicated in a crime, the severity of which must be judged in terms of its repercussions on European society as a whole, not only on producers, but above all on consumers.
I call for constant monitoring of the Chinese authoritiesâ commitment to combating piracy the counterfeiting of trademarks and products, and child exploitation, and to ensuring respect for workersâ rights.
Another important problem arises from the fact that the boom in textile exports from China has caused devastating effects in those developing countries whose principal and essential market for placing and selling their goods used to be the European Union, which is now overloaded with Chinese goods.
The needs of those countries must also be taken into account as the sector finds a new equilibrium in the next few years, which will be marked by trade liberalisation.
It is the Commissionâs responsibility to implement strategies providing vital support for modernisation and enabling businesses to confront, in an informed way and with a clear outlook, a path that is still an uphill climb, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Liberalisation of the global market cannot occur if the parties involved do not all respect the same rules and the provisions resulting from the agreements.
The absence of rules or the failure to respect them prevents fair competition, and, in actual fact, invalidates the very concept of the free market.
We are not only protecting an important EU sector of production, but we are also protecting the right of consumers to have access to safe and quality products, and the right of workers to know the true prospects for their future and to have the social clauses implemented with respect for human rights.
The European Union has to forcefully say to the rest of the world that there can be no free market without fair competition, and that in order for competition to be fair, the common rules must be respected.
Â Â  â Several Members are addressing the Presidency with regard to the serious events currently taking place, of which you may be aware, involving a series of explosions on the London transport network.
Several underground stations and several buses have been targeted, and it is reported that there are some people injured, perhaps some fatalities; we do not know any more for the moment.
I understand that Members wish to speak on this matter.
I should simply like to say to them that the Presidency and the whole of Parliament are, of course, extremely concerned by what is happening.
I simply propose that we do not open a debate now.
These events are ongoing.
I have been informed about them.
I have requested information.
There has been yet another explosion only a few minutes ago.
A third incident, as the British call it â but it is more than that, it was in all likelihood an attack â has occurred in a London underground station.
I believe that we should wait a little while longer before debating the issue, to find out what is happening and to have more information.
For the time being, the London underground is completely blocked off, paralysed, closed.
