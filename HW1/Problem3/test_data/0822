The Commission, out of the goodness of its heart, was trying to do the Council a favour by putting these changes into this SAB.
We want to see them too, but quite frankly, the sooner we get the SAB voted at our second reading, on the assumption that the Council does not agree with our first reading, then the changes will come about.
A third criticism from the Council is that there is no chance whatsoever of spending the money this year.
If that is the case, we could do something about it later on.
As I said SAB 3 is coming.
We have asked the Commission for information on how the money can be spent, whether it can be spent in time or whether all of it can be spent.
If the Commission comments support the Council's position, then of course we will have to re-consider.
If we do not do it under SAB 2, then we could certainly do it under SAB 3.
For those trying to read between the lines, I hope that message is pretty clear, because this is not just about this particular SAB.
There are other consequences.
If I use the words 'Financial Regulation' then the penny may drop with some people and they may begin to understand what I am talking about when I keep mentioning SAB 3.
Another aspect here is that some Member States, including my own, will say that there will be a hole in their own budgets.
They are right.
The easiest way to fill that hole is to get this business sorted out as quickly as possible.
This is linked, however, not only to SAB 2 or SAB 3, but also to the Financial Regulation.
I would hope that with the good cooperation of all three institutions this issue can be put to rest in the not too distant future, to make the Council happy, to make ourselves happy and to make sure that the Commission can get on with doing the job that it wants to do.
Mr President, I do not believe I can improvise a five-minute speech on budgetary affairs.
In any event, Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues from the Committee on Budgets and everybody else interested in budgetary affairs, the Wynn report - which was previously the Costa Neves report and which will very shortly be the PodestÃ  report, which means that it will be one of the most well-agreed and negotiated reports of this whole legislative period - contains some very interesting points for Parliament to discuss.
Firstly, and this is an issue which affects the Commission, as our chairman Terry Wynn has pointed out, we should ask ourselves why so many amending and supplementary budgets are needed, since they very often entail administrative costs because a new procedure has to be undertaken and, above all, because these distort and devalue the annual budgetary procedure, as we all know, because we have discussed this many times.
It would be preferable for us to restrict in some way this possibility of making so many amending budgets.
This does not mean that Parliament does not agree with the policy of amending budgets.
What is more, this Parliament, as you are well aware, is totally prepared to defend its rights so that amending budgets continue to exist in the current procedure, in their current form and with Parliament's current rights.
Therefore, we agree upon the basis, that is to say, that we agree that amending budgets should continue to exist, and that this Parliament should have something to say with regard to all of them.
We are talking in this case about a budget of balances, an enormous budget and surplus.
We are talking about EUR 10 billion plus another estimated EUR 1.2 billion.
We are talking, more or less, about EUR 12 billion.
This is money which was already budgeted for and which will be given back to the Member States because of an underspend.
A budgetary surplus in national budgetary policy is a good thing, it is a saving.
It will often be the result of efforts not to spend and is money that will revert to national coffers or to taxpayers.
However, in this case we are talking about a different kind of surplus.
We are talking about an underspend in budget appropriations that were approved at the time by the European Parliament.
We are talking about poor execution and poor management.
We do not know whether this is the responsibility of the Commission, of the Member States, of the regional authorities or whoever, but, in any case, we find ourselves having to cope with the reality of EUR 12 billion that has been poorly managed and that will have to be returned to the Member States.
This is not good news for anyone concerned.
It is not good news for the Commission nor for Parliament.
Neither, essentially, is this good news for Finance Ministers, although it would appear to be so, for these are European funds, Community funds that have a multiplier effect in national economies.
If they are not used, evidently this multiplier effect will not take place.
Therefore, essentially, to have to give back this money as it is is a lost opportunity.
However, on the positive side, this budget will allow us to analyse how to reduce the balance of outstanding payments and needs for 2003 payments.
Obviously, in order to enter into the payments for 2003, it is a good idea to start with payments for 2002, and for this reason amendments to payment appropriations of EUR 4.5 billion have been put forward, with which I believe this House will totally agree, because these affect all categories of expenditure.
From the Structural Funds or the Leonardo programmes to the external action programmes, they cover the whole range of budgetary needs for payments.
We know this does not have to be a definitive position.
Political life is a life of negotiation.
We will have to negotiate with the Commission and the Council.
Perhaps so many payment appropriations are not necessary.
The effort needed for 2003 will perhaps be greater.
Maybe the Council will want to reflect on the correct way to carry out interinstitutional relations, particularly with Parliament.
I am sure that, in any event, the task of the three institutions this remaining month before the second part-session in May, in which we will make a definitive decision, will be a month of much negotiation and we are of course all very optimistic in this regard.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is a fact that the beginning of every year, or a day relatively soon after it, finds us facing the same procedure as today's.
One could get the impression that, for the Finance Ministers, Easter means great big Easter eggs from Europe, which take the form of returned funds, which of course take some pressure off the national budgets, and on which we in this House have to take decisions at the beginning of each year.
As has already been said far more than once, with this Supplementary and Amending Budget we will be talking about EUR 10 billion, and the EUR 2 billion that have as good as been announced are yet to be put in front of us.
We must, though, remember that at the end of last year we repaid EUR 1.2 billion, whether on a one-off basis or in anticipation, which means that for this one year we are talking about over EUR 13 billion in unused resources.
In the same way, at the end of every year, when Christmas is approaching, we do not necessarily have Christmas presents for Parliament, and each time we have to fight to raise small amounts that are not allocated to important political tasks.
Over the last three years we had Kosovo, where we really had to fight hard to end up with any money at all.
This had to do with Serbia, it had to do with aid for fisheries in the southern parts of this EU of ours - in Spain and Portugal - and we even had to dig into our emergency reserves in order to guarantee the continuing reconstruction of the Balkans last year.
Yet today's backflow is not really cause for rejoicing, as it only means that there are resources that have not been utilised.
This can mean that the programmes for which they were intended were not there, or that serious work was not done in the Member States, or that the options for giving help to the public have not been sufficiently exhausted.
What it does mean in any case is that all of what has been announced must at some point or other be implemented, and every one of today's payment reimbursements is a burden for the future, because, if it is not paid out today, it will be paid out at some point in the future, and so only limited rejoicing is called for.
I think that we have to make it clear that this is not really helping.
As long as two years ago, I suggested on one occasion that, instead of letting all the money be returned, we should put some - 10% of the returnable resources, for example - into, as it were, a reserve or emergency fund.
That would, for a start, be another way of going about things.
Funds would not be constantly moved back and forth, so we would, instead, be able to make rather more reliable plans, and it would also help us to move forward in other areas.
Supplementary and Amending Budgets can be talked about and looked at from many different angles, this one being one of them.
We in Parliament intend to amend the Supplementary and Amending Budget in such a way that a substantial amount does not go straight back to the Member States.
We have just heard that there are payments that have to be made in many areas, with past commitments having to be met.
In the coming days and weeks, we will be intensively seeking discussions with the Council.
We will pay precise attention to how amenable to discussions the Council is, and to how openly it deals with us.
I do think we can find good solutions to this.
We must all be aware that cooperation means that all are ready to talk to each other.
That is as much the case as regards the Supplementary and Amending Budget as it is in the Budget procedure.
We are ready, but we are also prepared for very intensive discussions with each other and, if need be, for an in-depth exchange of arguments.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Wynn for an excellent report and say that I fully support his ideas on amending the Financial Regulation.
The Supplementary and Amending Budget before us includes two important matters: the new basis for collecting the own resources, and carrying over last year's surplus to cover this year's budget.
The collection cost for Traditional Own Resources is increasing from 10% to 25% and the value added charge is falling from 1% to around half a per cent.
The change is based on the new Council decision, which has only just been ratified.
It will particularly benefit the EU's net contributors.
Germany's annual contribution will fall by around EUR 847 million, that of the Netherlands by EUR 505 million, and that of Sweden and Austria by around EUR 140 million.
Italy's contribution will increase by approximately EUR 757 million and that of France by EUR 458 million.
The decision shows how sensitive an issue EU contributions are in terms of internal policy, because they only represent around 1% of GDP.
A politically harder question is last year's unused appropriations, which, according to the explanatory statement, amount to the enormous sum of EUR 18 billion, or 20% of the entire budget.
Unused appropriations for Structural Funds alone amounted to EUR 10.5 billion, or 32% of the total.
Last year EUR 6.5 billion of these funds remained unused.
The reason for this underutilization is first and foremost Commission bureaucracy.
It is difficult to put decisions into effect.
The procedure whereby decisions are taken is confused and vague.
The entire process lacks any clear approach or personal accountability.
Documents lie around buried under the official machinery and nobody cares about, or takes the responsibility for, delays with regard to decisions.
If the budget were so poorly implemented in any Member State the government would fall straightaway.
The Commission must therefore really make more of an effort.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Costa Neves, for he has certainly made a major contribution to the work of our committee in recent years and his input has always been positive.
As the rapporteur has rightly pointed out in the explanatory statement, the supplementary and amending budget which we are to vote on tomorrow has two distinguishing features.
Firstly, it budgets for 2002 a preliminary amount of EUR 10 billion of the surplus carried over from 2001. This surplus, which is mainly the result of underspends in the areas of Structural Funds and Agriculture, is equivalent to a 'reimbursement' to Member States as it will decrease their payments for the 2002 Budget.
Secondly, it recalculates the financing of the 2002 Budget on the basis of the new Council Decision on own resources and, as a result, the share of Traditional Own Resources in collection costs that Member States are allowed to keep has increased from 10% to 25%.
However, what interests me most at the moment is the first feature of this budget.
If we do not allow our attention to be diverted by the populist view that it is good to save money, the full gravity of the situation becomes apparent: in other words, the European Commission, the symbol - rightly or wrongly - for millions of European citizens, of Europe, of integration, of the future, has proved incapable of implementing the budget as adopted by Parliament and the Council, and is now left with a surplus of 12 per cent.
However, there is another side to the matter: the Member States, which are constantly asking for more money for structural actions and which, on the eve of enlargement, are fighting tough political battles in order not to lose Community structural support for their citizens, have been unable to implement the commitments undertaken and have not asked for payments which have already been appropriated.
Clearly, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is fairly universal and it is one that needs urgent resolution, for it is an offence to our fellow citizens and genuinely exposes us to the ridicule of a public which is becoming increasingly less disposed to understand and increasingly more liable, on the other hand, to let itself be influenced by summary criticism.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that, this evening, we have achieved unanimous support for the position of our rapporteur, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and I think that the Council must listen, let us say through an intermediary, to how the House votes tomorrow because we cannot always trust unanimity. Unanimity is sometimes the expression of the desire of an institution to set out its stall, to make its voice heard over that of an arm of the budgetary authority which sometimes forgets the balance between Parliament and the Council and attempts to encroach upon our powers, our prerogatives and the role that we have in relation to public opinion.
Yet, this problem, because of the fact that such a considerable amount was not spent, is a serious problem, it is not possible to simply ask us for a full discharge, perhaps a blank cheque, without even giving it some thought, without even asking the questions that we are asking this evening.
However this situation unfolds, therefore, I think that we have behaved properly towards the electorate, towards the citizens of Europe, towards ourselves, in investigating the DAB and in doing so, telling the Council to be aware that both our institutions have to decide, as that is what the Treaties stipulate and that is what logic dictates as well.
We have a DAB balance; we also have responsibilities as a budgetary authority.
We are fulfilling them, we are awaiting the Council's response, we are also waiting for the Commission's next steps and we shall issue an opinion at second reading, because this is a problem. It is right to raise it and we have done well to raise it in this way.
Mr President, Commissioner, the amending budget we are debating today, practically in private, reveals, as has been stated, a disease endemic throughout the execution of payment appropriations, because, given the amount in question, we are not talking about an exception, but the rule.
The 2000 settlement presented a surplus in the payment forecasts of some EUR 11 billion; that for 2001 could end up at around EUR 14 billion, a surplus that will, logically, lighten Member States' contributions in years to come.
Under these conditions, doubts are cast upon these procedures and their legitimate use is undermined.
These imbalances are largely concentrated in category 2. We already know that the first few years of the implementation of regional and cohesion policy, the programming phase, takes up a great deal of time, resources and energy.
Suffice it to say that the approval of the Community Support Framework for objective 1 regions took place in October 2000, with regard to Spain, and this decision is the prerequisite for cofinancing.
The results of the 2001 consumption of payments, under this heading, produces some worrying information.
The rate of implementation dropped 10 points in relation to the previous year and, with regard to the total intended for objective 1 regions, it dropped 6 points.
The final result is therefore a considerable increase in the RAL.
The current regulations of the Structural Funds should, therefore, be analysed in the light of this.
Faced with enlargement, it should be improved to allow better financial management of the programmes for obvious reasons: because regional policy is at the heart of the European project and is fundamental for the progress of the integration process, and because it is a key instrument that enjoys the widest consensus.
Similar problems, but involving lower figures, arise in headings 3 and 4: consumption of payments in external actions in 2001 also dropped 5 points in relation to the previous year - to be specific, initiatives promoting democracy and human rights only reached 56% of the anticipated payments.
I believe, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that Parliament's amendments have no other purpose than to temporarily slow down a saving that, to a large extent, is of a transitory nature for the Member States and does not aim to hinder the management of financial flows in Member States, but to remedy a situation that is neither politically nor financially reasonable.
Firstly, the Commission should improve its working systems both in the preparatory phase and in the execution phase.
In this regard, the difficulties in payments anticipated for 2003 should be resolved satisfactorily.
Secondly, the Council should understand that Parliament exercises its competencies as budgetary authority with all that this implies and that this modified amending budget means that, even when, with regard to own resources, Parliament is not on an equal footing with the Council, in this and in other areas that are currently being discussed, what citizens are asking for is a stable institutional balance and a dialogue which obtains practical results, because there are no other alternatives that would produce improved benefits for all.
Mr President, can I say that everyone in the Chamber this evening knows that the reason why this money is being held back in the system.
It is because there is a great need for structural funding to be spent in our various countries and regions.
We are now some two and a half years through the seven-year programme 2000-2006.
We are thus over 30% of the way through, and we have grossly underspent.
What we are doing now is giving the Member States the chance to get their act together and to spend this money, to help improve the environment, working conditions and employment prospects throughout our European Union.
This is for the betterment of the economy as a whole and of conditions in our areas.
We are taking a responsible attitude and I am delighted that we have unanimity round the Chamber this evening.
I hope this will be reflected in the voting tomorrow.
It is very important indeed for us to make sure that the countries spend this money, to allow the private sector to get its act together because, at the end of 2006, with enlargement, we, the existing fifteen countries, will lose the ability to have structural funding.
The other five or ten countries coming into the European Union will demand structural funding for their countries.
We will have a very rapid cut-off.
It may well be that we do not even allow any overlapping into the year 2007-2008 on the spend if it gets further behind.
I therefore urge every single government throughout the European Union to use this money, use it effectively and use it quickly.
I thoroughly endorse the Chairman's guidance to us, as team captains so to speak, to make sure that we vote conclusively together tomorrow to withhold the necessary money and urge those countries to spend it properly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening is a special one for me, as, by way of exception, I am not at all in agreement with the Committee on Budget's resolution, and take a different view of these matters.
The Member States do not just want their money back, they are actually owed it under the Treaty, and the Commission has accordingly submitted the Supplementary and Amending Budget.
The money from the Member States' contributions to the European Budget that we have not used over the past year should, in accordance with the legislation, be given back by us to the Member States as quickly as possible on economic grounds alone, as anything else would result in economic losses.
We had a very large surplus last year, and I will be coming back in this speech to its various elements.
The Supplementary and Amending Budget also comprises several elements, namely, firstly, the surplus from last year and secondly the implementation of the new own resources decision, which has various constituent parts.
The new own resources decision, as agreed in Berlin, was meant to enter into force with effect from 1 January 2002, but, as several Member States were late in ratifying it, the 2000 Budget still had to be based on the old own resources decision.
What this means in real terms is that some of the present Member States had to pay higher contributions than they would have to under the new own resources decision.
The new own resources decision has various elements to it: 25% of customs receipts can remain with the Member States, and the share from VAT receipts is reduced, while that in terms of GNP is increased, thus resulting in the financial burden being shifted.
There is also the third element: four Member States get, so to speak, a rebate on the rebate paid to the United Kingdom, that is, one rebate on another.
That is what has been decided, and is now to be put into practice, the Commission having for that reason linked it with the surplus.
Member States will be enabled to keep 25% of customs receipts with effect from 1 January 2001.
The money that would have been required for this has of course been set off against the surplus, as it would otherwise have had to be returned and then collected back again.
(Interruption: Very good!)
It gives me great pleasure to hear that, Mr Walter!
I would now, though, like to briefly say something about how a surplus of these dimensions came about.
It is the case, as has been said here already, that the surplus or under-utilisation in the area of the Structural Funds is around the order of EUR 10 billion.
I must again point out that, at this stage of the new programme, it is no longer a case of the Commission being too slow in authorising projects; rather, we now have the stipulation that the Commission makes repayments to the Member States when these submit an invoice for a programme that has been implemented.
If there are no invoices, then nothing can be paid out.
In 2000, we still had the option of making advance payments, as provided for by the relevant regulation.
In 2001, that was no longer possible, and the question does indeed arise as to why the Member States' estimates last year of the resources they required to implement the programmes were far in excess of the sums subsequently called for.
Still in connection with the surplus, there are two other things I would like to mention.
Firstly, in the agricultural policy area, there were actually savings of the order of EUR 2 billion, mainly because the weakness that affected the market for cattle following the BSE crisis turned out not to last for as long as had at first been surmised, and the market recovered more quickly.
Other market areas were in a better position than prior estimates had suggested.
We are talking here about real savings in which we can take pleasure.
Secondly, in foreign policy, that is, in category 4, almost 90% of the resources available were drawn on.
In the second year, we achieved an improvement on the former position, and I believe that it has to be clearly underlined that the administrative reforms introduced by my fellow-Commissioners Chris Patten and Poul Nielson in the field of foreign policy are now bearing real fruit.
The charge that the EU makes great promises but never really gets anything done will not stick any more.
The Member States are of course waiting for last year's high surplus to be returned to their budgets.
It is of such dimensions that it is now of real economic relevance to the budgets of the Member States.
When you consider that the economic slowdown that we have had since 11 September has of course had its effects on the Member States' budgets, it is absolutely clear that they are awaiting the repayment from the European Budget precisely in order to avoid greater deficits.
The Commission takes the view that it would be sensible in terms of overall economic responsibility to avoid delays.
Let me now summarise Mr Walter's and Mr Wynn's contributions: We have not given back any Easter eggs, and a glance at the timetable indicates that there will not be any bouquets for Whitsun either, but I will gladly accede to the request of the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets not to let them turn into Christmas presents!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on two reports: (A5-0066/2002) by Mrs Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the programme of action for the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community development cooperation, and (A5-0067/2002), by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, on the report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Annual Report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union 2000.
Mr President, Article 3 of the Treaty stipulates that the European Community wishes to eliminate all inequality and promote equality between men and women.
In 1995 in a resolution, the Council specified gender equality as the foundation for development cooperation.
Also in 1995, a ten-point action programme was adopted at the International Women's Conference in Peking to promote gender equality.
This action programme was signed by all the countries attending the conference.
However, the situation still leaves a great deal to be desired, certainly in the area of development cooperation.
There is a lack not only of projects for women but also, and above all, of projects that are implemented in consultation with women.
During the previous part-session, we adopted the very controversial Izquierdo Rojo report on women and fundamentalism.
This report was approved unanimously in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
The problem in this field is obvious to everyone.
We are also largely agreed on the directions which the solutions should take.
Development cooperation is still too much a matter that involves men only.
Seventy percent of the approximately one and a half billion people who live below the poverty line are women.
This means that they are greatly lacking in financial resources, but there is more to the matter in practice.
In many cases, there is also a lack of fundamental human rights and social rights, such as the right to proper food, drinking water, education health care and work.
People who live below the poverty line often have too little control over, and access to, services, sources of aid and goods and are barely involved in the decision-making process.
Interestingly, there are increasing indications that there is a link between poverty and gender inequality. Countries which struggle with a high level of gender inequality, such as Sierra Leone, Niger, Burkina Faso or Mali, also suffer the highest levels of poverty.
In countries where there is less gender inequality, there is also less poverty.
Moreover, it appears that development projects, for example in the area of health care, literacy or agriculture, are more successful if women are also involved.
Investing in girls seems to result in lower levels of child mortality and mortality among women, creates better food safety and means an improvement in the fight against poverty.
Not for nothing, therefore, is development policy based on the principle of sustainable, fair, human and social development based on participation.
Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are inextricably linked to this, and this is why women should also be involved.
Since the Council defined gender mainstreaming as a point of departure for development cooperation policy six years ago, disappointingly little has actually happened.
This is why I am pleased with this Commission communication.
The action programme can provide an additional boost to the implementation of gender equality in the EU's development cooperation policy.
I can identify with the three main points which the Commission outlines, namely the analysis and integration of the gender aspect within the priority fields of Community development cooperation, the horizontal integration of the gender aspect in projects and programmes, and the development of an internal gender capacity in the European Community itself.
These three points, and particularly the last one, are extremely important.
For a change in mentality is also required in the bodies of the European Union itself.
If the staff who are to assess, implement and evaluate the programmes do not take this sufficiently into account, how can the situation ever improve?
It is necessary to train our own people, as it is to provide adequate financial support for the policy.
It is unfortunate and disappointing in my view that the Commission is once again opting for an economic approach and describing women mainly as a means of achieving economic growth.
The fact that women are people who are entitled to quality of life in their own right and, as such, can, and should, be able to lay claim to civil rights, political rights and human rights, is still too much overlooked in my view.
The five-year action plan is there to implement the good intentions which the Commission formulates.
Indeed, the intentions should not remain merely good intentions.
This is why the plan also requires the further development of a work programme with clearly defined working methods, deadlines, financial resources and indicators.
I welcome the intention of deciding in favour of an interim evaluation, and I hope that the Commission will involve the European Parliament in this in good time.
I should also like to note the importance of cooperation with non-governmental organisations and other related organisations at international level.
These can often be of major significance.
Finally, the Regulation in question lapses in 2003.
It forms the legal basis for the budget line which promotes the integration of the gender issue in the development cooperation policy.
In my report, I therefore call for a renewal of this Regulation, thus allowing the work that needs to be done in the field to be continued.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have here the annual report, presented by the Commission, to analyse the progress made with regard to equal opportunities for men and women in the European Union in the year 2000.
We are pleased to see that the employment rate for women has risen, albeit only slightly, but we still notice that women's jobs are, on the whole, part-time, unstable and offer less opportunity for promotion.
We have not been able to achieve equal pay for the same jobs.
The differences are still very significant, and although we have made some progress in reconciling professional and family life, we have not been able to achieve greater task sharing within the family, which would allow women to dedicate themselves more professionally to their work.
When we consider that women need help, our thoughts turn to mothers, young women with small children, and we believe that we can resolve these problems by setting up crÃšches.
Another very common phenomenon is that older people are now increasingly living with the rest of their family, people these same women have to care for, disabled people, perhaps, which means that housewives, these same women, have an increased workload.
We do not on the whole take into account the fact that social assistance is also needed, such as day centres, that would make it easier for women to go to work.
We notice that women have not made great progress with regard to the society of the future, that is to say, new technologies or the information society.
Only 20% of women participate in this sector and this is something that we should promote, making sure that they can have access to lifelong training in this area, since the jobs of the future will rely heavily on the society built around these new technologies.
There is a very noticeable absence of women in managerial positions, in companies, associations, political parties and in public institutions.
We repeatedly call for increased participation of women in these jobs, a better balance between men and women, but we still notice a difficulty in achieving the presence of women in decision-making posts.
Therefore, we call for innovative measures and specific actions aimed at better representation for women in all areas of employment, in the professional field, with better task-sharing between men and women, and improved reconciliation between professional and family life.
We must monitor compliance with the Community objective of equality between men and women in programmes financed by European funds, pursuant to the Treaty, and to promote a greater participation of women in decision-making posts.
These objectives will also be taken into account in the EU enlargement process, monitoring the incorporation of the Community acquis into the national legislations of candidate countries.
Domestic violence and poor treatment and exploitation of women is still a very serious problem and an area in which we need to continue working in order to help victims and eradicate, where possible, the causes of these phenomena, such as poverty and insecurity.
As we can see, there is still much work to be done. There are still very few women working in managerial positions, little representation of women in the labour market and, most importantly, we are not yet at the stage where women get equal pay for the same work.
I believe, therefore, that we need to call on the Commission and the institutions to closely monitor this situation in order to ensure that the objective of equality is realised as soon as possible.
Mr President, there are two important reports on this evening's agenda.
The first is the report on the European Commission's final report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union in 2000, a subject of prime importance to the quality of democracy in the European Union and of prime importance if we are to achieve the development objectives set in Lisbon.
The second is the report on the action programme to include equal opportunities in cooperation with third countries. This is crucial to harmonious development throughout the world, even though we have been so slow to realise it; it is six years now since the Council first included the equality dimension in the Community's development policy and the action programme was published.
To be perfectly honest, it was the situation of women in Afghanistan, which unfortunately came to light after the terrorist attack on September 11, which woke us up to the plight of women's rights in various parts of the globe.
As far as the first report is concerned, which deals with matters closer to home, Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea points out - and I agree with her - that the report has improved this year in comparison with previous years and contains a more in-depth evaluation of the policies applied on equal opportunities.
I too should like to point out that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has expressed its dissatisfaction at the fact that the European Commission is unable to monitor the material application of Community policy on equal treatment for men and women.
We need to find and apply ways of monitoring these policies.
This is also immensely important to the new countries which will be joining us.
As far as the Lisbon objective is concerned, there may have been an increase in the employment rate, but the Member States still need to continue and step up their efforts to set more specific objectives in their national action programmes if they are to have both more efficient policies and monitoring policies.
I agree with the rapporteur that we need to voice our concern about the lack of job security, the lack of quality jobs, the poor career prospects open to women in Europe and the lack of infrastructures.
We are not just talking about nurseries, we are talking about care for the elderly and the sick.
The conference on people with disabilities organised by the Spanish Presidency has already stressed the immense importance of infrastructures for people with disabilities, both to allow them to retain their dignity and to relieve women of some of their responsibilities.
I agree with the rapporteur that we need to step up efforts to compile gender-based statistics which reflect the real situation of women on the job market and in other sectors and to apply more efficient policies.
Mr President, Commissioner, my heartfelt thanks are due today to Mrs Martens and Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea for their reports on the programme of action for mainstreaming gender equality in development cooperation and on the annual report for 2000.
I think there are a number of parallels between them, and Social Democrat members can note with satisfaction that yet another building block has been added to implement the platform of the Beijing Conference on Women.
The framework strategy of gender mainstreaming is being implemented consistently.
We are facing a thorough analysis of the problem and see here clear instructions as to how it is to be implemented on a regional and national basis.
Gender awareness is in the meantime becoming accepted among some decision-makers, and we know that sustainable development must first begin with women.
We also know that sustainable development cannot be had for free, and so it is appalling that the Budget allocation for gender-specific development cooperation, which was EUR 5 million as recently as 1998, was cut by 60% in 2001.
How is a change in thinking to be brought about?
Incidentally, I recall that the Member States had undertaken to utilise 0.7% of their gross national product for development aid.
We are nowhere near approaching that.
If we do not act without delay, the credibility of the so-called developed countries will be at stake.
I also ask the Commission what became of the 'gender desk' in development cooperation.
How are we to improve reproductive health and family planning, improving access to contraception - which includes ensuring the prevention of HIV/Aids - and, moreover, get these things into rural areas, if we do not replenish Budget resources to a marked degree?
Political discussion may well have enabled us to rescue from the realm of taboo practices which demonstrate contempt for the personal value of women, such as genital mutilation, public floggings, stonings, violence and sexual abuse, to blow the whistle on them on the international stage and also combat them politically, but there is also a need for practical implementation.
We need consistent annual reviews such as that in Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea's report, in order to be able to examine the facts.
That is why my group supports both reports.
We can do no other than back them up entirely and call on the Commission to make these noble objectives a reality.
Mr President, these are two very different reports we are debating here today but, where both reports are concerned, the fact is that, if no really major changes are made - in relation both to the developing countries and to the position of women in the countries of the western world, including the EU - then we can forget all about equality.
The methods required are, of course, completely different, however, and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, precisely because it is clear from the reports that it is different initiatives that are required.
In connection with the developing countries, I would highlight paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 14 of the report which indicate, for example, the need to look more closely at religious, cultural and socio-economic traditions and the role they play in relation to women in the developing countries.
It is all very well talking about 'mainstreaming', but this must not cause us to forget practical action programmes.
When it comes to the EU, I think that an article in today's 'Guardian' has a headline that is very much to the point: 'Women can have it all - with a little bit of help'.
The background to the article is research in the United States showing that 42% of high-salaried women are childless.
They simply start too late and are under the illusion that women can have it all. They cannot.
That is something we cause them to believe.
They cannot have both careers and family lives with children.
The next headline therefore says: 'A female-friendly state can make a significant investment in the future'.
I believe it has to be said that, in a number of Western countries, we are labouring under an illusion concerning equality. Illusion it is, however, and illusion it remains, and we must not therefore imagine that we have obtained equality until men too begin to make demands about wanting to have it all.
It is the subject of men's demands that it is necessary to bring up now.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for their very sound reports, on which I would also congratulate them.
There is every reason to welcome the Commission's programme of action for the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community development cooperation.
At the same time, I have to state that it is remarkable and quite frustrating that it took six years from the Council's making its decision to the Commission's presenting its programme of action.
It is now important for the prioritised areas in the programme of action also to be coordinated with the objectives of the Community framework strategy on gender equality, in which development is of course a recurring theme.
Economic equality, equality on issues of employment and political representation, equal social benefits and the promotion of human rights relating specifically to women are important aspects of these objectives.
In reality, the objectives concern the dignity of both women and men and, in actual fact, the very value of human life.
If these objectives are to be achieved in the developing countries too, there must be an undertaking to include issues of equality in all future programmes and documents concerning the country strategies, as well as in strategies for reducing poverty.
It is also important that compliance with the equality aspects be required for funding from all budget headings within the field of development policy and not only from the HIV and AIDS budget heading, commendable though it is in itself, of course, that equality is required in the latter area.
As soon as possible, the Commission must also table a proposal on the work programme and specify the funding for, and rules governing, its implementation so that it can be implemented quickly.
We know, as a result of countless studies, that democracy and development can only take place if women in the developing countries are fully involved.
I therefore also support the proposal in paragraph 26 to the effect that, in a meeting with the joint parliamentary ACP-EU Assembly, the important issue be addressed of ensuring that the Cotonou Agreement is also complied with in this area.
My group will support the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Martens and Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, whose reports, I believe, have produced unanimity, which is very pleasing.
I would also like to agree with the other speakers who have highlighted a few specific points in these reports.
First of all, I think that they share common ground, and particularly when they demonstrate that the question of poverty, just like the question of violence, are gender-related questions wherever they arise in the world.
We are all too used to this, and I have recently heard so much debate on violence in my country, but no one has pointed out that violence is not meted out in the same way by men and by women and on men and on women.
I believe therefore that the gender aspect of poverty and violence are important points.
I would also like to say that given this difficulty - and there are many other difficulties - but if I think about this particular one, I think that what is in the pipeline in the future directive, Commissioner, which will be based on Article 13 and which will deal with all the questions other than that of employment, the question of the individualisation of rights will be key.
What do I mean by the individualisation of rights?
These are rights that we give, independently of marital status, to a person.
I think that this is our future.
And it is important to emphasise that these reports allude to this and that we must, in my view, defend this particular point.
We must also defend ourselves at a time when, in my country, a candidate standing in the presidential elections is contemplating making women stay at home - he has said this and he has written this.
I think that the question of what we often refer to as conciliation - which I myself do not like to call conciliation - in other words, the organisation, the relationship between what we do at home and what we do with our children, as a family, and what happens in public, whether it be political or professional life, we have a genuine need to organise this.
I think that it is also important to highlight this point, whichever country we might discuss.
Perhaps all we need to do is to think about the future with the individualisation of rights and the interaction between professional and public life, and then think about this directive as well.
Of course, I expect the Commission to put forward its proposals in the very near future, and then we can consider enlargement.
We hope that the acquis communautaire will be transposed into national law.
We want the transposition of the acquis.
We know that it is very difficult.
The Baltic countries will soon start the transposition of some Community legislation into their national law and we know that this will be difficult.
Mr President, we are debating two very important reports on women's rights today.
A few days ago, someone asked me if I really believed that women's rights are violated in Europe.
Naturally I did not need to think long or hard before replying that, compared with other parts of the world, Europe is a paradise for women's rights.
Without doubt it has made a great deal of progress over recent years, as we can see from the European Commission's annual reports.
However, serious problems persist even in democratic Europe, such as violence against women in its various manifestations, domestic violence, sexual violence, violence in the workplace.
And it is to the Spanish Presidency's credit, I say it again, that it has put these issues at the top of its agenda.
The fact that some 500 000 women are bought and sold in the European Union every year is a blatant violation of fundamental rights; the European Union has still not woken up to this and, more to the point, it has still not taken specific measures to combat this phenomenon.
The fact that 3 000 women in the United Kingdom alone are sexually mutilated every year, in the name of cultural traditions which immigrants from fundamentalist and anti-democratic regimes bring with them together with their baggage is also a violation of basic rights, as was the recent crime of honour in Sweden.
The fact is, the European job market is still fragmented along gender lines, women's salaries are much lower than men's, only 25% of businesses belong to women and women are kept below the glass ceiling and out of responsible managerial and decision-making positions; all examples of violations and discrimination against women.
Furthermore, the standard which is the idea at the core of the guidelines for the European strategy on employment should also be the objective for women's employment, as should stepping up measures to reconcile working and family life and individualising rights, as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly points out.
Mr President, it is appalling how women in many developing countries are still being treated.
They often have to do the hard work, give birth to and bring up many children, and are scarcely remunerated for this.
They have no, or poor, access to education.
Women suffer heavily from domestic violence.
Reproductive health care often leaves a great deal to be desired.
Also politically speaking, women do not have a voice.
Cultural, religious and socio-economic customs which are at odds with the humane and equal treatment of women must be broken down.
To fight for this is not a form of neo-colonialism, it is a sine qua non of effective development.
This is why the fight against structural injustice has to play a prominent role in European development policy across the board.
It is very unfortunate that I am the only man to take the floor on this matter this evening.
We men should not leave women to fight this battle alone.
The situation is too appallingly unfair for this.
Mr President, I am struck by the similarities between these reports.
Mr van den Bos has just pointed out that conditions for women in the developing countries are appalling for a variety of reasons.
At the same time, I remembered that Mrs Martens' report states that women in developing countries are often discriminated against in terms of access to food, health care, education, training, decision-making, participation in regional programmes and economic activities, as well as property rights.
It is of course precisely the same as in the EU Member States.
Perhaps the degree of discrimination is not as great in the EU but, as we say in Sweden, 'there are differences of degree in hell'.
The report also makes it clear that remedying a lack of equality and strengthening the role and rights of women are crucial to social justice and development.
That is something which applies to both developing and industrialised countries and within both the EU and its Member States.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs for the contribution they have made with this report.
I would, however, like to focus in particular on Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea's report, for I feel that, as has already been said, the annual report is a genuinely important instrument which allows us all to follow up, assess and monitor the initiatives undertaken by the Union and the Member States and the coherence of these initiatives with the global legislation and strategy defined at Union level.
As the rapporteurs have already said, although the 2000 report does record some progress, it reveals a Europe which is still a hostile environment for women and which is, in many respects, a long way from achieving the goal of equal opportunities: the female unemployment rate is higher than the male unemployment rate, the employment rate is still a long way off the goal set at Lisbon, the labour market is still segregated, women continue to be heavily under-represented in positions of responsibility and, above all, there is a pay gap which is frankly scandalous considering that this is Europe in the third millennium.
With the Community framework strategy on equal opportunities, the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and the Community equal opportunities policy as a whole, we are heading in the right direction.
In particular, I feel that the 2002 employment guidelines and the amending of the directive on access to employment and training, which were successfully completed in conciliation last week, the directive on gender equality based on Article 13, in the context of which I, like Mrs Fraisse, feel that we should call more strongly for the individualisation of rights - a directive which the Commission is to present shortly - and the programmes combating violence against women and trafficking are new, important elements which fill gaps in the overall strategy.
However, we need to do more.
With regard to the pay gap between men and women, the under-representation of women in positions of responsibility and the balanced participation of women and men in decision-making processes, we need to be more forceful in making everyone - the social partners, the political organisations, the institutions and the Member States - shoulder their responsibilities, and we should maybe introduce more effective instruments that provide better incentives than those used hitherto.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to use this speech to dwell on depictions of the disadvantages under which women labour in developing countries or elsewhere, which have often been described.
I believe we are familiar enough with the problem.
The Commission is pursuing the implementation of the principle of gender mainstreaming - and, indeed, so is Parliament, as the two rapporteurs have reiterated.
Looking, though, at the resources that are made available for this purpose, I ask myself how it is to be achieved.
Gender mainstreaming is a top-down process, one that presupposes that the necessary raising of awareness and opportunities for training take place or are present within the organisations or authorities in question - in this case, the Commission.
We are well aware, though, of the substantial personnel shortage that exists in this field of work.
Unless there has been significant change in the meantime, we only have one national expert from Sweden who is at all involved in the area of women and development cooperation.
This is a lamentable state of affairs, one that we have been complaining of for years, and we have, unfortunately, seen no changes in it to date.
We do not weary of emphasising that the key to development is in the hands of women, but we have not the remotest possibility of being able even to start to put that into practice.
Commissioner Schreyer, please take note of how those very people who are responsible here for development cooperation are profoundly disappointed that what we have described in many papers - and on which there is, as is well known, a programme - stands not the remotest chance of being implemented in a truly satisfactory way.
There really have to be some changes here.
It is also, let it be added, in Europe's interest, for if we support the empowerment of women in the developing countries, that forms part of the emancipation of the European area and will also in part alleviate the problems we still have to deal with today.
If women are not empowered, if they are not given the tools for development, then development simply will not happen!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Diamantopoulou is on her way to the G8 Summit, so I am standing in for her in today's discussions.
That I do very gladly, as a policy on gender equality is indeed one of the pillars of European politics.
I would like to start by referring to Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea's report.
The annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the EU has, ever since it first appeared in 1996, been to some extent our flagship publication in the area of gender equality.
The report informs the public about progress made in the field of equal opportunities, and is of course at the same time a means of monitoring the Commission's strategy of involving gender issues in all the EU's policies and in all its programmes.
I am glad to be able to note that the present resolution by Parliament sees our report this year as marking qualitative progress and confirms it as a systematic and critical evaluation of the initiatives at Community and national level.
Parliament's resolution contains, in addition, new and highly constructive commentaries and proposals, which will prove very useful in the drafting of future equal opportunities reports.
I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, most warmly for her report.
The Commission gives a ready reception to her call for improved and more up-to-date statistics on equal opportunities, including the development of an index on equal opportunities for both genders.
I am able to inform you today that the 2001 annual report will incorporate a statistical annex on this subject.
Equal opportunities experts are already working on developing an equal opportunities index, which then, I hope, can find its way into the next annual report.
Another topic of core significance is the balanced representation of men and women in decision-making processes.
We need no further confirmation of the fact that women continue to be under-represented in essential fora.
Looking at the Convention, we again cannot but note that adequate representation can still not be taken for granted.
I would like, though, to point out that the Commission took the step of setting up its Equal Opportunities Group in order to make equal opportunities a primary issue in our institution as well.
The Commission agrees that equal opportunities for both genders is a prerequisite for a functioning democracy.
Three further issues arose from Parliament's resolution: equal opportunities policy in the Structural Funds, the position in the candidate countries and all the forms taken by violence against women. Let me take the first point.
The Commission intends this year to adopt a communication on gender mainstreaming in the Structural Funds, which will incorporate the contributions to and conclusions from the third conference on gender mainstreaming in the context of the Structural Funds.
The conference, which is to be held in Spain on 14 and 15 June this year, is being organised by the Spanish Presidency in close cooperation with the Commission and with financial support from it.
Let me turn to the second point. Over the past year, positive developments in the area of equal opportunities have been noted in the candidate countries, although not all the necessary conditions have as yet been met.
Transposition of this integral part of the acquis communautaire will not only continue to be closely observed by the Commission, but we have also made it abundantly clear that transitional periods in respect of equal opportunities and rights or for the relevant directives and legal framework cannot be permitted and there will therefore not be any.
The President of the Commission and my fellow-Commissioner Verheugen have made this clear on their respective travels in the candidate countries, in discussions with which this point is one that I always raise myself.
Finally, I turn to the third topic, the extremely difficult one of violence against women, which includes domestic violence and the problem of the trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Here, even more than in other areas, the issue has to do with raising public awareness and exchanging information on innovative measures.
The annual report may well also contribute towards this, and the programme of action also makes available resources for measures to raise awareness.
Gender mainstreaming is not just of the greatest topical interest for the Community's internal policies, but also of course for development cooperation - something which your contributions have highlighted.
The programme of action presented by the Commission for the mainstreaming of gender equal opportunities in the Community's development cooperation work is intended to promote the putting into practice of this approach to politics.
Mrs Martens' report is helping Parliament to adopt today a position on this communication, and I would like first to congratulate her and also the draftsman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation's opinion on this thoroughly constructive and trenchant report.
Here in this House, you are calling on the Commission to give the plan of action more tangible form and to submit a formal proposal with a detailed work programme, containing qualitative and quantitative indicators.
I am able to assure you that we will use the resources available to us to work purposefully on incorporating this ambitious agenda in our programme of action.
We will be giving appropriate training to our staff and to those with whom we deal in our chosen partner countries, and will be clarifying roles and competences within the Commission.
We will be improving the analyses within the frameworks of the programming cycles of the various programmes, revising the sectoral and political guidelines and devising indicators.
We have agreed to produce reports on the progress made and submit mid-term and final evaluations of the Community measures in the area of gender equal opportunities for the 1995 - 2001 period, the results of which will be available at the end of this year, and on which basis the proposal for a new Regulation will be worked out.
It will enter into force when the current Regulation expires.
Gender equal opportunities, being a mainstream issue in our action programme, covers all six priority fields of development cooperation by the European Community.
This means that every development cooperation agency has to take the issue of equal opportunities into account in its day to day work.
The nine months since the Commission's adoption of the action programme have seen the introduction of various measures for the programme's effective implementation, most of which deal with points addressed in your report.
For example, you have proposed that part of the administrative budget should be earmarked for compulsory staff training on equal opportunities issues.
I am able to inform you that these training schemes are already up and running in, among others, the Directorates-General for development and employment and also in the Meda teams in the field of external affairs policy.
In item 13, you call for gender analysis of the country strategy papers and of future poverty reduction strategies.
I am able to inform you that a large number of country strategy papers have already been examined from this angle, and that the results of this will find their way into the programming cycle and into improved manuals and training documents for staff.
In item 16, you call for gender auditing of the Budget, that is, the assessment of public budgets in terms of their effects and influences on one or other gender.
This is an important point for me personally, among other considerations.
Let me point out that various measures have been set in motion in this area as well.
I hope to be able to give you further information and reports on the International Women's Day next year.
Turning to your item 8, I am glad to be able to inform you that, in March, the Commission adopted a communication on the fight against disease and poverty in developing countries, one of the core points of which is improved access by women to basic health care, which also includes improved provision in the area of reproductive health.
Indeed, the Commission is making a great contribution to the Global Health Fund, and that is something else that I would like to mention in this connection.
There is no doubt that gender equality, the realisation of equal opportunities for women and men, will still be one of the great challenges at the various political levels over the coming years.
It is, though, particularly important, and should be seen in a very positive light, that Parliament, the Member States and the Commission are pulling together on this and, let me add, being supported by many organisations in civil society.
I would like at this point also to put on record my gratitude for the contribution the women's movement has made towards the idea of equal opportunity being firmly established in our societies.
I have exceeded my speaking time somewhat, but I believe that this issue, even when it is discussed so late in the evening, does in fact demand much attention, time and energy if we are to make progress in this area.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0111/2002) by Mrs Jensen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment (PE-CONS 3609/2002 - C5-0097/2002 - 2000/0195(COD))
Commissioner, I know you to be a clever and hard-working budget Commissioner.
Today, we must talk about something else, namely employment policy.
As late as yesterday, I received an enquiry from a Danish municipality that included a message: 'Can you not work for a situation in which the Member States learn from the EU?
Can you not work for a situation in which they learn to realise that it is through local efforts in partnership with public authorities and private enterprises that unemployment is best combated, especially in its least tractable form - as experienced by the vulnerable and those who are out of work long-term?'.
When I received that appeal, I in fact felt genuinely happy.
I was happy that we in Parliament have done some good work on this directive on the EU's employment policy.
We have done the right thing.
We wanted greater transparency surrounding employment policy and the more active involvement of local authorities and both sides of industry.
We wanted better opportunities for the individual citizen to become familiar with and to understand this policy, for it is of course at the end of the day the citizens, or electorate, who have to assess whether their national governments are up to scratch on employment policy.
We wanted to promote employment policy at local and regional levels through more information about local employment plans, through exchanges of experience concerning good practice and through demands that, in their national action plans, countries report on how local authorities can be involved in employment policy.
Moreover, a conciliation has now successfully been brought about which fulfils Parliament's demands on these important points.
In that connection, I would thank my fellow MEPs here in Parliament for the unity and perseverance we demonstrated during that procedure.
For example, we submitted proposals tabled by Parliament in another context, so there was good preparatory work.
I would also thank the Council and the Commission for their efforts and helpfulness, which have now ensured that we have ended up with a good result.
We in Parliament have attached a lot of importance to there being a link between employment policy and the EU's efforts via the social fund programmes.
We are therefore also very satisfied with the declaration attached by the Commission to the agreement on incentive measures.
In the declaration, the Commission promises to secure this link and fully to inform Parliament and the Council both of the priorities chosen within the framework of Article 6 under the European Social Fund and, especially, of the local activities to which quite large amounts will be allocated over the next couple of years.
We shall remember that pledge.
I also want briefly to say something about the budget for employment policy.
Parliament had proposed a higher amount than the Commission's proposal of EUR 55 million, and we of course wanted the Commission to make an additional contribution, so it was natural to ask for more money.
However, we have now received assurances from the Commission that the additional input of information can be achieved within the EUR 55 million, and that is therefore something we are relying on.
Nor has the budget framework been fully utilised so far, so it appears realistic.
A portion of the budget is to be used for assessing European employment policy.
We also wanted this assessment to extend to include the methodology used.
The 'open' coordination method has triumphed in many areas in recent years, and it would be odd if there were not both good and bad experiences arising from employment policy which can provide inspiration in the work using 'open' coordination in other areas.
Employment policy has now been up and running for approximately five years and, in that period, a great deal of experience has been accumulated.
All in all, I think it is a good result we have ended up with, and it is therefore up to the Commission and the Member States to fill out the new framework. What, however, is no doubt most important is that citizens, the two sides of industry and the local and regional authorities have, by means of this legislation, obtained a tool for developing mutual inspiration and engaging in the race to secure many more footholds in the labour market.
They have obtained a tool for participating in the work on the other important objectives of EU employment policy: reducing exclusion from the labour market, ensuring that we are flexible and competitive and ensuring that it becomes possible better to combine working life and family life.
I wish and hope that this challenge will be taken up seriously by all the parties.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, for her good work and for the efforts she has made so that we may be in this position today.
In the Minutes of the Turin European Council we notice that, if Europe were to advance only in the economic and monetary fields, its success would not be guaranteed - I am quoting from memory here - because we would be forgetting the most important thing Europe has: its citizens.
To involve European citizens in the process of European integration, the European Union has to take a greater interest in their concerns.
An example of this appears in the introduction to Title VIII of the Treaty, with regard to employment, following Amsterdam, with an important reference made in Luxembourg, as well as the 2000 Lisbon European Council, where the conversion to a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society that can grow in an economically-sustainable fashion with more and better jobs and better social cohesion was set as a new strategic objective for the European Union, and therefore to achieve the conditions for full employment.
This objective was highlighted once again at the Barcelona Summit.
For these reasons, I believe that this Parliament and Council decision on Community measures to stimulate employment seeks to noticeably improve cooperation with Member States in analysis and research in the field of employment and the implementation of these results in the labour market.
It also seeks to coordinate employment policies within the general Lisbon and Barcelona objectives and to apply an information and transparency policy as a response to the aspirations of European citizens to be well informed on European employment strategy, in which they place great hopes.
It also intends to support the Member States' efforts to evaluate their action plans, exchange experiences and good practices, carry out a follow-up to the employment strategy, particularly through the European employment survey, involving the various players to a greater extent, from the authorities to those seeking work, and to rationalise and guarantee coherence in order to avoid duplicating actions and of course expenditure.
I think therefore that we are dealing with an important decision full of good content and good intentions which hopes to rationalise and optimise European employment strategy and which will constitute a step forward in the process of European integration for all European citizens.
Mr President, may I thank the rapporteur very much for a really good piece of work.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to say that we are very satisfied with the conciliation achieved.
Cooperation with a view to increasing employment in Europe is a matter to which both our group and Parliament as a whole attach crucial importance.
Unemployment is unfortunately too high in Europe, but we do in fact have documentary evidence that a coordinated employment policy produces far more jobs than is the case when an individual country pursues its own policy without taking account of what is happening in neighbouring countries.
The incentive measures on which conciliation has now been achieved are specifically designed to support and strengthen cooperation on employment in the EU.
This is to take place through, for example, analyses, statistics, reports, information activities and evaluations. I think that the outcome of the conciliation is commendable in many ways.
It is important that employment policy not only be something that is conducted in offices and in more or less secret meetings of the Council of Ministers.
People must know which method we are using, even when its designation is something as difficult as the 'open coordination method'. Moreover, information must be provided about what is happening in terms of employment policy.
What is still more important is that local authorities, which must play a part in getting things moving, should also be involved.
That is why it is also so incredibly encouraging that the local dimension of employment policy has successfully been given a still more prominent place.
I am delighted that the Commission and the Council have come to the conclusion that it is precisely local and regional authorities that are important in efforts to promote employment.
The same is true of the two sides of industry and of voluntary organisations.
Partnerships are the way forward in this area.
The practical work involved in getting people into jobs is done locally, and that is why local players must be involved in employment policy.
It requires targeted support for local efforts.
One of the routes to a more effective employment policy involves disseminating good experiences of employment policy to everyone who does practical work on getting people into jobs.
There must therefore be adequate means of being able to learn effectively from each other's methods and experiences, and that is also of course something to which we must make a positive contribution.
It is also important, therefore, that we should obtain thorough evaluations of the results and methods of employment policy.
Only by having access to such evaluations can we become still more effective, and I am therefore very satisfied that agreement has been achieved on increasing the budget - by a modest amount, admittedly, but nonetheless to EUR 55 million in place of the original amount of EUR 50 million.
That is something encouraging, I think, precisely because we have reached a phase in which we are to point out and demonstrate to people that employment policy does in fact work and that the open coordination method has something specific to offer.
I should like to conclude by thanking all the rapporteurs, especially for their fruitful cooperation, and wishing the Commission luck on getting these measures put into effect.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Jensen and Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for their work on the reports.
Where Mrs Thorning-Schmidt's report was concerned, there was a hard fight at the conciliation stage.
On one point, our political group is not satisfied with the outcome, and that is when it comes to the limit value for whole-body vibrations, which we believe was set too high.
It is even higher than the international industry standard and significantly higher than the level set by the Commission from the beginning.
I know that Mrs Thorning-Schmidt shares my group's view on this point.
With regard to Mrs Jensen's report, I want to point out that it is incredibly important that the Commission and the European Employment Strategy should now begin to pay attention to the local levels.
The employment strategy we have had so far has often got no further than government offices and not been channelled into working life in the Member States.
Now, there is greater interest in such a strategy's being applied, and it is incredibly valuable for money to be earmarked for information activities at local level.
I have followed Mrs Jensen's work and seen how hard she has fought along the same lines as myself.
Later in the year, I shall return with a report that will take the work further in the same direction.
It is particularly important to set aside money for the provision of information because local information activities are unheard of and there are no trends at all towards, or guarantees of, the central authorities' distributing information from Brussels.
I should like to have seen still larger appropriations, but I hope to be able to return to this subject later.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome as positive the final agreement between Parliament and the Council on incentive measures in the field of employment, which we believe will be instrumental in achieving the development objectives set in Lisbon.
Today, it saddens us all to see how slowly we are moving in this direction.
Employment strategies in numerous countries are inefficient, resulting in long-term unemployment and the social problems that go with it.
It is vital, therefore, that we boost cooperation between national policies, coordinate our efforts, exchange best practices, carry out research and monitor and analyse the market and its needs.
The approved proposal provides an excellent framework for making use of efficient employment policies; all we need is good cooperation between the Member States, the European Commission, the social partners and all the social agencies involved.
We particularly welcome the fact that the approved proposal gives us an opportunity to inform public opinion and agencies at local and regional level.
This is particularly important, which is why the European Parliament insisted on it.
We need to make the most of the opportunity being given to local and regional agencies.
These agencies must play their part in designing and implementing these policies and disseminating their experience.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result achieved in conciliation and I would like to thank the Commission for its contribution to the achievement of this agreement and for its support.
The measures included in the decision we are discussing today are important funding instruments for achieving the strategic objective set at the Lisbon Summit, and the decision will, indeed, serve to increase cooperation between the Member States on labour market policies.
The gamble of implementing the European employment strategy through open coordination in recent years has started to pay off.
It is important to note, however - and we too see evidence of this every day - that there is a huge information gap between citizens regarding the existence of this strategy, its objectives and the procedures for implementing it.
That is why the European Parliament persisted in calling for all the information measures aimed at raising public awareness, particularly the awareness of those who can benefit from this strategy, to be implemented and therefore to be set forth in this decision.
A further point on which the European Parliament has insisted - and rightly so - is the involvement, association and participation of the local and regional levels in implementing the employment strategy.
We know how important the role of the local and regional authorities is in promoting employment and high-quality employment, particularly for those people for whom it is most difficult to penetrate or re-enter the world of work - women, young people, people with disabilities, older workers - for they can involve all the social operators present on the territory and create favourable conditions for employment.
To this end, I feel it is absolutely essential to introduce activities relating to awareness-building, best practice, cooperation and exchange of experiences.
The partnership, which has already been used to implement other initiatives and has proved to be an extraordinary, effective involvement tool, must become a traditional, standard method of working in the field of employment too.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the accord that has now been reached on this important resolution, and would like to thank both Parliament and the Council for their willingness to compromise.
The text adopted will lead to an action programme not only reflecting the aspirations of both co-legislators, but also putting on a firm foundation the measures that the Commission intends to implement in order to accompany the European Employment Strategy.
The Commission especially welcomes the agreement on a proactive and transparent information policy enabling Europe's citizens to be made more aware of the Employment Strategy's successes.
The Commission particularly welcomes the extension of the Employment Strategy's scope from national to local level.
The Commission wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, on her proposals, and thanks are also due to the Spanish Presidency of the Council for the openness with which it conducted the concluding negotiations.
Had all the parties involved not taken such a positive attitude, it is certain that no agreement could have been reached concerning this programme.
The Commission undertakes to implement this programme strictly as Parliament intended.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0110/2002) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (vibration) (16th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (PE-CONS 3616/2002 - C5-0137/2002 - 1992/0449(COD))
Mr President, this is a splendid evening.
I think that everyone who is concerned to secure a better working environment for European workers has reason to be satisfied.
The Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching agreement on a ground-breaking new directive.
As far as I know, this is the very first time that genuinely binding rules have been laid down governing the shocks or vibrations to which workers are exposed in the course of their employment.
That is why, of course, there have also been strong exchanges of opinion along the way.
We have had a lively discussion as to whether the scientific basis was in order.
We have heard from many, in fact a great many, lobbyists, and not all of them took a positive view of the preparation of these binding rules.
By means of this directive, we have, however, achieved recognition that vibrations - both hand and arm vibrations and whole body vibrations - constitute a health risk.
That is gratifying, for damage to health may be associated with exposure to such vibrations in the course of one's work.
It is also gratifying that everyone - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - have agreed upon a method of limiting vibrations and other physical agents.
The method involves introducing both action values and limit values that should never be exceeded.
In the light of the fact that we are concerned here with a completely new area within legislation governing the working environment, I believe that the conciliation achieved is really good, and I should like to say that directly to Mr Herman Schmid and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left because the conciliation strikes a reasonable balance between commercial considerations and worker protection.
It is a very big gain in itself that we are now in actual fact acquiring a directive.
It is not something we knew all along that we would obtain, but all European countries are now obliged to take the problem of shocks and vibrations completely seriously.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have therefore accepted that the limit value for whole-body vibrations should be set at that level proposed by the Council in the common position.
When the directive has been in force for a certain amount of time, we must see whether, on the occasion of a future revision, we can reduce the limit value further.
There has been a lot of focus upon whole-body vibrations, but I should like to emphasise that Parliament has in actual fact reduced the action value from 0.6 m/sec2 to 0.5 m/sec2.
That, I think, is a very important victory, since the action value is a very crucial figure.
Why is that the case?
Well, it is because it in actual fact entails a duty on the part of employers to take the problem of vibrations seriously and to actively prevent workers from being exposed to powerful vibrations.
When the action values are exceeded, employers must come up with practical action - that is why they are called action values - by, for example, changing the way in which the work is organised or investing in better equipment.
It is precisely this method which, on the one hand, provides flexibility and, on the other hand, attaches a very great deal of importance to prevention in preference to actual orders and bans.
It is this preventive effort which, in my view, is the most important thing for employers now to begin to engage in.
I also think that the conciliation creates a good framework for a sensible implementation of the provisions of the directive.
The reports, which are to be implemented at the same time as the directive is implemented, must also contain examples of good practice.
In that way, good experiences in one Member State can contribute to other countries' learning something from these.
It is the same principle which we have just been talking about with regard to employment policy and which can perhaps also be used within the working environment.
Transition periods will of course be required to ensure that industry is given time to adjust to these new provisions, but the Council's common position contained a number of transition periods which were a little too long, and this matter too has also been successfully straightened out.
In the cases of agriculture and forestry, to which special conditions apply, there is still, however, a transition period of as long as twelve years.
That is a long time, but it means that we shall be quite certain that these businesses too are able to adjust to the new provisions.
I must also put forward a couple of critical observations.
It is difficult for ordinary people who are not involved with the EU on a daily basis to understand that it takes such a long time to prepare a directive.
When people hear that the first proposal concerning physical agents goes right back to 1992, the reactions are very critical.
Can it be right that it should take us more than ten years to complete the negotiations for putting a directive in place?
It does not increase people's faith in the decision-making process.
I would therefore once again urge the Commission to table proposals for directives on the two physical agents for which there are still no directives, namely electromagnetic fields and optical radiation.
Turning now to something more positive, I would thank the Council and the Commission for their really fruitful cooperation, on a completely informal level too, and I would also thank the rapporteurs from the other political groups.
The cooperation has been very constructive, and we have in actual fact ended up with a result that we can all be proud of.
Mr President, Commissioner, as well as thanking Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her work on this report, I would like to make one observation. When we see, for example, someone working with a pneumatic drill on the street, or a tractor driver sitting behind the steering wheel on a farm, these people - and I am not speaking as an expert in these matters - are probably not aware that they are facing a risk that could have serious consequences to their health.
For this reason I believe that today is a day to celebrate because, despite the fact that nine years have passed - as Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said - this first directive of the four planned in the proposal presented by the Commission in 1992 has come to fruition.
From this day forth, therefore, we shall be able to count on a series of protective measures to try to prevent these risks I was referring to from turning into a disaster.
Throughout this time, the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has maintained an attitude that has, more than anything, sought to encourage constructive work and a spirit of dialogue with all of the interested parties, with the aim of achieving better applicability of the provisions of the directive and, as a consequence of this, increased effectiveness of workers' protection methods.
For this reason we are particularly delighted that the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 8 April has taken into account the difficulties in applying this directive encountered by a large number of, mainly small, companies, and also by many economic sectors in the search for a compromise on limit values and on the implementation deadline for the requirements imposed by the new directive on companies.
Technically, the great reduction in the limit value for daily exposure to vibrations, as well as the setting of the daily exposure values, has allowed us to reach this agreement.
I feel we have to welcome the fact that the Member States can have a longer period of time, until 2010, to apply the precautionary measures, as well as special consideration for the agricultural and forestry sectors, which in many Member States include a collection of small and very small companies, which have longer still to implement the measures, until 2014.
To sum up, I think that the desire to make improvements, an observation of reality and common sense are good examples and good formulae to work on in the hope that these new directives on the aforementioned risks and others that are still being studied can soon be approved.
I would like to finish, therefore, by congratulating the rapporteur, the Commission, Parliament, the Council, and above all, all the workers affected, because from today they will have an instrument in defence of their health.
Mr President, I would prefer that we would have had no directive whatsoever on whole-body vibration, because even the ISO Standard report says there is no quantitative link between whole-body vibration and lower back pain.
However, having said that, I am very pleased that we have reached an agreement.
It is not ideal, but it is better than it might have been.
I would have liked it if we had kept the derogation for agriculture and forestry.
That was extremely important, but I am pleased, however, that we have agreed that agricultural machinery will not have to be changed until 2014, that is, if the machinery has already been bought by 2007.
I am also pleased that we have moved back to the common position limit value of 1.15 m/s2.
It is far better than what the PSE Group rapporteur suggested in the first place, which was 0.7 m/s2.
The PPE-DE Group suggested 0.8 m/s2.
We have moved back to something that is reasonably sensible.
If we had not, tractor and dumper-truck drivers would have had to drive their tractor or their dumper-truck for between two to four hours.
There is still going to be a problem with harvest time, but most of industry can cope with this apart from the agriculture sector.
Those of us who insisted that the levels suggested in the first edition of the report were unworkable won the day.
I would like to congratulate everybody on the hard work they put in.
We have achieved a worthwhile compromise.
It is not ideal, but I will reluctantly be asking my group, ELDR, to vote for the directive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is to the expertise of the delegations to the Conciliation Committee, and to their willingness to make progress on the issue of the protection of workers' health and safety that we owe the reaching of an agreement without the need for a formal conciliation procedure.
For this I would like especially to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, and the Spanish Presidency of the Council.
This instrument introducing measures to protect workers from risks in the workplace arising from vibration represents an important step in the improvement of workers' health and safety.
All workers in the Community are now ensured a minimum level of protection, which the individual Member States are able to go beyond.
As you know, it was decided in 1999 to divide the original Commission proposal, which had applied to all of the four areas of vibration, noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation, into four individual proposals.
The first step has now been taken and brought to its conclusion.
As the second reading in plenary at Parliament's March part-session showed, we can also point to good progress in the problem area of noise.
I am relying on Parliament and the Council to start work shortly on the regulations on the other two physical agents - optical and electromagnetic radiation - so that we can at length complete the legal framework for these important aspects of health and safety at work.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
Fishing fleets
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has again postponed the enactment of the proposals for the reform of the common fisheries policy, which was originally to take place last week.
That has, at least, the advantage that they have another few weeks, or maybe even longer, to incorporate into their proposals for reform the suggestions for future fleet management in my report, on which we are voting today.
Now, then, to my report, in which I have consciously limited myself to the Commission's report on the implementation of the multi-annual guidance programmes for reducing fleets.
As we are at the crucial stage of preparations for the reform of the common fisheries policy as a whole and thus also of the fleet policy in particular, I would like to express a view on the MAGPs in general, pointing out a number of problems to which consideration must be given at all costs when the reforms are set in train.
There are only two - identically-worded - amendments to be voted on today, and I, as rapporteur, can support them without further ado.
What this shows is that the Committee on Fisheries is as one in its assessment that the Commission's report for 2000, like its predecessors, had shown one thing above all, namely that the MAGPs have not achieved their objective of significantly reducing fleet capacity and thus the fishing effort.
We regret the fact that the majority of the Member States again failed to reach the target set by their MAGP.
We call on these to make substantial efforts to reduce their fleets, at the same time welcoming the way that the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings against several Member States which have repeatedly not kept to their MAGP objectives.
We also emphatically call on the Council and the Commission, both at the same time, to analyse the reasons why these targets were not met and develop more effective sanctions.
In addition, we call on the Commission, when formulating its proposals for a new fleet policy, to deal specifically with the need for a balance between the fishing capacities and/or fishing efforts of each Member State's fleet segment and the catch possibilities available to it.
Last week, Commissioner Fischler told the Committee on Fisheries that the European Union's fishing vessels are about 40% over capacity, a figure that is not only alarming but also underlines all the more the urgent need for something to be done about this.
The primary cause of this over-capacity is that the instrument used to make cuts in the fleet did not achieve its objective and that there has even been a measurable increase in fleet capacity in recent years.
There is therefore urgent need for this problem to be dealt with, but, in doing so, it is imperative that the Commission ensure that the fishing fleet is reduced in a socially acceptable manner, by setting up Community financial aid to cushion social hardship.
One effective means would be premiums appealing to the fishermen, which the European Union and the Member States together could use to buy up fishing tonnage and either destroy it, sell it, or use it for purposes other than fishing.
The payment of such premiums should be mandatory, and, moreover, the possibility of an increase in the Community's financial contribution should be examined.
The previous system led to the situation in which fishermen wanting to leave the business, or having already done so, sell their ship's tonnage on the market, so that even more of the fleet is bought up by efficient companies, yet this does not result in any reduction in capacity.
At the end of the day, efforts to reduce fleet capacity must not be to the detriment of on-board working conditions, the vessel's safety, or the quality of the catch.
Structural aid must therefore continue to be used to modernise the fleet, but means and ways have to be found to prevent the fishing effort being increased at the same time.
I am aware that the production of a balanced proposal is no easy task for the Commission, and we are already eagerly awaiting its proposals for reform.
I will conclude by thanking all my fellow MEPs who have helped with this difficult task, and, in particular, the Commission for its constructive cooperation.
Mr Kindermann, I admire our Commissioner Fischler, who, as an Austrian, has to get to grips with the subject of one of the really big fleets.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kindermann's report is a good one, and we are dealing with a complex and very important subject.
Furthermore it is a politically very timely report within the context of the reform of the common fisheries policy which is taking place and at a time when there seemed to be proposals which questioned or removed this aid for the renewal or modernisation of the fleet.
I would therefore like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, on this work and I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler, please, to take good note of what the European Parliament says today and I hope he will approve the Kindermann report.
Mr Fischler, it is wise to put things right.
Therefore, I ask you to take note of this, if Parliament takes this approach.
From Mr Kindermann's report, as approved in the Committee on Fisheries - improved, I believe, by the amendments we have presented - I would like to highlight the following: firstly, the fleet policy is crucial and has a great impact on fisheries, but also on the regions dependent on fishing and, ultimately, on the economic and social cohesion of Europe.
This is a very important aspect which is highlighted in the report.
Fleet policy is an important political instrument, but it is not the only one.
There are others to be considered, such as technical measures, the TACs, fishing bans, fishing days, etc. Increasing the capacity of the fleet does not mean fishing more, but fishing better, with more security, with greater habitability and with greater hygiene and health guarantees in terms of the treatment of fish on board.
We therefore still need the FIFG aid for the renewal and modernisation of our fleet, which is a crucial aspect if we are still to have fishermen and a competitive fleet.
We therefore ask the Commission to adopt measures to increase the capacity and tonnage of renewed vessels.
We therefore also ask, within the framework of the reform of the fisheries policy, for the introduction of uniform criteria and objectives to measure the capacity and the segmentation of the fleets of the Member States, as well as the creation of a system for the inclusion and exclusion of vessels in the registers in order to guarantee that capacity does not increase.
In summary, we are dealing with a clear and concise report which I hope will reflect the approach of the Committee on Fisheries and this Parliament as a whole to the reform of the common fisheries policy which is getting closer, by opting - in accordance with our wishes - for the maintenance of a renewed, and therefore competitive, fisheries sector and not, Mr Fischler, for its dismantling.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report which we should see it firstly in the overall context of rebuilding fish stocks.
The key points are firstly rebuilding fish stocks and secondly the need to devise ways of measuring fleets.
I welcome Mr Kindermann's work in this area.
He has given us some very good pointers such as reminding us that we are not dealing with one single Community fleet, but with fishing fleets of individual Member States and that each Member State has its own quota for individual fish stocks.
As for the data that the report is based on, we should remember that Member States have until the end of 2003 to report new figures and bear in mind that we still do not know how many ships are in the EU fleet.
This is worrying and must be rectified.
I welcome Mr Kindermann highlighting this.
My final point is that Member States should pass on information to the governments and parliaments in the Member States.
Fishing is one of the mainstays of rural life in Scotland.
I know that my constituents would want to ensure that the Scottish Parliament is kept fully and directly informed of developments at the European Union level.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Kindermann for a sober and thorough report.
The common guidance programmes for the fisheries fleet are the main problem in the common fisheries policy, since the European fleet is far too large.
Last week, Commissioner Fischler stated that the fleet was 40% too big.
This means that, at the moment, we are, with the one hand, providing money by way of decommissioning subsidies in an attempt to reduce the size of the fleet and, on the other hand, providing assistance for modernisation.
Aid of this kind, together with modernisation, have led in recent years to a situation in which the combined fleet and total fisheries capacity have actually increased.
It is a vicious circle which we need to break.
In connection with the reform, we should probably therefore consider inaugurating a period in which we do not provide aid for modernising the fleet.
I look forward to seeing the Commission's proposal on precisely this area, based on the principle that there are too few fish for too large a fleet.
All the Member States must now comply with the joint resolutions, and we should really also reward those countries which have to date complied with the joint resolutions in the multiannual guidance programmes.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his work in this area.
It is clear that the capacity of the EU fishing fleet is greater than available resources and that therefore firm action is needed to allow many fish stocks to recover to sustainable levels.
Reductions in the fleet are thus essential.
The overall fishing effort must be controlled as well as fleet size so as to correspond to the resources available.
The Commission should better assess the impact of so-called exploited capacity by certain Member States who, at least on paper, claim to have met their MEGP target.
The Commission should also ensure stricter enforcement of existing penalties on certain Member States so that the Member States themselves are penalised and not the fishermen.
I hope the House will support the amendment which was originally tabled in committee by my group colleague, Mr Nogueira because it is very important.
Fisheries in certain areas of the European Union, including Scotland, are a devolved responsibility and it is important that direct communication between ourselves and devolved parliaments should be standard practice.
Mr President, Commissioner, just imagine if the European Union, in addition to the milk quota, were to develop a multi-annual programme for milking machines. To ensure that farmers did not produce too much milk, the number of milking machines was curtailed.
One of the Member States appears to be duly adhering to its milk quota but still has too many milking machines after four years.
Rapporteur Kindermann then proposes to penalise this Member State and to reduce its milk quota.
Another Member State has the correct number of milking machines, but produces much more milk than its quota allows.
Mr Kindermann seems not to have any problems with that at all. After all, that country has complied with the multi-annual guidance programme.
I am using this example to demonstrate the absurdity of the situation.
The aim of the common fisheries policy is to maintain sustainable fish stocks.
For this purpose, total allowed catches and quotas are introduced.
The fleet structure is secondary to this.
It is a bonus if the capacity is in line with the catch potential, but the capacity is not a goal in itself.
In fact, the capacity is distorted by giving subsidies for modernisation and renovation. This smacks more of social policy than of economic policy.
A social policy is not something we should be ashamed of, but we should call a spade a spade.
If we do not, the wrong Member States will find themselves in the dock.
Which countries exceed their quotas?
Are these not by any chance the countries that receive the highest subsidies for their fleets and duly meet the MAGP objectives?
Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate rapporteur Kindermann on his report and also on the political courage he has displayed, particularly in paragraph 6, in which he clearly states that the MAGP should not be continued in their present form when the common fisheries policy is reviewed.
This is straightforward language, which indicates, in fact, the failure of this programme.
The multi-annual guidance programme for the fisheries sector was aimed at reducing and renewing the European fishing fleet but, at the same time, we have to note that the programme has not improved the fish stocks in any way.
After all, there is no link at all between the Member States' correct implementation of the programme and an improvement in the situation of the stocks which they fish.
I know countries, including the Netherlands, which have not fully met the MAGP objective, but whose fished stocks are nevertheless relatively healthy at the moment.
In other words, the reality is that, although we may be able to lay down policy in Brussels, each programme, in fact, fails to come up to the mark if the Member States do not adequately monitor the situation.
This is also confirmed in the Kindermann report.
I would also like to comment on the impending Green Paper and the preparations that are being made in this connection.
We had expected the Green Paper to have been presented last week or, at least, the Commission to have taken a decision this week.
Independently of the Brussels circuit, the BBC, however, announced last night that the presentation of the Commission proposals has been postponed through the intervention of the Spanish Presidency.
Politically speaking, it would be unacceptable if this communication by the BBC were true and if a presidency could block or delay the presentation of proposals by the Commission.
This is unacceptable.
I have a great deal of faith in this Commissioner, and I am also convinced that he will take the Kindermann report seriously, especially paragraph 6 which stipulates that the current MAGP no longer serves the existing fisheries policy in any way and should therefore be dropped from the new fisheries policy.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with heartfelt thanks to you, Mr Kindermann, for your excellent report.
Your analysis of both the strengths and weaknesses of our current fleet policy really is very much to the point, and I also share your opinion that the MAGPs have had their day.
This sort of fleet policy no longer enables us to achieve our common objectives for the future.
We need a more straightforward and more transparent fleet policy, and we also need it to work.
Before dealing with the amendments that are being discussed today, I would like to say two things about the current state of fisheries policy and about the preparations for the reform, all the more as these have been mentioned by several speakers today.
It goes without saying that we will, as far as possible, deal with the proposals in Mr Kindermann's report when we introduce our reforms, but there is one thing I wish to make clear.
That is that I want reform, and the reform proposals are not going to end up being watered down in some way.
What is going on at the moment is that additional information and analyses have been asked for from various parties - including within the Commission.
As, then, I seek not only proposals for reform, but reform itself in the sense of a resolution in favour of reform, I go along with our taking this extra time to obtain these supplementary items of information and put us in a position to defend our position against all comers.
I would like very briefly to address a second issue in view of the various reports that have appeared in the media here.
Yesterday, the Commission decided on a quite major rotation of Directors-General and their deputies.
One of those affected is the Director-General of the Fisheries Directorate-General, Mr Smidt, who, I would like to make abundantly clear, enjoys my complete confidence; he and I work well together.
He too, though, is affected by the rotation, as there are a series of different objectives that are to be translated into reality.
This is, by the way, not just about rotation, but also about other objectives.
It is in this context that this change should be seen.
Let us now turn, however, to the individual items in the report.
In your first and second points, you call on those Member States that have not reached their MAGP objectives to make greater efforts at reducing their fleets.
On this I am in complete agreement with you, and the Commission has already commenced infringement proceedings against a number of Member States in connection with this.
In your third point, you urge the Council and the Commission to impose more effective and deterrent sanctions.
I can assure you that we will take this up as part of the overall reform of the common fisheries policy, but I would like to add that, whilst sanctions are meant to have deterrent effect, we also must not lose sight of other principles, such as that of proportionality, according to which the extent of the offence has to be balanced by that of the sanction contemplated.
I agree with you on the fourth point as well.
The Member States must complete the re-measurement of their fleets as soon as possible.
The target date for this is the end of 2003.
Against this, I am unable to agree with your statement in item 5.
Even if the Member States had met all their targets, sustainable exploitation of the stocks would still not have been achieved.
The reason for this is that the Council was far from ambitious enough and set the objectives in its MAGP resolutions far too low.
You will be aware from our reports that fleet capacity is in reality showing an increase despite MAGP objectives - even when they are met - rather than falling.
I agree with your sixth and tenth points.
The MAGPs should not be continued in their present form when the common fisheries policy is revised.
There is a need for improvements to on-board safety.
To that I commit myself, but it must not lead to an increase in fishing effort.
Your seventh point contains a demand for new criteria for measuring fishing effort and fishing capacities, and this we will discuss during the reform process.
The number and size of the fishing gears could, for example, be included in measurements of capacity.
I accept your eighth point as well.
A 'new for old' arrangement for fishing vessels features in our considerations of the new fleet policy.
Your ninth point, too, we accept wholeheartedly.
Restrictions on the fishing effort will be a cornerstone of the reforms.
I can, finally, accept the demand you make in your eleventh point, namely, that it is necessary to create voluntary scrapping programmes with attractive premiums.
The amount of the Community's contribution is, however, bound by the rules of the Structural Funds.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Mr President, unfortunately I must begin the debate on my report with the sad news of the tragic deaths of eleven immigrants off the coasts of Lanzarote.
Too many words have been said, and they have not yet been able to stop this terrible tragedy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that only a miracle would allow my group and myself to vote in favour of the report with my name on it, since some of the amendments introduced in committee and others which are being presented again in this House make it very different from my initial ideas.
Unfortunately, I believe that neither the Socialist Group nor the Liberal Group, which I understand even less, are up to taking responsible, rigorous and serious positions in the face of the phenomenon of immigration and asylum.
It will therefore be very difficult for all of us to comply with the objective of implementing the mandate of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the communitarisation of the asylum procedure and, worse still, for Parliament's views in this area to be taken into account by the Council, since they reflect party interests which do nothing to help resolve the serious problems which economic immigration and asylum pose for European society at the moment.
Ladies and gentlemen, frivolity, demagoguery and a lack of realism have very negative effects in certain societies which, like France, may leave the path free to parties or persons which, through their radicalism, may lead to dangerous social confrontations.
Furthermore, it is the case that the current legislative process in relation to asylum is being carried out in an illogical and disordered fashion.
This leads to the incongruous situation of our examining proposed directives which, like this one, regulate minimum rules for conditions for accepting asylum seekers, when much of their content depends on others which are still being dealt with in the Council, as in the case of the directive on procedures or the status of refugees, which is beginning to be debated by means of the Lambert report.
To put it in a nutshell, we are beginning to build the house from the roof downwards.
We must, however, move forward in any event, and Parliament accepts this disorder and wishes to cooperate, despite external and internal difficulties, as demonstrated, for example, by the fact that all the groups in committee have agreed to remove all references in the proposed directive to subordinating conditions for acceptance or medical treatment at the different stages of the procedure.
Amongst the difficulties faced by my group in supporting this report is, firstly, the scope of the directive.
My group and I believe that the persons included in the scope must be, as proposed by the Commission in its original text, those refugees defined in Article 1 of the Geneva Convention, leaving to the Member States the possibility that they may, by extension, be given other forms of protection.
This makes sense, especially at a time when - and I will use the same words as Anna TerrÃ³n in committee - this Parliament is debating the Lambert report, which will give its opinion on the status of the refugee and subsidiary protection.
If the Socialist Group wants to be consistent, it should support the thesis of the rapporteur and not be led by the Liberal Group, which, together with the Greens, intends to impose the extension of the directive to other forms of protection.
With regard to schooling for minors, I believe that it should not go beyond what the Member States can guarantee for their own citizens.
Certain Liberal and Green amendments - such as Amendments Nos 47, 48 and 50 - propose going further by obliging Member States to provide schooling, to guarantee nurseries and reduce the time limits for access to education.
This is not realistic.
Furthermore, access to the labour market is a point of conflict which I cannot understand, particularly because the Socialist Group accepted in committee, in its own amendment, the period of six months as a time limit within which the Member States must provide access to the labour market.
To reduce it to four months, as the Liberal Group has proposed, and as approved in committee, is entirely inconsistent.
It is logical that the Member States should have the room for manoeuvre laid down in the original text, and that they should be allowed to assess the situation of the labour market.
With regard to the family members of asylum seekers, a compromise with Socialists and Liberals has lead to the agreement of a formula which is a departure from my group's traditional position, for the sake of global consensus.
What we will not accept under any circumstances is Amendment No 115, which the Group of the Greens is presenting once again, which goes much further than those commitments.
Despite all of this, I would like to end, Mr President, by expressing my satisfaction at the references that appear in my report, thanks also to the opinion issued by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that the terrorist activity of asylum seekers should be a cause for a restriction of their right to acceptance.
Mr President, I hope that later on in the vote, and as a result of the views expressed in this debate, the miracle I referred to at the beginning of my speech may take place.
Mr President, I agree with what the previous speaker has said regarding the inconsistency and poor organisation of the material, which needed much more thorough treatment.
I agree too with the first statement made this morning, when a Member mentioned the refugees who died off the coast of Spain.
I am sad to say that such incidents are very common off the coasts of Italy as well.
Approximately 150 million people live outside the country in which they were born and the application of human rights standards is inadequate in many situations.
The best is the enemy of the good: when we aim too high, we often achieve nothing in practice. Consider the 1990 Vienna human rights convention, which was signed by many countries but ratified by very few because the standards it lays down are too specific.
Then there are, especially nowadays, parties which have made the fight against immigrants a priority in their programme.
Moreover, immigrants are often used as a reserve source of temporary labour, their visas are often linked to a temporary work permit and their social security is reduced to a minimum.
I do not feel that any of this has been dealt with adequately in our document.
Immigration levels were higher in the past than they are now, but the issue was not then on the agenda, or not a priority.
Only now has it reached the top of the agenda, as the Commissioner responsible for immigration has stated that there will only be 100 000 refugees entering the Union each year in ten, fifteen years' time, which means that an average-sized industrialised country will only be receiving 5000 and industry, in particular, will be complaining of the lack of immigrants.
I do not feel that this fact has been taken into due consideration either.
In any case, my view is, if we are going to tackle this issue, we must do so more thoroughly and more competently.
Mr President, the rapporteur has been kind enough to speak positively of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, including in the report he has prepared.
In the Committee on Legal Affairs we have taken a generally very positive view of the Commission's proposal. I believe that the Commission is doing great work in updating and harmonising Community law in this area.
I also believe that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has done great work, led by its rapporteur, by integrating and trying to modernise the new law.
The report raises an important issue, which is the updating of the current asylum system and the whole immigration system.
From the point of view of international law, following the First World War a series of international conventions were adopted with a view to regulating this area, based on what we might call principles of the right to individual protection in the face of political persecution of a specifically European nature.
At the moment a radical transformation is taking place of the whole problem of international migration, in the sense that, as well as real political asylum, we are also seeing economic asylum.
This is leading to great movements of people for which we probably do not have appropriate legal instruments.
This morning, in the speech by Mr Nogueira and the last speech by Mr Volcic, reference has been made to the tragedy that took place yesterday on the island of Lanzarote, in which, once again, eleven immigrants drowned trying to reach our continent, the European Union.
It is clear that there is no easy solution to this within the traditional exercise of the right to asylum because, even if we had more liberal and comprehensive legislation in this area, we could not prevent these people from leaving their countries nor offer sufficient guarantees so that they could reach their destination without endangering their lives.
We are therefore facing a new phenomenon.
I will repeat that, from the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the proposal represents enormous progress, but the Commission and the other European institutions will probably have to find a way to regulate the whole problem of asylum given the new dimension created by the enormous economic phenomenon of international migration linked perhaps to the process of international globalisation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today we must determine why Member States are competing in an unfair and negative manner to win the prize for being the most off-putting State in terms of the way it welcomes nationals from other countries.
It is this competition which is creating the tragic situations that we are now seeing, on a daily basis, in the Sangatte refugee centre, at Tarifa, in Italy, and in many other parts of Europe.
These tragic situations are clearly calling into question the fundamental rights of individuals, the right to asylum and the international commitments to which we subscribed.
The proposal for harmonisation is, of course, heading in the right direction, since it is seeking to halt the downward spiral in the conditions in which asylum applicants are received in Europe.
It is heading in the right direction and will become fully credible within the framework of a common asylum and immigration policy with a European statute for refugees.
We therefore welcome this prospect and the initial work, which will effectively guarantee rights such as the right to work, to education, health, housing, schooling, vocational training and fundamental rights, all of which are inseparable.
The proposal aims to avoid a situation that we know all too well: asylum applicants trying to enter countries illegally, reception centres being inundated and, ultimately, the rights that we want to promote being violated.
I think that, in this area, we must make every possible effort.
We cannot give scope to those who want Europe to be based primarily on xenophobia, the rejection of all that is foreign and the fear of the unknown.
In this area, it is the European project itself that we must defend.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, Commissioner, esteemed ladies and gentlemen, the number of people per year applying for asylum in the European Union has already reached 500 000.
They want refugee status.
The individual Member States have the most diverse procedures, which, as a rule, take a very long time.
We are faced with multiple applications and the associated misuse of social security benefits as well.
At the end of the day, 90% of these applications are rejected, and only 10% of the applicants are actually recognised as refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention.
This means that we need European minimum standards for reception procedures, which need to be speedy and safe in order that the 10% recognised as refugees may exercise their rights and get the help they need.
We need measures to combat misuse.
What we do not want is for the right of asylum to be eroded, nor do we want covert immigration by way of asylum.
We therefore support proposals by the Commission and above all by our rapporteur, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, which take these objectives into consideration, but decisively reject all the unacceptable and bankrupt proposals by the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Greens.
We reject the idea of extending the grounds for recognition far beyond the scope of the Geneva Convention.
We reject the idea of immediate access to the labour market for applicants for asylum and all their accompanying family members, which goes hand in hand with total freedom of movement right across the European Union.
We reject the proposal for immediate access to vocational training, and, above all, we repudiate their desire to do away with sanctions when the Member States' security is threatened, when applicants for asylum 'go underground', claim social security benefits to which they are not entitled or indulge in violent behaviour.
With these demands of yours, ladies and gentlemen on the Left, you will not help refugees to exercise their rights and get help without delay, but rather, you will be inviting immigration without it being managed or controlled and by way of asylum, which is unacceptable.
In Europe, governments of that sort generally get voted out of office.
That would not be such a bad thing, but what is, is that very often populist extremists from the Right are then voted in.
That we do not want!
That is not the policy that we support.
We reject what your side is coming up with.
We do not want more Le Pens in Europe.
Mr President, as we all know, this Commission proposal concerning the asylum policy forms part of a whole package of proposals.
The approach which the Commission has adopted across the board is largely balanced and realistic.
My group therefore expresses the hope that the Council and Parliament will summon up the political courage to follow the tenor of this initiative.
We should not be thrown off balance by cheap gossip spread by demagogues who seek to make political capital out of the fear of foreigners.
A European fortress, a large fence around Europe and, in practice, preventing people from seeking asylum are not only undesirable but also unrealistic.
Human rights violations and other disasters, together with the unfair distribution of prosperity across the globe are the actual backdrops to the asylum and migration issues, and they are not eliminated by such measures.
A minimalist asylum policy is a form of social dumping.
Instead, we should translate the principles of solidarity, equal opportunities, naturalisation and integration into a practical policy.
This is why my group calls for particular attention to be paid to the following four points which would improve the substance of the proposal.
First of all, the provisions should not be confined to persons who apply for asylum on the basis of the Refugee Convention.
As has been mentioned here before, a proposal has been submitted in Parliament too concerning the recognition and status of refugees and of persons who require protection in other ways.
It would therefore make little sense, to say the least, if a restriction were imposed on this proposal.
Maybe we should revisit the underlying logic, but this is impossible, of course.
Social protection is therefore included.
My second point concerns education.
It is great for children who have been snatched from their familiar surroundings to find respite and a fixed daily routine quickly, and education can help in this.
At the same time, they also learn the language and settle in.
This is why the PSE wholeheartedly supports the amendments which provide for prompt access to schools and for the observance of the compulsory education requirement.
Thirdly, it is important for asylum seekers to be able to enter the labour market as quickly as possible.
This enhances their own sense of self-worth and independence and provides them with a useful way of spending their days.
It also helps them settle in quickly, and we therefore back the proposals as they are now before us.
Fourthly, I should like to draw attention to the anti-discrimination proposals, especially Article 29.
This is of major importance.
Day-to-day practice shows that a good relationship between the local communities and the reception centres is important for the purpose of eliminating racism and xenophobia.
Finally, I should like to point out that it is important for the Netherlands too that the reception facilities are not taken away from those who refer to Dublin, and I hope that this Council proposal will also convince the Dutch Government of this.
All that remains for me to do is to thank Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar for his commitment and willingness to enter into consultation, and I regret that we were unable to reach agreement.
We may get another chance.
Mr President, a shadow is passing over Europe, in whose darkness is hidden a mixture of stale chauvinism, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and classic European nationalism.
Europe has seen it before, but all too often reacted too late.
What has happened in quite a few of our Member States should give us established politicians pause for thought.
What responsibility do we bear for the fact that xenophobic parties are growing in strength in country after country?
This has a very great deal of bearing upon Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar's report.
The EU, which places a high value upon fundamental human rights, must also be able to conduct a refugee and asylum policy based on precisely the same principles.
Lanzarote is not the only example. There are many more.
The refugee policy conducted at present by the Member States is inhumane.
The latter are tightening up policy in a vain belief that this should ease the problems, make integration a smoother process and lead to fewer people reaching our borders.
I believe that the Commission's proposal on minimum standards for the reception of refugees is very significant.
I am also pleased that it was possible for the committee to accept a number of improvements from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, such as better access to education and work and a situation in which greater account is taken of the conditions under which children and families live.
Of particular importance is the committee's proposing that the scope of the directive be extended beyond the requirements of the Geneva Convention.
That does not, however, mean, as Mr Pirker maintains, that we are undermining the right of asylum.
Precisely the opposite is the case.
I wish to thank Mr HernÃ¡ndez for his constructive cooperation. I had hoped that he might have been able to support the report in its entirety today.
In conclusion, I want to emphasise that it is especially important for us to show today that we are not following the Member States' stricter line.
If we obtain broad agreement today, the message to Le Pen and his kind is clear: you will never be victorious.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, on issues related to asylum and immigration, the Union currently has two options.
The first is to lay down rules that are clear, fair and which protect those who are fighting for freedom and all those who are fleeing from dictatorships, persecution or poverty.
The second is to equate asylum applicants with illegal immigrants, thus turning these people into scapegoats.
It is very rare for a Member of Parliament to oppose a positive acquis communautaire, as it was affirmed at Tampere that there was a need for common rules in the area of asylum procedures.
I am also surprised that, despite the adoption, in 2001, of an initial resolution which aimed to provide asylum applicants with a decent standard of living and to enforce respect for human rights, our rapporteur has attempted to restrict these rights, which flies in the very face of fundamental rights which are also an acquis communautaire.
At the same time, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has condemned laws passed by the Danish and Italian Governments that call into question the right to live as a family by limiting family reunification, the right to love the person of one's choice by attacking mixed marriages and that even seek to limit the number of asylum applicants. Furthermore, France - my own country, as it happens - which has traditionally defended human rights, has just voted a Jean-Marie Le Pen through to the second round of the presidential elections, a politician who has used the subject of immigrants and asylum applicants for his own gains.
It is irresponsible to throw ourselves headlong into this matter and refuse to resolve the real problems by making third-country nationals carry the can.
No, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, Europe's problem is that of unemployment and exclusion, not that of third-country nationals and asylum applicants.
But I can in no way accuse you of xenophobia, as last year, we worked together in El Ejido on a fact-finding mission, precisely in order to protect those who have been victims of xenophobic aggression.
But how can you, at the same time, fail to mention to the House that those who exploit these victims are, in fact, those who make them work; those who exploit them are, in fact, the bosses who employ them to moonlight; those who exploit them are, in fact, the very landlords that provide their slum housing.
So, we must have the courage to lay the blame on those who exploit them and we must stop blaming the immigrants by turning them into scapegoats.
Today, we must make families more stable and help the men and women who are in dire need of reassurance and support, as their lives are often in danger, even when they live in exile.
We must have the courage, therefore, to blame the traffickers in human beings, those who exploit them, and not the immigrants themselves.
Lastly, we have a duty to create a genuine policy for cooperation and dialogue between the north and south, because as long as there is poverty and one-party rule in the south, it is to be expected that these people, as we ourselves have done in our history, will try to reach areas where they are better?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Denmark is not a party to the EU's regulatory framework on asylum because, in June 1992, we exercised the people's democratic right to reject a situation in which the EU would determine the Member States' asylum regulations.
It may perhaps serve to stimulate the debate if I state the three main lines of thought behind the Danish 'no'.
A few people here in this House, represented by Mr Camre of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, said 'no' out of a paranoid fear that EU regulations would mean our little country being swamped by asylum seekers.
Other MEPs, represented by Mrs Frahm from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left said 'no' for quite opposite reasons, specifically in order to secure the safety of asylum seekers in the best way possible.
What now takes the edge right off the Danish 'no' is the unfortunate fact that xenophobia has in the meantime become the policy of the Danish Government.
Fortunately, there is, however, a third and democratic 'no' which is not dependent on political trends.
Sustainable in the long term, this particular 'no' is based on the attitude that problems which deeply affect local conditions should be solved in close cooperation with the local communities concerned and not be forced upon us by EU institutions that think they know better.
The EU's coercive centralism and mania for making rules quite simply contributes to creating the poisoned breeding ground for demagogues such as Mr Le Pen, Mr Haider and Mr Camre.
Not that I fail to appreciate the social and economic conditions underlying this shift to the right and this xenophobia, but be in no doubt that the centralised imposition of rules - in which no account is taken of the attitude of the local community - is downright fatal and fosters right-wing extremism.
Mr President, the right to asylum is a sacrosanct principle of universal law which is acknowledged by all the civilised people in Europe and in the world, but it must be regulated thoroughly if it is not to lose its importance and meaning.
Those who wish to extend it - and I refer to those who voted through a large number of amendments to the text proposed by the Commission in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - are certainly not doing any kind of service to the principle of the right to asylum by extending it indiscriminately to people who, in actual fact, are not really entitled to it.
I refer, in particular, to Amendment No 14, which seeks to eliminate provision for specific penalties, namely the reducing or withdrawing of reception conditions in the event of an observed infringement of the reception system, and also to a set of amendments - Nos 19, 21, 22, 23 and 34 - seeking to extend the scope of the directives to people requesting protection for reasons other than those listed in the Geneva Convention.
Do we actually want to reintroduce asylum for economic and social refugees?
If we do that, we will be letting at least a billion people into Europe!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we find ourselves discussing proposals to establish a common European asylum system.
What we are also trying to do in this field is to pursue the objective of an area of freedom, security and justice which is open to people who, for various reasons, are legitimately seeking protection in the Community.
The Tampere conclusions stipulate that a European system of asylum must be established and must include, in the short term, minimum common standards for the reception for asylum applicants.
These conditions must provide a dignified standard of living and must respect the individual's fundamental rights.
The intention is to limit the secondary movements of asylum applicants that are prompted by the differences between the reception conditions provided by the various Member States, thereby ensuring that asylum applicants enjoy a comparable standard of living in all the Member States and that there is a fair spread of efforts between the Member States of the Union.
I acknowledge that integration into local communities is a complex and difficult matter but this is the approach we must pursue, with its consequences in terms of the right to health, education and employment.
With regard to the issue of access to the labour market, freedom of access must be allowed, although it is reasonable for this to be made conditional for a period of six months.
Our rapporteur, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar is right to suggest that we must address this issue seriously and without resorting to populist rhetoric.
An excessively charitable attitude in these matters only helps those who base their arguments on intolerance, racism and xenophobia.
This is why it is right, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to send a message to the benches on the left of Parliament: those who go too far in the field of asylum, as in other areas, become the greatest ally of the forms of extremism they claim to want to combat, for they ultimately stimulate it.
(Applause from the right and from the centre)
Madam President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for the way he has led this report.
The miracle he called for will probably not take place, but that will not be because he has not tried to reach an agreement; he also knows that on some issues I personally was prepared to do so.
Above all because, on these issues, nobody listens to this Parliament.
Madam President, take a look at the Council's benches: there is nobody there; take a look at the Commission's benches: I am delighted to share this sitting with Mr Fischler, but I believe that agriculture and fisheries are not exactly what we are talking about.
I think it is absolutely intolerable that we are debating a report whose departure point we know has been modified by the Council during a period when it is under consultation in this Parliament.
Madam President, I believe that this is sad and would like to ask you personally to express our concern at this situation.
The issue we are discussing is extremely serious.
I believe that the proposals move in the right direction and I also believe that, with regard to some of Parliament's proposals, the Group of the European Peoples' Party is not so far from everybody else, although we do have differences of emphasis, such as the absolute importance of correct access for refugees to our society.
My time is running out, but I would like to reply to Mr Pirker and Mr Coelho: I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the way to confront the extreme right is not for us to behave in the same way; that would ultimately mean victory for the extreme right and not failure.
Madam President, this debate is proving to be rather heated even in the discussions going on behind the scenes.
The rapporteur is right: this is no longer his report.
Proof of this is the fact that it was adopted in committee by 25 votes to 18, but above all the fact that a good 111 amendments were made to it.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted for the motion against its will, and it declared its opposition to all these amendments.
I therefore urge the rapporteur genuinely to pursue his original position and to treat the report as no longer his own, no longer the work of our group.
Moreover, just a few days ago, at Valencia, the Council addressed the issue of immigration, discussing matters belonging to the second pillar within the framework of the major field of action - the third pillar - of justice and home affairs.
It was pointed out that, after the Montpellier talks in May 2000, a programme should be launched - and the Commission has already put forward a proposal - financed by MEDA, a programme of practical actions in the field of immigration.
This means that the Council is still at the analysis and assessment stage.
Proof of this is the fact that, at the suggestion of Italy and Spain - the two countries which are certainly most affected by this issue - it was proposed to hold a ministerial conference on migration next year.
Well then, while the Council is continuing to pursue a careful and cautious approach, we now want to include measures in a European Parliament report which are so advanced that they consider extending healthcare to all asylum applicants and providing for access to the labour market within four months of lodging an application and admission to school for asylum applicants' children, under conditions, what is more - and the rapporteur also pointed this out - which are more favourable than those applying to the children of residents.
Well then, none of this is acceptable, especially not to the countries that are in the eye of the storm as regards asylum applications.
The constant attempts to overload a report with too many problems make it unacceptable when all is said and done.
I do not feel that this is the way to help those who are entitled to and need asylum.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, considerations of time have hitherto prevented me from congratulating the rapporteur, but today it is out of conviction that I refrain from doing so.
Let me say at the outset that I support Mr Pirker's viewpoint, to which I refer in order to avoid repetition.
The report raises a number of issues which, as I see it, have not been resolved.
How will an equal distribution of applicants for asylum in the EU be achieved if standards vary because Member States are obliged to retain higher standards?
How is unrestricted freedom of movement for third-country nationals while their application for asylum is in progress to be reconciled with the public's need for security and with concerns that the procedure should be speeded up?
How do we explain to our citizens a regulation that ensures applicants for asylum access to the labour market as soon as possible, whilst they themselves may be unemployed?
If the way the EU worked were as transparent as we would all like it to be, one would end up wondering how our citizens would vote in response to proposals of this sort.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar for his efforts towards reaching agreement on his report and the further amendments to the proposed directive that is under discussion today.
In Luxembourg today, the Council has been able to conclude an understanding by taking into account the amendments approved by Parliament.
The result in Council will, though, remain in some ways unsatisfactory from the Commission's point of view.
The text before the Council contains provisions that have watered down some areas of the regulation we were working towards.
I must say, despite this adverse comment, that we still see the adoption of this proposal as a milestone on the road that leads to a common European immigration policy.
The sole directive covering this area affords only temporary protection.
It is applicable only in exceptional cases involving a mass influx of expelled persons into the territory of the European Union.
The directive on the reception of applicants for asylum will be the first binding regulation governing the uniform handling of influxes of asylum-seekers in the EU.
I would now like to make some comments on the report and on the amendments to the proposed directive that are under discussion today.
The amendments may be divided up into three principal categories.
Firstly, there are technical amendments which improve the text and which the Commission can therefore accept as a matter of course.
There are, secondly, substantive amendments that make perfect sense and will form part of the final version of the directive that will be adopted.
These are amendments deleting every reference to asylum procedures, and also amendments aimed against reception conditions that differentiate in accordance with the asylum procedures applicable in each case.
Thirdly, there are substantive amendments that present the Commission with no difficulties but will not get past the Council because they go against the fundamental interests of one or more Member States.
Examples of these are amendments deleting every reference to the possibility of Member States making use of a system of vouchers, and, only partially in this category, amendments extending the scope of the directive to other forms of protection not founded on the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
The Commission has constantly advocated a solution such as that put forward in these amendments, at least as a target for the second stage of the common European asylum system, but, with reference to this proposal, it had expressed itself in favour of leaving it, at least for the present, to the Member States to decide on the extension of the directive's scope.
The Council still has an open mind on how to ensure that the relevant provisions of this directive are adapted following the enactment of the directives on subsidiary forms of protection and asylum procedures.
I said at the outset that the Commission regards the adoption of the proposal as a milestone on the road that leads to a common European asylum system.
Quite apart from that, though, it is of extreme importance that the other three cornerstones of the common asylum system be added without delay, these being the directive on the recognition of refugee status and on subsidiary forms of protection, the Regulation on the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application and the amended version of the directive on asylum procedures.
These three will shortly be resubmitted by the Commission and are intended - as the Tampere conclusions envisaged - to complete the first stage in the development of the common European asylum system.
In several Member States the prospect of immigrants and asylum-seekers flooding in is already giving rise to public expressions of fear.
Extremist political movements find a ready audience for their calls for these people to be turned away without further ado, and this makes it high time that we agree on a unitary European regulation to properly manage the flow of immigrants and asylum-seekers.
This is, in my opinion, the best way of overcoming these fears and at the same time fully discharging our international obligations in respect of human rights and doing justice to the humanitarian tradition of our Member States.
Let me, in conclusion, also express on behalf of the Commission, our great sadness at the accident that was reported earlier.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ will now take the floor to move a point of order.
Madam President, in view of the information the Commissioner has been kind enough to give us - in which he confirms that the Council is actually today, even before the vote on our report, discussing and probably adopting a different version from the one it communicated to us for consultation - I would like to ask him to deal with this situation.
This is not an isolated case: in relation to all the issues we are discussing, which are fundamental and very sensitive, relating to justice and internal affairs, in accordance with the procedures adopted in Amsterdam - in other words, we are still within the five-year-period during which Parliament only plays a consultative role - in addition to having little capacity for intervention, the little power we do have is constantly being undermined by attitudes of dubious interinstitutional loyalty on the part of the Council.
I would request, Madam President, that the Presidency of this House deal with this situation before the Council and inform it of our displeasure.
Thank you, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­.
We shall do as you have asked.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Commission statement on the international conference on financing for development in Monterrey;
the report (A5-0075/2002) by Mr Mantovani, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission Communication concerning the proposal for a Council decision on the adoption of the position of the Community within the ACP-EC Council of Ministers regarding the settlement of all ACP HIPC LDCs' special loans remaining after full application of HIPC debt alleviation mechanisms [COM(2001) 210 - C5-0394/2001 - 2001/2158(COS)].
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the final results of the Monterrey Conference are encouraging and give cause for renewed optimism about September's world summit in Johannesburg on sustainable development.
Monterrey's success is founded, among other things, on the innovative form that the conference took, which enabled the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organisation to take an active part as partners on an equal footing.
It was the first time the European Community had been accorded the status of a full participant at a UN conference.
What had originally been meant to be a conventional United Nations event became a meeting on a significantly broader scale, and one that, it is to be hoped, will promote future coordination of its principal participants and cooperation between them.
The conference was also innovative in form in the sense that the Final Document - known as the Monterrey Consensus - had already been agreed on in New York in January.
And, as no negotiations as such took place, the participants in the conference concentrated on round table discussions alongside the events and also at bilateral meetings, rather than only on sessions spent discussing wording and drafting the Final Document.
This made it possible to focus debate on potential concrete commitments, bilateral initiatives and tangible contributions.
In addition, the conference built upon the so far unique global consensus achieved at the Millennium Summit on objectives, policy and indicators in the development field.
The essential challenge for the Conference on Financing for Development was to mobilise the financial resources required in order for the Millennium Summit's development policy objectives to be achieved. This meant that the conference could pursue a clearer and better-defined objective.
The events of 11 September had a far-reaching influence on the way the international community saw and understood this conference, bringing as they did in a tragic way the extent to which we depend on each other to the attention of a vast public quite apart from those who concern themselves with issues of development policy.
It is against this backdrop that what is no doubt the conference's most important and most visible outcome should be seen - the simultaneous commitments by the European Union and the USA to increase their public-sector development aid by a further USD 20 billion and USD 10 billion respectively.
President Bush's announcement of the allocation of USD 5 billion, a sum then further increased in the course of the week in order to catch the EU up, is also evidence of a change in thinking by the USA on its development policy, the estimates for which have been subject to continuous cutbacks over the past 20 years.
It is no presumption to say that we, the European Union, are in a leadership role, in which we can also, accordingly, present ourselves to the world.
These commitments were widely welcomed and were the inevitable response to the declared willingness of most of the developing countries to mobilise their own resources and accept the imposition of good domestic governance.
They can thus be seen as a partial implementation of the statements contained in the Monterrey Consensus, and accord with the European Union's concept of development policy as a global agreement also including Dohar, Monterrey and Johannesburg.
A few aspects of Monterrey did not meet expectations, and I will list three of them: Problems inherent in systems, innovative sources of finance for development, and global public goods.
As regards problems inherent in systems, the Monterrey Consensus limits itself to underlining the importance of paying greater attention, in the international financial architecture, to the voice of the developing countries. There are, though, no concrete proposals on this.
The document contains nothing more on innovative sources of finance for development than a general statement of the need to examine these questions more thoroughly.
Global public goods are not mentioned at all, so the Johannesburg Conference offers a second opportunity to address these aspects, one that, I believe, we must make use of.

Let me conclude by referring to the role played in this process by the Commission, which had, even before the Council met in Laeken, put the case in the political arena for the Member States to substantially build up their ODAs.
The Development Council of 8 November last year took an initial step in that direction by entrusting the Commission with the task of examining these issues more closely.
This process then led to the Barcelona European Council resolution in which the Member States agreed for the first time to consult with each other on their development budgets and above all to give the Commission a coordinating role.
It is my belief that these results speak for themselves.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Members for their valuable contribution to the development of this report, and I would also like to thank Commissioner Nielson for the opportunity to work on the issue; although he is not in the Chamber today, he was very hospitable towards Mr Tajani and myself precisely with a view to discussing this problem which is holding many countries of our world in a vice.
In order to give fresh impetus to the international consensus regarding debt reduction and to respond to the international community's growing concerns regarding the increasing marginalisation of the least-developed countries within the world economy, the Commission is now, with this communication, proposing full cancellation of the debts linked to any of the special loans granted to the least-developed ACP countries under the first three LomÃ© Conventions which are still outstanding following the introduction of debt-relief measures under the HIPC initiative launched in 1996.
This is a brief overview of the situation.
The problem of external debt and the ability to service the interest payable on that debt continues to be one of the basic constraints on economic development in the poor countries.
These countries - most of which are located in Africa - allocate on average 40% of their annual budgets to debt servicing, which reduces their investment capacity and therefore their ability to offer their people basic social services such as healthcare and education.
Paradoxically, the development aid provided by the EU and its Member States to the world's poorest countries is sometimes not even sufficient to cover the cost of servicing their external debt.
In addition, the global economic slowdown is deepening as a result of the events of September 11 2001, exacerbating the already severe problems of these communities.
Here are some figures: the debt of the HIPCs increased from USD 147 billion in 1989 to USD 214 billion in 2001; at present, 41 of the world's poorest countries are in a situation of bankruptcy and 300 out of every 600 HIPC citizens survive on less than a dollar per day.
I will spare you the details of the lives of these people, suffering from illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, of which, moreover, there is currently an upsurge, or of the situation, in particular, of children, people with disabilities or sick people, seeing as there are no elderly people to speak of in these countries.
Twenty-six countries have become eligible for debt relief now, having reached what is known as the decision point, and can now benefit directly from the cut in debt servicing, but to officially exploit this relief, reaching the completion point - which has currently only been reached by four countries, moreover - they must implement a pre-established package of social and structural reforms and maintain sound macroeconomic performance.
It is strange, however, that no deadline has been set for them to reach this completion point, although the average time frame should be at least 15 months in practice.
Moreover, such a short time period gives the highly indebted countries little time to develop multisectoral strategies for combating poverty and forces local governments to spend money and funds on reaching the completion point rather than on implementing a sustainable programme and a credible plan for combating poverty.
In general, however, we can say that the enhanced HIPC initiative is still, on its own, wholly inadequate to resolve the issue in the current context of economic globalisation, even though it acknowledges the failure of earlier programmes and initiatives based on macroeconomic strategies, for it does not, in actual fact, decrease the nominal debt of the HIPCs.
If the size of the debt is not radically reduced, these countries will be condemned to repaying it forever and ever.
Now, the European Parliament and the Commission, in particular, have firmly upheld the need to cancel this debt, not least in the wake of the Jubilee 2000 campaign in which a range of different political, civil and religious organisations and movements - led by the Holy See - vehemently demanded the complete cancellation of the debt.
In particular, I feel that it is important to emphasise the involvement of the Holy Father, who, during the Jubilee year, which was a year of charity, called for greater, more effective focus on the problems of poverty which are still afflicting the world.
As regards Monterrey, although it was criticised as the umpteenth display of mere grand declarations on the part of the wealthy countries, I feel that it should still be seen as a positive development for it led to an increase in practical goals.
Evidence of this is, in fact, the Union's commitment to providing a further USD 20 billion dollars of aid by 2006 and USD 7 billion dollars after 2006.
To sum up, Madam President, I feel that there are a number of initiatives that can help these countries, not least the use of new technologies, as discussed at Palermo just a few weeks ago on the initiative of the Italian Government, the World Bank and the UN: applying new technologies to debt management systems, including national debt management systems, and budget monitoring, which would certainly help public administrations to give us clear, practical indications of the target to be set and deal with the concern which is holding us back, which is these countries' arms purchases and their failure to transfer benefits and use them to fund the social and economic poverty reduction initiatives and, of course, the social and healthcare projects which, on the other hand, these countries do need.
Madam President, I was one of the five Members of Parliament who went to Monterrey and I want to put it on record that what Mr. Nielson did before the Monterrey Conference was extremely good.
He persuaded the 15 Member States of the European Union to make a commitment that by 2006 their contribution for development finance will be 0.33% of GDP.
Many Member States are currently contributing much less than this.
This achievement embarrassed the United States, because it realised that its contribution is very small indeed.
The European Union gives USD 25 billion: it is the largest donor in the world.
The United States gives USD 10 billion.
This is a very small sum when you think that the United States has given its military establishment USD 100 billion since September last year, and that is why President Bush promised a further USD 5 billion in development finance by 2006.
That would bring the US contribution up to USD 15 billion, which is still very low indeed when you think that people like Bill Gates give USD 1 billion as personal donations.
Because Mr Fischler is here, I would like to say that EU agricultural subsidies are killing the poor farmers in the Third World.
He knows this and I know he is in favour of persuading Member States to do something about the food mountains that we create.
This was widely discussed in Monterrey with the International Fund for Agricultural Development.
I and my colleagues met with the President of IFAD.
It was made very clear that unless we invest this development finance in the rural economies of poor countries and boost their agricultural production, we will have a breeding ground for deprivation, terrorism and internal conflicts.
This is because these are the people, the majority of them living in rural areas, who are too poor to grow their own food and too poor to buy the EU's surplus food.
I would like to make one other point about HIV, AIDS, TB and malaria.
The Monterrey conference did not discuss these issues at great length, and did not commit itself to allocating funding to them in a special category.
Madam President, in the little time available I would like to give my personal impression, as representative of the Socialist Group at the Monterrey Conference - although I believe it is shared by all the parliamentary groups - of that Conference.
This has been a Conference of contrasts.
There are positive aspects which it would be unfair not to stress, but we must also recognise, as the Commissioner has done, that on certain aspects our expectations for this Conference have not been fulfilled and, of course, this Parliament's expectations had been expressed by means of a resolution.
On the one hand, to have a consensus document, drawn up previously in January in New York, has the positive effect of allowing the participants to dedicate their time to meetings and achieve very significant bilateral commitments, to participate in round tables.
But, on the other hand, we also revealed what our weaknesses and limitations were and how far we were willing to go.
We knew previously that certain issues might be put on the backburner, because for the sake of reaching a consensus, particularly with the United States, the European Union was going to give in.
I believe that this has been a failing on the part of the Council: to demonstrate this weakness.
Of course, it was not the European Union that was represented there; it was the European Commission, the delegation of the European Community, since the European Union does not yet have its own personality.
The positive aspects include the commitment to a budgetary increase in development funds by Europe, as well as better coordination between the Member States, and the fact that the United States has also committed itself to increasing its contribution.
