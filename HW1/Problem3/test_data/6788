Ought not the European Parliament to remember its own decisions along different lines, for example the recommendation to the Council, adopted as long ago as 1999, to set up a European civil peace corps?
The Council has ignored this recommendation for ten presidencies.
The European Parliament should also strongly support the promising talks now under way between the Beijing Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
It can do this by approving AmendmentÂ NoÂ 10 which repeats our old demand that the EU appoint a special representative for Tibet.
Through the people with whom I am in touch as Vice-President of the Delegation for Relations with the Peopleâs Republic of China and as a member of the European Parliamentâs all-party Tibet Group, I have contacts in both quarters.
I therefore know that both Beijing and the Dalai Lama would welcome a strong initiative from the EU on this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, here we have another Brok report, still taking its inspiration from the same principles, still driven by the same desire, which is to construct a common foreign policy.
Mr Brok still fails to understand that the interests of the various European States differ, that their policies are consequently incompatible and that this common policy, which was established, it should be recalled, more than twelve years ago, under the Maastricht Treaty, is one of the hoariest of old chestnuts to have inspired the European federalist outlook.
Rarely in history have so many eminent persons written so much and devoted so much energy to achieving this strange and pathological goal, which consists of ensuring that their country no longer exists.
Most fortunately, however, these pipe dreams remain laughable and have still not been realised to any extent whatsoever.
Let us focus for a moment on what these dreams are and what is so clearly going on here.
They reveal an entire blueprint for the world and, I would even say, a genuine fear of the world.
First of all, MrÂ Brok, who believes that the Council and the Commission are incapable of setting real priorities, takes it upon himself to perform this task, by deciding on what he calls, in ArticleÂ 7, the âimmediate external bordersâ, in other words the East and the South.
At the same time, he welcomes the fact that the crisis operations carried out under the common foreign policy have been supported by NATOâs planning and command structure â I am quoting here from ArticleÂ 30 â and he advocates, of course, closer cooperation with NATO.
What is the world-view that is being set out here?
If the European Union has to implement its principle of âStrength through Unity,â it must do so against the States located in its outermost regions, and closely related to this, must implement this principle, according to Mr Brok, through ever closer relations with the United States in the context of what he calls the âEuro-Atlantic Areaâ.
To sum up, Europe would be constructed in such a way as to support the unity of the white developed world against everything that is different, everything that surrounds it and everything that it sees as a threat.
Is this what the common foreign and security policy is, MrÂ Brok?
How then can we expect people to believe that Europeâs goal is to counterbalance US power when its sole aim is clearly to strengthen the unity of the white world against a South that it perceives to be a threat?
Can we not see that those singing the praises of the common foreign policy are also the greatest supporters of a wait-and-see policy and that the centre of this Euro-Atlantic area has never been more accurately called âthe White Houseâ in other words, a house populated by whites, in league with one another, huddling together happily against the threats posed by the world.
Well, ladies and gentlemen ...
Â Â  Mr President, the Brok report on the fundamental choices of the CFSP is really extremely interesting and falls short only on one aspect: it fails to state that Europe consists of nations and that these nations, at least the larger ones, fully intend to continue to play their role on the world stage.
This was demonstrated yesterday by the visit to Teheran by the UK, German and French Ministers for Foreign Affairs, who obtained an agreement to the effect that Iranâs nuclear activities would be brought into line.
In short, the Brok report views the CFSP too much in terms of constructing a unified entity, whereas it should really be seen in terms of variable geometry and of the synergy of national policies.
One could make the same reproach, although to a lesser degree, of the draft constitution currently being examined by the IGC.
This provides for an official who would be responsible for external affairs in the Union, given the highly meaningful title of âministerâ, supported by European diplomatic activity and wearing not two hats, as has been said, but three: that of High Representative for CFSP, that of Vice-President of the Commission for External Relations and that of President-in-Office of the âForeign Affairsâ Council of Ministers.
This piling on of responsibilities will cause ....
Â Â  President, this is an excellent attempt by Mr Brok to survey all the controversies and trouble spots of the world.
The document has positive things to say on the wider Europe debate and new neighbours and, in particular, on the need to acknowledge the potential for full EU membership in future for those neighbours which are clearly European, namely Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.
Today I welcome to the Parliament Mrs Timoshenka, a Ukrainian leader of the opposition.
It emphasises cooperation in the areas of security and defence, which is excellent, only to spoil it, in my view, by regretting the continued unanimity principle and calling for QMV in foreign affairs, which would imperil national sovereignty.
It rightly calls for strengthened EU and G8 measures again the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which is arguably the biggest threat of all.
However, I am less convinced of the need for an EU foreign minister or armaments agency and found the mini-defence union proposals of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Germany purely a piece of post-Gulf war anti-American posturing, which undermines NATO and is laughable without UK military participation.
I also have concerns about the call for reforms of the UN.
They are long overdue, but not if this means an EU seat replacing the UK's permanent seat.
I have longed believed that there is a case to make for India as a permanent Security Council member and, possibly, also Japan and Brazil.
I welcome the need for closer cooperation with Latin America in general.
I also have problems with including the ESDP in the Community budget, as defence policy is ultimately a marker of national sovereignty and can mean people dying for their country.
It should therefore remain under national parliamentary scrutiny.
Lastly, I have my doubts as to the necessity of a EUROMED Parliamentary Assembly and a EUROMED bank, which will be expensive.
Besides, most of these countries are not true and fully functioning democracies with properly elected parliaments.
Â Â  â Mr President, implementing the EUâs common foreign and security policy will mean having to go from words to deeds.
The Intergovernmental Conference now going on will have to create structures that will make effective decision-making and action possible.
Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, Javier Solana, deserves our support while he frames a strategy on which the Unionâs foreign and security policy will be based.
In a key role here will be the creation of a cordon of properly governed neighbouring countries on the Unionâs external borders.
The Commission proposal on the new neighbourhood policy is currently being debated by Parliament.
It is a positive sign that future new Member States are actively working on the âWider Europeâ initiative.
We will need their skills, know-how and views in the development of relations with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
The proposals for a common foreign and security policy being discussed by the IGC are a logical extension of the decisions reached at the Helsinki Summit on improving the EUâs crisis management capabilities.
It has to be said, however, that we are still a long way from a situation where the EU could offer its Member States guarantees of military security.
There is no need to take a negative view of the fact that some Member States are making faster progress in the area of defence cooperation than others.
At the same time we have to insist that strengthened cooperation should be open to everyone.
We are in favour of the creation of an international system based on multilateralism, as mentioned in MrÂ Brokâs report.
Strengthening the role of the UN will be of key importance here.
I am pleased that my own Group of the Party of European Socialists has now taken a very special approach to how to improve the way the UN performs.
Multilateralism also involves maintaining transatlantic relations.
In the wake of the disagreements over the Iraq war we now must look ahead.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I would like to restrict my observations to our relations with China.
My group endorses the view put forward by the Commission in its excellent policy paper on the new relationship between the EU and China; we are also very grateful to the Council for having made its position clear as long ago as 13 October.
Whilst we believe that the Peopleâs Republic of China is a significant strategic partner for the European Union and that both sides should be committed to building up relations between them, we share the Councilâs concern that the current human rights situation in China, especially where fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms are concerned, still does not meet the international standards that China itself acknowledges.
This is particularly the case as regards Tibet.
Like the Council, then, we call for serious dialogue to be commenced between central China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
Whilst unequivocally endorsing the âone Chinaâ policy, we join with the Council in calling for a constructive dialogue to be commenced between the Peopleâs Republic of China and the Republic of China of Taiwan.
The conflicts across the straits must be resolved by peaceful means, and so the rockets â which could be seen as a threat â must be withdrawn from Chinaâs coastal provinces.
Parliamentâs great interest in having closer relations with Taiwan, including in a multilateral framework, is a matter of record.
Commissioner, I hope that this Sixth EU-China Summit on 30 October in Peking will be successful in the sense to which the Commission and the Council have referred in their statements.
Commissioner Patten, I wish you luck in what will be the first high-level meeting between representatives of the EU and Chinaâs new leadership, in the hope that we will be able to make a new start on the basis that we have just discussed.
All the best!
Â Â  Mr President, this House should not leave unchallenged Mr CoÃ»teaux's comment in this debate about white unity, nor the undoubtedly unintended emphasis on countering terrorism in Islamic states, in paragraph 74 of the resolution.
Terrorism presents a threat from all states across the world, irrespective of religion.
Racial prejudice undermines security and should play no part in our security policy.
Parliament seeks a role to support a stronger and more effective European Union common foreign and security policy, and I congratulate Mr Brok on the strong statements of principle in response to the annual report which he puts before us today.
There is the need to strengthen transatlantic relations, to build EU defence capabilities in the context of reinforced cooperation between the EU and NATO and clear advocacy of the principle of multilateralism in international relations.
Today I do not want to concentrate on already well-debated differences of view on issues in the resolution arising from the draft EU Constitution â the powers of the foreign minister, communitarisation, qualified majority voting, the creation of a separate EU defence headquarters or a duplicate solidarity clause for mutual defence.
But I would stress to all Members that Parliament has already urged Member States to stick as close to the Convention draft as possible, and perhaps that discipline should apply to this House in making further demands now.
However, I want to argue that, while supporting the wider Europe and new neighbours initiative, this must not be used to diminish Europe's global reach.
In paragraph 8, is West Africa really more vital to the EU's interests than Central or southern Africa?
Cannot European diplomacy be as important in resolving potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, as it is â we all dearly hope â in making progress in the Middle East peace process.
I have never supported the principle of 'not in my back yard'.
I join with colleagues in criticising those who would retreat from global responsibilities in international relations.
That must include ensuring the European Union's political support for peace, democracy, human rights and development throughout our interdependent world.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish first of all to pay tribute to the work carried out by MrÂ Brok.
This report makes many points and puts forward a vision of Europeâs role in international relations that we basically share. We also agree with its confirmation of multilateralism and the ranking of Europeâs priorities in foreign policy and even with the positions it adopts on the Middle East.
If we had the time, I could give you many further examples.
There is one point, however, that I do wish to address, which is the issue of parliamentâs rights in the field of foreign policy.
Like you, I believe that the European Parliament should be better informed.
This is stipulated in a recent agreement between the Council, the Commission and our House and it must be fully implemented.
I do have some reservations, however, about the reportâs more extreme demands.
History has often shown that an effective foreign policy does not sit well with extended parliamentary powers.
An assembly is a place of debate and discussion and, if necessary, of decision-making.
Parliamentary time essentially extends over a long period whereas foreign policy must be conducted on a daily basis.
Incidentally, Parliament is also, sometimes, a place of conflict between groups of necessarily differing opinions.
I believe, however, that in terms of conducting its external policy, any community would benefit from demonstrating as much unity as possible.
We also note that, in all democratic countries, the role of national parliaments in foreign policy follows particular rules.
My last comment is that enhancing parliamentary rights would not make Europe's foreign policy more comprehensible.
Let us not produce some tangled web of additional competences that would further complicate the European publicâs understanding of our actions.
I shall conclude by saying that, as regards the CFSP, I do not believe it would be a good idea to call for equal rights with the other EU institutions.
Let us ask questions, let us make recommendations, if necessary, but let us not go so far as to call for the power to deliver opinions on matters of external policy.
For the CFSP, as for other matters, furthermore, let us rely on the judicious recommendations of the Convention.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it has been our lot to live through a historical moment which has proved that Europe would benefit from speaking with a single voice and providing itself with common diplomatic and military tools.
Just as Europe managed to provide itself with institutions capable of embodying its collective destiny, the war in Iraq laid bare the immense distance still to be travelled.
The introduction in the draft Constitution of a new figure, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, with one, two or three hats, to borrow the colourful language of MrÂ Berthu, gives us cause for hope.
Will this institution do its job?
Will it enjoy effective powers?
I certainly hope so.
We cannot accept that European integration will contain two distinct and separate essences: an economic one which embraces integration, and a political one, in the stark, traditional sense, which clashes with it.
This dichotomy does not really exist and has no part in the nature of European integration.
If the question were put to them, the citizens of Europe would come out overwhelmingly in favour of common foreign and security policies.
Legislators at European level, then, run no risk of being accused of taking up position in the vanguard, divorced from public opinion, advancing towards European defence and security.
The citizens of Europe want to feel secure against the threat of violence, external or internal, but they do not want to be the vassals of any unilateral power, even if it appears in the guise of an ally.
They may all dream of ImmanuelÂ Kantâs plan for perpetual peace, but they know that the road is hard and that, historically, naÃ¯ve optimism has a high price.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful that the report emphasises the importance of equilibrium and democratic government in our neighbouring regions.
I would add that it is only the creation of civil society that will form a basis for democracy and security.
Stability is brought about through the division of state and justice, and that is why it is difficult.
It is obviously right and proper to underline the importance of the UNâs role in international conflicts.
High-tech states can attack anywhere â and that has even happened and in even quite a rash way too.
This way they themselves â or we ourselves â can create crises instead of providing solutions.
The notion of a closed defence core is strange, puzzling and even frightening.
What special form of insecurity has come about in those countries whose neighbours are other EU states?
In my own country we have not been aware of any security deficit, even though we have a border with Russia more than 1 000 kilometres long and the Russians across that border outnumber the Finns 30 to one.
Obviously, defence cooperation must be open to all who want it, just as economic and monetary union has been.
The way we approach international problems has to be in the form of civil crisis management.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I agree with the reportâs analysis of the situation following the Iraq war, but not with all the conclusions.
It is true that new threats and security risks must be combated, above all, by means of political strategies with a view to fighting poverty, protecting human rights and promoting democracy.
That, in turn, requires efforts to discover conflicts in time and resolve them by political, diplomatic and economic means.
The EU has these means available to it, and they â and not the military resources â should be increased.
I do not, however, share the view that the credibility of the EUâs foreign and security policy is dependent upon the EUâs military resources.
Nor do I support increased cooperation within defence policy, which I believe should be subject to decisions on a unanimous basis.
Nor am I able to support the proposal that common military operations must be funded via the Community budget and that the EU should, in the long term, acquire its own defence budget.
Nor can I support the idea of a common military defence of European territory.
Peace-making operations, as discussed in paragraph 34, are measures in accordance with ArticleÂ 7 of the UN Charter, that is to say direct military measures, and may only be taken following decisions by the UN Security Council.
It is the EUâs task to prevent wars, not to make plans for conducting wars.
Military defence is, and should be, a national issue.
That is especially important for Sweden and other neutral countries.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The next items are the statements by the Council and the Commission on the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit, including the situation in Chechnya (6Â NovemberÂ 2003).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am quite happy to clearly explain the Presidencyâs position on relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation, especially as, in a few days, on 28 October, I shall, in fact, be in Moscow, together with the European troika, to examine with MrÂ Ivanov the prospects for the European Union-Russian Federation Summit planned for Rome on 6 November.
I should first like to say that the Presidency believes that EU-Russian relations should have strategic importance and that it is therefore in the European Unionâs interest to develop these relations into a close partnership: there is now a basis for it in the partnership and cooperation agreement, which was the subject of one of the first joint strategies drawn up by the European Union, and was brought up to date with the St Petersburg Declaration.
We believe it is in our interest to encourage the reform process begun by the Russian Federation and its move towards closer relations with the European Union.
This process seems contradictory at times.
There are probably forces still operating within the Russian Federation which, perhaps furtivelyÂ âÂ so to speak â oppose this progressive integration of the Federation into European structures; but on the other hand such integration is an objective that President Putin strongly shares.
This is why we must encourage those who wish to support and promote a closer and more positive relationship with the European Union.
The St Petersburg Declaration was an important turning-point in our relations with Moscow and marked out a path that the Presidency, with the agreement of the Commission and the support of the Member States, intends to follow: we must give substance to this privileged strategic partner relationship that we intend to have with the Russian Federation.
The St Petersburg Declaration marked out the path to create four common spaces.
This approach, which we support, forms a basis for the work to be done at the forthcoming summit on 6 November.
As regards the common economic space, first and foremost, we are waiting for the high-level working group to conclude its work.
Commissioner Verheugen will be having a final meeting with his Russian counterpart, the deputy Prime Minister Mr Khristenko, on 28 October.
We should then reach a final agreement on the actual concept of a common economic space and on operational matters arising from it.
We hope â and we are working towards this â that we can agree on a common commitment to pursue an even higher level of integration of our economies, through greater liberalisation of trade and greater convergence in terms of regulations.
In parallel, the European Union is involved in the negotiations for Russia to join the World Trade Organization.
Talks are at a very advanced stage, although there are still a few problems to resolve: I refer, in particular, to energy prices and access to the services market.
Commissioner Lamy recently spoke to the Council on this matter and was given strong encouragement to continue with the negotiations.
We are aware that Russiaâs membership of the World Trade Organization is an important, essential condition for a genuine common economic space.
With regard to the common external security space, we are preparing a draft joint statement setting the criteria, principles and objectives of collaboration in the field of crisis management, which should cover the use of both military resources and civilian resources.
We hope that through this joint declaration we can spotlight our cooperation in this area of special importance for the Unionâs external actions.
On the common internal security space front, we can report good collaboration, in particular in the fight against organised crime.
We are on the finishing straight as regards signing the agreement between Europol and the Russian Interior Minister, and we hope to be able to report the event during the 6 November summit.
Still on the subject of internal security, Russia had asked us to examine a new visa waiver scheme for short visits.
We are aware that this is a request that can be set in the medium to long term, but a number of preconditions will need to be met first on the Russian side.
Talks with the Russian authorities on this subject have already started and this is encouraging in any case; a working group has already met, on 13 October, to deal with this matter.
We attach importance to concluding the negotiations on visas and also those on the readmission agreement: this is a particularly important area, I would say one of the conditions for examining, overall, the Russian request to abolish short-stay visas.
In the meantime, we hope to be able to report some progress even, as one might say, âunder current regulationsâ, without changing the rules.
Some Member States, including Italy, have already established bilateral agreements, and others have stated their intention to do so.
The Presidency intends, of course, to work towards a common position that can so far as possible absorb the bilateral agreements.
Lastly, the common space of culture and education: here we have to work much harder, because very little has been achieved so far.
Among the positive points I can, however, mention the fact that the Russian Federation has recently joined the so-called âBologna processâ, a collaboration mechanism that promotes agreement on academic titles and the harmonisation of university curricula.
It is an important development.
I must also mention the possibility of renewing the cooperation agreement in the field of science and technology, and also the prospect of including the Russian Federation in certain Community programmes in the culture and education sector, something that the Italian Presidency is encouraging.
With regard to the St Petersburg conclusions, there is one aspect on which there is still a difference of opinion: the way the Permanent Partnership Council operates.
On the Russian side, they continue to interpret the St Petersburg Declaration as meaning that the council should meet not only in different guises depending on the various subjects dealt with, but also in the 25 + 1 format.
On the European side, the belief is instead that the council should operate mainly according to the troika formula, even if the troika is opened up to other members who may be interested.
I hope to deal with this matter in greater depth during my visit to Moscow on 28 October.
In our talks with Moscow, we shall continue to stand by our positions of principle and our concerns regarding the protraction of the Chechnya crisis and respect for human rights.
The match that is being played out in Chechnya has a significance that extends well beyond that territory: its outcome, whether positive or negative, will be felt throughout the Caucasus and will thus affect the overall security of the continent.
We have shown the European Unionâs support for the broad constitutional reform initiative that President Putin has launched through the adoption of a new Constitution, approved by a vast majority in a popular referendum.
We have also supported the passing of an amnesty law, which will be important in furthering the reconciliation process.
In the presidential consultations of 5 October 2003, we saw yet another step in the gradual resumption of normal political and administrative life in Chechnya.
Today, we reiterate our support for President Putinâs institutional approach and for a political solution that involves those increasingly broad sections of the Chechen population that have no links with terrorism and are therefore entitled to take part in the process of democratic reconstruction.
In parallel with constitutional reform, in fact, we believe that there is room to improve the current standards of human rights in the region and the relations between the Chechen population and their administrators.
We shall also reiterate our interest and encouragement for the Russian authorities to achieve the swift and safe release of the representative, Arjan Erkel, who was kidnapped in the Caucasus in August 2002.
Finally, during the Summit, we intend to underline the urgency for everyone involved, including the European Union and Russia, to redouble their efforts to achieve a solution to the current conflicts in the ex-Soviet sphere: I refer to Transdniestria and the southern Caucasus, in particular Nagorno Karabakh and South Ossetia.
With the enlargement of the Union and the increasing proximity of our borders, the Union has become rather more sensitive to this than previously, as it directly affects the security of the continent.
At the same time, we recognise the great responsibility that Moscow has to face and the great contribution it can make in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned.
We shall spare no effort or encouragement in this direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am extremely grateful for the Minister's comprehensive and very clear explanation on the prospects for the summit with the Russian Federation.
It is of course long-standing good practice for Parliament to review our relations with Russia on the occasion of forthcoming summits.
Parliament may recall that it was briefed at the May part-session before the St Petersburg Summit by my colleague and friend, Commissioner Verheugen, and we are now in the phase of implementing its conclusions.
We have five major expectations from the Rome Summit, which were alluded to by the presidency.
First of all, we want to find a common understanding with Russia on the approach to creating the common spaces, stressing the strategic nature of relations between Europe and Russia.
We should agree on how to do this, for example, by drawing up a joint document, which should contain specific, achievable objectives for the medium term, building on the partnership and cooperation agreement and taking into account the Wider Europe initiative.
Secondly, we want to intensify discussions on the impact of enlargement.
It is in Russiaâs interest that the partnership and cooperation agreement should be extended smoothly to the acceding Member States, without any discrimination.
This is a formality, and one on which we want to tie up loose ends by 1 May 2004.
If we cannot achieve this, we will need to agree to apply the partnership and cooperation agreement on a provisional basis, as in 1997.
Thirdly, we will take note of reports on the common European economic area and the energy dialogue, to both of which the presidency referred in some detail.
I spent 18 months myself working with deputy Prime Minister Khristenko on the European economic area.
We were at what one could call the conceptual stage.
I hope that will bear fruit by the time of the summit.
Fourthly, I hope we can reach agreement with Russia on ways to address common challenges.
This means tackling problems primarily in the fields of Justice and Home Affairs, and the environment.
We will, for example, request Russia once again to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible, and ask Russia to intensify cooperation on nuclear and maritime safety, on terrorism and on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Fifthly, we are ready to agree a joint declaration on cooperation on political and security matters, including crisis management.
In particular, the European Union expects positive signals from Russia on its readiness to cooperate on the Transdniestrian region of Moldova.
We are also ready to look at ways to step up cooperation on civil protection, in order to make best use of existing structures.
Achieving these results â and perhaps I uncharacteristically understate the point â is not without obstacles.
The presidency has referred to two examples. One in relation to the Permanent Partnership Council and the other in relation to visa requirements and the negotiation of a readmission agreement.
In making all these points, the European Union will recall the importance of the common values which underpin European Union/Russia relations, and which are crucial with regard to Chechnya.
The Commission has followed recent developments in Chechnya.
As Parliament will be aware, we support a political solution to the conflict and we support all genuine efforts to bring about a lasting peace.
We welcomed the constitutional referendum in March, which we hoped would lead to a peaceful, political settlement to the conflict by providing a platform for genuine dialogue, restoration of the rule of law and the protection of human rights.
It was in our view essential that the population of Chechnya should recognise the legitimacy of the presidential elections held on 5Â October.
But the conduct of the elections has raised many questions regarding, amongst others, due process and access to the media.
Also, there are worrying reports of continuing human rights violations.
Let us be clear.
We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we recognise the territorial integrity of Russia.
But we also insist on the respect of human rights and the prosecution of those who ignore such rights.
As the biggest provider of humanitarian aid to the region, the Commission is asking Russia once again to remove all obstacles to the provision of such aid and we are asking for assurances that internally displaced persons will return to Chechnya on a strictly voluntary basis.
I hope that in putting these points to Russian officials once again we will have a better response than we have had on the many previous occasions when we have raised them.
In July, Parliament requested the Commission to consider how to support reconciliation and rehabilitation.
This we are doing, but the most important precondition for assistance â namely security â is simply not met at this time.
In fact, the security situation in Chechnya has, if anything, deteriorated since last March, and it would be difficult even to carry out a needs assessment, let alone to start work.
We are fully aware of the conclusions of the September meeting of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and we look forward to a new resolution on EU-Russia relations following the Oostlander report of December 2000.
Speaking for myself, I hope that by the time I give up my present responsibilities my speaking notes for meetings with my Russian interlocutors do not cover nearly all the same points that they did four years ago.
Â Â  â Mr PresidentRussia is already now by far the most significant country the Union shares a border with.
That border, which is 1 200Â kilometres long, will grow to twice the length when the Union expands into the Baltic countries.
Russia is still a modest proposition in terms of its economy, GDP being slightly greater than that of the Netherlands, but its economic potential might be said to be huge.
The Union has already strengthened its cooperation with regard to energy in Russiaâs direction, as we heard the Commissioner say, which is vital if we are aiming to find a replacement for North Sea energy sources, which are running out, and avoid becoming solely dependent on the Middle Eastâs energy resources.
Russiaâs incomparable wealth with regard to forests, however, as well as Siberiaâs reserves of precious and colour metals, for example, will also be one of the reasons for Russiaâs rise over the coming years, the other being its high achievements in the sciences and high levels of skill and know-how.
In the view of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Russia is now and will be in the future our most important neighbouring region â whatever geographical definition is applied to cooperation with neighbouring regions.
In our opinion the Union has to use all the economic and intellectual means it has to try and help the advance of a stable market economy, the development of democracy and see the rule of law become established and take root in Russia, because any other sort of Russia, if it remains a nuclear superpower, would also be the greatest potential security threat to the Union.
Russia and the rest of Europe are bound to one another by destiny.
âThere is no great Europe without Russia and no great Russia without Europeâ was the motto employed by our party, led by the current President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, and Russiaâs workgroup on progressive forces back at the start of the 1990s.
Our attempts at cooperation with Russia, however, must not be allowed to eclipse the fact that we now insist on better compliance with human rights and the freedom of speech than before in Russia.
This does not apply just to Chechnya, but also and above all to the Chechnya region and the war and destruction in Chechnya that continues still.
No conflict is any longer solved with weapons, but political decisions instead.
The United States of America can also see that in Iraq and Afghanistan.
That is why we demand that Russia shows even greater political initiative and openness and that it should make considerably better use of international organisations in more open solutions to the problems of Chechnya, as Commissioner Patten also said here in his speech with regard to questions of security in the region.
MrÂ President-in-Office, we are not convinced that the recent elections and referenda were conducted honestly.
Apparent democracy has been produced to cover up the truth, not to reveal it.
In my opinion, the Councilâs impression of a positive development, which MrÂ Frattini suggested there was, is not absolutely in keeping with the truth, and we noticed there were slight but obvious differences in the positions presented here by Commissioner Patten on the one hand and the President-in-Office on the other.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, relations between the European Union and Russia have improved, but not enough.
It is worth remembering that almost 40% of Russiaâs exports come to the European Union. Just 6% go to the United States of America.
Now it is estimated that after enlargement that figure will rise to 60%.
At the same time, the Unionâs dependence on Russiaâs resources is growing: that would seem the prospect for natural gas, for example, in the next decade.
It is in Russia too that economic growth these days is fastest in the world.
The Russian President has set two objectives in his election campaign: firstly, to create a strong central power based on the rule of law, and secondly to extend economic growth to the vast sections of Russiaâs population who are poor.
It is in the European Unionâs interests that Russia is able to solve its huge problems, from its wide-scale poverty to human rights, freedom of the media and the war in Chechnya.
We want to see that economic, political and cultural cooperation can also help us to have an impact on Russiaâs problems.
We have also had a taste of Russian isolation.
In its time it was a gift to Stalin, who pulled down the shutters and began having his own people killed.
Now it is important that civil society in Russia, now in its infancy, has our support.
This is precisely what many Russians are hoping to obtain from us.
Let us not leave them just to get on with it!
The Russian leadership claims they often listen to the messages coming from the Union more carefully than they do each other.
These aims will serve to allow Russia to join the World Trade Organisation as soon as possible.
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement should be reviewed to correspond with todayâs needs.
Regarding Chechnya, I would say that the elections were problematic, as previous ones have also been, and the Community has been unable to accept them.
We propose that there should be an international conference and arbitration with regard to this matter and also that relief organisations should be allowed access to the region promptly.
Â Â  â Mr President, the biggest single project between the EU and Russia is the creation of a common European economic area.
It has been hard making that a reality, as it has been a matter of a bilateral project between the EU and Russia.
At the same time both sides have been developing relations of cooperation with other states.
Thus, Russia has recently concluded an agreement with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan on the formation of a common economic area.
The EU has its own separately agreed arrangements with these countries.
In my opinion it would be wise to try and bring together these arrangements for cooperation by establishing a broader, multilateral, economic area of cooperation, with the involvement of not only the EU and Russia but also that of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan as well as any other of the Newly Industrialised Countries willing to participate.
Where appropriate the European Economic Area, which was established between the EU and EFTA, could be taken as a model.
An arrangement agreed along such lines would be well suited to the EUâs evolving broader European policy.
The EUâs new, broader European policy also offers opportunities for the development of cross-border cooperation where the EU shares a border with Russia.
The Commission proposal for a new financial instrument for neighbourly cooperation will eliminate those problems which we have had harmonising internal and external financial schemes.
The Russian authorities must familiarise themselves with the new financing scheme in good time so that we can be sure it will work right from the start.
Finally, my greetings go to the Russian Government.
Can you ensure that human rights are implemented in Chechnya and do your very best to seek a peaceful solution to this regionâs problems!
Â Â  Mr President, this is somewhat earlier than expected, for which I am grateful to you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my gratitude but also my disappointment in respect of the Italian Presidency.
My gratitude is for the fact that the Foreign Affairs Minister has mentioned the name of Arjan Erkel without prompting.
He clearly stated that he will urge the Russians to take additional steps to bring about the release of Mr Erkel, a humanitarian aid worker who has disappeared, having been abducted over a year ago.
This is a message of hope, Mr Frattini; his relatives are pleased about it, and so is the organisation âMÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšresâ.
I hope that you will certainly bring this up for discussion on 28 October in your meetings with Mr Ivanov.
I have, however, to give voice to some disappointment too, Mr Berlusconi.
This is a statement by the Council and the Commission.
I have listened very carefully to Mr Patten, who made very pertinent statements about the situation in Chechnya and about the elections in that country.
Mr Frattini, you only stated â and I made a note of it â that you will express your concern about the human rights situation in Chechnya.
The issues involved are much worse, though.
As Mr Patten quite categorically stated, those elections were not real elections.
They were a sham, a farce.
Those elections were not conducted in accordance with international standards, and the hope we shared with our ad hoc delegation when we returned, when we saw that a political process had indeed been put in motion, has now all but evaporated.
Peace will not return to Chechnya unless all factions, all clans, within the Chechen population are involved in a real peace process, in a real dialogue.
Peace will not return to Chechnya unless the Russian Government is prepared to talk and enter into dialogue with the rebels, the freedom fighters.
This is why I want to come back to our resolution of July, in which the express request was made for the European Union to play a significant role, with a peace conference held under its aegis, because an external player is required to ensure that the Russians and Chechens enter into real dialogue.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for the extra time you have given me.
Â Â  Mr President, close cooperation with Russia is vital if the international community is to compel Iran to restrict the application of nuclear energy to purely civil purposes.
I trust that the Council and the Commission will clearly put this message across to President Putin.
After all, what matters now is for yesterday's concessions to Iran to be realised.
In this context, I should also like to touch upon a complaint made by President Putin.
According to him, Russian companies have had sanctions imposed on them for supplying the nuclear sector in Iran.
However, according to Putin's sources, European and American companies got off scot-free having made identical transactions.
I would like to ask the Council and the Commission if this serious allegation concerning Europe's contribution is true.
I should like to offer the Council and Commission a second, equally urgent item for the Summit's agenda.
In the Gulf of Kerch, a serious border conflict between the Ukraine and Russia is at risk of escalating out of control.
The immediate cause is the construction of a dam from the Russian peninsula Taman to the Ukrainian island of Tuzla in the Gulf of Kerch.
We from the European side should make an urgent appeal to both parties for a peaceful settlement of this thorny territorial dispute.
I also concur with what Mr Staes said in connection with the request that Europe should do everything possible in connection with what has happened to Arjan Erkel.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am sorry, but the policy you both stand for today is no longer just a vile and irresponsible policy: it is a criminal policy, because what you are doing, Mr President-in-Office, is criminalising an entire people.
You have presented them as a terrorist people; the foreign ministers of the five largest countries in the European Union, who met in Paris last week, promised each other to exchange information on the international terrorist training camps in Chechnya.
You have never given us â the public â the slightest evidence of them.
You talked of Chechen terrorists present in Afghanistan, but no Chechen has ever been found in Afghanistan; you said the same thing about Iraq, but you have never found a single Chechen in Iraq, alive or dead.
This is an identical operation to the one that was carried out in the 1930s, when a whole people was presented as a people of plutocrats; well, now, day after day, you present the Chechen people to European and world public opinion as a terrorist people.
You do so because it is expedient for you to do so; it is expedient for you to do so because of the policy you are developing with British Petroleum, which is of great interest to Mr Blair; with Shell, which is of great interest to Mr Oostlander; with , which is of great interest to President Prodi or Mr Berlusconi; with , which is of great interest to President Chirac; and with other companies too, of course.
That is what you are doing, in order to promote a policy of self-interest, and certainly not a policy of truth.
Â Â  I wish to begin by saying that our relationship with Russia is incredibly important.
I wish I had much more time to talk about it, but I want to concentrate upon what is most urgent, namely the issue of Chechnya.
It is a quite specific conflict, but there are nonetheless many parallels.
We see in many quarters how great powers come into conflict with population groups with different national identities.
It is, of course, easy to say that this or that should be done, but I think there is a pattern to learn from.
We can begin by looking at ourselves â the EU and Europe.
Historically, we have a lot of experience of conflicts of this type.
One current example is Northern Ireland, where we are beginning to find a solution.
Another example is the Basque Country.
No Europeans now imagine any longer that the conflicts in the Basque Country and Northern Ireland can be resolved by military means.
Political solutions have to be sought.
Formulas have to be found that are acceptable to both parties, and that naturally also applies to Russia in Chechnya.
That is something we have to do all in our power to emphasise.
Peaceful solutions must be sought, and they must be based upon respect for self-determination on the part of the people concerned.
How, in practical terms, the particular conflict is then to be resolved is something the parties must discuss and agree about.
No one else can solve the conflict for them.
The point of departure must, however, be self-determination on the part of the people.
Democracy must have grass roots support, rather than be imposed from above.
It is not possible for Moscow to dictate solutions.
If the Russian people do not realise this, a lot of damage will be done both to Russia and to future cooperation between Russia and the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, we have already discussed Chechnya on a number of occasions in this House, and it is important to mention this.
At the same time, I should like to underline how right the two-track policy is with regard to Russia.
After all, we are dealing with entirely different cooperation possibilities, which may, in turn, have an effect on Russia's political culture.
It is precisely in this political culture of Russia that Chechnya fits in as an area where indeed, a failed state was created at one time â a kind of black hole in the Russian federation, where Russia had no choice but to act.
The way in which this is done, however, fills us with disgust.
We should consider whether it would not be possible for us â maybe in the person of Mr Solana â to criticise Russia's military intervention in that country to such a degree that Russia would feel forced to change its strategy.
The military training, the system of that military apparatus and the strategy used in Chechnya all fit into the old pattern of ruling with a rod of iron.
This only breeds terrorism and results in desperate suicide acts.
These are events that we have witnessed from relatively close-by in Chechnya.
If we ask the acting commanding officer whether there is an alternative to this guerrilla warfare and whether there is any knowledge about this alternative method, his response is that this knowledge is available at the ministry, but he questions what good that is to them on the ground.
This shows that the Russians cannot appreciate why we in Europe make such a fuss about Chechnya.
Despite this, it is extremely important for us to keep an eye on this aspect, because one of the areas that has been mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, namely that of internal security, is, of course, directly connected to it.
We must not, therefore, forget Chechnya.
I share the view of the others who say: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with all due respect for you when you draw attention to the case of Arjan Erkel â in respect of whom it would be fantastic if you were able to solve it during your presidency â but you have to remember that Chechnya is more tragic than you have depicted it.
Mr Patten is right: the security situation over there is abominable; even aid workers will certainly not be able to operate in safety.
That is why it is of vital importance that we pull out all the stops to see whether we can persuade the military, and hence the politicians, in Russia, to change the way it behaves in Chechnya.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in the past, the European Union has, in matters relating to Chechnya, addressed most of its appeals for a peaceful resolution of the conflict to Russia rather than to both sides.
It was only when the USA became the victim of targeted terror attacks, which Europe also feared, that we began to take a more nuanced view of the situation.
Such a realistic approach is to be welcomed, and the summit with Russia should reinforce it.
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the European Union will not always be able to exclude the issue of the CIS from the debate it wants on the European Common Area, but will have to face up to it.
Even if one takes a critical view of the possibilities open to it in political dialogue on the resolution of the conflict with and within Russia in relation to Chechnya, the EU does have options, and we should make use of them primarily in order to provide effective aid for humanitarian purposes and for reconstruction, so that the hard-pressed people of Chechnya can get real help.
Â Â  Mr President, the summit on 6 November will be different because not only is Russia currently the EU's fifth largest trading partner, but from next May it will be its neighbour.
Already the acceding countries are flexing their muscles, as illustrated by Lithuania's concerns over the controversial D-6 oilfield in the Baltic Sea, and Latvia's objections to harsh criticism over its treatment of its Russian minorities, who will number almost one million between the Baltic republics in the EU next year.
The EU will shortly be importing Russian uranium.
Plans are afoot to synchronise the two electricity grids.
Pressure is mounting on Russian to ratify Kyoto, as otherwise the treaty is dead.
In exchange, Russia will want EU support in its quest to join WTO, where there are many unresolved problems, from its dual pricing over gas to export duties and discriminatory transport fees paid to Aeroflot to overfly Siberia.
Recently, the issue of pricing Russian oil in euros was raised.
Surely this is for the markets to decide, not governments.
I welcome formal cooperation with Europol and OLAF and hope that visa-free travel for Russians will be possible once the issue of a readmission agreement for illegal migrants is settled.
We are used to the abuses levelled at President Putin over Chechnya, where the recent victory of President Kadyrov was described as lacking in pluralism, and human rights abuses still go on.
But what do the Russia-bashers want?
A failed, rogue, independent state in the Caucasus with links to Al Qaeda, exporting organised crime to the European Union?
First we must see law and order restored.
Only then can true democracy prevail.
Only Russia can deliver that.
Recently, Russia signed a controversial and, in my view, regrettable single economic space agreement with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but at the same time we now see dangerous military posturing from Russia and threats to invade as a result of the dispute over Tuzla Island in the Black Sea.
I hope that this can be resolved amicably.
I hope that one day we will see arrangements for a single free-market-style economic space with the EU and Russia united as one big economic entity.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I was shocked by what Mr Frattini had to say about Chechnya.
In making these statements, you are putting yourself at odds with what the majority in this House has thought and said for years, and also opposing the position that the majority in my party, the European Peopleâs Party, has taken for years in this House.
We have stood up for freedom and human rights in Chechnya, where Russia is engaged in a brutal colonial war, the second stage of which was inaugurated by President Putin in the course of the bloodiest election campaign in history.
Mr Putin is, unfortunately, not going to solve the problem, for he is a quite substantial part of it.
On attempting to consider the problem from the point of view of Russiaâs interests, one discovers relatively quickly that Russiaâs interests and Chechnyaâs are in fact one and the same.
Russia is suffering from financial problems; in Chechnya, billions are being senselessly squandered on a futile and bloody war.
In Russia, democracy and the rule of law are suffering decline and â as Andrei Sakharovâs widow Yelena Bonner, has very powerfully described â the war in Chechnya is being taken as an opportunity for old structures to re-establish themselves.
Russia is suffering to a quite substantial degree from remilitarisation and the return of elements from the secret services, developments that also essentially derive from Chechnya and the war that is being waged there.
Russia is suffering from terrorism and from organised crime.
As Mr Oostlander so rightly said, the war in Chechnya is doing nothing to remove these problems, but is making matters worse.
It can therefore be said that those who commit themselves to freedom in Chechnya and to its liberation are ultimately also committing themselves to freedom and liberation for Russia.
In the long term, Russia will have to recognise that the only solution for its problems is for Chechnya to be a real democracy, and we have to see that the problem is that the pseudo-referendum that has been held there is intended to legitimise someone who was and is a villain rather than a legitimate partner in dialogue, namely President Mashadov.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a look at the topics for the forthcoming summit with Russia reveals among them such important and honourable projects as support for independent media at national, regional and local level, the integration of Russia into a common European economic and social area, cooperation in the fight against international crime and illegal migration, cooperation in the field of nuclear safety, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and a number of other things.
I recall, in this context, an article by the Russian chess grand master Garry Kasparov on the eve of President Putinâs visit to the USA, an article that is equally relevant to the imminent summit between Russia and Europe.
Its opening line went something like this: âVladimir Putin comes to the USA as a great friend of democracy, of the rule of law, and of human rights.
True?â, whereupon Kasparov promptly answered the rhetorical question with a polemical âNo, false!â.
He followed this up with a veritable tirade enumerating incidences of negligence and wrongdoing, arguing, for example, that Russian democracy is only a front; that the press and media are in fact made to toe the line, that liberalisation of the economy is not in fact being implemented, that potential contenders in the forthcoming presidential elections were interned on spurious charges of economic crime, and that the elections in Chechnya were a charade.
I have no wish to promote Mr Kasparov from chess grand master to being the yardstick by which we judge everything, but, even if one regards it as exaggerated â which was his intention â his article has to make us prick our ears up.
We must not blot out unpleasant issues.
Chechnya is a running sore and the grossly manipulated elections did nothing to heal it.
What, then, should we be calling for?
We should be calling, firstly, for an end to the lawlessness of Russian army personnel, or else it will never be possible to win the publicâs confidence.
Secondly, democracy must be put on a broad basis.
It would be desirable if the Kremlin were, at the EU-Russia summit, to be reminded, on this point, of its most fundamental responsibility, for it is in any case President Putin who is required by the Russian constitution to guarantee human rights in the Russian Federation as a whole.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I thank all the Members who have spoken and expressed opinions â some of which I think deserve brief comments â as well as claims with which I frankly cannot agree.
First, as Mr Patten has already said â I had mentioned that the Councilâs activities and the Commissionâs have always moved along in parallel and in complete understanding â doubts have already been expressed regarding certain moments in the presidential elections in Chechnya, and our Russian friends have also been told quite clearly on a number of occasions that Europe is keeping a close watch on the situation inside Chechnya and on the human rights situation.
At the same time, I think it is quite right â and the Presidency confirms this â to have continued to encourage the constitutional reform approach that President Putin has embarked on and which he confirms and maintains.
At no time in my speech, which is, moreover, available for everyone to look at â as in fact I only heard in one speech by a Member â at no time did I ever say anything that could be taken to mean that I considered the whole Chechen people to be terrorists.
I said the opposite: I said quite specifically that the Presidency hopes and desires that those increasingly numerous and widespread sections of the Chechen people that have no connection with terrorism should be involved in the constitutional process.
I repeat: I do not believe in any way at all that the Chechen people is a terrorist people.
Nevertheless, although we shall certainly talk about this point â that is, the involvement of a broad spectrum of Chechen civil society in the constitutional process â at the summit with the Russian Federation, I must also make it just as clear that there can never be any justification of any kind for those individuals â however many of them there may be â who commit terrorist acts or use themselves as human bombs to kill innocent civilians.
On this point, we Europeans have always been and, I hope, will continue to be united.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the initiative in the United Nations for a universal moratorium on the death penalty.
Â Â  . â Mr President, on 10 October 2003, the World Day Against the Death Penalty, I adopted a public declaration on behalf of the European Union which clearly stated: âThe European Union calls upon countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty to at least introduce a moratorium as a first step towards complete abolition.â
This, I repeat, is the declaration that I myself adopted just a few days ago on behalf of the European Union: a text agreed upon by everybody.
I say this because even before that, as a representative of the Italian Government, I can say that Italy has always been firmly convinced that the battle for the abolition of the death penalty is of great political and idealistic value, as well as having a very important humanitarian aspect.
I believe that all of us Europeans are sure that the process leading to the complete abolition of the death penalty is irreversible, but also that this process has to be a gradual one.
That is why we must ask ourselves how we should act in practical terms so that the sacrifice of human life that it inevitably requires can be stopped for good.
These are the concerns that have led the Italian Presidency to accept the invitation of this House and many other parliaments, including the one in my country, to propose to the governments of the countries of Europe a European Union resolution initiative on a moratorium, to be put before the current United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Mr Berlusconi spoke in the same vein here in Parliament on 2 July this year; this commitment is founded on concerns that we all share, as reflected in the report and resolution on human rights in the world, adopted by the European Parliament on 4 September.
In the debate within the European Union, a major ethical problem, which is a question, has arisen.
People have wondered: Is pursuing the complete abolition of the death penalty compatibleÂ âÂ I repeat, is it compatibleÂ âÂ with an initiative such as the moratorium, which is based on governmentsâ willingness not to apply the death penalty in practice in their countries?
There are also more strictly political considerations.
Is there, people have wondered, a sufficient level of agreement for the resolution to be adopted in the General Assembly?
How much might a possible defeat affect the future of the campaign for the total abolition of the death penalty?
If the data really confirm that there is a trend towards an expansion of the abolitionist front, we wonder: is it now worth running the risk of the resolution failing â given the uncertainty of the outcome â or might it not be better to wait until our position has been further consolidated?
These are the questions that have been asked.
The Italian Presidency has been giving considerable thought to these serious questions, because Europe obviously cannot and must not appear divided or uncertain on a subject as important and sensitive as this one.
We have weighed up the pros and cons.
We have mobilised our whole diplomatic network to try to understand, to get an idea â so to speak â of voting intentions on a possible resolution for a moratorium.
The result of this survey, which we have carried out in all the diplomatic offices, seems to indicate that a suitably formulated text might be approved by the General Assembly, although, of course, that is not a certainty.
The fact remains, however, that many countries whose history would suggest that they should be in favour of a resolution of this sort have not expressed their position on our question, and we should not ignore the risk that, if amendments are tabled on the text of a resolution such as this, the united front of supporting countries might suffer some major defections when it comes to the vote.
The Italian Presidency â and the Italian Government, at a national level â are very conscious of the demand made by this Parliament, the European Parliament, just as, in Italy, we are conscious of the mission that the Italian Parliament has given us to put a resolution on a moratorium before the General Assembly.
On the other hand, it is quite clear to us that many governments within the European Union are still rather baffled and are wondering how best to pursue this objective, which we all share.
We are convinced that a European initiative to put a resolution before the General Assembly would be politically well-timed and morally very worthwhile, and we have been and still are working towards this, so that the question can remain a subject for examination and careful consideration by the foreign ministers.
We are aware that concern over a defeat, despite the general positive feeling, is prevailing over any inclination to table a resolution.
We, as the Italian Government, uphold this commitment at a national level, but, as the holder of the European Presidency, Italy still hopes that the outcome of this careful consideration will be a European decision to go ahead with tabling the resolution.
This would be a decision consistent with Europeâs commitment to oppose the death penalty.
That is why I am once again calling for some careful consideration.
I know time is short, and I know this consideration has to lead to a decision very swiftly.
I hope there will be either a joint decision of all the countries of Europe to share responsibility for tabling a resolution of this kindÂ âÂ which would be by far the best option â or a European decision that clearly leaves the path clear for national initiatives on this subject by European countries, including, perhaps, the Italian Government acting at a national level.
If the initiative comes from Europe, it will certainly have greater force; if it comes from the governments of European countries it will certainly have less force but it will be equally important.
I am still waiting for the representatives of the European Governments â and I shall be giving them a reminder â to give me their judgment and final opinion on one or other of these possible solutions within a very short time.
Â Â  Mr Patten, this is not the first time you have addressed the House on this issue.
Â Â  . Mr President, you are entirely correct in saying that I have addressed Parliament on a number of previous occasions on the death penalty and I have had to observe occasionally in the past that when I first used to make speeches in a Parliament on the death penalty, I did not find such unanimity of support for my views.
I remember voting for the abolition of capital punishment in various parts of the British Isles, not always with great support.
The first act that I carried out when I was a colonial oppressor was to abolish capital punishment in Hong Kong!
So I have a certain amount of 'form' on this issue, as football managers would say.
Can I straightaway apologise for the fact that I will not be able to stay for the whole of this debate.
I have to catch an aeroplane for Madrid for the Iraq Donors' Conference which is beginning tomorrow morning, and where, of course, the presidency will also be represented.
I hope Parliament will excuse me of any discourtesy, but my colleague, Mr Fischler, will be coming to sit here to report anything that I should have heard later in the debate.
I hope also that Parliament will excuse me if a good deal of what I say treads in the elegant footsteps of the presidency.
I want to put many of the same points, but in my own way.
Parliament knows that we consistently work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty.
In the process of attaining this objective, where the death penalty still exists, we call for its use to be progressively restricted, we insist that it should be carried out with the minimum cruelty.
The European Union also presses, where relevant, for moratoria to be introduced.
We have produced internal guidelines for dÃ©marches and representations on capital punishment, where relevant, in multilateral fora and towards third countries.
At the European summit with China last year, the then Prime Minister of China, Zhu Rongii, said: 'you just talk about these issues to poorer countries don't you?'
I pointed out to him that the first time I recalled us raising the issue was with the United States.
So it is an issue that we raise âI must say that the United States Secretary of State was slightly surprised! â with everyone.
The European Parliament is a long-standing opponent of the death penalty and has been instrumental in promoting this process.
Parliament has declared in the past that it considers capital punishment, and I quote, 'an inhuman, medieval form of punishment, unworthy of modern societies'.
A series of initiatives have been taken to ensure that the abolition of the death penalty should become a key element of European human rights policy.
It is on the basis of this strongly held European policy objective that for the last years we have successfully tabled resolutions in the UN Commission on Human Rights on the death penalty, as the President-in-Office has said.
The seventh consecutive resolution was adopted in Geneva on 24 April.
This resolution contains some significant new features.
It calls, in particular, on states not to carry out executions in public or in any other degrading manner and to ensure that any application of particularly cruel or inhuman means of execution, such as stoning, be stopped immediately.
While the support for resolutions on the death penalty in the Commission on Human Rights has increased, it has to be said that opposition has increased as well.
The resolution adopted in Geneva received the support of 24 states, while 18 voted against and 10 abstained.
However, the strong disagreement of many states was proved by the fact that 63 countries signed a statement dissociating themselves from the resolution.
I thought it would be useful to recall these facts in the context of today's debate on a resolution requesting a moratorium on the death penalty in the General Assembly Third Committee.
A first consideration, before presenting any resolution, should be whether such a text would receive sufficient support to be adopted by the General Assembly.
We all remember the 54th session of the General Assembly in 1999.
A text notably calling for the establishment of moratoria and the enforcement of certain safeguards was circulated.
This draft caused an immediate outcry from states that maintain the death penalty, including Egypt, India and Singapore.
Strong attacks were made on the European initiative, and we were perceived as seeking to impose our values on other sovereign states.
In the end, the text was withdrawn.
That was the situation in 1999.
We have no indications that the General Assembly would be more positively inclined today towards a death penalty resolution.
It would seem that while the hard-line retentionists are resigned to further Commission on Human Rights texts on this issue, they will continue to resist strongly any efforts to secure a General Assembly resolution.
This would lead to further divisive debate.
As a result, the European Union has decided to pursue its action against the death penalty in the Commission on Human Rights rather than the General Assembly.
However, a more fundamental issue is whether a resolution asking for a moratorium would promote the European objective of abolition of the death penalty world-wide.
The presidency has suggested that the European proposal should not go as far as requesting abolition of the death penalty but rather a moratorium on the use of this punishment.
Since the resolution tabled by the European Union in the Commission on Human Rights asks states to abolish the death penalty completely and, in the meantime, to establish a moratorium on executions, we may run the risk of being perceived as weakening the European stance by not suggesting the same high standards in the General Assembly.
I should also let you know that I have been approached by non-governmental organisations on this matter.
In July of this year, I had the pleasure of convening a special seminar for human rights NGOs in Brussels.
In the context of that meeting, the world coalition of NGOs against the death penalty, and that includes Amnesty International and many other prestigious organisations, presented its own view.
The message of this group was to ask the European Union to refrain from presenting a resolution on the death penalty at the forthcoming General Assembly.
These NGOs in particular pointed out that since there are no signs to the effect that political tensions have eased since 1999, such an initiative could create a highly politicised and counter-productive debate in the General Assembly.
In their view, another failure in the General Assembly could reinforce the position of those states that maintain the death penalty.
I attach great importance to the expertise of the many renowned NGOs that we work with.
They also play an important role as partners in the framework of projects we implement under the European initiative for democracy and human rights programme.
On the initiative of this NGO coalition, we also for the first time on 10 October celebrated, if that is the right word, the World Day Against the Death Penalty.
The European Commission will continue to support campaigns designed to achieve a moratorium on the death penalty and on executions and eventually the abolition of capital punishment throughout the world.
Last year approximately EUR 4.9 million were allocated under the European initiative to projects aimed at raising European public awareness in retentionist countries.
The methods used include public education, out-reach to influence public opinion, studies on how states' death penalty systems comply with minimum standards, informing and supporting strategies for replacing the death penalty and efforts towards securing the access of death row inmates to appropriate levels of legal support, as well as training for lawyers.
During the last months there have also been some positive developments that should be highlighted.
In January, Governor Ryan of Illinois decided to commute the death sentences of 156 prisoners on death row.
Through the entry into force on 1 July of Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the use of the death penalty is banned not only in peacetime but also in time of war.
Lastly, the President of Armenia in July commuted all outstanding death sentences to life in prison and, subsequently, in September, ratified Protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, and in that way abolished the death penalty.
Let me repeat, we take this issue seriously, and I am delighted that we are working with a presidency which has taken it so seriously and has pursued it with considerable skill and very good political judgment.
We are making some progress, but it will take time and persistence, as well as the continuing advocacy of this Parliament if we are to attain our goal, which is to see the death penalty consigned to the history books as a form of punishment that should have no place in the modern world.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, thank you for describing the efforts you are currently making.
The European Unionâs position is indeed clear; we are all unreservedly opposed to the death penalty, and that is why the resolution tabled jointly by this House is a relatively short one.
The fundamental and primary question is what tactics we should adopt in order to make the best progress.
Are we to address the UN Commission on Human Rights and demand its abolition there, or are we, in the UN General Assembly, to call only for a moratorium?
Commissioner Patten set out very well how we can proceed without losing sight of our fundamental rejection of the death penalty.
One might almost say that it is a bit warped: the best solution is of course the abolition of the death penalty; the second best is a moratorium; the worst of all the bad solutions is for there to be still such things as stoning to death or other even crueller modes of execution, and the second worst is to demand that people be executed âhumanelyâ.
So discussion of this amounts to something almost perverse.
I do believe, though, that the approach that Parliament is asking the Council to take will end up being feasible, involving as it does the European Union presenting a united front in calling, in the General Assembly, for a moratorium on the death penalty.
I believe that all the states belonging to the United Nations know where the European Union stands on this.
Calling now only for a moratorium will not mean that we lose sight of the overall objective.
I also think it would be right for this motion to be put by the European Union as a whole.
I do not think it would be right for one or other government to obstruct it and thus prevent action by the EU as a whole.
Still on this subject, I would be interested to know what line our candidates for accession take on this issue.
As a general rule, this should already include them.
I believe that an initiative of this kind carries more weight and has more far-reaching impact if twenty-five states adopt it.
As our resolution indeed mentions, the individual Member States also need, in so far as they are able, to attempt to make approaches to individual states and persuade them to support at least a moratorium.
I believe that would be the best way for us to proceed.
I wish the Presidency all the best for its negotiations towards this end.
I am sure that this House will, by way of this resolution, virtually unanimously endorse this approach.
Â Â  â Mr President, may I say by way of an introduction that it is rather odd that every debate of ours on the death penalty should still be marred by a particular lack of frankness.
A few months ago we listened with similar discomfort to people speaking in tones of exasperation about Cuba, while on China, with its 3Â 138 executions in one year, we continue to pick just polite words, which are reduced at times to an embarrassed stammer when Europe is called to speak out on the increasingly frequent, at times almost industrial use of capital punishment in the United States or other so-called liberal democracies that still use the gallows, such as Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and India.
I should not like this political bashfulness to be compounded now by a serious omission concerning a commitment that the Presidency of the Council formally adopted before this Parliament on 2 July this year, that is, to put a resolution for a moratorium on capital punishment before the United Nations General Assembly.
Let us recall â and let us remind Minister Frattini of this â that this resolution was given as one of the Italian Presidencyâs priorities in its foreign policy programme, and we know â as a matter of common sense and also from experience â that a moratorium is the first political step towards the abolition of the death penalty; anything else is just a pipe-dream.
The deadline for submitting a text for this resolution is 7 November, but so far there is no sign of the resolution.
After many decades of noisy and sometimes sterile debate, it would be irresponsible to have announced such an important political initiative four months ago only to give in to the pressures of those who do not want the United Nations to pronounce against the death penalty.
The risk of defeat?
I am thinking more of the duty of battle, the duty of the political battle that the European Union must carry on its own shoulders.
In conclusion, as the President-in-Office of the Council leaves for China, we also entrust him with the task of reminding that country that, when faced with the value of human life, there can be no political expediency or hierarchy, not even towards China.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the UN Charter of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
Last year, 31 countries breached this crucially important article, which supports what is human and alive and promotes a civilised and humane society.
Thirty-one countries believed they had the right to take the lives of their own citizens.
According to Amnesty International, a total of 1Â 526 people were executed in these 31 countries, and 3Â 284 people were condemned to death in 67 countries.
Slightly more than 80% of the executions took place in three countries: China, Iran and the United States.
Commissioner, Minister, you know all this.
China is the worst of them all.
It is nonetheless deeply tragic to have to place the democratic United States on the same list as the two dictatorships.
As a sincere friend of the United States, that pains me a great deal.
How can a democratic and civilised country such as the United States continue to apply the death penalty?
In the United States, the number of executions increased last year to 71, compared to 66 the year before.
I do not in actual fact believe, MrÂ President, that many Americans are aware that the United States does not fulfil the requirements for becoming a member of the EU, and I am convinced that the United States should be influenced to change its attitude.
That would make it so much more difficult for other countries in the League of Death.
Might the American people be less open to the facts than us Europeans?
Thousands of innocent people have been condemned to death and executed.
Might the American people be less humane than ourselves?
No, that is not true, but, in that case, more courageous leaders are needed who wish, and dare, to take up the debate in pursuit of justice and human dignity.
Is it possible, Commissioner and Minister, to engage in bargaining when it comes to the total abolition of the death penalty?
I doubt it.
I believe that a very clear approach is required in this area.
This popular revolt against the death penalty, the first step in which is a worldwide moratorium, must be supported wholeheartedly by the EU and the Italian Presidency.
You must not hesitate in this area, gentlemen.
The responsibility lies with yourselves, Minister and Commissioner.
The death penalty must be abolished.
It is not negotiable.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I believe we should welcome the fact that the cause fought for by the abolitionists has become, in the space of a few decades, a few generations, one of the general publicâs most passionate demands in the field of human rights.
When in 1961, abolitionists such as Martin Luther King talked about abolishing the death penalty, it appeared to be a pipe-dream.
The following generation â my own â was made aware of the issue as a result of the policy conducted in this area in France, when FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and Robert Badinter abolished the death penalty in 1981.
We should also bear in mind that countries we thought would never abolish the death penalty so quickly, such as Turkey and various candidate countries, have succeeded in doing so, by showing some real political will, especially since our sitting in this Chamber in June 2001.
I therefore believe that, as regards this issue, instead of talking about tactics, it would be infinitely preferable to talk about political convictions and the will to back up these convictions.
In fact, when our fellow Member, Mr AriÂ Vatanen, takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally wearing a badge that features the words âno death penaltyâ, he is raising the awareness of an entire continent.
By the way, as MrsÂ Trautmann said, what is at stake is our ability to tame our instincts for revenge.
When we rally forces, we manage to save a Nigerian woman who had children outside marriage from the death penalty.
I believe that if we rally forces again, we will be able to get a man named Mumia Abu-Jamal off death row. He has been imprisoned only because he is black, because he was a journalist, because he spoke out for those who have no voice and because he spoke out against the abuses perpetrated by Philadelphiaâs racist police.
It is with all of these individuals in mind that I say today we should think carefully.
As regards the death penalty, the colour at stake is not black or white, but the colour of blood.
This is why, in my opinion, we must not extradite people to countries where we know they can expect the death penalty.
In particular, it upsets me to think about our fellow citizens currently in Guantanamo, because we do not know what their fate might be.
Ladies and gentlemen, what is needed is political will, not tactics.
Â Â  â Mr President, one of the great areas of historical tension in our age is the struggle between state sovereignty and universal human rights.
The traditional power of sovereign rulers appears above all to be the right to make decisions about the life and property of their subjects.
In an era of nation states we have failed to rid ourselves of two serious and persistent breaches of fundamental human rights, namely the death penalty and the widespread use of torture.
It is excellent that the European Union, whose own external sovereignty is very weak, has, in a core area of its foreign policy, human rights, focused on the elimination of these two serious ills especially now when thoughts about armed security dominate the shaping of the new world order and at the same time violence against a countryâs own citizens is worryingly becoming of relative importance.
A state that kills and tortures should never have international legitimacy.
The fateful question the UN system has to address is the conflict I mentioned at the beginning.
The universal organisationâs particular strength has indeed been considered to be respect for human rights, but at the same time its Charter is firmly anchored in the notion of state sovereignty.
It thus lies at the point where two eras and two different political views of the world meet.
I believe the time is now ripe to take this step forward and do all we can to try for a comprehensive moratorium to let the death penalty just smoulder everywhere in the world as an interim stage in eliminating it once and for all.
The plan will involve diplomatic and other types of risks, but the goal will make them worth taking.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, despite repeated calls from many quarters for the protection of human rights to manifest itself in the abolition of the death penalty, we have not only seen an increase in death sentences in some countries in recent years but also systems of execution becoming crueller, with barbaric methods used.
In asking for a moratorium on the death penalty, at the very least, the would like to mention, merely by way of example and on the basis of the, of necessity, partial facts that were provided by Amnesty International for 2002, that, in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan alone there were 113, 48 and 40 executions respectively, not to mention the 1 060 carried out in China.
In light of this, whilst upholding the urgent need for a moratorium on the death penalty, we must call, just as fervently, for the European Union and the United Nations to intervene regarding these countries in which the punishments given are not linked to secular rules but to fundamentalist cultures or traditions of any structure.
Furthermore, whilst upholding every individualâs right to religious freedom, we need to declare with conviction that the enforcement of the in a State or part of it cannot be accepted by the Member States of the European Union.
This is why the moratorium on the death penalty must be accompanied by sanctions that Europe must impose on those governments which do not accept the moratorium and continue to apply the death penalty with cruel techniques such as, for example, stoning to death.
One of the sanctions that we would like to see would be a suspension of economic relations with these countries: continuing to help the citizens, where possible, but no longer traffickingÂ âÂ if you will excuse the termÂ âÂ with those countries whose governments knowingly continue to violate human rights.
Europe cannot impose its laws and its concept of democracy onto other countries, but neither can it continue to have effective economic relations with governments that are founded on the violation of the most fundamental human rights because, in these countries, the death penalty is not only a punishment inflicted by courts or carried out by the executioner but also one which is inflicted every day by hunger, desperation and violence that drive whole populations to seek refuge elsewhere and even, as has been happening in Somalia since 1991, to die in the waters of the Indian Ocean or in the Sicilian Canal.
Finally, the death penalty is also a punishment that terrorists are continually giving by killing unarmed citizens.
Consequently, there is no hope of actually obtaining a moratorium on the death penalty if we do not also impose sanctions on those who enforce inhumane and fundamentalist laws and cover up terrorist actions as well.
The time is right MrÂ President for the Italian Presidency to press Parliament to make a symbolic gesture, to ask Iran to pardon the young woman condemned to death for killing the man who was raping her.
Europeâs involvement in this could give new hope to so many women oppressed by the extremist and inhumane vision of all too many governments.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have been allocated 90 seconds as president of and as a representative of the Transnational Radical Party, which has been fighting for decades to, at lastÂ âÂ and I am saying this to PresidentÂ FrattiniÂ âÂ state our convictions instead of doing verbal gymnastics around conventions in an undignified manner.
In 1994, we only lost by eight votes in the UN, because of the concern of Singapore and other States that these proposals for a moratorium would reduce national sovereignty.
To date, 33 States have become abolitionist and have enforced the moratorium.
The Italian Presidency has proclaimed and is continuing to proclaim loud and clear its conviction in this battle, taking every single opportunity, every single day in this rubbish heap of pretexts and excuses, every opportunity, to go against its commitments.
MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, we are fighting a battle so that the convictions that we accept or claim to accept are, at least to a minimal extent, honoured in our country too, if possible, and also in EuropeÂ âÂ with or without you â and so that we can stop unworthily conforming to foolish, mistaken conventions.
My time has run out but I fear that your time is running out for credibility and decency.
I hope that this is not yet the case but you are in danger and putting us in danger of indecency and not being believed.
Â Â  â Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, I do believe that it is essential that the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States of course, presents a motion for a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly calling for the adoption of a universal moratorium on death penalties.
What is more, I also believe we have the obligation to present such a motion.
Prudence cannot be allowed to make us forget our commitment to defend the right to life or our responsibility to work to increase international cooperation with a view to achieving the complete abolition of the death penalty in the world, because the death penalty is a violation of the fundamental right to life, and what is worse â as Amnesty International says â is that this violation is not only not hidden or denied, but is actually enshrined in the laws of the country which applies it.
Furthermore, if a country does not respect the most fundamental of rights, with what authority will it demand from citizens respect for other rights and on what foundations will that country base its democracy and Rule of Law if its law allows the most important and most fundamental of rights to be violated: the right to life?
For the European Union, therefore, the fight to abolish the death penalty and the fight for democracy and respect for human rights are and must be one and the same.
It is true that progress has been made in this regard and that today far fewer countries maintain the death penalty in their legislation, but we are still far from its total abolition, as the statistics so cruelly demonstrate.
The European Union, therefore, in order to be coherent in terms of the values on which it is founded, must make fighting the death penalty a priority, not only before the United Nations General Assembly, but also in its relations with third countries which have yet to abolish it, whatever links the Union may have with these countries or their strategic or commercial importance, because nobody must be given the power to decide on the life or death of a human being.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to make a few very brief comments to give absolute clarification on this issue, which is very important to the Italian Presidency.
In many speeches, I have heard a call to the Italian Presidency to present the resolution to the United Nations General Assembly, on behalf of the European Union.
What I did not hearÂ âÂ but which I hope Parliament will be able to establish in its deliberationsÂ âÂ was anything regarding a situation which I felt it was my duty to mention in my speech.
There is notÂ âÂ and I repeat, there is notÂ âÂ unanimous agreement within the Member States of the European Union that the Italian Presidency should present a resolution on behalf of Europe.
In light of this, there are two options: either Parliament asks the Council Presidency to present a document on behalf of the European Union when not all of the Members of the EU agreeÂ âÂ and this is the first optionÂ âÂ or it must be clearly stated that Italy, even holding the Presidency of the European Union, can present a resolution even without the consensus of some Member StatesÂ âÂ without this, however, being seen as a grave violation of the spirit of cohesion in the European Union that we must demonstrate.
Italy, as a nation, is in favour of doing so, but it is in favourÂ âÂ and I repeat thisÂ âÂ of doing so when it becomes totally clear that, within the framework of the European Union, not all Member States are in favour, not of a moratorium because we are all in favour of a moratorium, not of abolition, because we are all in favour of that, but of a resolution now being presented.
Since I believe that I have now been clearer, I will say that the Italian Presidency is not only in favour but very much in favour of presenting a resolution on behalf of Europe, but if Europe does not unite on this issue, can we present a resolutionÂ âÂ undoubtedly not on behalf of EuropeÂ âÂ saying that Europe is divided on this?
I am ready to comply with this request when Parliament says what it thinks in this regard.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me, but I do not understand the answer we have been given.
I do not understand it at all and I still do not know whether or not the presidency will support our demands.
Â Â  I suggest that you take up that matter with the President-in-Office of the Council.
I have received five motions for resolutions from different political groups.(1)
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  . A universal moratorium is called for here on a regular basis, but when will this actually be implemented?
Good will on the part of Europe is no longer enough.
Abolishing the death penalty must be seen as a crucial aspect of the EUâs relations with third countries.
Throughout the world countries continue to perpetrate this State crime.
This barbaric practice still takes place in particular in Japan, China, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and in Iran, where executions are still carried out.
What is worse, between 2001 and 2002, the number of executions increased.
It has become impossible to remain silent about this âadministrative murderâ, especially when it is carried out by the most powerful country in the world, which is attempting to impose its order and its values on the rest of the world.
We cannot accept that the only solution to crime and violence is crime and violence itself.
Like the newly created World Association of Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty and in line with the worldwide call for abolition, the European Union must exert all necessary pressure to ensure that the United Nations adopts a moratorium that would have lead rapidly to the abolition of the death penalty.
Men and women are left to rot on death row and Mumia Abu-Jamal is one of these.
Preventing the irreparable must be done as a matter of urgency.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B5-0279/2003).
We will take a series of questions to the Council.
Â Â  In 2002, the Commission presented a Communication on the integrated management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, which gave a comprehensive view of future border management.
Again, in 2002, a feasibility study, led by Italy, was presented in Rome on setting up a European border police force.
The following June, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a plan for the management of external borders that was the basis for all further activity in the area.
On the basis of these documents, in Seville in 2002, the European Council specified priority measures and asked for a common unit of external border practitioners to be set up, made up of Member Statesâ heads of border control services and charged with coordinating the measures contained in the plan.
Furthermore, this also provided for the rapid implementation of joint operations at external borders and the immediate commencement of pilot projects.
These operations and projects have been implemented or have been in the process of being implemented since 2002 and 2003.
In June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council decidedÂ âÂ as you knowÂ âÂ to create a Common Unit of External Border Practitioners to make this European strategy more effective.
This unit has been set up and is operating in the Council.
In the Thessaloniki conclusions, the Council invites the Commission to examine the need to create new institutional mechanisms, including a European operational structure, in order to enhance operational cooperation for the management of external borders.
On 16 and 17 October in Brussels, the European Council welcomed the Commissionâs intention to submit a proposal for the creation of a European Border Management Agency, in order to enhance operational cooperation, in time for the Council to be able to reach a political agreement on the main elements of the agency by the end of 2003.
This proposal will draw on the experience of the Common Unit of External Border Practitioners.
Furthermore, the European Council took note of the study carried out for the Commission on maritime borders and invited the Justice and Home Affairs Council to draw up a working programme on this issue to be adopted by the end of the year.
Finally, regarding the European police college: this was set up by the Council decision of December 2000, it began operating in 2001 and is temporarily based in Denmark.
A decision regarding its permanent site will depend on the recommendations given by the European Council.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr Frattini, for your answer, which was extremely good and specific, and for the very good work that the Italian Presidency of the Council has done in this area.
I have just two specific supplementary questions.
Firstly, will the group of border experts to which you have referred produce a written report at some point in the course of the year or at the end of the year, or will it take even longer?
That is my first question.
My second brief question has to do with the Police College.
Do you think, as regards the issue of where the various bodies are to be based, many aspects of which are still open, that this package can be got to grips with before the end of the Italian Presidency, or will it â and the issue of the Police College not be able to be sorted out before the end of this year?
Â Â  A decision has not yet been made on the location of the agency, and so I cannot say whether it will be the Italian Presidency that examines the overall package.
Nevertheless, I can say that Common Unit of External Border Practitioners reports and will continue to report regularly, since it is clear that all preparatory work for the future agency will be basedÂ âÂ as I saidÂ âÂ on the experience of this working group.
This is why we value the cooperation between the Commission and the Council, particularly from the coming months onwards.
Â Â  â Mr President, at present a team of experts in the field of border control operate in Finland.
It includes a few officials.
If this joint border police agency were located somewhere other than in Finland would the intention be for this Finnish team of experts also to be ultimately stationed there?
In other words, has the Council any plans at this time regarding what is to happen to this team of border control experts that currently operate in Finland?
Â Â  C These are technical problems, which I take note of.
The principle is that of a European agency that coordinates all operations.
Clearly, therefore, where there are working groups, their experience will be taken into consideration. Obviously, we have not yet looked into the technical aspects of coordination.
Â Â  I can inform MrÂ DellâAlba that the Council has received neither a proposal nor a legislative initiative on this matter.
Despite this, being aware of the importance of the question, the Italian Presidency raised the issue of the execution of prison sentences at an informal meeting of Ministers for Justice held in Rome on 13Â September 2003.
As you can see, we are waiting for developments in this debate, which the Presidency initiated.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke as such and you replied in this role as if you were not also the representative of the Italian Government.
MrÂ Turcoâs question said exactly this: that your colleague, MrÂ CastelliÂ âÂ also President-in-Office but also a member of a government of a Member State and as such entitled to present the proposal to which you referÂ âÂ announced on 7 August, in the and in a Parliamentary hearing, that the Italian Government, or he, personally, intended to launch an initiative to define minimum standards of living in European prisons.
Since we thought it an excellent idea and since Parliament has been calling on the Council to do this very thing for yearsÂ âÂ and I would now add the idea of extending the right that Italian deputies have to visit prisons to MEPsÂ âÂ I would like to ask if you can confirm this intention in this House on behalf of the Italian Presidency.
Â Â  I do not feel I can reply as a representative of the Italian Government.
I can only say, as a representative of the Presidency, that this debate was commencedÂ âÂ as I said beforeÂ âÂ at an informal meeting of the Ministers for Justice.
There will clearly soon be developments and results that, at the moment, we are not in a position to predict, given that the debate began on 13 September, less than a month ago.
Â Â  The European Union has expressed its concern to Turkey about the framework agreement on customs union with the Republic of Northern Cyprus and, in particular, stated that, over and above the implications of a legal and commercial nature, the signing of the said agreement damages the efforts intended to resolve the Cyprus issue and goes against the spirit of the plan drawn up by UN Secretary General, KofiÂ Annan.
The European Union has taken note of the reply from the Turkish GovernmentÂ âÂ with which it is satisfiedÂ âÂ to the effect that it has decided not to ratify and not to enforce this agreement, deemed incompatible with the customs union with Turkey.
The European Union is expecting Turkey to abide by this decision and withdraw the current trade measures with Northern Cyprus that are violating the Europe-Turkey customs union.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
This is one step, but it is not enough.
This agreement bears the signatures of the Turkish prime minister, the Turkish Government, and it is before Parliament; simply it will not be put to the vote.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office if the European Union will call for this agreement to be cancelled outright as it is provocation for the regime of Turkey as a candidate country and of the customs union between Turkey and the European Union.
Â Â  I can confirm that we will continue to urge Turkey not to ratify the agreement and, clearly, an agreement that has not been ratified is a void agreement in legal terms, in the sense that it cannot and must not be enforced.
I think that we must check that Turkey does actually act on the commitment that it has given and we hope and trust that it will be made good.
Â Â  The Council is concerned about the deterioration of the food situation in Zimbabwe and is opposed to any attempt to make the supply of food aid dependent on political criteria.
The European Unionâs food aid policy and its management are regulated by a 1996 Council regulation, pursuant to which the Commission adopts all the provisions necessary for food aid programmes and actions to be implemented properly.
To this end, the Member States and the Commission provide each other with the necessary help and any useful information.
In its common position of 18 February 2002 on Zimbabwe, the Council expressed serious concern at the situation in this country, in particular the renewed violence, and imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe.
This common position was extended until 20 February 2004.
According to the Unionâs guidelines on food distribution in Zimbabwe, agreed by the Commission and the Heads of Mission in Harare in 2002, the management and distribution of food are based on need and not on political criteria.
The impartial distribution of aid will be a joint endeavour carried out in consultation with the main interested parties.
It will provide for a participatory and transparent selection of recipients.
Each distribution programme will have an independent monitoring system in order to manage selection, distribution, surveillance and possible complaints.
The European Union has harboured serious concerns at the publication, by the Zimbabwe Government, of the new policy relating to the operations of non-governmental organisations providing humanitarian aid and development aid.
Towards the end of September 2003, the Zimbabwe Government signed Memoranda of Understanding with Euronet and the World Food Programme (WFP) on the principles of food distribution and has made some effort to clarify how it intends to apply the new policy to the operations of NGOs. After these developments, the Member States agreed that the Heads of Mission are to launch a widespread initiative in the main capitals, with the exception of Harare, to inform the European Unionâs regional partners of concerns relating to the issues associated with delivering food and humanitarian aid in Zimbabwe.
The Presidency is currently preparing the mandate for the aforementioned initiative.
The Union will continue to follow the development of the food crisis closely, in the hope that the Zimbabwe Government will, indeed, respect the humanitarian principles of the recently-signed Memoranda of Understanding.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
MrÂ Frattini, could you perhaps give me a concrete answer to the question whether the Council intends to act on Mr Mugabe's dictate and, whether or not they do, whether it is intended to continue to provide direct aid to the NGOs that are active in Zimbabwe.
Or are we going to follow the guidelines issued by the Zimbabwean Government and deliver the food aid directly to the government bodies?
Meanwhile, you may like to know that the situation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated even more, in the sense that there is now also a shortage of fertiliser for the production of food, a shortage of fuel and such like. The situation is therefore getting worse all the time.
I am a little worried that the response will be inadequate if all that is done is to maintain existing sanctions up to, and including, February 2004.
Â Â  As MrÂ Cushnahan knows from the Councilâs reply to his previous question, the Commission was commissioned to carry out a feasibility study to improve controls at maritime borders following the adoption of the comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in February 2002.
The report contains some recommendations on ways of improving border controls and refers to the possible establishment of an operational structure.
The Commission forwarded this report to the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 12/13 September 2003.
The Council is looking into this report to draw any possible conclusions.
These actions are testimony to the importance that the Council accords the issue of controls at maritime borders.
We are convinced that the management of external borders should have a substantial European dimension if we are to succeed in making progress in implementing measures that have already been determined by the Council seeking to combat illegal immigration and associated crime.
Â Â  I welcome the fact that the Italian Presidency is interested in the concept of the European coastguard and recognises the fragility of our maritime borders rather than â and it has happened in the past â an exclusive preoccupation with land frontiers.
While I am aware of the Commission proposal, would the presidency not accept that the issue of illegal trafficking in human beings is not the only problem on our seas?
Criminals have used our seas in many ways to ply their evil trades, which include illegal trafficking in drugs and cigarette smuggling.
Also to be borne in mind are the problems caused by shipping disasters.
We have also had major problems with regard to marine pollution, the package and, more recently, the disaster.
Would the presidency also accept that, given the low stocks which exist in our seas vis-Ã -vis fishing, there are a lot of things that a European coastguard could do along the lines of the US Coastguard?
Is it not time for a proposal on a multi-faceted approach, which does not deal solely with the issue of illegal trafficking in human beings, but covers all these aspects?
If we address the concerns of European citizens, we are always concerned about how to make Europe more relevant.
If we came forward with a definitive proposal to tackle these problems, we could make Europe very relevant by addressing the real fears of the citizens across a whole host of areas.
Â Â  Womenâs rights and the issue of enforced disappearances are a source of particular concern for the European Union.
According to international law and on the basis of ethical and constitutional principles common to all the Member States of the European Union, we have urged governments to commit to the UN resolutions and decisions and to enforce all the rules, laws and programmes seeking to ensure that women can fully enjoy all rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal footing with men.
The European Union monitors and regularly discusses with the Mexican authorities the human rights situation in Mexico and compliance with the countryâs undertakings under international law.
The Union has been encouraged by the clear commitment to human rights for everyone made by PresidentÂ Foxâs administration and his pledge to considering this one of the most important priorities of his government.
We welcomed Mexicoâs cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights (UNHCR).
Nevertheless, according to some sources, the governmentâs good intentions and new approach have not yet been completely turned into tangible results.
The recent restructuring carried out by the undersecretary for democracy and human rights in the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the National Human Rights Commissionâs recent decision to cancel the Ombudsman project that had been financed by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights have given rise to much concern.
Mexico was chosen as one of three priority Latin American countries to benefit from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the period 2002-2004.
The Mexican authorities should therefore renew their commitment to make progress in the field of human rights in cooperation with international partners, including the important UNHCR programme in Mexico.
The European Union will continue to monitor the human rights situation and will discuss it with the Mexican authorities at the first useful opportunity, which will be the meeting of the Joint Association Committee to take place next November, under the Italian Presidency.
Â Â  â Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, the problem you have raised in the reply to my question satisfied me only in part. That is because, unfortunately, over the last ten years â as you well know â specifically in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, more than 320 bodies of women and girls have appeared.
Furthermore, more than 4 470 women and girls of between 14 and 16 years old have disappeared.
I would therefore like, in addition to the action the Council is going to take with Mexico in relation to the Agreement, to see an examination of what specific actions â since we are not talking about a violation of human rights in general, but a very specific case which involves the disappearances and deaths of many women and girls, specifically in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez â have been taken by Mexico to try to verify these facts, and, on the other hand, whether it is possible, and whether the Council will allow it, to consider what assistance is being requested by the authorities of that country so that the international community may contribute to clarifying these facts, which are very serious.
Â Â  The issueÂ âÂ which has had such tragic consequencesÂ âÂ of the arrival in what are known as âold tubsâ of so many desperate people who come to try their luck in Europe, has resurfaced once again.
The Thessaloniki European Council invited the Commission to examine the need to create new institutional mechanisms, including a possible European operational structureÂ âÂ I have just mentioned thisÂ âÂ in order to enhance operational cooperation for the management of external borders.
As I mentioned earlier, the aim is to approve the launch of a European agency specialised in this area at the December European Council.
The Council recalls, furthermore, that, in the context of the plan for the management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, some joint operations have already been put in place that seek to monitor and reduce illegal immigration via the sea.
A final progress report on the implementation of this plan for the management of external borders, with evaluations of the results, was presented in June 2003 and then forwarded to the Thessaloniki Council.
On the basis of this experience and on the basis of the suggestions from the European Centre on risk analysis, measures are in place and new operations will be launched.
Among these I would like to just focus on the project called âNeptuneâ which only began in September 2003, just a few weeks ago.
This operation involves implementing joint surveillance and monitoring operations in the central and eastern Mediterranean, and various Member States and accession countries are involved.
This isÂ âÂ I would stressÂ âÂ just one important case to which I hope more will be added shortly.
Furthermore, I would like to draw MrsÂ Izquierdo Rojoâs attention to the importance of cooperation with countries of origin and transit.
This issue is part of a broad, comprehensive approach to immigration that is balanced and integrated.
We must make sure that we create conditions for development in countries of origin and transit that prevent the flow of desperate people from leaving for Europe.
Particular attention, in this respect, was given to creating a network of liaison officers, to be formally approved by the end of 2003, whose job it will be, precisely, to create a support network for European initiatives to regulate the whole phenomenon of migration.
Â Â  I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply and for the measures adopted by the Council.
I believe, however, that the Council is not adopting them with the speed that this situation calls for, because these are measures that will be adopted at the beginning of 2004 at the earliest and we will have to wait for a year or more for them to be put into practice.
We have been warning of this for some time.
These are urgent and specific assistance measures so that these human beings can be provided with the necessary assistance services.
In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, could you not give us some specific information on this funding, which is necessary to update assistance services in those regions in which the boats are arriving, where the immigrants are arriving?
Can you not give me some specific information here and now?
Â Â  I can only say to MrsÂ Izquierdo RojoÂ âÂ as I have already saidÂ âÂ that at least one of these programmes is, in actual fact, operational: it is called âProject Neptuneâ, began in September 2003 and provides for operations that are already underway.
As regards funding, MrsÂ Izquierdo Rojo is well aware that it is the Commission that decides and deliberates on the conditions.
I will take note of these concerns, which I, personally, share, and I will also make the Commission aware of them.
Â Â  MrÂ SacrÃ©deus has raised an issue which it is for neither the Council nor the Council Presidency to comment on: the organisation of popular consultation at national level and, therefore, the competence of Member States.
We have stated our position, which could obviously be the position of each individual Member State of the European Union; each one is governed by different laws regarding popular consultation.
There are States in Europe that do not make provision for referendums and there are those in favour of the possibility of European referendums on the draft Constitutional Treaty.
They are all ideas and proposals, which neither the Presidency nor I can judge or comment upon now.
The extremely sensitive and important issue of popular approval of the draft Treaty is an issue for the Member States, and each State is governed by different laws.
It is not, therefore, a matter on which the Council can give its opinion.
Moreover, I can express a hope and an opinion which is mine alone, perhaps a dream, certainly not a practical situation that is feasible in the near future: that of a European referendum, in which all the citizens of Europe give their opinions on the draft Treaty on the same day.
I define this a personal thought and a dream because I am aware that it will be difficult for it to be practicable.
Â Â  I wish sincerely to thank the Italian Foreign Minister, MrÂ Frattini, and the Council Presidency for that answer.
I believe it is incredibly important for Italy, as the country holding the Presidency, to have its own view and, thus, for the Council Presidency to operate as a model.
I think it is very important to raise the level of knowledge and commitment and to focus more upon European issues in domestic policy, both in Italy and Sweden.
My follow-up question to MrÂ Frattini is about the way in which the Council Presidency views the fact that more and more countriesâ governments and parliaments have now said that they wish to hold referendums on the draft European Constitution.
Do you take a positive view of this development?
My second follow-up question is this: do you yourselves see a possibility of Italyâs being able to take such a decision as a model for other countries and governments?
Â Â  I will reply very briefly and the answer is obviously âyesâ.
We are in favour of any initiative that gives force and popular legitimacy to the current constitutional process, but this is a favourable view and a vision that, as you so rightly said, MrÂ SacrÃ©deus, cannot impose solutions on other countriesâ constitutional systems.
Â Â  MrÂ Frattini, we have just heard your opinions and we would like to thank you.
I think that they were very clear.
I would like to ask whether, in the evaluations given to date and in the proposals put forward by individual Member States to establish the Convention text, or rather the Constitutional Treaty, there have been any evaluations or whether ideas have been included regarding the proposed referendums.
I understood, and we know, that our systems do not provide for an abrogative referendum, nor does the possibility currently exist of subjecting this Constitutional Treaty to a similar evaluation.
Are there any ideas or not regarding the proposed referendum?
Â Â  I can say to MrÂ Ebner that there have not been any proposals to this effect.
My personal opinionÂ âÂ and I emphasise, my personal opinionÂ âÂ is that any ideas that can enrich the popular legitimacy of the new treaty will be interesting and valuable proposals, but, of course, there are some national systems that can hold referendums of this type and other systems that cannot.
I can, however, say, Mr Ebner, that, in the course of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, no one presented these ideas.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I want to ask about Europeâs next big âreferendumâ, namely the elections to the European Parliament on 13Â June next year.
What is the Presidency contemplating doing to increase voter turnout on that day, along with their understanding of the European Union?
Â Â  I will be extremely brief in my reply to MrÂ RÃŒbig.
This is a competence that we share with the Irish Presidency, which will have the honour and duty of leading the Council from 2 January.
My opinion is that, in order to convince the citizens of the importance of European elections, we must obtain good results when drawing up the Constitutional Treaty.
I will try explaining this the other way around: if we do not reach an agreement on the Constitutional Treaty by the end of the year, then this will be a powerful weapon to discourage the public from voting because we will have sent the public a message of crisis in our European ideal.
The first thing that we need to do is, therefore, show that, after the many, long months of the Convention and the Conference on the constituent debate, that we reach agreement on the Treaty.
This is the first sign.
Â Â  For this reply, I will refer to the Council declaration on trans-European networks, which we presented on 24Â September during the last plenary session in Strasbourg.
Regarding the outermost regions, it is fair to say that they are disadvantaged because of their geographical location and the fact that they are islands, as recognised by Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
The issue must, indeed, be dealt with not only with words but also with a major support action.
These regions, with a population of 3.8 million inhabitants, received EURÂ 7Â 200 million during the first two Structural Funds periods, which means that every inhabitant in these regions received 33% more than those in the Objective 1 regions.
In 2002, the Commission forwarded a regulation to increase the funding of the trans-European networks.
This proposal is still being discussed, but the Council is expecting a new proposal to be forwarded, amending the decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, adopted by the Commission on 1Â October 2003, just a few days ago.
The Council will have to look into the scope of the new proposal.
Commission Vice-President, MrsÂ deÂ Palacio, explained the proposal to the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on 9Â October 2003.
The Council gave a mandate to its bodies, having only just received the proposal from the Commission, to begin the relevant work to adopt a political decision on this matter as soon as possible.
The Italian Presidency considers the enhancement of the trans-European networks to be a priority; the objectives include adopting the aforementioned proposal and looking into other possible sources of funding for these networks.
The last meeting of the European Council led to a call for proposals to be finalised seeking to eliminate technical, legal and administrative barriers to trans-European networks, in particular with regard to cross-border sections, public private partnerships (PPPs) and innovation, research and development projects.
The Commission will therefore clarify the principles on national accounting treatment of PPPs to ensure increased transparency, including the registration of government guarantees in national accounts and securitisation.
Furthermore, the European Council invited the Commission and the EIB to present final reports on the Growth Initiative, in particular to develop better coordination of procedures between EIB financing, the Structural Funds, the trans-European networksâ budget line and the Sixth Framework Programme.
Â Â  I would like to inform you that MrÂ Frattini must leave at 7 p.m. on the dot and Mr Ebner, Mr Crowley and Mr RÃŒbig, as well as the two Members tabling questions, have asked me for the floor.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I tabled the question before the Commission adopted its proposal on the trans-European networks, but it was motivated by a very timely proposal by the Italian Presidency, which appears to be producing results, both in the Council's approval of its proposal, and also the incorporation of transport to the island of Sicily, which is a recognition of the special nature of island regions.
The President-in-Office of the Council has stressed the special nature of the outermost regions, based on Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, but, on seeing the projects approved by the Commission, I note that there is only one which could involve the outermost regions, and that is the one relating to sea motorways.
They could perhaps also be included in the project on telecommunications networks, but what is striking about this report is that it does not contain the least reference to this type of region, and the European Union's experience demonstrates that, if there is no specific reference in these projects to the outermost regions, it is probable that the strengthening of continental communications networks will in no way benefit these regions.
I would therefore call on the Presidency of the Council, in accordance with the comments it has itself made, to ensure that the Council takes account of their special situation.
Â Â  Like Mr Medina Ortega, I also want to say that not enough is being done in favour of ultraperipheral regions.
In Ireland, for example, the network into and out of Ireland is often considered sufficient, but the west of Ireland is even more peripheral and remote, and this problem is not addressed by the Commission's present policy.
There is no railway line connecting the regions in the west of Ireland â all networks lead to Dublin, which is not peripheral.
There is already a rail link in place in the west, but it is not used as a result of the fact that the policy is not strong enough to put in place such a network in the peripheral regions of the west of Ireland.
Â Â  I feel obliged to remind you that this is a time for supplementary questions, not statements or explanations about why a question has been presented, because this afternoon the same issue is arising.
I would ask you to read the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  I would like to ask MrÂ Frattini whether, when referring to less favoured areas, this should not only be understood to be the outermost regions but also mountainous regions, because these, too, are penalised for geographical reasons.
Â Â  I am happy to answer MrÂ Ebnerâs last question, although, of course, I have also taken note of the other comments that I have heard.
I would like to say to MrÂ Ebner that the Presidency recognises the importance of giving particular emphasis to mountainous regions, in so far as we received, when drawing up the draft constitutional Treaty itself, some proposals which seek precisely to recognise the specific nature of mountain regions.
These proposals are some of the few that the Presidency has agreed to discuss, and they have, therefore, been added to the agenda for debate that is to take place shortly at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs.
I must say, therefore, that we recognise the serious nature of this issue.
Â Â  President-in-Office, in your response to the original questions you stated that work was to be undertaken to look at the technical, legal and administrative barriers with regard to the trans-European networks.
In particular, you mentioned two things: the public/private partnerships with regard to financing and also how the record of government guarantees is registered.
We have already come across situations where public/private partnerships are included in the government borrowing requirement, which puts them inside the Stability and Growth Pact, affecting the government borrowing requirement.
Surely this is a mistake, as we are investing in infrastructure that is essential for economic growth to create a stronger economy and a stable growth environment.
Do you have specific proposals with regard to the public/private partnerships and how they can be utilised outside of the Stability and Growth Pact to benefit trans-European networks?
Â Â  I can say, MrÂ Crowley, that this is a subject that is obviously being studied.
As you mentioned, we included this clear reference in the decision of the recent European Council last week, and, clearly, we are in the process of looking into how to make this mechanism compatible with the Stability Pact, which is confirmed as a founding principle.
As MrÂ Prodi said this morning, the Commission is carrying out a comprehensive study with a view to the presentation, for the December European Council, of a specific and well-constructed plan, which will also include a recommendation for the immediate launch of the trans-European infrastructure.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would actually be interested to know how things currently stand with the timetable for the TENs.
The financial package is now on the table.
You have announced that the ministers are about to meet.
When will the legal bases actually be created?
Â Â  I can merely respond by saying that we have, of course, set ourselves a goal for the start of the actual programme.
The start of the actual programme including the first appropriation of EURÂ 5Â billion for what are known as the quick-start projects, will be approved by the December European Council.
It is then, therefore, that we will, of course, also have the necessary legal framework.
Â Â  I can say that the Council is certainly aware of the trial and of the imprisonment of five Cuban citizens who have been resident in Florida since 2001 and is also aware of the concerns expressed by representatives of non-governmental organisations regarding the conditions in which they are being detained.
The Council has not discussed the conditions of trial.
As far as the more general stance of the Council and the Commission regarding Cuba is concerned, I would refer the Members who have tabled the questions to the debate that we held in this House at the beginning of September, because the conditions and stance have not changed
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Frattini, for the speed and clarity of your reply.
But, apart from thanking you for the information, the supplementary question I would like to put is as follows: when the sad and reprehensible death sentences â which we also condemn â were passed in Cuba by the Cuban Government and by Cuban courts, everybody criticised and condemned â including the European Council â that action by the Cuban Government; so why, in the situation where families of Cuban prisoners cannot see the prisoners imprisoned in Florida, which is a violation of all human rights, do you not behave in the same way as in the case in March and concern yourselves with human rights, whoever is suffering these deprivations and violations of human rights?
Â Â  MrÂ Marset Campos, I can only say that I am not expressingÂ âÂ and I do not intend to express my personal opinion here.
I can confirm that the Council, although aware of the situation, decided not to examine or address the conditions or the situation relating to this trial.
This is how things stand.
On the other hand, however, as regards the violation of human rights and the sentences that have been inflicted by the Cuban Government, the European Union has, as you are aware, expressed a specific position unanimously and with the support of Parliament.
This is the state of affairs.
I will, of course, make a note of your concerns and the measures that you have called for, which I will, of course, forward as you worded them.
Â Â  We learn that the Council knows about but has not examined the conditions of the trial.
We also know that the Council has been paying special attention to the fact that the Cuban courts have sentenced about 70 United States agents.
What will the President-in-Office reply if he is accused, not him but the Council, because he is replying on behalf of the Council, of unbridled hypocrisy, of having two sets of weights and measures and of the fact that the European Union outdoes the United States in its aggression towards socialist Cuba?
What will he reply if someone accuses the Council of what we openly accuse the European Union of?
Â Â  Mr Frattini, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure I am going to give the floor to the three people; three minutes and then we will end the sitting.
Â Â  My colleague MrÂ Alyssandrakis has raised the issue.
I have no further question; I am satisfied with this.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, the question I would like to ask you is this: I had occasion to speak to the mother of one of the prisoners and the wife of another.
Both women had been denied permission to visit these men.
The prisoners are allowed no contact with their families.
I would ask you, is this not a violation of the Convention on Human Rights, in your opinion?
Do you not feel that the European Union and the Council are currently applying double standards?
I believe it is time to take up a clear position condemning this aspect of the policy of this United States administration.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask whether human rights are universal or whether they only apply to certain countries.
Â Â  As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 17 to 33 will be replied to in writing (1).
That concludes Question Time to the Council
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0351/2003) by MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on peace and dignity in the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would first of all like to express my pleasure and thank all the Members who have joined me in making an effort to achieve the consensus in this report, a report with the significant title of âPeace and Dignity in the Middle Eastâ.
Unfortunately we are far from peace, and humiliation â rather than dignity â is the order of the day in the troubled lands of Israel and Palestine.
However, the report we are discussing expresses the aspiration, in its letter and its spirit, that more and more voices, more and more consciences, should be raised here and over there in favour of this twin objective: dignity and peace, to which we can and must add stability for the region and prosperity for its peoples.
It is true, as the report indicates, that it has not been possible to establish a climate of mutual trust between the parties and that recently the enemies of peace have placed obstacles and raised pretexts in the aim of making the Roadmap unworkable, but our duty is to continue trying to achieve it in the immediate, in the medium term and in the long term.
Hence the report â at risk of being accused of utopianism â calls on the governments of both parties and those of all the countries in the Middle East to implement a new educational policy based on the notion of education for peace and geared towards promoting mutual tolerance and understanding between the different cultures and religions.
While this is being achieved, however, we must confront the inescapable reality of the situation, and we do so condemning the terrorist violence of Palestinian factions, as well the Israelisâ use of excessive military force against the Palestinian people.
Regrettably, the latter consideration is particularly timely at the moment and, I would insist, this is regrettable.
As stated in the editorial of the Israeli daily newspaper â and I quote, âon Monday, while Sharon was giving an empty speech, lacking any realistic political vision, Israeli helicopters were bombing Gaza, hitting several terrorists, but also killing and injuring many innocent Palestinian civiliansâ; an odious practice which is not isolated and which, writes , âthe Israeli army has shown that it is going to pursueâ.
Something, in my view, which leads the editorial writer â a clear product of a democratic society such as Israeli society â to advise the Israeli Government and army that, âthey must not, through this policy, undermine the ethical standards which Israel has adopted over the years.
If this were the case, Israeli society would become seriously divided, since public opinion would stop trusting in their political and military leadersâ.
Actually, in that speech on Monday, the Israeli Prime Minister claimed before the Knesset to be an ardent advocate of the Roadmap. Though with the 14 amendments presented not to the Quartet, but, unofficially, to the US administration.
Apparently alarmed by the resonance of the so-called Geneva Accord, the peace initiative produced as a result of joint Israeli-Palestinian efforts, Sharon has stated that the Roadmap is the only hope of making progress towards peace with Palestinians.
Well, it is time for work.
We will rejoice with him if it makes genuine progress.
For the moment, however, we will be satisfied if he complies with what the report â on the basis of a consensus â requests from him in paragraph 2: the withdrawal of his army from the autonomous Palestinian territories, an end to selective assassinations and the freezing of all colonisation and of the construction of the security wall.
âThere is no need to sleep to have nightmaresâ, said a slogan painted on the Berlin Wall.
Fourteen years after its destruction, another wall is causing nightmares in Palestine.
And while Sharon, in his speech on Monday, said that he had ordered that the wall be speeded up, last night, in the United Nations General Assembly, 144 governments voted to call on Israel to stop it and to backtrack on a construction which the whole planet â apart from Israel and the United States, who voted against â considers a violation of international law.
The report deals with various burning issues.
For example, on the basis of the necessary constitution of a viable and democratic Palestinian State, it calls on the Palestinian authorities to deal realistically with the so-called right of return for the refugees, so that a realistic solution can be agreed.
Even so, as a European, I would insist â and I will end here â that I naturally entirely support the Roadmap, but the report recommends that, in the event that this Roadmap is deadlocked in the immediate future, and in view of the grave consequences that would have, causing greater suffering for Israelis and Palestinians, new options be provided for, in particular, the establishment of an international mandate under the authority of the Quartet in Palestine, which may even include an international force on the ground.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr Patten had to fly to Madrid to the Iraq Donors' Conference, so I present the Commission's opinion.
I would like to congratulate Mr MenÃ©ndez on this very comprehensive report on the situation in the Middle East.
I would also like to congratulate him for showing a great deal of diligence and diplomacy in bringing diverging opinions together, while still offering us a report that is full of substance.
When the honourable Member started work on the 'Peace and Dignity' report there was hope that the Road Map would be the way out of the misery that has gripped the Middle East for such a long time.
Today, several months later, much of that hope seems to be gone.
Despite the recent setbacks, we must look for a way forward and explore solutions that will lead to an improvement of the situation.
Resignation and failure are not options, for the sake of our neighbours, our partners and all people in the region.
The two-state solution is still the most widely accepted solution.
The Road Map shows us the way, but what we need is the political determination from the parties and the international community to find that way forward.
Many are trying to explore innovative solutions for solving the hard questions, like refugees and Jerusalem first.
A group of Palestinians and Israelis have done just that.
Many of us have had a chance today to hear from the experience of these people.
The Geneva Accords prove that difficult issues can be discussed and resolved, as painful as they may look for either side.
But beyond this, the Geneva Accords prove that there are still admirable people from both sides of the conflict who, in the middle of the current tragedy and chaos, have kept their will and courage to look for positive and peaceful alternatives.
There are other initiatives which deserve similar praise, such as the citizens campaign of Mr Nusseibeh and A. Ayalon who presented their ideas to this house only a few weeks ago and have now attracted more than 80 000 signatures.
The MenÃ©ndez report is totally correct in pointing out that any peace plan depends on the political will and honest commitment of the parties.
And that commitment seems to be lacking.
Is the current Israeli Government ready to accept the two-state solution, with Palestine being a real viable State?
Are the Palestinians ready and capable to exercise governmental functions in all areas, including security?
Palestinians must take effective control, undertake visible and effective steps against those conducting and planning violent attacks on Israelis, and publicly reconfirm the right of existence of Israel.
It is equally important to press ahead with the preparation of elections, the constitution and civil society involvement in reform.
Security concerns are given as a reason for the separation barrier deep in the West Bank.
But if completed as currently projected in official documents and media speculation, Palestinians would be living in several enclaves which are not connected and are isolated from the outside world.
Moreover, the projected route would involve cutting off a large number of Palestinians from their schools, hospitals and other services â and even their livelihoods.
It is not too late for Israel to change this.
And only yesterday, even some ministers in the Israeli Government criticised the deaths of innocent civilians during the recent Israeli military operations in Gaza, one of the heaviest air strikes for months.
Israel really must address these widely expressed concerns.
The report addressed the Commission directly on several issues.
Let me briefly go through them.
Paragraph 31 refers to future elections in Palestine.
The Commission has already made funds available to the independent Central Elections Commission.
Preparatory work for elections could start in the coming weeks.
The Palestinian Prime Minister is planning to hold elections in June next year.
We are prepared to start voter registration as early as next month.
But the present restrictions on movement, the cutting off of one community from another, would make the preparation of elections and an election campaign itself well nigh impossible.
In paragraph 38, the report calls for an assessment of economic and financial needs.
The Palestinian Authority is working on a strategy for economic stabilisation and recovery.
An international donor conference for the Middle East is scheduled to take place in mid-November.
We will also have the opportunity to discuss with the World Bank and the IMF the prospects for financial assistance on the basis of the Palestinian budget for 2004.
The Community this year is contributing about EUR 245Â million to the Palestinians, either through support of the Palestinian Authority or UNRWA and NGOs.
It is the highest per capita support in the world and it is based on the assumption that a viable Palestinian state is in the making and deserves our assistance.
Clearly, our help is vital for humanitarian reasons and for attaining a bare minimum of economic activity.
It has also helped to create some of the institutional foundations of a Palestinian state.
But we need to be clear that, if the situation continues to deteriorate, we are not simply funding the Israeli Defence Force's occupation of the Palestinian territories.
Paragraph 40 speaks about schoolbooks.
The Commission is not directly involved in this issue.
But we have met with a variety of parties concerned in order to facilitate dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis.
We have also raised the issue in the EU-PLO Joint Committee meeting in June and will observe closely PA endeavours to curb incitement.
In this context, let me mention that the latest call for proposals of projects under the EU Partnership for Peace focuses on initiatives to curb violence and incitement to violence.
The next paragraph rightly states that education for peace is one of the cornerstones on the way to a peaceful solution of the conflict.
The extension of TEMPUS to the Palestinian territories and the signature of the scientific agreement with Israel, granting it the same status as EU Member States, are but two examples of our support to this concept.
Regarding the international fund mentioned in paragraph 59, I should like to mention that the international community has been making contributions at the rate of about EUR 1 billion a year for the last three years.
World Bank reports keep stating that even if this contribution were to be doubled the impact would be minimal.
Only an improvement of the security situation and re-establishing freedom of movement would significantly improve the situation.
I agree with paragraph 64 that MEDA regional programmes should be fully used to exploit the potential benefits of regional and cross-border cooperation for the peace process.
Discussions in the context of the Wider Europe initiative will take this aspect into account.
Peace, dignity and security are indeed the foundation for a better future in the Middle East.
We must all work to that end.
It is in the interests of our partners but equally in ours.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle for the good cooperation on this report.
This is an issue that could even split the House, for if everyoneâs motion were to be included, diametrically opposing positions would be established.
We will continue to present these positions in our articles and speeches and so forth, but, in this situation, where peace and dignity in the Middle East are essential, it is important for this House to make a contribution with a report that does justice to the great value of peace and dignity.
In my view, the Middle East conflict is a conflict of missed opportunities, starting in 1947/48 after the United Nationsâ partition plan, continuing with the non-creation of a Palestinian state under Jordanian occupation in 1967, and carrying on with what could have been achieved under President Clinton just before 2000, namely the project which the then Prime Minister Barak was attempting to initiate with his Palestinian partners and which subsequently failed.
I therefore believe that the objective â the entire processâs ultimate destination â is clear to everyone: there will be a Palestinian state, the Israelis will have to withdraw from the occupied territories, and the two nations will have to live together in peace, just as the Germans and the French also had to learn to do after centuries of warfare.
The question is: How many victims must there be before that happens?
That is why I see the present situation as an outcome of the Intifada which began in 2000, when suddenly, people no longer relied on the talks which had been promised by both sides in Oslo and to which the European Union has now contributed billions of euros in support.
Instead, they thought that recourse to violence would enable them to move closer to the objective I have outlined.
Then, too, society changes in a process that you have described.
Israeli society is more right-wing today than it was a few years ago.
Many people who were active in the peace movement, who held illegal meetings with Arafat in the 1980s and 1990s and were threatened with criminal proceedings, now tell us that they do not want to talk to him any more, that they no longer trust him, because every week a bomb explodes in an Israeli city.
I imagine that our societies would change too if suicide bombings occurred in Rome, Madrid, Brussels or Berlin on a daily basis.
I expect that our societies, too, would become right-wing and reactionary in such a scenario.
So we must ask ourselves what is the way out of this situation.
The Road Map, involving collaboration between the Quartet â the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia â is absolutely the right approach.
Everyone must see that we cannot be divided on this issue, and that we intend to continue our support for this process. In this respect, I believe we are a step further forward, in that we have become more demanding, with the Council, too, now saying that the political wing of Hamas is a terrorist organisation, and in that we are speaking out clearly, also about the security fence and the way in which it alters territories.
Yes, we have now become more demanding. I hope that we can involve the region as a whole, and that Syria and Iran and indeed everyone who has funded terrorism for so many years will now recognise that they must work for peace if they want to be the European Unionâs partners.
This report, in my view, makes important suggestions that help contribute to this process.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate our colleague, MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle on his excellent report, which has won broad consensus.
His suggestions and recommendations are entirely to the point.
If they were implemented immediately, they would bring instant peace to the long-suffering people of Israel and Palestine.
We are all familiar with the obstacles to peace.
One amendment, which was rejected in committee, calls PresidentÂ Arafat an obstacle; I would have been tempted to vote in favour of that amendment if its author had treated Arafat and Sharon in the same way, and I would have given it my full support if it had stated that the Bush-Sharon relationship is currently making sure that the deadly status quo and the stagnation in the Middle East remain in place.
As a result of this stagnation, the two peoples are becoming a little more entrenched every day in this murderous folly and in poverty.
Avraham Burg, the former Speaker of the Knesset whom we have received and applauded in this very House, accuses MrÂ Sharon of killing the Israeli nation by destroying its values.
Today, he says, âwe are a State that is building settlements under the leadership of a corrupt clique, which thumbs its nose at the wishes of the people and at the lawâ.
Indeed, occupation, segregation, blockades, humiliation, targeted murders, houses being bulldozed and the wall are merely the visible signs of a deep-felt contempt and the failure to acknowledge a Palestinian national identity.
âEven if 1Â 000 terrorists were killed every day, nothing would changeâ continues AvrahamÂ Burg.
Should we not, then, MrÂ President, start by ensuring that international law is respected?
It is now being flouted quite openly and Israel will have to accept unilaterally to withdraw its army from the occupied territories and to dismantle illegal settlements.
Accepting this would give the Palestinian people some political hope, would strengthen the power of its leaders and would enable them to wipe out extremism and terrorism.
There is certainly an alternative to MrÂ Sharonâs policy and this alternative is being advocated, in Israel, by members of the left and of civil society grouped around YossiÂ Beilin, AvrahamÂ Burg, Ami Ayalon and Amram Mitzna.
We must hope that the European Union, unlike the United States, openly supports their initiative, which is the only thing capable of stopping the current process of demolition.
The Union will have a good opportunity to do so, on 4Â November, when supporters of peace sign the Geneva Agreement.
The fourth of November, I must remind you, is the anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
Why should the President-in-Office of the Council not go to Tel-Aviv and to Ramallah with Mr Powell, with Kofi Annan and MrÂ Ivanov, returning only once the mission has been accomplished, in other words, once they have successfully ensured the irreversible and irrevocable implementation of the Road map?
Go into the midst of activity and take this initiative in order to generate this shock, of which Messrs Poettering, BaronÂ Crespo and Cohn-Bendit spoke here on 9Â October, each in their own way.
The European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia each have the means of making both sides listen to reason.
They have already used these means, moreover, and have a duty to use them now, before the entire Middle East is torn apart.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, a few days ago, on 16 October, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, MahathirÂ Mohamed, at the Summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, stated that the Jews control the world by proxy.
An important French newspaper stated that, in the name of anti-Zionism, proclaimed far from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, anti-Semitism is re-remerging in a new normalised form.
The Middle East conflict, however, is not unrelated to all these problems and we are all concerned about this conflict and this problem.
We are now dealing with a report on peace and dignity in the Middle East.
The report has been produced by the rapporteur, Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle, who has made, I believe, a considerable effort which we are grateful for, although I do not agree with some of his conclusions.
This afternoon, we have had the opportunity to hear two figures from the region: Naomi Chazan, an Israeli, and JamalÂ Zaqoud, of the Palestinian National Council, who, after the Dead Sea talks, wish to present what is known as the Geneva Accord.
They are excellent people â there are excellent people on both sides â their will is excellent, but, naturally, in both cases they are currently far from the political powers, which in reality are the people who govern the destinies of Israel and Palestine.
I said that this report has been produced with difficulty, because the first document was dated 21Â May and the Commissionâs agreement did not arrive until 9 October.
Almost five months have passed and, over these five months, too many things have happened in those countries.
It is a report which relates to the first phase of the Roadmap and I believe it is positive that Parliament should give its opinion on it, because it is the only direction.
It also talks about education for peace, which is necessary at all times.
Where I disagree with the report, however, is the second part, in which it wishes to propose what the second and third phase of this application will be.
I believe it is premature at the moment to define a series of issues which will certainly be problematic: what must the final borders be, what must the policy on refugees be, what must be done in Jerusalem.
I believe â sincerely â that it is premature to talk about it at the moment.
The priority now is to ensure that the deaths in that region come to an end.
I believe â and I regret â that this report will not make a real contribution to the peace process, because it will not be accepted equally by the conflicting parties and, in this regard, the European Union will not increase its prestige and its moral authority in the region, which is so necessary at the moment.
Â Â  Mr President, our Group, the European United Left â Nordic Green Left, fully supports the report by MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle and we take a very positive view of the effort made and the various suggestions provided by the different political groups in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy; we therefore believe that Members like these are needed in the European Parliament.
The European Union now needs to make its voice heard in relation to the conflict which has the greatest effect on our current and future stability.
We have seen the complete failure of the Sharon approach, supported by the United States, which consists of using violence as much as possible in the form of state terrorism, which puts him on the same condemnable level as the Palestinian suicide groups.
We in Spain, where we suffer the murderous terrorism of ETA, once fell into the temptation of employing state terrorism and that led to more violence and even a degree of moral legitimacy for the terrorists, and we therefore had to return to the path of respect for the Rule of Law, which is much more effective and dignified.
The current spiral of violence gives credibility to both the Roadmap and the initiative of 4 November, in Geneva, of a determined and courageous group of Israelis and Palestinians who are not resigned to the situation, who know that all violence, on either side, represents failure for everybody, and who represent the hope that the only solution applied to the Roadmap is the existence of two States: Israel, a homeland for the Jews, and Palestine, a homeland for the Palestinians.
Respect on the part of one people for another and vice versa, the recognition of the rights of refugees, Jerusalem as a dual capital for both States, an end to the unjust occupation of Palestine by Israel, ending and dismantling the Israeli settlements and, above all, removing the wall of shame which is so reminiscent of the ghettos, all of this with respect for international law and the UN, which incidentally sponsored the creation of the State of Israel.
Â Â  MrÂ President, like MrÂ Poos, I have read Abraham Burgâs article, also published in Sweden, in which Mr Burg says that the nation of Israel is based upon corruption and oppression.
He says that a state without justice that crushes the Palestinian majority under its boot cannot be regarded as the only democracy in the Middle East.
Mr Burg is now appealing to Israelâs friends to intervene.
It is high time we stopped treating Israel as a normal democracy, because it is an occupying power and state that is in breach of international law.
We must intervene very much more forcefully.
We must of course give our support to the Beilin-Abed-Rabbo initiative and use the resources at our disposal.
Parliament has on several occasions requested us to suspend the association agreement.
Why does Commissioner Liikanen not address this issue?
He lists many good things the EU has done to strengthen the Palestinian Authority, but we must resort to more forceful methods.
Obviously, we condemn the violence, but violence in the form of violent resistance to occupation is in actual fact permitted under international law.
My country has avoided occupation, but many of the rest of you live in countries in which people have risen up in resistance to occupation.
We want violence to be avoided and are opposed to all forms of violence.
The violence of resistance and that of oppression cannot, however, be directly compared with one another because they are two different things.
The Israeli violence is the violence of oppression and occupation, and is unlawful.
That is why we must intervene.
We are now in the process of developing a military capacity in the EU.
