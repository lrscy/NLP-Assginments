Â Â  Mr President, for several months we have been hearing very worrying news from Sudan, specifically from Darfur.
We are facing a crisis with no foreseeable outcome, that some people have described as genocide, and which has led to thousands of deaths and hundreds and thousands of displaced persons, within a context of horrendous violations of human rights and an enormous humanitarian disaster.
One of the most recent pieces of news we have received relates to the arrest of two officials of MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres, a Briton, Mr Foreman, and a Dutchman, Mr Hoedt, accused of espionage and spreading false information.
In particular, the supposedly false report notes more than 500 cases of rapes of women in Darfur.
I believe that the report is important; the credibility and solvency of MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres organisation are proven and for all of these reasons Parliament has the duty to take action to defend these two officials of that organisation.
On behalf of several colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would call for action, perhaps a letter from the President to the Sudanese authorities expressing Parliamentâs concern about the events being condemned and calling for the release of Mr Foreman and Mr Hoedt without charge.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in view of the huge influx of honey into the EU from third countries, and given the alarming reports from consumers about the poor quality of this honey, I believe that protective measures need to be taken.
Unless this happens, the problems currently experienced by the beekeeping industry will be exacerbated.
It should be noted that there has been a drop of almost 40% in Europeâs bee population over recent years.
In Germany, for example, numbers have dropped by 33% over the past 15Â years, and in Poland by 40% over the past 20Â years.
Bees are not only important in terms of honey and other bee products.
They help maintain a balance in nature and increase the efficiency of food production, as well as playing an essential role in environmental preservation.
In view of the above, it is my opinion that the European Commission should, as a matter of urgency, present the House with proposals for measures to be taken in this respect.
The aim of these measures should be to protect not only the market in honey and bee products, but also bees and the future of beekeeping.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like publicly to thank Mr Poettering, the chairman of our parliamentary group, for his proposal that we discuss the situation in the European Union in detail today, together with progress with the ratification of the European Constitution.
I wish to thank him because this satisfied an initiative on my part to have this debate.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank my honourable friends who signed â and thus gave real support to â this initiative.
The European Parliament cannot merely react.
It must also act.
Certainly the situation in the European Union today is a matter for the democratically elected governments; however, it is also a matter for the democratically elected institution , the European Parliament.
It is a minimal indication of democratic responsibility towards the civil society of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, for the last two years the British Government has funded âOperation Scrap-itâ with GBPÂ 7Â million â EURÂ 11Â million â a year given to London boroughs to cope with the End of Life Vehicles Directive.
This programme provides a fast, London-wide removal service for abandoned cars, removing around 75Â 000 a year from London streets.
The scheme has saved many neighbourhoods from the blight of scrapped and burnt-out vehicles littering and polluting the environment, making a real difference to the quality of citizensâ lives.
However, to coincide with World Environment Day yesterday, the UK Government made known that this funding would end in September.
This would not be so bad if our government made manufacturers liable from that date, as it has the possibility to do under the directive, before manufacturersâ liability becomes mandatory in January 2007.
The government has not done that, putting corporate profits before a sustainable environment.
Through you, therefore, Mr President, I appeal to the British Government to prolong the funding of âOperation Scrap-itâ to stop an environmental crisis in London.
Â Â  â Mr President, according to confirmed reports, a meeting of neo-Nazi and fascist organisations from Greece, Italy, Spain and other countries of Central Europe and the USA is scheduled to take place from 16 to 18 September 2005, in the Meligala region in the prefecture of Messinia in the Peloponnese.
This meeting will pose a challenge to the democratic authorities and sensibilities of the Greek people and of all the peoples of Europe.
Especially today, when these forces are using the European Constitution as a pretext for undermining the values and principles on which we have built common, peaceful and democratic cohabitation and brotherhood in Europe.
The Greek Government should immediately ban this anti-democratic meeting.
This call should also be supported by the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to seize this opportunity to draw your attention again to a problem that I regret to say is still present, that being subsidies for the export of live animals.
Ever since export subsidies for the transportation of live animals were introduced in 1989, this House has on many occasions voted in favour of their removal from the EU budget.
Although the animalsâ torments, particularly on journeys over long distances, and the resulting disadvantages for consumers, are a matter of general knowledge, their transportation continues to be subsidised to the tune of EURÂ 41 million in 2001, EURÂ 57 million in 2002, EURÂ 67 million in 2003, and now the figure has reached EURÂ 77 million per annum.
Giving subsidies in this manner amounts to promoting extreme suffering for animals, and we should therefore surely reject it.

I wish therefore to call upon the Members of this House to endorse this statement, and would advise the ladies and gentlemen currently engaged in negotiating the EUâs budget that the abolition of these subsidies would remove several hundred million euros from the budget, and to do so would be surely to give it some justified relief.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 25 Heads of State or Government signed the European Constitutional Treaty, as did 25 foreign ministers, and 10 Member States have ratified it.
This House adopted it by the two-thirds constitutional majority.
Most of Europeâs citizens have already said yes to this Constitution.
I would ask you, Mr President, to issue a press release making it clear that we will not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by opponents of the EU, disinformation merchants, those who play the blame game or rabble-rousers, and that this Constitution reinforces the publicâs fundamental rights, strengthening Parliament, and, through Parliament, the citizens, democracy and transparency.
I would ask you, Mr President, to inform all the Heads of State or Government that it is because we do not want to interrupt the constitution-making process that the European Parliament is opposed to self-willed decisions appealing to popular national sentiment and premature statements by Heads of Government â such as the one made today by Tony Blair.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Constitution is dead.
The French killed it, the Dutch put it in the coffin and now the lid is on.
But, like Count Dracula, EU treaties have a nasty habit of coming back to life.
The Constitution needs a stake through its heart.
That stake could be administered by means of a British referendum, which would deliver a resounding ânoâ.
It now seems, however, that the British Government will deny the British people that opportunity.
Instead of a stake there might be an even more deadly termination, in the form of a silver bullet.
That silver bullet will take the form of the disintegration of the European single currency.
The eurozone is already starting to show signs of fraying at the edges.
The break-up of the European single currency, which is only a matter of time, will kill political and economic integration stone dead once and for all.
Â Â  Mr President, it is nice to see our loony friends are in the Chamber with us today.
Despite recent major jolts to the EU project, we still have some fairly substantial work in progress, not least the Lisbon Strategy.
I would like, therefore, to continue my mission to name and shame Member States that have not implemented some of the Lisbon directives.
The European Parliament has passed 83Â Lisbon directives.
Sixty-three should have been implemented; only ten have been fully implemented by all Member States.
The European company statute directive should have been implemented by 18Â October 2004, but the following countries have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing this directive: Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia.
Mr President, would you write to those Member States and ask them when they intend to implement the directive?
Â Â  â Mr President, between the two part-sessions, we had a thunderous from both France and the Netherlands.
However, the 'no' to the European Constitution was not also a 'no' to Europe.
We must listen to the European people.
In the European Parliament, 62% of the French members voted .
However, 55% of the French people voted .
Here, 82% of the Dutch members voted . However, 62% of the Dutch people voted .
What is happening?
Why are governments saying yes and the people are saying no?
The people know a few facts.
They know about unemployment, inflation and the invasion of Chinese products.
They know about everything that we arrange behind their backs.
We let Turkey in without asking them and illegal immigration is out of control.
We need to pay closer attention to the people.
If we ask the people, if we sing from the same hymn sheet as the people, then Europe too will progress.
Europe without the people cannot progress and the bureaucrats in Brussels need to understand that.
Greater attention to the people and more respect for the people.
Â Â  The 700 000 or so lorries that drive through Slovenia into Italy every year, must, on crossing the border, use the special lanes through the Italian customs posts at the cities of Trieste and Gorizia.
Although lorries in transit travel unladen and require no customs services, they have to use the same special lanes as they did prior to Sloveniaâs accession to the European Union, and have to pay a road toll.
If they do not pay the toll, they are stopped and prevented from continuing their journey.
I suspect that the underlying reason for the use of this system in Italy is that following Sloveniaâs accession to the EU, the volume of customs services in connection with transit goods haulage has been halved.
The unjustified charging of a road toll is the financial compensation.
Yet this medieval-type tax seriously violates the principle of free flow of goods and persons within the EU and constitutes an inadmissible precedent.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, today I should like to alert the House to a matter that has outraged public opinion in my country for many weeks.
I refer to the Lukashenko regimeâs persecution of the newly-elected leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus.
Violations of fundamental human rights in Belarus are something to which we have been accustomed for many years.
I need only mention the fact that two leaders of the democratic opposition, Nikolai Statkevich and Pavel Severinets, were sentenced a few days ago to three years in a forced labour camp for organising anti-government demonstrations.
Nevertheless, the recent attacks on the Polish minority organisation deserve to be singled out for particular criticism by the EU authorities.
I would remind the House that although new leaders were elected at the March congress of the Union of Poles in Belarus, the Belarussian Ministry of Justice not only refused to recognise these elections, but also threatened to outlaw the organisation entirely.
What is more, the publication of , the countryâs only Polish-language newspaper, has been suspended, and a Polish diplomat has been expelled from the country.
These facts give a full insight into the persecution suffered by Poles in Belarus.
The drastic measures to which the Belarussian authorities have recently resorted are a clear indication of the fact that they fear their country will experience a repeat of the democratic revolution seen in Ukraine.
I hope that their worst fears come true, but the European Union must pursue a more proactive policy to ensure that this happens.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a question for you.
You will be aware that over the last few part-sessions in Strasbourg there have been any number of serious problems with flights to and from Strasbourg airport.
You are not listening but never mind, I shall carry on.
Strikes, diversions, cancellations and all sorts of other reasons have meant that MEPs have been seriously delayed or diverted.
As the City of Strasbourg and the French aviation authorities seem incapable of providing a consistent or reliable service to this great city, and in view of the clear wish of both Members of the European Parliament and the peoples of Europe that we do not waste any more of their money, is it not time seriously to consider once and for all the future of the monthly plenary sessions held in Strasbourg?
This afternoon I am asking you personally what your proposals for action in this field are, both in the short term and in the long term, or is it perhaps a question you prefer to avoid?
Â Â  I believe that the Treaty should be respected in every respect.
The rules in force establish where and how this Parliament should meet and our obligation is to comply with the rules in force, which say what they say about where the European Parliament should meet.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to correct what Mr Leichtfried has said.
I, too, am opposed to the transport of live animals for slaughter, but this statement makes no distinction between animals for slaughter and animals for breeding and production, the latter of which must be exported alive and really are economically significant to Europeâs farmers.
If we subscribe to the statement as it stands, something like half of Europeâs breeding cattle would be affected, and that would represent another major blow to Europeâs farmers, on top of the general economic stress.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not want to give the impression that I am anything other than an advocate of a peaceful and united Europe, but I do believe that, after the votes in France and the Netherlands, we cannot simply go on with business as usual.
Nor can it be said that over half Europeâs citizens have already cast their votes in favour.
To do so is simply wrong; in Germany, it was fewer than 600 members of parliament who voted in favour, while over 80 million citizens were not asked their opinion.
Last week, a major German daily newspaper polled its readership.
Of the almost 380Â 000 readers who took part, 96% were opposed to the Constitution.
I do not believe that the blame lies with the French and Dutch voters who voted against the Constitution, but rather with the Members of this House who voted to start accession negotiations with Turkey and in favour of the early accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
That is what we need to be talking about.
Â Â  Mr President, in the light of the Constitutional referenda, I would hope that at last, in this House, there might be some recognition that the EU project is seriously flawed and heading in the wrong direction.
However, that is not the point I want to draw attention to.
Another Member has already mentioned the G-8 summit, which is going to take place in Edinburgh, and also the Live-8 campaign, which is seeking debt relief, trade justice and increased aid for Africa.
However, financial measures alone cannot solve Africaâs problems.
If we are going to bring about real change for the better in Africa, this must be accompanied by action to ensure that good governance is practised, the rule of law upheld and human rights respected.
I look at the case of Zimbabwe, where in March Mugabe had another sham election and where, at this moment, he is involved in clearance of urban areas inhabited mainly by opposition supporters, whom he is ruthlessly suppressing.
The international community is doing nothing about this.
The Council said that it would review sanctions in the light of the elections that took place in Zimbabwe.
Nothing has happened.
I call upon the Council and the Commission to take robust action against Mugabe and similar dictators who are abusing the oppressed people of Africa.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Anne Laperrouze, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decisions No 96/391/EC and No 1229/2003/EC (COM(2003)0742 â C5-0064/2004 â 2003/0297(COD)) (A6-0134/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, for having taken over this proposal on the guidelines for trans-European energy networks and for having carried out a focused analysis in her report which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I would like in particular to express my gratitude for her commitment, together with that of the shadow rapporteurs, in aiming for an agreement at first reading which, I very much regret, has not been achieved.
Let me recall on this occasion the objectives of the proposal.
The challenge of the proposal is to build a legal instrument that will be efficient in delivering the necessary energy transmission infrastructure, while developing the appropriate cooperation with the private sector and the Member States.
The security of energy supply and the functioning of the internal energy market are key policy issues.
These objectives are taken up in the trans-European Energy â TEN-E â guidelines aiming at the installation of an electricity and gas network of truly European character by better linking the fragmented national networks.
Concerning natural gas, there is a strong growth perspective.
The trans-European energy networks policy aims at securing and diversifying additional gas import capacity from sources in Russia, Norway, the Caspian basin region, Northern Africa and the Middle East, and providing the necessary interconnection capacity between Member States.
Concerning the electricity networks, the main function is to create and foster a real European electricity market.
For this objective, sufficient interconnection capacity between Member States is essential.
Since the adoption of the existing guidelines for trans-European energy networks in June 2003, the need has arisen fully to integrate the new Member States and candidate countries in these guidelines and further to adapt those guidelines to the new European Neighbourhood policy.
The revision of the TEN-E guidelines proposed by the Commission in December 2003 should be seen as a complement to and an improvement on the existing guidelines.
It aims at explicitly incorporating the ten new Member States into the priority projects, as well as the incorporation of essential energy connections with third countries.
As to the choice of the projects, we have proposed to introduce a top-down approach, identifying the projects of highest priority on the priority axes from the larger family of projects of common interest.
The projects of European interest are those of highest priority.
They have the objective of supporting the rapid implementation of the most important cross-border interconnection capacity.
To achieve this aim, the projects of European interest need to comply with special criteria.
They must be situated on a priority axis.
They are of a cross-border nature or have significant impact on cross-border transmission capacity.
They must be mature: that means that a firm commitment must exist to start before the end of 2006 and that the projects need to be completed by 2010 at the latest.
Another essential element of our proposal is the European Coordinator.
The European Coordinator will encourage cooperation with users and operators, and promote the projects amongst private investors and financial institutions.
A coordinator may be designated by the Commission and will act in the name of, and on behalf of, the Commission.
I now look forward with great interest to your debate on the proposal.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his kind remarks.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me also express my deepest gratitude to my fellow rapporteurs for their opinions, which have been in my mind throughout my considerations and which have made a considerable contribution to the report that I am presenting today.
I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and the representatives of the Council for their attention and for their answers to the many questions we have raised.
Finally, my thanks go to the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to my assistant for the help that they have given me.
Commissioner, you recalled the objectives of this proposal for a decision.
They are to adapt the guidelines to the shape of the European Union of 25 Member States, to authorise the financing of common-interest projects, to make it possible to create an internal market for gas and electricity and, principally, to ensure that there is security of supply via interconnections between the Member States and with neighbouring countries: south-east Europe, the Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus.
This approach to the trans-European energy networks corresponds, in fact, to the approach taken for the trans-European land transport networks.
A majority of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy supports the new ideas introduced by the European Commission to define the action priorities, particularly the description of projects of European interest located on high-priority routes and the appointment of a European coordinator, provided, however, that this is limited to complex projects that present particularly difficult implementation conditions and that it occurs in consultation with the Member States.
Parliament must also be consulted on the appointment of the coordinator, which is the aim of the amendment proposed by my group.
The report voted for by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy encourages the Member States to cooperate amongst themselves when this is made necessary by the implementation of transnational enquiry procedures taking into account decisive criteria, such as security of supply, the projectâs impact on the environment, the opinion of the inhabitants of the territory concerned, and so on.
On the basis of information provided by the Council, the Committee on Industry felt that the Councilâs recommended approach was consistent and made it possible to simplify the Commissionâs original proposal.
Thus, the report voted for by the Committee on Industry establishes a hierarchy of projects: common-interest projects that form the basis of the trans-European projects are listed in AnnexÂ III and priority projects described as projects of European interest are listed in AnnexÂ I.
The Committee on Industry did not want to call into question the projects established by the Member States, because it felt that it did not have sufficient competence or information to assess the choice of projects.
Nevertheless, following comments made by some of my fellow Members, I would like to ask the European Commission to verify the validity of the projects when this decision is applied.
By way of example, our fellow Members from the Baltic States think that it would be more appropriate to have a gas transport network crossing the Baltic States to supply them, rather than an offshore network in the Baltic.
As another example, the EHT line between France and Spain is giving rise to very forceful protests from the inhabitants of the region.
That is why the financial package allocated to these projects should be increased to EURÂ 60Â million, which would make it possible, for example, to respond better to environmental constraints, which may require more thorough feasibility studies.
It is a matter of validating the projects, of coordinating the procedures for consultation between the Member States, of finding the most appropriate technical solutions.
Before I finish, I would also like to stress the fact that the Committee on Industry views the inclusion of the transport of olefins in this text as justified not only in view of the importance of such networks in Europe for the European chemical industry, but also in view of the gains in terms of safety and the environment that would result from a reduction in road transport.
Besides access to the European Investment Bank, the reference to olefin-related projects guarantees a symbolic European label.
It does not, however, enable these projects to benefit from European subsidies under the budget for trans-European networks.
I think it is also necessary to consider the integration of the trans-European energy networks into the European corridors that have been proposed for the land transport sector.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I would like to thank the Commission and the committee responsible for the work they have accomplished, and it should be emphasised that the directive which we are to discuss today is particularly important in taking the European Unionâs physical integration a stage further.
I would, however, like to draw your attention to a few aspects which might stand in the way of achieving the tasks advanced in the directive.
Thus, creating interconnections in structured supply systems is not always in the interests of those suppliers who dominate in any particular region.
In such cases, investment in interconnections must be assessed from the perspective of medium-term and long-term returns.
This requires market principles to be replaced by long-term planning methods to guarantee security of supply for consumers and environmental protection.
The thinking is similar when an interconnection has to be created in the interests of security of supply, to overcome an inadequacy of production capacity.
In such cases it is not always possible to adhere to market principles, as the time required for recovering the investments may not correspond to the objectives of a participant in the competitive market.
In cases where creating new interconnections is not in the interests of participants in the electricity market, creating network elements may be a public service obligation for system operators.
Therefore, the choice of the priority interconnection elements of trans-European networks which will be created with the financial support of the European Union should not only be a matter for commercial competition between regions and Member States, as appears from the approach offered by the directive.
When making its choice of priority network elements, the European Commission must be guided by the interests of medium-term and long-term security of supply and the creation of the European Union internal market.
The European Parliament ought to retain a supervisory role over this process through the budget procedure.
In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the three Baltic States are totally isolated from the European Unionâs electricity and gas market.
Since Soviet times they have been in a joint electricity supply network with Russia.
This ought to be a priority task, a priority area where interconnections should be created.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Laperrouze and thanking her for her spirit of cooperation during the production of this report.
The importance of this proposal stems from the fact that the development of interconnections is a necessary condition for the creation of a genuine internal market in energy.
Furthermore, the interconnections will provide us with better guarantees for dealing with occasional situations of scarcity of electricity supply.
As has been pointed out, following the informal three-way dialogue with the Council and the Commission, it was not possible to reach an agreement with Parliament at first reading.
We do not agree with the Councilâs desire to eliminate projects of European interest and we support maintaining the categories of project advocated by the rapporteur.
We also support the rapporteurâs amendment that modifies the text relating to the post of European coordinator, maintaining the amendment approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to the effect that the coordinator should be appointed for those projects that raise difficulties and that Parliament should be consulted in relation to the appointment of the coordinator, something that was approved in the case of the trans-European transport networks.
I would like to highlight a very important amendment, presented and approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I am talking about a new recital 2(a) which takes up the objective established by the Barcelona European Council that electrical interconnections between the Member States should account for 10% of installed generation capacity.
It only remains for me to applaud the Commissionâs proposal for a Regulation, which is being debated, on the funding of the trans-European transport and energy networks.
That proposal, for the first time, provides for the co-funding of projects in the field of energy and not just preliminary studies.
I trust that this will be taken into account when establishing the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 because, if the budgetary allocation is reduced, this and all of the European Unionâs programmes, such as Rural Development, Life, Trans-European Networks and the Seventh Framework Research Project, will be negatively affected.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mrs Laperrouze for the splendid work she has done and above all for the collegial spirit in which all groups were enabled to have input into the report.
The report is, I think, a good one, in that it clarifies our need for more trans-European energy networks if we are to achieve the Lisbon goals, which have to do with making our continent more competitive.
Two things are clear: firstly, that networks are needed within Europe, and secondly, that there is no guarantee that they will be problem-free.
Far from it: it follows that integrated networks can result in a problem transferring itself to other networks, although security of supply is generally enhanced.
What is also needed is an increased supply in the shape of the diversified supply of energies, especially of course of crude oil and natural gas.
I will take this as an opportunity to observe that you, Commissioner, someone whose dedication I otherwise greatly respect, were not present at the commissioning of the important pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan by way of Tbilisi.
The presidents of the countries involved were there, as was the Energy Secretary of the United States of America, but there was, alas, no sign of Europeâs Energy Commissioner or, indeed, any other Commissioner.
When such an important pipeline is built in a region covered by the European Unionâs neighbourhood policy, connecting a potential Member State of the European Union, or at any rate a country with candidate status, I would have liked the photograph to include you â not just because I like seeing you in pictures, but because it would have had symbolic significance for the European public, indicating that this European Union of ours cares just as much about energy as does the administration of the United States.
I am well aware that the American administration was behind the building of this pipeline, but we ought also to have made our presence visible.
It may be that you were not invited or that you could not be there, but perhaps you could give a brief explanation of your absence either today or on some other occasion.
There are two other things I would like to mention.
You are quite right to say, Commissioner, that we have to bear in mind that there are certain projects of European interest, and that these must be supported accordingly.
I agree that the European Coordinator can be important, and so I would like to endorse what has been said by certain Members, including Mrs Laperrouze, to the effect that this House needs to be consulted prior to his appointment, although the appointment itself is of course a matter for the Commission.
To recapitulate, I believe that energy supply is vital to our continentâs competitiveness, that we need a diversity of sources of energy, including those from outside the EU, and I hope that Commissioner Piebalgs will be able to be present the next time an important pipeline is opened, thereby demonstrating the importance of energy supply to Europe.
Â Â  . A possible solution for the assurance of security of the gas supply at the cross-country level has been on our minds for quite a time, as well as the solutions for the security and diversification of the supply to the Baltic region of the European Union.
The speaker has also noted this matter in her speech today.
Two projects have been included in the priority list of the guidelines under consideration, that is, the Northern Trans-European gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany and the Yamal-Europe transit gas pipeline route to Germany via Belarus and Poland.
The list of projects of general importance includes the Amber Project, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the territories of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
Naturally, the specific routes of pipelines result from particular agreements between the gas companies and the countries concerned; however, I would like to point out that the Northern Trans-European transit gas pipeline project partially disregards the interests and needs of all European Union states along the pipeline route that are concerned with the supply of gas.
The 2nd project of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline fails to meet the provisions for gas supply safety as it crosses the territory of Belarus, and we should remember the blocking of the gas supply via Belarus in February 2004.
We need an additional merger of the gas system of Eastern and Western Europe so as to ensure the safe provision of natural gas to consumers, to create a common and functioning gas market and satisfy the growing need of the European Union for natural gas in the mid- and long-term outlook; therefore, I propose to enter the Amber Pipeline from Russia to the European Union into the first appendix of the list of general significance projects, that is, the list of priority projects, as a possible alternative for Yamal II, while passing a new decision concerning the Council and European Parliament project.
Such a merger complies with the priorities set out in the Community guidelines in 2003 and indicated in the project under deliberation.
Such a gas pipeline route would also make a sound contribution to the settlement of security problems of the European Union and the Baltic region in particular.

Â Â  . Madam President, let me make one thing clear: we are not, in this instance, talking in terms of publicly-owned infrastructure; on the contrary, the networks under discussion, which are to be further developed, are to a large degree owned by the private sector in the shape of big energy suppliers.
This is what makes this debate so very different from that on the transport networks.
We repudiate Mrs Laperrouzeâs report, certain aspects of which we have not, despite our efforts, succeeded in improving.
It is our belief that this wish list of 300 projects of European interest will do no more than make the hearts of the energy supply companies â which, in Europe, amount to oligopolies â beat faster, and will be more likely to give additional power and influence to European energy suppliers, who are already too powerful in acting against the market, and we do not believe that benefiting such businessesâ interests alone will bring us any closer to security of supply.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me, too, start by extending warm thanks to the rapporteur and to all the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done and also for their willingness to engage in dialogue on this issue.
Today, we are debating the establishment of guidelines for trans-European energy networks.
The decision we reach concerning these guidelines will determine the future development of a modern infrastructure for trans-European energy networks.
I would like to use this short speech to highlight something that matters particularly to me, namely the decision to incorporate, for the first time, what are known as olefin gas pipelines into the trans-European energy networks.
While I agree with the rapporteur that this is of great importance in terms of Europeâs success as an industrial and business location, the Commission proposal does have what I regard as the unfortunate disadvantage of not specifying individual stretches, and, on behalf of my group, I have tabled Amendment 39 in order to remedy this defect.
There are already some individual olefin gas networks in the European Union; they are to be found in the west of our continent and in the new Member States, but there is no link between the two.
Amendment 39, which I will again take this opportunity of urging you to support, lists a number of selected stretches that could be used to bridge these gaps without delay and in a sustainable manner, thereby securing the supply of olefin gases and keeping our businesses viable.
It is clear â in view of the paucity of funds available â that not every project can be supported, and my amendment is not, indeed, concerned with financial support for the stretches named in it.
My concern is that there should be a clear statement of policy and an indication that these stretches are of particular significance to the European Union and its Member States.
It is for that reason that I again urge you to lend your support to Amendment 39 when we vote tomorrow.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the trans-European networks are important for achieving the Lisbon objectives.
Energy brings synergy.
The TEN-E networks in the energy sector will play an important role in the liberalisation of the internal market and in improving operational reliability, as they will enable the EU to connect to suppliers outside the Union.
The energy networks should not, however, be treated in the same way as trans-European transport networks.
Transport networks are part of the general infrastructure, whereas the TEN-E networks are in private ownership.
Accordingly, public funds for the energy networks should be spent mainly on planning and research.
In any case, this sum of money is so small for the Unionâs energy networks that it will not be a critical factor when investment decisions are being made.
A Coordinator would hardly be of any great value either: it would simply create a new organisational level once again.
In matters of expertise just a little money should bear fruit.
As far as certain details in the report are concerned, I am suspicious about mentioning the priority projects as proposed by the Commission.
Their preparation has not been systematic: in practice it has been quite random.
Do not let us emphasise the status of certain projects, then, but above all, the importance of Union-wide investigations into what we should invest in.
Ladies and gentlemen, we all the while need to ensure that the operational reliability of energy does not lead to wastefulness, but savings.
According to new estimates, all energy sources apart from renewables may run out within a few generations, depending on levels of consumption.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to thank Members for a fruitful debate.
However, we should be very honest in looking at the trans-European networks in the energy field.
It is clearly a necessity because the security of our energy supplies depends on our energy networks, and on interconnection as the most important part of it.
When we speak about a competitive market, again interconnection is an absolute necessity.
From this point of view, I cannot accept that there should be no policies at the European level.
So the guidelines are clearly there to justify our approach.
We spend EURÂ 20Â million a year on trans-European energy networks.
The money is for feasibility studies and perhaps in the future we can provide support for the projects.
There have been advocates from the Baltic States for particular projects.
At this stage it is clear, as one Member said, that the Baltic States are like an isolated island: there is no interconnection of electricity.
There will be interconnection from Estonia to Finland.
However, the PowerBridge Project between Lithuania and Poland will never be a reality unless there is Community support for trans-European networks in energy.
I strongly advocate the approach we have delivered.
Concerning broader support for energy, we definitely need to diversify our supplies.
For this reason we are working with all the countries and also with Azerbaijan, which I visited.
No European company was involved, but we need to be involved from the beginning.
Four countries have signed the Treaty.
The Commission could not do so, but we are interested in this project because it concerns oil that that will be used by customers.
We are interested in gas supplies but, at the same time, as we are not financing the project we cannot expect to take all the credit.
Therefore, we are thinking about diversifying our security supplies.
At the same time, as I mentioned, the main sources of investment are from private investors.
Therefore the private investors should invest in the project and the Commission, through these guidelines, should provide the necessary political input.
So I am very grateful for todayâs debate.
We will continue our work.
I wish to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze.
As concerns olefin and Amendment 39, I am sorry to say that at this stage the Commission simply notes the importance of olefin networks, without going into detail about the priority sections of this network, which will have to be assessed by the European Investment Bank for every specific proposal for financing.
Therefore, the Commission does not propose a financing intervention by means of European Community money.
For this reason, we cannot support Amendment 39.
However, as I mentioned, the Commissionâs and Parliamentâs proposal are very close.
I wish to thank Parliament again for its very close cooperation.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0130/2005) by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (COM(2003)0739 â C5-0642/2003 â 2003/0300(COD)).
Â Â  . First of all I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her excellent work in producing this report.
I would also like to thank the other members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy who have drafted amendments and worked to improve the Commission proposal.
Many of these amendments will strengthen and add coherence to the proposal.
As you know, I consider energy efficiency in the Union to be a priority area for Community energy policy.
I am gratified that the European Parliament strongly shares this view.
The proposal for a directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services can prove to be one of the most effective tools at our disposal, not only as a means of combating climate change and improving competitiveness, but for improving our security of supply, increasing employment within the EU and establishing a viable market for energy efficiency.
As you know the Commission is also in the process of preparing a Green Paper on energy efficiency.
This paper is designed to stimulate public debate on the usefulness of improving energy efficiency in the European Union and the best way to do this.
The debate on the Green Paper will also focus attention on the energy services proposal and on its role.
The proposal for a directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services has several important objectives and means to achieve these objectives: it sets uniform energy savings targets to be achieved in each Member State through improved energy efficiency and energy services; it is also designed to stimulate market development for energy services and for energy efficiency in general; it applies to distribution and retail sales to most final customers of most types of end-use energy, such as electricity, gas, district heating, heating oil, and most of the transport fuel sector.

It is âfuel neutralâ in that it seeks to improve energy efficiency regardless of the primary energy involved.
We have also proposed that Member States place an obligation on their energy distributors or retailers above a certain size, requiring them to offer their end-use customers energy efficiency measures or, alternatively, fulfil other energy efficiency obligations, while allowing the necessary flexibility.
The proposal also sets forth requirements for Member States to promote financial instruments for saving energy, such as performance contracting and third-party financing contracts; to improve metering and consumer information; and to promote the certification of energy service providers and improve the quality and use of energy audits.
The proposal also provides for Member State regulators to improve their distribution tariff structures when possible, in order to promote energy efficiency.
Two issues that were discussed extensively in the European Parliament and in the Council were the compulsory character of the targets and the measurement systems for energy efficiency achievements.
Throughout the debates in Parliament and in the Council, the Commission has maintained its position on the importance of mandatory targets, for both the overall target and for the public sector target.
As regards measuring efficiency, Mrs Rotheâs report points out that a system with bottom-up measurement provides the necessary accuracy and robustness and can be further developed with comitology.
We also believe that comitology is the way forward because these issues would be too technical and detailed for coping with in the codecision process.
We do, however, see a need to maintain some top-down measurements.
I will have the opportunity later to comment in more detail on the amendments put forward to this House but I would like already to say that the Parliamentary debates in committee have been extremely constructive, and that we have appreciated in particular the efforts of the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in developing a coherent and consistent report, with many constructive amendment proposals.
I look forward to the debate you will have on the proposal.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission should present this proposal for a directive on energy efficiency and energy services was a matter of urgent necessity.
This House had already, and repeatedly, called on the Commission to respond to the creation of the single internal market in electricity and gas by proposing concrete measures to deal with demand, the minimal use we at present make of what is almost our largest energy resource being indefensible.
All reputable studies indicate that total energy end-use consumption in the European Union could be reduced by between 20% and 30% without harming the economy or reducing comfort; the technology available makes savings of over 40% possible.
Knowing as we do that we are increasingly dependent on imports, some of them from regions in crisis, and that our current use of energy is a significant factor in climate problems, we are obliged to get started with a real policy for energy efficiency and energy saving.
As Commissioner Piebalgs said, that also means a policy that deals with climate change, a policy for improving security of supply, and a policy for something that is part of the Lisbon strategy, namely the creation of many new jobs.
Hundreds and thousands of new jobs are to be created in this sector.
So I really am grateful to the Commission for producing this directive, and to Commissioner Piebalgs; I really do appreciate, Commissioner, your desire â which you have expressed on many occasions â to attach such special importance to energy efficiency, and to present a Green Paper on the subject before long.
In this proposal for a directive, the Commission has â as the Commissioner has just said â put forward binding targets, and I am glad that the Committee has done as I suggested and kept these targets binding; indeed, it has gone further in making appropriate increases to the targets proposed by the Commission, whilst allowing the Member States the greater flexibility of reporting on three periods of three years each rather than on an annual basis.
If, as the Commissioner has just said, the Commission wants to give rather greater emphasis to the top-down model, the targets will have to be the subject of renewed discussion, for the more the top-down approach is adopted, the higher the targets will have to be.
The initial line taken by the Committee is that we want to keep doing things from the bottom up.
None of the Member States will find it difficult to make energy savings of between 3% and 4.5% by means of concrete measures over a period of three years.
Let me state again, for the sake of clarity, that it is not the total energy consumption that is to be reduced; rather, the intention is that the concrete measures ensure that savings can be made, so that if, for example, total energy consumption increases in line with economic development, the increase would have been greater had these measures not been in place.
Matters will also be made easier for some Member States by the calculation taking into account the continuing effects of saving measures taken earlier.
We also â and this too is important â agree with the Commission that the public services should lead by example â a role laid down for them already in other directives.
I am confident that this Houseâs vote tomorrow will send a clear message to the Council, and will call on it not to take refuge in the âtake it or leave itâ approach.
I am also confident that we can do this with a broad majority.
I would like to take this opportunity to say a really very big thank you to the shadow rapporteurs â Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, Mrs Hall, and Mr Turmes â for their cooperation, which was really excellent and also resulted in the drafting of a compromise, which we are putting before you.
The Committee had, in its voting, to decide between two approaches: one was the one I have already described, which involves the Member States taking action to meet clear and binding targets, and the other was that of applying benchmarks.
We have already put before you a compromise providing, in the first instance, for binding targets to be applicable, to be followed by the setting of benchmarks in all areas, which â time-consuming and far from simple though this will be â will enable the targets to be met.
Â Â  . Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Rothe for the dedication she has shown in producing this report.
In stating its position, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has mainly emphasised the cost-effective approach towards energy efficiency.
In addition, we have proposed a number of amendments, on a few key points of which there is, fortunately agreement, but the Committee believes that ultimate proposal does not go far enough, particularly with regard to the flexibility that we have to offer to the Member States where the objectives of energy efficiency are concerned.
Consideration should be given to the different degrees of energy efficiency that exist in the Member States.
I am pleased, though, with compromise amendment 107, because it provides, or at least provide, more flexibility for national objectives.
That is in itself a good thing, but we should not at the same time stand by the compulsory objectives for each Member State and consequently keep the door open to uniform compulsory objectives being prescribed for each country.
I do not think, therefore, that we should abide by the obligation in this respect.
Secondly, it is important for SMEs â which make a considerable contribution in reducing energy consumption â to be guaranteed a major role in the market.
The requirement that energy suppliers provide free energy audits would harm SMEs and it is therefore a good thing that this has been abolished.
Thirdly, this leads the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to believe that we must promote a cost-effective approach.
It is of major importance for energy efficiency to go hand in hand with sound cost-benefit analysis.
The proposal to introduce benchmarks will certainly encourage the spread of best practice, but it is important to set up a possible benchmark system in such a way as to ensure that it does not produce paperwork that cancels out the value added by the benchmarks.
Â Â  .
Madam President, we are dealing with a subject that is central to climate policy.
The energy services directive is intended to supplement the directive on emissions trading by directing savings measures to areas beyond its scope and to continue the energy savings process among end-users.
As the person delivering the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I myself had hoped that this would have provided an opportunity to correct the problems and distortions of competition which the directive on emissions trading contains.
Now there is much that is good about the directive, for which I wish to thank MrsÂ Rothe, but I shall address its biggest problem.
I opposed common savings targets for all Member States to the very last, because I believed they would punish countries in which energy saving measures had already been undertaken for a long time.
It is perhaps paradoxical, but when we treat Member States uniformly we accord them unequal status.
For that reason, I would have liked to refer the Article relating to savings obligations back to the Commission so that a system that takes account of each countryâs different potential for saving energy might be created.
The Committee on the Environment approved the Commissionâs equal savings targets.
I am not objecting to the ambitious nature of the savings, but their unfairness.
Once again they are being wrongly allocated.
Some countries have been set a very tough target; others, on the other hand, a ridiculously easy one.
My own country, Finland, which has invested in the efficient use of energy for years now, is facing quite a different challenge from that which Poland, for example, is.
In a common market, it is a matter of the distortion of competition when measures that have already been implemented are insufficiently taken into consideration and Member States are not given enough latitude.
The proposal mentions taking early actions into account when reducing the fixed common target, but as long as it is not abundantly clear what the savings verification method is, nobody can know what measures will be approved.
If my idea had been adopted, a study would have been conducted of the savings potential across Europe, and savings targets would have been allocated on a country-by-country basis, according to each countryâs savings potential.
This way we would have been acting even more ambitiously than now, and, even better, in a sustainable way.
I regret that what we now have is a weak compromise.
The issue may well have been considered urgent, but too much haste can be costly, to the extent that it could lead to conciliation with the Council.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Rothe and all the shadow rapporteurs who have participated in the production of the report for their willingness to seek points of agreement.
It has been a pleasure, as always, to work with such constructive and reasonable colleagues.
As Mrs Rothe has already explained, after a long negotiation we have reached a satisfactory agreement on the proposal for a Directive.
I believe that this compromise demonstrates the enormous importance that all of us who have participated in the discussion attach to the issue of energy efficiency, as well as considerable agreement on the objectives of this piece of legislation.
Security of supply and fulfilment of the objectives we have established in relation to climate change, not to mention those laid down in the Lisbon Agenda, oblige us to take a multi-dimensional approach to energy policy.
I believe that it is important to stress the necessary balance between the establishment of ambitious and realistic general European objectives and their flexible adaptation to the specific situation of each Member State.
It is fair to acknowledge that some countries have made considerable efforts in the past, which have led to undeniable improvements in energy efficiency, and these achievements must be recognised when it comes to deciding on the objectives to be fulfilled.
It is also important to make it clear that the ultimate purpose of this directive is not exclusively to reduce consumption, since in countries in which there are significant sources free of emissions it is perfectly acceptable to take a more flexible approach which is more in line with their economic growth needs.
Madam President, I am pleased to reiterate my groupâs satisfaction with this new step towards the goal, which we all want to achieve, of combining security of supply, protection of the environment and the competitiveness of the Unionâs economy in the global market.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports all possible energy saving schemes.
They are vital for us to be able to achieve the Kyoto objectives and reduce our dependence on imported energy.
MrsÂ Rothe has undertaken a mammoth task, and I thank her for it.
She has had very broad support for her proposal.
The compromises have not come about easily, but now they have the support of the major political groups.
The proposal entering the debate is an ambitious one.
The proposals for energy saving targets, in particular, are even tougher than those in the Commissionâs proposal.
Trans-European objectives are a good thing.
We have seen that, without them, Member States wriggle out of their responsibilities over and over again.
The fact is, however, that the position of the Member States in this respect varies considerably from one to another.
This proposal will cost my country a lot of money, as we drew up a list of considerable savings measures a long time ago.
In fact, we were got started too early, and now we have to pay the price for that a second time.
An annual 1% savings target is therefore unfair, because for Finland that would mean increasing the present costs of financing energy saving by 450 million to a billion euros.
It is my sincere hope that we will see a change, and that one day, ladies and gentlemen, we will all be prepared to support directives which seem inevitable but which cost our own country very much when the circumstances are so unfavourable.
I would like to point out that we have implemented all the directives that are connected with the Lisbon process.
Â Â  . Madam President, we need this European directive first and foremost because of what the United Kingdom scientific adviser has called the âelephant in the living roomâ; that is, the enormous threat posed by climate change which we largely pretend not to notice, even though it is sitting massively in front of us.
We also need this directive because of a large and growly bear in our living room.
That bear is the threat to our energy supply.
By 2020, Europe will be 90% dependent on Russia for oil.
Already we get a quarter of our oil and half our gas from Russia.
The easiest way to lessen our energy dependency is by using less energy.
This directive will give a clear framework in which companies dealing in energy efficiency can operate and compete.
I welcome, in particular, the provisions for accurate metering and billing.
In the United Kingdom, the single biggest cause of consumer debt is the arrival of a sudden, enormous utility bill on the doorstep.
The requirement for regular bills, based on actual consumption, will put an end to that problem.
The targets in this directive are not ambitious; they are way below what is technologically possible.
The advantage of sticking with these modest targets is that they are absolutely realistic and attainable.
There are whispers coming from the Council that higher targets might be acceptable if they were merely indicative, not mandatory.
But high targets are meaningless if they are just a wish list.
The incoming United Kingdom presidency has declared that tackling climate change will be a top priority.
It would be tragic and hypocritical if a knee-jerk reaction against making anything mandatory at a European level were to be allowed to be jeopardise that commitment on climate change.
I hope that we in the European Parliament will send the strongest possible message that mandatory targets on energy saving are necessary.
Â Â  Madam President, on behalf of my colleague Mr Turmes, who is stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway and is therefore unable to thank the rapporteur himself, I would like to convey the thanks of my Group for the very cooperative and productive work in producing this report.
We believe this report succeeds in putting the demand side â rather than always the supply side â at the centre of energy strategy once and for all.
That is something that has been neglected in many decades of debate on energy policy and we hope that with the Rothe Report we are now going on the offensive.
Forty per cent potential savings is a great deal.
Even for 20% to be economically feasible today without having to internalise the external costs is a tremendous challenge.
I would like to say at this point that we have agreed to compromise and that we back the report.
We do think, however, that these figures suggest that the Commission and the Council, too, really could be even more ambitious in this area.
Let me say for Mr Paasilinnaâs benefit that we do not believe that mandatory targets are damaging, and, if I understand things correctly, Finland, too, could still make enormous savings in heating alone.
When I look at what the Berlin Energy Agency has achieved in energy efficiency, for example, then I wish people would follow Berlinâs example.
We rather feel that energy services are the key to the future for energy efficiency.
We believe we must create a market for energy services if our ambitious targets are to become reality.
I believe economics and ecology can actually go in tandem again here, because if we tackle this single-mindedly then as well as enormous benefits for the environment we will also be able to create jobs, jobs in small and medium-sized firms.
Mrs Rothe, the rapporteur, mentioned public buildings.
We really must set an example here.
We have been discussing it in Germany for a long time.
We have already begun in Berlin, for example, but we have probably still not yet opened up all the potential there is in Germany.
Finally, I would like to express my conviction that we will only really succeed in achieving the ambitious targets we are pursuing in the energy debate, that is independence and security of supply, and in overcoming the major risks, namely climate change and the nuclear risk, if we at last take energy saving and energy efficiency seriously and translate our fine, ambitious words into action.
I am sure that Mr Piebalgs will be the first Commissioner in Europe to act rather than only talk.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the province of Upper Austria, from which I come, must surely be the worldâs market leader in energy efficiency, and we have always concentrated on making that energy efficiency as economic as possible, in other words making it meet the Lisbon criteria.
We all know that the cost of saving is now lower than the cost of new production.
It follows that taking action to save energy also promotes growth and employment.
In principle, however, we are against mandatory or binding targets.
We should concentrate more on incentives and we should in particular see to it that account is also taken of Member Statesâ inputs, in my province, for example, that now has far fewer opportunities at the margins than others.
We should also establish precisely who could achieve what savings with a benchmark system.
Most important of all, we need a system of tried and tested practice.
We need to learn, not only in Europe but across the world.
Worldwide learning is crucial here.
That is why I would like to recommend to Commissioner Piebalgs the establishment of a prize for energy efficiency for which the whole world can compete, so that we can become acquainted with the best models from all over the world and put them into use as quickly and efficiently as possible; that way, we in Europe, too, will be able to create new jobs and growth in this new sector.
Perhaps we could also have an impact analysis of this sector so we can learn which measures have the most efficient and quickest effect.
We should also look back over the past 10 years and compare the different Member States, also making comparisons on a world scale; that will give us a basis for the next 10 years for negotiating the targets we want to set and above all for deciding whether there is a place for incentives such as the âIntelligent Energyâ Programme, for example.
Â Â  Madam President, if I may come straight to the point, we are, today, saying a heartfelt âyesâ to a European approach for more efficient energy use, but I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe and the Commission on the proposal and the report on energy efficiency.
The more efficient use of energy is in all our interests; we all stand to benefit from it.
Greater efficiency means a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, which, in turn, helps us meet our Kyoto obligations.
Consumers and governments save on their energy bills, and energy-efficient companies become more competitive.
Innovation is the key word here and I unreservedly endorse the top runner principle in Amendment 96.
Critics who view this proposal as needless interference from Brussels in their domestic affairs forget the unfortunate fact that, without external pressure, too little is done in order to make our energy consumption more efficient, but I think that Mr Piebalgsâ top down approach should be complemented by its opposite.
Amendment 45 challenges enterprises to come up with all kinds of proposals on more efficient energy consumption.
I wholeheartedly support the Commission in its endeavour to get Member State governments to lead by example.
Governments are ideally placed to make investments in energy efficiency that are unprofitable in the short term but that are recovered in the longer term.
Whether by purchasing clean and economical official cars, refuse lorries, electronic equipment or investing in energy-efficient buildings, governments are ideally placed to address this problem.
In this context, I also think that we as European institutions have an additional responsibility.
Not only should we impose obligations on the Member States, we must also accept the challenge to enhance our own energy efficiency.
I suggest that the European Commission, Parliament and the Council all compete against each other to find out which is the most energy-efficient institution.
The outcome could be presented to the public and press during next yearâs Green Week, and, while I am on this subject, I should like to say that I think there is room for an improvement of over 30% in the new Parliament building.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, as things stand in the market, and in light of the supply model in most EU countries, we will only be able to achieve a sustainable European energy policy if there is a considerable increase in energy end-use efficiency.
Consequently, the proposal by the Commission on which this report is based, albeit only one element of a much broader body of legislation, represents a key step on the road towards achieving this objective.
This issue is all the more crucial given the fact that energy efficiency levels are known to vary a great deal between the Member States.
This creates discrepancies and, worse, waste, which is utterly unjustifiable in the context of a future internal market.
The model proposed by the Commission is based on rules that are clearly laid down, yet it is also sufficiently flexible and workable, and will encourage the 25 Member States to save energy.
Mrs Rothe approaches the issue from both a global and a specific perspective, which is welcome and helpful.
Proposing more ambitious targets for energy saving â and structuring those targets on three different levels â enshrines active intervention on Parliamentâs part.
This sends out a clear message to the Council that the Unionâs energy policy aims are being complied with.
Also relevant and worthy of note are the objectives set for the public sector â which are even more ambitious â and the creation of an energy efficiency fund accessible to every supplier of energy services, which will benefit households and small and medium-sized businesses, although it must be acknowledged that implementing them will be no easy task.
Given the current state of economic development and the practical realities of the internal energy market, further incentives must be put in place to encourage energy efficiency.
Global energy policy is about far more than efficiency, however.
It is increasingly based on ever-broader new energy sources, and on the safe integration of the Trans-European networks, a philosophy that corresponds to the way in which the transport networks currently operate, as has been mentioned in this House.
It is also essential to move towards tariff and contract harmonisation, thereby giving real dimension to European energy policy.
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome this directive, as it will primarily help energy users to reduce and monitor their electricity consumption.
This measure will require companies to give energy consumers accurate information to allow them to regulate consumption, compare their consumption with a normal user in a similar building and in an ecologically efficient building, and assess the environmental impact of, for example, the CO2 emission levels of the energy they consume.
Consumers deserve to have full and fair information on their energy use. The UK gas and energy watchdog, Energywatch, does an excellent job in giving information to consumers.
For example, if you type in your postcode on their website you can find out who is your cheapest supplier.
We all know that efficiency is absolutely essential.
I hope implementation of this directive will be fast-tracked in Britain to make it easier for consumers to play their part in reducing energy consumption and tackling climate change.
The directive will require the introduction of smart metering services that allow consumers to check at a glance how much energy they are using and how much it will cost.
The new meters are obviously part of a package of measures that will also force energy companies for the first time to give individual consumers accurate and detailed bills, along with information about the environmental impact of their energy use.
Climate change is one of the fundamental challenges facing us today and it is vital that we reduce carbon emissions across Europe to help meet this challenge.
Progress in this area will require radical changes and investment decisions and behaviour by governments and individual households.
This directive will enable people and businesses to assess accurately the environmental and financial impacts of their energy consumption and make informed choices on how to reduce such impacts.
I fully support this directive and I welcome the work of the rapporteur.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Rothe again for her very important work in Parliament.
I would also like to thank Mrs Wortmann-Kool and Mrs Korhola for their contribution to this well-prepared report.
I will start where I see more support in the European Parliament.
In some cases doubts have been expressed about the need for energy efficiency, at least in the form proposed.
It is an important, timely and necessary proposal, although perhaps a bit late in the day.
First of all, concerning the security of energy supplies, there are limited possibilities for the supply side.
We should address the demand side: this is where we should focus our attention.
The second issue which is extremely popular with Member States, at least theoretically, is the climate change issue.
But the achievement of climate change goals is impossible without firmly addressing energy efficiency issues.
We can indicate that if the target of 1% per year of energy efficiency were achieved, we could save around 50% of the European Unionâs Kyoto goals.
This is an extremely important issue.
Without addressing energy efficiency firmly we cannot achieve these goals.
Sometimes it is perceived that energy efficiency is against the Lisbon goals or against our competitiveness.
Quite the opposite.
It is the only way to go forward because climate change is a global issue and if we get competitive development in this field, we will definitely be competitive leaders in the world.
So it provides more opportunities than the cost involved.
Regarding mandatory targets, I very much welcome Parliamentâs approach.
I think a mandatory target is a must.
First of all, we do not have very good experience with indicative targets; but secondly, in the energy efficiency area as it relates to all areas, mandatory targets are providing a sustainable policy.
I salute the proposal of the Parliament to be more flexible about the scope and level of the target.
I would say the Parliament is more demanding than the Commission.
I congratulate Parliament on that, but we think that our figures are perhaps more modest, but at the same time generally well defendable in the Council.
So, there is no difficulty with a three times three years proposal.
I think it gives some necessary flexibility, but at the same time 3, 4 or 5% with a bottom-up approach means a lot.
It is a really demanding target and we shall have to see whether it is achievable.
Concerning the issue of one target or individual targets, I am in favour of the general approach of one target.
Some of the speakers mentioned that we have a different situation, one country has done more, another less.
If we compare, for example, new and old Member countries, the energy consumption per capita in the new Member countries is lower.
There are huge possibilities, but it also shows that there is an opportunity for older Member States, so all Member States have the potential to achieve these targets.
I think this is a less bureaucratic approach and is a policy throughout the Union, and the Member States that have invested in energy efficiency are gaining more and have more possibilities to achieve something in the energy efficiency field.
There has been less debate on energy services, but I think that this part of the directive is also very important.
If you personally look and see what has happened with energy services during your lifetime, you will see that not much has happened.
So this directive is giving a necessary boost for the construction of energy services, because the market by itself has not provided this development.
There have been some very good proposals from the Parliament, some of which could be acceptable.
There are some very important issues relating to best practices.
Each Member State can find something it has done in the energy efficiency area that could be used in other Member States.
So it is very important at a European level, but also at Member State, regional and local levels because energy efficiency is an aspect of each of the operations or uses of energy using the equipment that we have.
It means that we should involve the whole society in this process.
At this stage it must be done in a very intelligent way, but not necessarily always through restrictions.
I would like to thank the Parliament once again for its strong support for this very important directive and I hope that we will convince the Council about the mandatory targets.
That is now the big challenge.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on protecting the Communityâs financial interests and fight against fraud (2004/2198(INI)) (A6-0151/2005).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this report relates specifically to the budget year 2003, it is not intended as a snapshot; rather, it seeks to analyse failings and their causes over a longer period of time, to understand trends and learn from them for the future.
We in the Committee on Budgetary Control are not contemporary historians; what we want to do here in this House is to prepare documents and adopt reports that will ultimately help to improve the fight against fraud and to improve the situation for European taxpayers.
I believe this is of quite particular interest in the run up to a new financial period, a new Financial Perspective.
I would also like to say to those taxpayers here today that we must clearly understand, to take only one example, that so long as we have policies like the payment of export refunds in agriculture, there will be fraud.
It is an open invitation to fraud and we therefore need to put an end to these policies.
We ought to think about this in connection with the forthcoming Financial Perspective.
The year 2003 saw a slight decline in reported irregularities and fraud compared with the previous year: EUR 922 million compared to 1.15 billion.
The long-term average is around 1 billion, far too much, of course, to be ultimately acceptable.
Looking back over the years, we find a decline in reported irregularities in agriculture, with an almost equal rise in irregularities in the structural funds.
One reason for this may be that the increased controls in agriculture are having a visible effect â often at the expense of small European farmers, and that, too, needs to be addressed here.
On the other hand, it may be because the amount of structural fund payments has increased appreciably in the last few years.
A second subject is recoveries â a truly timeless one, to judge by the European Court of Auditorsâ latest report.
I wonder what is the point of trying harder to prevent fraud if we have to wait decades for money that was wrongly paid out to be recovered.
The Court of Auditorsâ special report highlights the shocking scale of recoveries in agriculture.
Between 1971 and 2004, EUR 3.1 billion of irregularities were reported in agriculture, only around one fifth of which were recovered.
Some 70% of monies wrongly paid out have never found their way back to the EU budget.
I believe there is reason enough for action here.
The blame rests clearly with the Member States, and the European Parliament must make that clear.
European money obviously ranks differently with the Member States than their own money.
One final point that is emphasised in this Parliamentary report on fraud is the question of combating cigarette smuggling.
We learn that cigarette smuggling is causing us tremendous losses, that the Member States are not cooperating with the European Union as much as they ought and that the Member States, and their finance ministers in particular, are still clinging to an incorrect and dangerous tax policy, always increasing tobacco duties when they need to plug a gap in national tax revenues.
That is an invitation to organised crime and we are all â Member States and the European budget â the losers.
It will be up to us as the European Union to develop appropriate strategies to prevent it.
Â Â  . On behalf of the Commission, I welcome the report by Mr BÃ¶sch on the protection of the unionâs financial interests and the battle against fraud.
The report concentrates on the previous year. For me this has been a period of familiarisation with OLAF and the development of the European anti-fraud policy for the coming years.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶sch, for his constructive work.
As I have repeatedly stated, I believe that OLAF also requires a stable and secure environment for its development.
Next I will address some of the issues that I would like to examine in greater detail.
First, in connection with the returning of payments, I welcome the responsibility of the Member States in this matter, as emphasised in the conclusions.
The Commission is grateful for comments concerning the work of the joint working group formed between OLAF and the Directorate General for Agriculture in connection with cases of the returning of funds connected with the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, where Member States have made an application before 1999 concerning possible fraud or irregularities.
The report notes the cooperations agreements concluded between Philip Morris International and the Swiss Confederation as successful examples.
Both have been visible and tangible results in the struggle against fraud.
I am grateful for complimentary comments and the support of the rapporteur in dealing with these cases.
In connection with the agreements concluded between Philip Morris and the Swiss Confederation, I would like to emphasise the innovative nature of these agreements.
The Commission finds that all of the other Member States could accede to the agreement.
We hope that they will join Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland, which have recently acceded.
I also hope that the agreement concluded with Phillip Morris will serve as an example for the conclusion of similar agreements.
In light of the upcoming hearing of OLAF in Parliament, the Commission and Parliament await the Court of Auditorsâ report concerning the results of the management audit performed at OLAF.
The hearing will offer the possibility for serious discussions of several matters raised in the report.
This primarily concerns comments about the institutional organisation of OLAF and its complicated role in communicating with Member Statesâ corresponding organs and European Union institutions.
At the hearing, which will take place in Parliament at the beginning of July, we will have the opportunity to examine the structure and organisation of OLAF in detail.
I am grateful to you for organising the hearing, and I hope that the upcoming hearing will help us to find the best solutions for the development of OLAF.
The Commission will attempt to do all in its power to ensure that the implementation of the conclusions of both this and previous reports correspond to the wishes of Parliament.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the protection of the financial interests of the Communities, which is directly linked to the fight against fraud, constitutes a duty which is divided up between all of us, on the one hand, and the reasonable protection and expectation of citizens and society, on the other.
Combating fraud must be considered a national and Community priority, not only of an economic but also of a cultural nature.
It is a question of a general culture, over and above the question of unfair competition.
In this direction, policy-making and the rules for applying policy are of paramount importance.
One of the financial sectors which is in the limelight is the agricultural sector.
It is a complex, multidimensional sector with dispersed social characteristics.
The mid-term review of the CAP and the simplification promised are a positive starting point for the application of effective control and transparent management systems.
Within the same framework, the recent agreement on a new financing regime for the CAP which, as you mentioned earlier, has already been decided by the Council of Ministers for Agriculture, appears to serve the same objectives of the simplification of procedures and the efficacy of the support provided.
The application of new systems for managing the common market organisations depends on an additional effort by the Member States, who must always keep a more beneficial ratio between costs and anticipated benefits in mind.
The simplification of the payment and control mechanisms must be promoted, so that there is a clear division between irregularity and fraud, especially in a complex sector such as agriculture.
Nonetheless, the main responsibility lies with the Community institutions.
Within the framework of their competences, they should act and cooperate for the benefit of the Union.
The citizens' expectations are that we should have correct management of the resources of the European Union.
To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his integrated proposal on the question of combating fraud and protecting the interests of the European Union.
Â Â  . â As is clearly stated in the report in front of us, there is still much to do in the fight against fraud, especially when it comes to cigarette smuggling and use of European Union funds.
I think, however, that it would not be right if we did not acknowledge the useful work being done in the fight against fraud, even, for example, in the new Member States where substantial progress on this matter has been noted by the national authorities.
I would also like to welcome the useful work being done by OLAF, which is instrumental in this fight, and it is good to note that, at last, we are reaping the harvest of the investment we made by establishing OLAF.
I am very much afraid, however, that there are still many who are trying to hinder the work of this office.
OLAF was set up under the auspices of the three institutions.
There is no reason, however, why it should not evolve into a completely independent office.
Indeed, if we want OLAF to be more effective, we need to allow it to work independently.
To be effective, OLAF needs less interference and less political pressure when it comes both to the appointments made to it and to the investigations it conducts.
I wish to remind the House that, in speaking about fighting fraud, we are referring not only to protecting the financial interests of the European Union or national public finances. More than anything else, we are also talking about peopleâs interests as tax payers who want to see the tax burden shouldered fairly and not increased on account of those who evade taxes through smuggling or by abusing European Union funds.
At a time when Europe is going through a difficult period where public opinion is concerned, we must make great efforts to be more effective in the fight against fraud.
Â Â  . Mr President, in expressing my appreciation of Mr Herbert BÃ¶schâs extraordinarily thorough, thought-provoking and forward-thinking report â on which I also heartily congratulate him â I am speaking not so much in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, or as spokesperson of the Socialist Group.
Instead, on behalf of Hungary, as a new Member State, and all the new Member States, I would like to emphasise the concrete significance for us, both in theoretical and practical terms, of protecting the European Unionâs financial interests and fighting fraud.
We, too, participate in the expenditure of EU budgetary resources by Member States; the body responsible for ensuring the lawful and efficient use of EU funds is currently being developed and consolidated.
We, too, are participating in this process in a concrete way and we support its efforts to protect the EUâs financial interests and to fight fraud and corruption.
Moreover, as a general matter of principle, the kind of example the new Member States and institutions have before them is not merely a minor issue for us.
In the course of the accession negotiations, when we were preparing for membership of the European Union, particular attention was given to modernising the public administration and combating corruption.
Upon accession, our situation was deemed acceptable, although it was stressed that work still needed to be done to whiten our economy and rid our public administration of corruption.
Now, one year on from our accession to full membership of the EU, it is very important that, on the basis of this concrete report, the public administration and public opinion should get a sense of the level of attention given by the EU to protecting its financial interests and fighting fraud and corruption, so that this will serve as a reminder to us and a pointer for the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too should like to add my thanks to Mr BÃ¶sch for his consistently interesting report on this subject.
As a Dutchman, I do, of course, still have the outcome of the referendum on my mind.
What general conclusion can be drawn from it?
Here in Brussels or in Strasbourg, a Moloch of rules is coming into being â rules that are completely unintelligible, utterly incomprehensible, and with which we do not want to be associated in any way.
When we talk about the fight against fraud, all we can do is to tighten the rules.
That is the problem with this subject.
How can we avoid lapsing into excessive regulation while fighting fraud effectively?
That is, I think, the challenge for this Commission.
One of this reportâs conclusions is that the number of isolated cases of fraud and irregularities in structural funds is going up.
I come across more and more organisations that prefer not to use those structural funds because they are far too complex to use.
You need all kinds of agencies to complete the forms.
This is again an example of an inconsistency.
How can the Commission solve this?
Although cigarette smuggling has been an issue for a very long time, we are making progress on all kinds of fronts.
When I read the report, I was reminded of the first, temporary, committee on the prevention of fraud in transit, on which I sat, and which made a whole host of recommendations, including equipping all customs offices with computers to enable information to be passed on swiftly.
That report has never, as far as I am aware, been followed up.
Has the Commission done anything with it?
Does the Commission intend to revisit it, to inform Parliament what subsequent action has been taken, because it contained many interesting recommendations?
Finally, there will not be a European public prosecutor for the time being.
This is an old idea.
I belong to the group of people who regret this.
Another recommendation in the report of the temporary enquiry committee was to organise as much as possible the exchange of customs officers from the different Member States with a view to them learning from each other.
What is the Commissionâs current position on this?
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mr BÃ¶sch for the excellent report and also for the excellent cooperation.
There are two points of particular interest to which I should like to draw your attention this evening.
The first one is the responsibility of the Member States, which, let us not forget, manage 80% of all European aid, which gives us every right to ask more commitment of them, meaning, above all, extra efforts in reporting possible irregularities and cases of fraud.
It also means reinforcing systems for monitoring and managing the structural funds.
We have a long way to go in this respect.
It also means that extra efforts have to be made in the area of reimbursement of funds paid either in excess or in error, which amount to the tidy sum of EUR 3 billion.
In his speech, Mr BÃ¶sch made a point of explaining how this is possible, and Member States have to be galvanised into action, for they have not taken any responsibility to date.
It is in this respect disappointing that the Member States where the most significant irregularities are reported are also the very Member States with the lowest reimbursement rates.
Secondly, with regard to cigarette fraud, as Mr Mulder pointed out, Parliament is a driving force in addressing this issue, which, indeed, formed an important part of the enquiry committee on transit fraud.
Every container that disappears represents a value of EUR 1.5 million of income of the Member States and the EU, in other words the taxpayer.
Next Wednesday, we will be questioning the Council and the Commission about the agreement that was concluded with tobacco giant Philip Morris who, for the next 12 years, will be paying USD 1.25 billion into an EU account.
I congratulate the Commission and OLAF, the anti-fraud office, on the exemplary way they have worked together to bring this about.
We need more agreements of this kind with other tobacco giants.
As Mr Mulder pointed out, the past referenda taught us that people have doubts about the European Union.
Issues like these, including the Philip Morris issue, demonstrate at any rate that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission join forces, organised crime and mafia networks, which are, in fact, also used for other products like drugs, can certainly be tackled adequately.
Finally, if you, Mr BÃ¶sch, say that we should abolish export subsidies and for the reason that it is a scheme that is very susceptible to fraud, then you will know that you can rely on me as an ally.
We should indeed put the issue of export subsidies on the political agenda and keep it there.
Â Â  MrÂ President, last weekâs referenda in France and the Netherlands were a dramatic reminder of how little legitimacy the European Union now has in the eyes of the peoples of Europe.
The EU is rightly viewed as a project ever more driven by an elite. A political elite with no genuine mandate from the people rides roughshod over the public and their national institutions in ever more areas of political life.
In Sweden, a scientific investigation is carried out each year into the populationâs confidence in about twenty different institutions.
The Commission and this House â the European Parliament â are at the bottom of the list.
There are many politically committed people such as ourselves who wish to rescue the European integration project from the attempts to create a European superstate.
We wish to make it once again a project of cooperation between independent countries of equal value which trust one another and to limit it to areas such as the internal market and cross-border environmental problems.
The attempts to push the EU towards being a United States of Europe without popular support now threatens the survival of the integration project.
However, it is not only the attempts by the political elite to push ahead with the creation of a supranational EU against the will of the people that undermines the legitimacy of the EU.
It is generally apparent that the European peoples associate the EU with top-down government, bureaucracy and corruption.
In this very debate in the House, it is, moreover, corruption and fraud with which we are dealing.
I wish greatly to commend MrÂ BÃ¶sch for his report.
It was painstakingly prepared and contains sound proposals that I support wholeheartedly.
At the same time, our work in the Committee on Budgetary Control shows how difficult it is to get on top of fraud.
There is some basic systemic error we are not getting at.
Money disappears year in and year out via agricultural policy and regional policy.
There is barely any clear sign of improvement.
Those officials who reveal scandals in the EU bureaucracy are routinely frozen out, dismissed or given early retirement.
EU history is littered with the corpses of all these whistleblowers.
A number of scandals are revealed in other ways but, normally, there is never any legal process.
This cannot be allowed to continue, and it is now Commissioner Kallasâs responsibility to ensure that this development does not continue into the future and undermine the little confidence in the EU that the EUâs population still has left.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am also able to give my full support to MrÂ BÃ¶schâs report, which is both constructive and perceptive.
MrÂ BÃ¶sch pointed out that we still have too much fraud, and that is a view I can only endorse.
I think there may be said to be two problems.
The way MrÂ BÃ¶sch expressed this was to say that EU money has a different value in the Member States than the Member Statesâ own money.
This is a problem that the former President of the Court of Auditors, Professor Friedmann, addressed years ago. The way he put it was to say that we cannot continue to provide aid in this form.
Instead, we must give countries cheap loans, as in that way they will have to pay the money back and be careful about what they use it for.
The second problem is that EU legislation and administration is still not good enough.
There are still too many cases in which the money goes into the wrong pockets or in which we do not get value for money.
I was talking recently with a Danish expert who works for a private firm and for the EU in the former Yugoslavia, and he reported that the aid provided by the World Bank, the EBRD and the EIB is monitored quite differently.
In contrast, the EU lets things slide.
When the money is used, all is well.
This is something we need to have looked into so that we are as proficient as the World Bank and the other big banks in ensuring that the money is used correctly.
Â Â  Mr President, in 1999 I was elected to this Parliament as a non-party frontrunner of the Austrian social democrats.
At the time, I had an equally high opinion of both OLAF and our rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶sch.
Since then, both the voters and I have had to learn that neither of them are that good.
OLAF is the private army of the powers in Brussels.
Someone denounced reporter Hans-Martin Tillack, claiming he had paid money for confidential documents from inside the Commission. used the documents to publish a report about fraud in Brussels.
Every word of the article was true.
That was not the point, however.
Tillack still has not got the confiscated documents back.
It is not unusual for journalists to work with confidential official information.
Such information was also used in this report.
Everyone who works on a newspaper knows that it is almost good form for people who are exposed to claim that money was paid for confidential documents.
OLAF also asked the public prosecutors in Hamburg, where is published, for help; they refused.
No judge was found who was prepared to do his duty.
These EU investigators have been gradually expanding their powers for years now. No one can stand in OLAF chief Heinz-Hermann BrÃŒnerâs way.
That is what European law now says, and the thoroughness with which Brussels always sorts everything out means that the Council has always immediately adjusted criminal law accordingly.
Now even fewer people in Europe are safe from Franz-Hermann BrÃŒner! Uncovering Mr BÃ¶schâs part in all this will have to wait for another time.
I have quoted everything I have said today from todayâs issue of the news magazine .
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Kallas, I would first of all like to offer my most sincere thanks to MrÂ Busuttil for the excellent work he has carried out as shadow rapporteur.
On the eve of our vote, I would like to speak about the way in which the work of OLAF has been judged within the BÃ¶sch report.
I felt that it was my responsibility to defend this fledgling European anti-fraud office, which up to now has never received any criticism from any judicial body, whether European or national.
It is an organisation that has been the subject, however, of ruthless campaigns of slander and destabilisation, through worrying indirect attacks, in which even certain elements of this House are not uninvolved.
It is with great regret that I am forced to state that MrÂ BÃ¶schâs report also appears to be inspired by unjust, exploitative and one-sided attitudes with regard to OLAF.
I believe, in particular, that it was premature and inappropriate to include the reference to a special report by the European Ombudsman against OLAF, which can only have been published in its final form with remarkably perfect timing.
In addition, this reference, which I consider to be unacceptable political meddling in a delicate ongoing investigation into suspected corruption, has been brought back to the attention of Parliament by means of an oral amendment, which would seek to ignore, however, two verdicts of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice in favour of OLAF, which are by far more authoritative.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us leave it to the judicial bodies to pronounce on the investigations, and let us all ensure that OLAF never becomes, as some would wish, the Trojan horse of political battles and one-sided interests.
For my part, I will continue to fight and to ensure that OLAF is forever an effective and impartial instrument, acting in defence of the legality and the financial interests of the European Union.
I am convinced that Parliament will also become the spokesperson for such a battle.
The crisis that Europe is going through today in the eyes of the citizens calls on us all to behave with the utmost responsibility.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr BÃ¶sch, I should firstly like to congratulate you, as others have already done.
Secondly, it is a pity that the Director of OLAF is not here today.
I am sure this is for reasons beyond his control.
I should nevertheless like to point out that, on the one hand, OLAF must pay very careful attention to this report and that, on the other, Parliament and our rapporteur must pay due respect to OLAF.
Such respect is essential for a body of democratic control such as ours.
I hope that OLAF has similar respect for its supervisory committee, given that under no circumstances must OLAFâs indispensable independence be confused with self-sufficiency, which would be extremely detrimental to the functioning of our institutions.
Turning to you, Commissioner, I should like to reiterate what we stated in point 28 of our report, namely that we await a Commission report by 31Â October 2005, explaining fully what stage has been reached as regards the scandal of adulterated butter.
Despite the fact that it was clear six years ago to all of those involved in the investigation that action had to be taken, none of the actual perpetrators, nor their accomplices, were brought to justice, and their activities continued undisturbed.
I should therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, to declare to this House that you are ready to accede to our request by 31Â October.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to continue quoting from : âThere is no one who can stand in Franz-Hermann BrÃŒnerâs way.
As the Commissionâs decision establishing OLAF puts it, his Office âshall exercise the powers of investigation ... in complete independenceâ and it may âneither seek nor take instructions from the Commission, any government or any other institution or bodyââ.
That must sound like heaven to a German public prosecutor, who is bound by instructions from the Ministry of Justice.
That is a tradition that is taken for granted in many European countries.
This brings us to quite a big problem. No one who is for Europe can be in favour of OLAF as it is, no one who is for Europe can be in favour of the EU as it is, especially when it uses an instrument like OLAF, where the well-tried principles of the rule of law are disregarded on a massive scale, especially the right to be heard and the right to information, when such proceedings are under way.
I urge Commissioner Kallas to do something about this.
Â Â  . Thank you for your comments.
Several speakers touched upon the subject of OLAF.
As I said, and as you all know, in July we will have a broad discussion about the status of OLAF and the legal environment surrounding it.
I hope we can settle some of the outstanding questions during the hearings.
My desire, and that of the Commission, is to calm the turbulence surrounding OLAF, to develop a reliable, efficient organisation, where it is possible to follow a case from start to finish and deal with it in a reasonable timescale, following all necessary procedures and without intervening in matters of substance.
We must create an institution that is a beacon of trust and which helps us to dispel the shadow of suspicion, which is everywhere in the European institutions, not only concerning OLAF, but all issues.
I agree with Mr BÃ¶sch and other speakers that we have an extensive range of rules and programmes that may give rise to the possibility of fraud, but also offer great scope for mismanagement and weak control.
No-one fully understands the origins of these programmes, rules and subsidies.
Consequently, I ask Members of Parliament to support all the efforts we are now making to simplify the rules and proposals so as to make the financial system more transparent, simpler, visible and easier to follow and control.
This is a major question.
The Commission and Parliament have made proposals, but we need more concrete proposals.
Sometimes, someone suggests that a regulation or subsidy should be abolished because of the damage it is causing.
Then someone else will say that it is good enough, that we cannot change anything, that there are certain political purposes and reasons behind it, so we try instead to simplify it, with the result that little is finally achieved.
I am happy to hear that there is a clear understanding about the responsibility of Member States in all these matters.
We are preparing certain proposals to strengthen our single audit model as part of the integrated control framework.
I hope that I can soon inform Members of Parliament of our proposals.
So far the response to these proposals has been very positive in several Member States, but not in all.
The sharing of responsibility between the Commission and Member States is crucial.
Mr Mulder asked about the public prosecutor.
The Commission has been very much in favour of the idea of a public prosecutor, but many Member States have not been very positive on this issue.
The Commission did not include it in its working programme, because it saw clearly that it would meet fierce resistance from certain Member States.
It was included in the âHague programmeâ, which increases judicial cooperation between Member States.
As far as I know, however, it is being withdrawn from that programme.
We deeply regret this and will try to find other ways to increase cooperation between Member States.
The issues raised by Mr Fazakas clearly show how the lack of a proper cooperation mechanism makes it difficult to achieve effective results.
In reply to his question, of course we will provide a report up to October 2005.
Yet this is an issue where we can clearly see that one Member State initially made intensive efforts, with very good cooperation with OLAF, and then the case was divided up among the Member States where these operations occurred.
Judiciaries in the different Member States examined these issues in very different ways, giving priority to different aspects.
Therefore, some kind of model for cooperation would be very useful.
As Mr Lundgren pointed out, fighting fraud is a very systemic question.
The Commission wishes to develop a systemic response to possible fiscal mismanagement.
We can never avoid bad things, but the question, in a democratic society, is how we handle such cases and how we develop a systemic response capable of dealing with all possible nasty surprises.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mrs Brepoels, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the Community (INSPIRE) (COM(2004)0516 â C6-0099/2004 â 2004/0175(COD)) (A6-0108/2005).
Â Â  .
Mr President, first I should like to thank the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, for their work on this subject at first reading.
If we are to shape a good environmental policy, then we need to have good information.
The directive being debated, therefore, will help considerably in improving this basic information infrastructure.
Indeed, the shaping of policy is frequently hampered by the fact that information is often not available in a form which enables it to be used.
Often the data simply do not exist or they exist but are inadequately substantiated or of unsatisfactory quality.
At other times, the information is fragmentary and comes in a variety of different forms and types, making it impossible to use it in order to shape policy at European level.
In other cases, the information is in the hands of government agencies which do not wish to publish it.
European policy-makers either come up against refusal to allow them to access the relevant information or are forced to accept onerous and costly licensing arrangements in order to obtain access to the data.
As a result, our environmental policy is not based on knowledge to the maximum possible and desired extent.
INSPIRE will help to remove these barriers by forcing government agencies to improve documentation and ensure that their data systems are interoperable.
Similarly, they will share data with each other and with the public.
In this way, the infrastructure of knowledge will be improved not only for environmental policy, but also in other policy areas which use the same geographical data.
Over the last six months, intensive discussions have been held between the three institutions in a bid to achieve agreement at the first reading of this subject.
Unfortunately, however, this proved impossible, due to continuing concerns being put forward by certain Member States in connection with intellectual property rights.
Nonetheless, I am particularly grateful for the persistence and attention with which Parliament, in other words the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, managed to reach an agreement with the Council.
During these discussions, Parliament proved that it clearly understands the importance of removing the barriers to which I referred earlier, in order to improve the knowledge infrastructure for environmental policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has already indicated, there is indeed a great need for information and for better management of existing information flows.
This applies to the European Union in general â as we have noticed at the referenda on the Constitution â but also to all Community policy areas, in particular.
Despite decades of common European environmental policy, there is still evidence of major barriers blocking access and the use of spatial information at Community level.
There are already quite a few instruments in place, including the European Environmental Agency, and new instruments are being developed in a number of directives that are related to this.
In order to eliminate those shortcomings now, the Commission has made a proposal to set up and run an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe, which has been abbreviated to âInspireâ.
It will in the first instance be based on existing data infrastructures and existing information in the Member States.
I can tell you, Commissioner, that we are right behind the proposalâs objectives and principles, because Inspire also seeks to give the public more insight into environmental policy and, in this respect, to increase the level of accountability at local and regional level.
Inspire also seeks to promote the reuse, but above all the exchange and sharing, of data between governments, and, without doubt, to be a driving force behind the pooling of new relevant environmental information.
Finally, it will certainly also be instrumental in making environmental policy more efficient and effective across borders.
The proposal relates to information needed to supervise the state of the environment, but also to improve on it, and can therefore benefit all policy measures that have a direct or indirect impact on the environment.
As you have already indicated, there has been an extensive debate in our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I can tell you that some Members see the proposal as not going far enough, while others believe that it went a little too far.
We in this House thought we should make a number of constructive and useful amendments to this rather technical proposal in order to accommodate a number of justified concerns on the part of the current operators in the field, without, however, losing sight of the ultimate goal.
I will mention a few of those amendments.
Our focus of attention was, in the first place, the cost-benefit issue.
You know that data suppliers are concerned about the income which they want to continue to generate so as to promote innovation and development.
I think it is important for Inspire not to get drawn into this debate on compensation for those suppliers.
This remains an issue that must be resolved at Member State level.
Secondly, current European and international legislation concerning intellectual rights of ownership remains in place.
It is prohibited to make reproductions, and data may not simply be sold on.
Thirdly, we also built in a number of guarantees for what is referred to as free-viewing, thus avoiding improper use for commercial reasons.
It must also be made perfectly clear that at a cost, the download and the processing services can be made available upon request.
Finally, with a view to respecting the division of competence within the Member States, we also suggested a few changes, because we deem it important that the governments that collate this spatial information â those are, in many cases, the regional and local governments â are also involved in the coordination of the infrastructure and are also responsible for the contacts with the European Commission.
I can tell you that in a very constructive consultation involving the shadow rapporteurs of all political groups, we managed to approve the report in our committee by unanimous vote.
A number of compromise amendments were tabled to ensure that Parliamentâs position is coherent and unambiguous.
Finally, I should also like to thank the Commission for the support we received, not least during the informal talks with the Council, with the object of reaching agreement at first reading, which, unfortunately, we did not manage to achieve.
Although this has represented a slight setback in terms of time, together, we have made huge strides forward.
The informal talks with Coreper have already clarified and crystallised a number of ideas for the future.
I therefore hope that tomorrowâs plenary will be approving this proposal with an equal dose of enthusiasm.
It should enable us to take an important step in the direction of a more sustainable European environmental policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for its proposal and the rapporteur for her constructive report, which has improved on this Commission proposal in a number of important respects.
The basic objective of compiling interoperable spatial data on a European scale is to be welcomed.
The environment in particular demonstrates to us every day that it knows no national boundaries and neither positive nor negative effects stop at the border post.
The collection and use of data must be practicable, however.
The rapporteurâs proposals have created clearer formulations and rules which greatly improve the proposal.
Moreover, everyone in the Community will have access to the environmental data they want free of charge â a great step forward in bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
By requiring the data to be coherent, it also makes this a practical possibility.
It must also be clear, however, that if the data is not merely to be consulted but is to be used commercially a fee must be payable; anything else would not be fair to the very people who will have to produce the data, in particular local and municipal authorities.
If the Member States decide differently about such payments, however, the subsidiarity principle makes that perfectly possible.
I also believe the rapporteurâs call for the proposal to be easy to understand and transparent is important.
The comitology procedure called for by the Commission should therefore only be used in exceptional cases.
The public has a right to know precisely how and where decisions have been taken and, above all, what the reasons for them were.
In conclusion, I can say that the rapporteur has with her proposal succeeded in bringing the Commission proposal closer to the citizen and introducing into it greater transparency, subsidiarity and practicability.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, on their work and dedication in trying to improve this proposal for a Directive and on trying to reach a compromise â which has not been possible, but there has been an attempt â with the Council at first reading.
I will begin by pointing out that there are still currently certain significant problems in the Member States with regard to access to spatial information and its use, due, amongst other things, to the fragmentation of data sets and sources, gaps in availability, lack of harmonisation between data sets at different geographical scales and duplication of information collection.
I therefore do not have the least doubt about the usefulness of this new instrument, which is fundamental to the drawing up, application, monitoring and evaluation of environmental policies at all levels and of policies or activities that may have a direct or indirect impact on the environment.
We in my group are therefore pleased that the Member States can guarantee the interoperability between spatial information systems and, in this way, eliminate the obstacles that still exist.
One important aspect, which I would like to refer to, is that of funding.
In this regard, I would like to stress that, according to the calculations of the European Commission itself, the application of this Directive will cost EUR 5 million per Member State, which represents 1% of the total spending on spatial information, while its application is expected to bring environmental benefits worth more than EUR 30 million per Member State, although it will perhaps be necessary for the directive to clearly establish the legibility conditions within the framework of the existing Community financial instruments for the costs of the planned actions.
Furthermore, I believe it is appropriate to base the Community infrastructure on the spatial information infrastructures established and managed by the Member States, in full application of the subsidiarity principle, but amongst those infrastructures, particularly when the Member States, such as mine, have several levels of public administration.
Finally, I would like to thank both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Council for their understanding, so that this proposal can provide for an analysis of soil erosion, since we must not forget the current significance of the progressive loss of soil throughout the European Union, and I would also like to express my concern about the specific role that the European Environment Agency should play in terms of creating the infrastructure necessary for the correct application of our objectives, since I still have some doubts in this field.
I would like to echo the congratulations expressed by this House, particularly to the rapporteur, and I believe that this mechanism that we are going to approve tomorrow will undoubtedly provide more clarity within the European Union's mechanisms.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank MrsÂ Brepoels for the work she has carried out, which we carried out together.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the report, insofar as it represents a very significant coordination effort between the Member States.
The Councilâs short-sighted attitude is regrettable, however, because, on the one hand, it has confined itself to environmental applicationsand, on the other hand, it has made little use of the Commissionâs coordination capacities.
The Commission can carry out a far more important role.
Such a short-sighted attitude will require these topics to be re-examined in future, when it will be necessary precisely to make the document more general and to include possible areas for implementation â which will soon be extended by the availability of satellite systems, in particular GALILEO.
These possible areas include, for instance, air, land and sea navigation assistance, support for land use and monitoring, which is yet to be taken to its logical conclusions, and the collection of statistical data with georeferenced points of reference, which could provide suggestions for further correlations.
In our legislative capacity, however, we must also consider the need to draw up fewer documents, of a more general nature.
I hope, therefore, that we can return to this topic, precisely in order to make it an extremely important instrument, since we need it for much more than the environment.
Â Â  .
Mr President, my many thanks go to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Brepoels, for her excellent levels of cooperation with the political groups.
The Council of Ministers wanted to impose too many restrictions on the publicâs access to information.
We support the rapporteur in her conclusion that we did not agree to this and that, accordingly, the compromise at first reading was not reached.
It is reasonable to establish a database where existing environmental data can be made greater and more varied use of.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to emphasise that our citizens must have the right freely to access information that is relevant to their lives and health on, for example, environmental pollution, even if many polluters of the environment, for example, would not like it.
Moreover, even if it is important for many authorities to collect revenue for the information it produces when it is being used for commercial purposes, it is important that our citizens can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own lives and health without having to pay for it.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this directive should be named Expire rather than Inspire, considering the detrimental effect it will have on the Ordnance Survey mapping agency of Great Britain.
Ordnance Survey has been in existence for 215 years and has a long and distinguished record.
Over the last 20 years or so, it has built itself up from a government-funded organisation into a successful commercial enterprise.
Under its current arrangements, it has responsibility for its own finances and freedom to develop new customer-related initiatives.
Inspire puts all that at risk and will undermine its successful commercial operation.
Why is this being done?
Once more we see the dead hand of EU harmonisation and the EUâs need to control every aspect of its Member Statesâ lives.
Also evident in this directive is the sinister presence of Galileo, the EUâs âbig brotherâ spy satellite, its eye in the sky.
How much more effective that will be when the EU has control of national mapping services.
According to the Commissionâs own report, those involved in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, particularly the Commission itself, will be the main beneficiaries of this proposal.
The British Government should have told the EU to get lost.
However, we can always rely on its cowardice and craven surrender to the EU.
I would ask you to vote against this directive, but knowing your insatiable appetite for more and more legislation, I know I am wasting my breath.
Perhaps the growing torrent of damaging legislation imposed on the United Kingdom might help to bring the British Government and its people to their senses and bring forward the day of Britainâs unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the success of the Communityâs environmental policy depends very much on the availability of reliable scientific data and the trouble-free transmission of that data.
The availability of spatial data is a necessary precondition for scientific evaluation conducted on the basis of environmental legislation.
The standardisation of spatial data collected from the Member States has still not made any great progress, as there are still serious barriers at Community level that are hampering the exploitation of the available information.
We must therefore try to improve the way spatial data is used and accessed, to facilitate the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies.
The purpose is to provide a knowledge base to take decisions on policies relating to the environment and in this way promote sustainable development.
That is the goal.
The Community has various instruments at its disposal to help improve access to reliable data, in particular public sector data, in the first place, and later standardise it to make it comparable at Community level.
One of them is the directive on public access to environmental information, for which I myself was rapporteur.
The problems observed when it was being discussed should now be taken into careful consideration as we debate this proposal for a directive which would create a legal framework for the establishment of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe.
One problem with both these directives is that it is feared that losses of income for certain data providers will result.
I would therefore advise that we tread carefully right now, to avoid surprises.
The most important objective is to reduce obstacles that hamper the shared use of data, particularly environmental data, among public authorities.
The Communityâs spatial data infrastructure will supplement the directives on the re-use of public sector information and public access to environmental information.
I myself think it is very important that in establishing a spatial data infrastructure we should focus specifically on environmental policy, in which case there would be practical grounds for the centralisation of information.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the proposal for a directive on INSPIRE lays down rules for the establishment of a spatial information infrastructure for the purposes of implementing Community environmental policies in the Member States.
Its primary focus is intended to be collections of spatial data and associated services, network technologies for sharing, access, use, coordination and monitoring mechanisms and procedures.
The principles and goals underlying these tasks, or in other words classification, standardisation and the establishment of an EU-wide database, would merit closer consideration if it were not for the fact that many European countries are currently experiencing political and economic problems as a result of rising unemployment and slow economic growth.
There is a never-ending stream of proposals for new directives, even though it is the poorest among us who have to bear the brunt of their costs.
Annual investments of as much as EURÂ 5Â million per Member State could be necessary to implement INSPIRE, and yet the database will not be fully functional for another 10Â years.
It is worth emphasising at this point that attempts to create an information infrastructure must not run counter to the social policies of the individual Member States.
The lofty goals proclaimed by the authors of the directive will be used as a pretext for the establishment of a database.
Although such a database could well serve a variety of purposes, it could also be used as a political football, and this would pose a major risk.
We therefore feel that this is not the most pressing of the many problems the EU needs to resolve.
What is more, the directive requires further work and the incorporation of a great many safeguards.
Â Â  .
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Salinas GarcÃ­a for underlining the fact that the benefits of Inspire will by far outweigh the cost.
Regarding Mrs Brepoelsâ comments on intellectual property rights, I would like to stress that these are not significantly compromised by the proposed directive.
In particular, it does not in any way affect the principle of co-existence or ownership of intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property rights held by public authorities must be exercised in a way that is compatible with the aim of Inspire, which is to ensure a maximum of data selling between public authorities, as well as public access to the data.
Nevertheless, to answer some of Mr Battenâs concerns, the proposed directive explicitly allows public authorities to charge for data to be downloaded by the public.
Mr Seeber is right in his comments on comitology.
This is indeed a technical directive and many of the detailed rules, for example on how to ensure interoperability between data systems, can only be decided at expert level.
I agree with Mrs Korhola.
I would like to stress that the Inspire proposal builds on the access to information directive, incorporating the same type of restrictions on public access to information, and is fully complementary with the Aarhus Convention.
Generally, I am very pleased to say that I can accept a large majority of the amendments proposed, at least in principle.
A few of the amendments aim to clarify the obligations on public authorities in relation to public access and data selling and to provide safeguards for data providers in relation to intellectual property rights.
Amendments 3 and 26 can be accepted in their entirety, while Amendments 28 and 29 can be accepted in principle.
Most of the other amendments seek to provide technical clarification of the proposal.
Some of these â Amendments 8 to 12 â are intended to make the structure of the text clearer and can also be accepted, although Amendment 9 introduces further small changes which can be only partly accepted.
Some amendments introduce other clarifications and can be accepted, while a number of others require some rewording or further clarification, so can only be accepted in principle.
There are just six amendments that we cannot accept.
Amendments 2 and 7 seek to extend the scope of the directive to include data held by Community institutions and bodies.
While we have no problem with this in substance, it would create substantial obligations on Community institutions and bodies and this cannot be done in the context of a directive.
Amendment 30 deletes a reference to measures taken to prevent distortion of competition and would make the text unclear.
Amendments 52, 53 and 54 give Member States more time to implement certain provisions of the directive.
Delaying the implementation of key provisions will, however, also delay the benefits that will result from their implementation, an option which is not favoured by the Commission.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on reinsurance and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC and 92/49/EEC and Directives 98/78/EC e 2002/83/EC (COM(2004)0273 C6-0038/2004 2004/0097(COD)) (A6-0146/2005).
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Skinner, the rapporteur, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work on this important subject.
Although it is not very well known to the public, the reinsurance sector is very important for the financial and insurance markets in the European Union and internationally.
The terrible events of 9/11, as well as more recent natural disasters, have shown how essential properly functioning insurance and reinsurance sectors are.
The European Union is the worldâs largest provider of reinsurance services.
Supervision of reinsurance is important for financial stability, as well as for the standing of European Union reinsurers internationally.
Whilst reinsurers were subject to national supervision rules, the reinsurance sector was one of the few financial fields without any major European prudential legislation.
The proposal for a reinsurance directive has been prepared in close cooperation with Member States and the insurance industry.
It is also in line with current reinsurance work in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.
This proposal provides a regulatory framework for insurance activities in the Community.
It lays down a supervisory regime founded on the principles of single authorisation and prudential supervision by the home Member State.
It is, in fact, the same regulatory framework already used for the completion of the single market in insurance and other financial services.
The single authorisation will allow reinsurance undertakings to work throughout the Community under the freedom of establishment and free provision of services.
The proposal could also be a useful preparation for reinsurance undertakings for the introduction of Solvency II, relating to the revision of current supervisory rules for direct insurance undertakings, in a few yearsâ time.
This is currently being analysed by the Commission, Member States and stakeholders.
By adopting this proposal, the European Union will be also the first international organisation with a regulatory framework for insurance.
This will be an important precedent for other international fora, which are also working on the supervision of reinsurance.
Finally, the proposal will also constitute a useful tool that will help give the European Union reinsurance industry effective market access to third countries.
I look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am pleased to be able to report to you on this directive.
It has been a great honour to be involved in this.
We need to thank many of the people working inside and outside this institution: people such as John-Paul Dryden, who fell ill during the report drafting stage and therefore could not help us to finish it.
However, Manica Hauptman, who took it over, has devoted a great deal of time and attention to addressing the very deep concerns and the details.
The Commission and its staff also played a vital role.
I am sure Mr McCreevy is be aware how good his staff can be.
Without the help of MEPs and their staff, and I note with appreciation the support from my colleagues across the floor, we could not have reached a fast-track agreement at first reading.
We went to fight an election, came back after a time and found this still on our plates and it is quite remarkable that we have managed to deal with it so quickly.
The concerns expressed by the House have been eliminated largely because of the agreement and the good work that has gone into it.
The first question is, what is reinsurance?
It is about business-to-business, risk and the spread of that risk by the insurance industry.
It covers such things as aircraft, ships and buildings.
9/11 and its effects on the World Trade Center were insured by large reinsurance companies such as Lloyds and others for the kinds of catastrophes that we had hoped would not occur.
They panicked, but managed to pay their debts.
This is a business-to-business directive as well.
It involves competition.
The central political issue was whether competition was fair at European level and beyond.
It was therefore a question of collateral.
Since the value of the reassured risk was collected in banks in the country where the risk was to be covered, it just collected money that did nothing: dead cash, if you like.
It was neither effective nor economic.
It was an old blunt instrument.
It had to be got rid of, because it increased administrative costs and it raised the issue of whether or not the risk was properly covered.
That question then led us to another: the timing of this directive.
We worked on a formula that allowed us to consider avoiding the Solvency II discussions, which would come later.
The formula would be a form of compromise, with 24 monthsâ transposition and 12 monthsâ transition, which I welcomed, through the Luxembourg presidencyâs efforts, and agreed to very easily.
Parliament was able to vote on this in committee.
Other issues included SPVs, the insolvency issue and captives.
Without going into detail on those, I can say that we now have a level playing field at European level.
The reinsurance market now has no barriers to trade and it will have a strong supervisory framework across Member States when this directive goes through.
Thus it will help EU reinsurance undertakings to maintain their competitive edge around the world.
It is a global market and European companies are at the very forefront.
In fact, Europe is the second largest market in itself, after the US.
Europe needs to play a role in the rest of the world.
The adoption of this text is going to strengthen the hand of the European Union in arguing for an end to the unfair, anti-competitive scam in the United States of requiring non-US companies to pay collateral within the United States, where they are regulated state by state.
Do not tell me that the US is a competitive economy: in terms of reinsurance, it is not.
So the US now has to reconsider and I know it is doing so.
This directive enables us to speak with one voice.
Supervisors and regulators can impose higher standards of supervision on third country companies from outside the EU if they wish, rather like the Americans.
There is a possibility of conflict in the worldâs rule-making bodies on anti-competitive measures, which we know the US would strongly resist.
But there is room for compromise, efficiency and a voluntary initiative.
Let us look at some of the figures.
Collateral is required by non-US companies in the United States.
It is counted in billions: it is reckoned that USDÂ 40Â billion is collected in the US against European companies.
There are far more, at a cost of USDÂ 500Â million every year.
This does not promote efficiency and it does not provide security against risk.
The first blow has been struck with an EU market.
With the Commissionâs support, the fight will go on.
We should congratulate ourselves on this European law, which has brought about significant change both inside and outside Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good day for the European Union, for policyholders, and for insurance undertakings as well, because todayâs debate and tomorrowâs vote â which I assume will be unanimous â will dismantle the much-criticised bureaucratic obstacles and make European reinsurance more competitive on international markets.
Supervision of direct insurers is regulated across Europe in a number of directives: the European Union has already enacted extensive and necessary instruments for the protection of policyholders with the loss insurance and life assurance directives and the solvency rules for insurance companies.
These will now be complemented by the harmonised supervision of reinsurance.
The directive on which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs reports is therefore an important addition to supervision in this important service industry.
The reinsurance directive, which is now successfully on its way after more than three yearsâ preparatory work, draws to a large extent on the systems of supervision that are already in place for direct insurance.
As has already been pointed out, important differences between direct and reinsurance were also identified in close cooperation with the Council, the competent authorities of the Member States and reinsurance industry representatives and are taken into account in the draft directive.
It includes in particular a uniform treatment of life and non-life reinsurance so far as solvency margins are concerned, an arrangement based on the prudent person approach for capital investments and a clear time limit of 36 months from the entry into force of the directive for the collaterals the supervisory authorities still require in the individual Member States.
As has also already been mentioned, the harmonisation and liberalisation the directive seeks to introduce will further strengthen the competitive position of European reinsurance and Europe as a whole as a financial centre.
At the same time, the administrative hurdles within the Community will be dismantled.
When the directive is implemented, the tortuous national licensing systems within the EU will disappear.
The home countryâs supervisory authority will provide such supervision as is necessary.
A reinsurerâs authorisation will then apply for the whole of the European Union.
Next year or the year after will probably see an extensive rewriting of the rules for the whole insurance industry as a result either of motions to that effect or âSolvency 2â.
An amendment that I originally moved has ensured that this reinsurance directive does not anticipate the political debate on âSolvency 2â.
I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his close cooperation; we all hope that the next time such an important resource is debated there will be more time in the committees and longer to prepare.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to thank Peter Skinner for the work he has done, especially as the person responsible for Solvency I. The logical consequence is of course that I am pleased we now have this report.
Reinsurance undertakings are among the last in the financial services sector not to have a European passport.
The planned directive will ensure that reinsurance undertakings operate under the same competitive conditions throughout the EU while at the same time not preventing direct insurance undertakings from assuming reinsurance risks.
The European passport means that an EU-domiciled reinsurer, that is a reinsurance undertaking that is authorised and supervised in its home country but which covers risks of an insurance undertaking in the host country, will no longer be subject to the discretionary authorisation of the host countryâs supervisory authority.
If this system of mutual recognition is to operate without damage to direct insurers in a host country and under the same conditions of competition throughout the EU, the transposition of the directive into national law must be harmonised in a similar way as with banks, and national supervisors must cooperate as regards their methods of supervision.
In one of the amendments I have tabled, I therefore called on them to cooperate more closely in the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee.
The reinsurance industry is a global network because that is the only way to obtain a sufficient spread of the risk of major losses and disasters.
European reinsurance undertakings have to compete in particular with North American and Australian rivals.
The recent American International Group scandal in the US has exposed the extensive control and disclosure shortcomings in relations between direct insurers and reinsurers.
In one of my amendments I therefore called on the Commission and national insurance supervisors to cooperate more closely with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to get standards of corporate governance and internal controlling procedures extended.
In order to reach a consensus with the Council as quickly as possible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was the lead committee, accepted only one subparagraph amending the resolutions in the competent Council working party.
All the proposed amendments were sacrificed to the accelerated procedure.
That alone explains why the version laid before plenary does not include my amendment clarifying what government bonds can count towards the cover for a reinsurance undertakingâs technical reserves.
In consequence, the reinsurance directive is the only financial services directive that makes no distinction between the risk weightings of any government bonds and does not differentiate on the basis of the stateâs rating or of whether or not the bond issuer is an EU or OECD Member State.
A little more would have achieved a great deal.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his skill and inclusiveness, which, in cooperation with the Council and Commission, have enabled a speedy agreement to be reached on this matter.
The text is a compromise, but it has been accepted by all parties, including the reinsurance industry.
This is not a sexy dossier.
You probably would not talk about it much in a referendum on the Constitution â if you had one â but it is vitally important.
The lack of an EU regulatory framework for reinsurance and differing national rules have created uncertainty for companies, barriers to trade within the internal market, greater administrative burdens and costs, and a weakening of the EUâs position in international trade negotiations.
As someone who represents London, with its strong insurance sector, and in particular as someone who worked for several years for Lloydâs of London, I appreciate what a significant single market achievement this is, based on the recognised principles of licensing home state control and mutual recognition.
The important thing for us citizens is that, the more supervision is streamlined and cost-reduced, the more jobs are created in a European industry which is competitive at home and abroad.
It will release assets for investment that are currently tied up unproductively in collateral.
It will enable the EU to mount a challenge to American anti-competitive rules.
Reinsurance is a global business and EU firms are in the lead, so a global marketplace in which firms have access to markets on an equal basis is needed.
This directive takes us firmly in the right direction.
Not sexy, but significant.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, we are well aware of how important reinsurance is for the insurance and banking sectors.
It is enormously important for all companies, regardless of how large they are.
Several issues arise as a result of this, but in view of the time available to me I should like to touch upon just two.
The first is the question of whether it is appropriate for us to limit the scope of the directiveâs rules to reinsurance undertakings.
After all, we know full well that insurance undertakings take out mutual insurance policies in order to reduce risks, as do banks when issuing bank guarantees.
