One reason for this is, of course, that, owing to demographic change, State security systems are experiencing financing problems, but it is primarily because we wish to have pensions which will provide for a secure future.
In this context it should be noted that the Commission has not yet submitted a proposal for a directive to Parliament which covers the whole package necessary for an occupational pension, as it promised it would last year, but only one part of it.
The European Commission's proposal for a directive contains no reference to tax arrangements.
For us it is very important to know to what extent the existing regulations are to be supplemented by proposals to harmonise taxes or proposals for new taxation arrangements.
Commissioner, you have announced that a communication will soon be published.
In order to actually give our opinion on the overall package, it is very important for us to know to what extent the principle of the free movement of workers might not be undermined by diverging national taxation, by different taxation of contributions, including to occupational pension schemes, and by different taxation of pensions themselves, because we do have downstream taxation in many Member States.
All of these questions remain open and are closely bound up with the success of the proposal for a directive which you have tabled.
I have one further comment: it is unacceptable for workers to be discriminated against solely on the basis of the place where they then draw this pension.
Neither tax avoidance, nor unfair tax competition, nor insufficient exchange of information on tax are responsible for this problem.
What we actually need here is coordination of tax policies, the initial moves towards which looked so promising with the Monti package.
It is also in the interests of workers who wish to engage in cross-border activities - and the Treaty provides for this - that we need to make this possible.
That is why for us in the European Parliament it is terribly important that we also receive answers from you, before we complete our discussions, on how tax coordination is to be guaranteed in this sector.
Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath has, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, raised questions on a particularly important issue, namely the Community initiatives on the future of pension systems.
I agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath on her first question.
The proposal for a pension fund directive is a first important step in the direction of cross-border membership of pension funds.
It must be supplemented by further initiatives.
As the explanatory memorandum to the proposed directive sets out, for cross-border membership it should be possible for companies and employees to obtain tax relief on contributions paid to funds in other Member States.
This aspect will be the subject of a separate initiative by the Commission.
The second question is what the Commission will do to make cross-border membership of pension funds a reality.
First of all, it is a priority for the pension fund directive to be adopted by Council and Parliament.
However as a corollary to the pension fund directive, the Commission will adopt a communication on the elimination of tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions.
The adoption of the communication is now scheduled for two weeks' time.
It is necessary to secure the elimination of discriminatory treatment against pension institutions established in other Member States.
Many Member States give better treatment, in terms of tax deduction for contributions and taxation of benefits, to schemes operated by institutions established within their own territory.
That poses a major obstacle to the cross-border movement of workers, and European businesses as well.
It effectively closes off the pension markets of many Member States.
Furthermore, Mrs Randzio-Plath asks whether the Commission thinks that it should be tabling legally binding initiatives and, if not, how the Commission could still ensure that cross-border membership would become a reality.
As I said, the Commission is in the process of adopting a communication.
This communication will make clear that the most urgent obstacles to labour mobility and cross-border pension provisions can be overcome without secondary legislation, by enforcing the Treaty rules which are already in place.
I hope that you will appreciate that until the communication has been adopted by the Commission I hesitate to go into detail of its content.
I shall be very happy to discuss those with you and how the communication should and could be implemented after its adoption by the Commission.
I can, however, assure you that I see the elimination of tax obstacles to labour mobility and cross-border pension provisions as an absolute priority.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are having this debate today, because there is of course a need to clarify a number of points in connection with the report on occupational retirement provision, the second pillar.
Some say that this is a directive which, in the first instance, needs to be seen as part of the financial services sector.
Others think that we ought to use the directive straight away to cover conclusively the whole second-pillar package, from taxation issues to social security, therefore including biometric risks.
You have now explained that this is just one step in the process and that others will have to follow so that the directive - and here we are of the same mind - does not perpetuate existing distortions of competition.
The tax issue is fundamental here, but the social aspects, the issue of supervisory regimes, the issues of labour law and social law - which after all are not the same thing - of course also have their part to play.
Commissioner, I must also repeat that for us, and for me as rapporteur, this directive represents a step forward, a considerable one, which sets the ball rolling.
Further Commission initiatives will have to follow, which we will address in our report very clearly and in ever greater detail, because we will not have transferable pensions and mobility within the EU until the Member States agree on common taxation principles.
We know that setting the tax rate is part of income tax and thus falls within the purview of the Member States.
Nevertheless, in my view, a general shift to downstream taxation is necessary to avoid contributions and benefits being taxed twice or not at all.
A second point is very important to us, putting an end to the discriminatory tax treatment of service providers established in another Member State and pension contributions made by EU citizens resident in another Member State. This system is practised in many Member States and is tantamount to cordoning off the pension market.
Although our views may coincide here, in many respects we are sceptical about whether this really will be achieved.
On the one hand you are now announcing a communication rather than a directive - you will have your reasons for this.
A second point, however, makes me even more sceptical: at the last plenary sitting of the European Parliament, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, announced the demands that he was going to make at the summit in Stockholm with respect to occupational retirement provision and the tax issue.
There is a difference between the demands which were expressed here in the last Strasbourg week and the final document from Stockholm.
In the final Stockholm document, the pensions issue is, in fact, reduced to the labour market of the over 55s and is no longer worded, as announced here, as a call to reform the pensions system and remove all tax obstacles.
That is why we would ask you to ensure that the initiatives, which you have again mentioned today as being necessary to follow up on the directive, quickly become part of actual Commission proposals, so that we do not encounter possible difficulties with the application of this directive on occupational retirement provision on account of the many unresolved issues.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in making this proposal for a directive the Commission is pursuing one main objective.
This objective is to use pension funds to strengthen Europe's financial markets.
If it wanted to do this it would not need a directive at all, because all of the pension funds and financial markets are covered by the OGAF directive.
That is why it explicitly mentions occupational retirement provision, meaning the second pillar of the overall retirement provision strategy.
However, if we do mean occupational pensions then the financial markets have to be subordinate to the occupational pension schemes and not vice versa.
In this case we believe that we need to talk about a proper directive on occupational retirement provision and not only about a step or series of steps which may in 20 or 25 years' time perhaps lead to this.
I now turn to the issue of taxation.
I have no sympathy for you, Commissioner, when you say that you cannot say anything about the content of the actual communication because it has not yet been adopted.
You, yourself, announced several times that it would be ready in March, then the beginning of April and then there was talk of Easter.
So when is it going to arrive?
How can we be expected to work on the proposal for a directive and Mr Karas's report in the Committee if the tax issue is not included?
Unless the tax issue is addressed we will not, in my opinion, be able to put Mr Karas's report to the vote.
You are therefore required to table something.
You say that you have hopes of enforcing the Treaty rules which are already in place with the help of the European Parliament; my only objection is that you have already had the chance to do so many times in the past.
You did not need to wait, and you can always be sure of Parliament's support for uniform taxation rules.
For once the Commission also needs to start to show courage, courage against the Council of Ministers.
Mr President, my group's attitude towards the Commission's attempts in this area is rather different from that of the previous speaker.
Indeed, if we were to criticise the Commission, we would criticise it rather from the other side; we would hope that the Commission would take a rather more robustly liberal attitude, for example in the proposals which it has made for a directive on occupational pension funds, to remove the possibility of certain Member States deciding to continue to implement quantitative restrictions for which there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any superior performance.
The Commission should generally adopt the guiding principle that it should at least be capable of putting forward some evidence in favour of its proposals, rather than merely going for something which appears to be no better than the average practice in those Member States where the prudent person principle is adopted.
We also take a different view in urging the Commission and our colleagues in Parliament to try to make progress in taxation coordination.
While that is a very desirable aim, we should not allow the best to become the enemy of the good.
If we can make progress in improving the returns for pensioners in private schemes across the European Union, we should do so.
There is, as I have already said, absolutely no evidence that there is any reduction in safety or security as a result, and to establish an entirely spurious linkage, whereby we wait until we have a perfect scheme for taxation before we attempt to make some progress in the area of opening up and liberalising asset management seems to me to be very unfortunate.
We also welcome the Commission's new stress on coordination rather than on legislation.
We know that it is perfectly possible for the Commission to make many proposals, as it has done in the past, without making very much progress.
This is a new approach and I hope that it will be more successful than the approach of some of the Commissioner's predecessors in this area.
Mr President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and to Mrs Randzio-Plath and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.
It certainly indicates the importance which Parliament attaches to the matter of pension funds and also to the issue of problems in the area of taxation.
May I further note that we have almost unanimous agreement - I say "almost unanimous agreement" - on the fact that it is of utmost importance to deal with the tax problems in the area of cross-border pension provision.
A fully functioning single market in this area is crucial for the free movement of workers, and it will increase the Union's competitiveness.
For this we need of course swift adoption of the proposed pension fund directive, but that will not be enough.
We should also be dealing with the tax problems, as I said just now.
That is an absolute priority for the Commission and it is precisely why I have proposed to the Commission the adoption of a pension communication.
Today has not been the best time to engage in detailed discussions for the reasons which have been mentioned.
The pension communication has not yet been adopted by the Commission.
Mr Kuckelkorn criticised the Commission for being so tardy; he mentioned the delays.
May I say that the Commission is running into important manpower problems.
The financial services action plan is a considerable task consisting of 42 measures.
The Lamfalussy report deals with ways in which that can be speeded up, but we are now running into manpower problems.
It is not the first time that I say this here tonight, but it is one of the reasons why we have not been as quick as we had wanted to.
Tonight is perhaps too early for a detailed discussion of that communication.
I am looking forward to presenting it to you and hearing your detailed comments once that communication has been adopted.
Mr Karas said that the directive or the communication could have included more aspects.
He mentioned social aspects and so on. As Mr Huhne said - I know the saying better in French than in English - le mieux est l'ennemi du bien.
He gave the English translation of that saying.
Let me say to Mr Karas: if we had to deal with all those aspects then Mr Kuckelkorn would be even angrier with the Commission because the delay would have been that much longer.
Mr Karas says that this is ein Schritt, it is just one step in the right direction and of course he is right, as I said in my opening remarks.
It is one step in what the Commission thinks is the right direction; other steps will follow and must follow in view of the demographic time bomb which is due to go off in ten years or so.
That is why it is a good thing that the Stockholm European Council conclusions made mention of the fact that Member States now have the right to look into each others' affairs as far as pension funds are concerned because, thanks to the mechanisms of economic and monetary union, what happens with pension obligations is of importance to Member States, since all must avoid having deficits which are larger than 3%, or deficits which do not obey the Dublin rules that they should tend towards zero or even be in surplus.
That is a very good part of the European Council conclusions to which I should like to draw the attention of this Parliament.
Mr Kuckelkorn said, "Would you please stand up to the Council of Ministers?"
The Commission does little else but stand up to the Council of Ministers but only, of course where this is necessary.
We do not stand up to anyone for the sake of it but only when we think that the Commission is right and the Council of Ministers, or the majority thereof, is wrong.
Certainly the Commission would not be hesitant in such cases.
Mrs Randzio-Plath drew attention to the matter of whether there should be a directive or communication, as did other Members of Parliament.
Tabling a directive on the matter of taxation would not solve anything since Member States would not be able to agree to it unanimously.
We are here in the area - I am talking about the fiscal aspects of pension funds - we are here in the area of unanimity.
Does this Parliament really think, does Mrs Randzio-Plath really think, that we can get unanimity in the Council on important fiscal aspects of pension funds?
The chances of getting a unanimous vote in Council on an ambitious directive on the fiscal aspects are similar to the prospects of a snowball in hell.
The Council may give unanimous approval to a much smaller and insignificant directive but that is not what Parliament or the Commission wants.
The Commission is ambitious, wants to have a proposal with meat in it and that means that it is driven to issuing a communication and not a directive.
The area of unanimity is such that we must find appropriate instruments for a proposal that contains any meat at all.
If we merely wanted a qualified majority vote in Council then a directive would have very limited scope and would only cover posted workers.
Lastly, I have not yet addressed Mr Huhne.
May I express the gratitude of the Commission for his support.
He would have liked the Commission to be somewhat more robust.
The Commission seeks a maximum of robustness but it must take into account what opinions are prevalent in the Council.
The directive that the Commission has put forward deals with the security for the contributors, prudential requirements, as Mr Huhne knows; it deals with the freedom of pension funds to invest where they would like and in which currency; it deals with the European passport for the pension fund industry.
These are significant issues and as Mr Huhne knows full well, the sums involved are considerable.
In conclusion, the Commission now finds itself caught in a crossfire between Mr Kuckelkorn and Mr Huhne and therefore perhaps the golden mean is the right place for the Commission to be.
Commissioner, I should like to ask one more question because we have had repeated problems with the timing of events: when exactly will the communication reach us?
The second point which is unclear is: how is a communication supposed to help to actually determine the basic taxation rules for the whole directive if you are not able to tell us the principles according to which a minimum of harmonisation, while avoiding tax discrimination or non-collection, will have to be regulated?
Even if you leave this to the Member States a contradiction still remains, namely: how can further progress be made and what then is the significance of the directive?
I do not think it would be useful to reopen the discussion at this time of night.
I would ask the Commissioner if he would like to respond to the first part, but not the second part.
We have already had a discussion.
This will be coming back to Parliament at a later date.
Mr President, if you allow me then to reply to the first part of the question, the answer is 'within a few weeks' .
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.38 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, on page 18 of the Minutes, I am reported as having requested that Mr Imbeni adopt a stance now that he is in Cuba.
However, what is at issue is the fact that Mr Imbeni will be making a statement on behalf of the European Parliament in compliance with the resolutions which the European Parliament has always adopted on Cuba.
Parliament did this for the last time on 11 March 1999.
Mr Imbeni, in fact, declared on 21 March to Agence Presse - and this what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo' s subsequent question, on page 19, addressed to me was about - that he did not intend to make a statement.
This is not a private visit, but an official one by Mr Imbeni on behalf of the European Parliament.
That is why we are urging him to make a statement on the human rights situation in Cuba.
One can make wonderful statements in the European Parliament, but actually doing it in situ is a mark of greater courage.
Mr van Velzen, I have taken note of that.
I recall that the President told you yesterday that she would attend to that.
Mr President, I regret the fact that we are discussing this matter once again.
Only yesterday, the chairman of my parliamentary group extolled the qualities and the sincerity of Mr Imbeni, and the way in which he has defended human rights, in Europe and in the rest of the world.
I also regret the fact that, once again, an attack has been made on a Vice-President of this House when he is not here to defend himself.
I hope that these words of mine will be recorded in the Minutes.
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
I do not intend to allow a debate on this subject.
If there are any other requests to speak on this, I shall not accept them.
The President made it clear yesterday what she intends to do.
So that is the end of this item.
Mr President, I have no comments with regard to the Minutes, but I have unfortunately missed a large proportion of this interesting discussion because there are no Dutch interpreting services available at the moment.
I am sorry, Mrs Buitenweg, but it would be pretty difficult to do anything about that at this stage.
If there is no Dutch interpreting, then can I please ask the Sittings Service to do something about that.
I am afraid that I cannot do any more at this point.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Decision on urgent procedure
The next item is the vote on the request for urgent procedure on the following proposal: Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 on the introduction of a support system for producers of certain arable crops [COM(2001) 87 - C5-0083/2001 - 2001/0043(CNS)].
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will speak in favour of the request.
, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. (DE) Mr President, this request for urgent procedure is about the fact that high-protein feed or pulses are to be grown on set-aside land before this year is out.
What we have here is an old demand made by Parliament finally taking effect.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has held negotiations with the Council presidency so that this scheme can be introduced within this year.
That is why my committee is supporting this request for urgent procedure.
This also provides an opportunity to grant financial compensation to cattle farms hit by the beef crisis caused by BSE, without imposing any additional burden on the budget - and I stress the word additional.
And these farms would nevertheless be given income aid through the channel of animal feed.
That will please Commissioner Schreyer.
I call on the House to vote for this request.
As no one wishes to speak against the request for urgent procedure, we can now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
2002 budget guidelines/ Financial perspective
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
Report (A5-0102/2001) by Mr Costa Neves on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the guidelines for the 2002 budget procedure (2000/2324(BUD)) - Section III - Commission;
Report (A5-0103/2001) by Mrs Buitenweg on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the guidelines for Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I) for the 2002 budgetary procedure (2000/2325(BUD))
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII - Ombudsman;
Report (A5-0110/2001) by Mr Colom i Naval on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adjustment of the financial perspective to take account of implementation (presented by the Commission to Parliament and the Council in accordance with paragraphs 16-18 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999) (COM(2001)149 - C5-0117/2001 - 2001/0075(ACI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budget' s proposed guidelines that we are now discussing attempt to be clear and concise in order to guide the evaluation of the proposed budget for 2002, and we hope that they address the issue which the people of Europe currently consider to be most important: the European Parliament must be the forum par excellence for protecting the interests of Europe' s citizens and for representing their political will and their democratic status.
It is with this idea in mind that the following priorities have been defined:
First of all, the issues of food safety and restoring consumer confidence, which go hand in hand with pursuing the reform of the common agricultural policy.
BSE and foot-and-mouth disease have raised many issues.
The establishment of a European food safety authority has become crucial; it must be an authority with real power to act.
At the same time, a great deal is still expected of the Veterinary Inspection Office.
We are waiting for decisions to be taken on this.
The situation that I have described, together with the prospects of enlargement and the new round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, is determining the shift in the focus of our system of agricultural production.
We need to quickly work out in which direction we are heading and why we are going there.
We must start discussing this issue before 15 September.
Let me clarify this aspect: what we want to have done, by that date, is to have begun the discussions that will lead to a shift in the focus of the common agricultural policy, not, obviously, to a thorough reform of it.
In the meantime, we must keep in mind the tragic problems facing so many farmers and draw our conclusions from the facts.
The European Parliament must be fully informed about everything, a situation which is a world away from the lack of decision-making power it currently suffers with regard to most expenditure in the field of agricultural policy, which is, therefore, a thoroughly undemocratic situation.
I would like to see codecision in this field and I feel that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure is conditioning the way a large part of European Union expenditure is monitored.
Secondly, the budget must be implemented with greater rigour, efficiency and transparency.
We attach the greatest importance to monitoring he implementation of the budget and to creating an effective link between such evaluations and the adoption of supplementary budgets and even of the budget for the following year.
Hence my determination to ensure that, within the European Parliament, this task is carried out in the various specialist committees.
Central to achieving this objective is the report that the Commission will present in June.
Thirdly, the European Union' s external action must be effective, in line with objectives that have been set previously.
We see the importance of the Union' s external action, both in our relations with neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean basin, the Balkans and with Russia, and in our relations with other parts of the world, with which we have traditionally worked in cooperation, and even in our contribution to the development of third countries.
The potential for the EU' s external action justifies making sufficient funds available and also justifies the requirement for greater efficiency.
Fourthly, we wish to see the creation of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, as defined in 1999 by the Tampere European Council.
There have been delays in implementing legislative and administrative measures that have been translated into the corresponding budgetary appropriations with a view to achieving an effective asylum and immigration policy, and there is cause for serious concern about clandestine immigration.
We are seeing trafficking in human beings, the genuine social exclusion of millions of illegal immigrants and the despair that this situation generates deserves closer attention.
This phenomenon calls for a multidisciplinary approach.
My fifth point is that we must be committed to achieving the objectives laid down at the Lisbon European Council, specifically the objectives of making a real contribution to creating more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
We need our citizens to be prepared to live and work in an information and knowledge-based society and the European Union must play a key role in this field.
The eÂ­learning initiative must be ambitious because it is so crucial.
We must move from preparatory action to adopting a legal basis that will ensure our prominence in this field.
I live in an island region, which, under the terms of Article 299 of the Treaty, is called an 'outermost' region.
I am therefore aware of what geographical barriers are and how the European Union can help to break them down.
I am aware, however, that the Union contains many other barriers, which are more difficult to discern than geographical ones.
The survival of this project, which can never be considered to be over or completed, depends on our ability to break down all of these barriers.
Let us find the courage to fight on.
I shall conclude by turning to the other institutions and stating my desire that we can work together and cooperate as closely as possible on this budgetary procedure.
Mr President, we are at the start of the budget cycle.
The report that is now before us is not a detailed report, but one which outlines Parliament' s involvement.
I would like to thank my fellow MEPs warmly for accepting this constraint and for not including all kinds of details in this report, however tempting that may be.
We will be further detailing the 2002 budget of the other institutions very shortly.
I will ensure that future cooperation with your will be sound.
Allow me to outline the salient points of the report.
I would like to start with enlargement.
It will not come as a surprise to anyone that enlargement will also be one of the Committee on Budgets' key challenges in the next few years.
We cannot afford to sit idly until that moment arrives.
The institutions must be ready to welcome the candidate countries.
That is why - and that is so important - we are asking all institutions to develop long-term plans in which the implications of enlargement are mapped out, also covering the extra building and staff requirements, and especially the effects on the translation services.
The preparatory activities generate costs, even before enlargement has actually taken place.
The financial perspective must therefore reflect these extra needs.
Another major point is efficiency.
We owe it to the tax payer to exercise strict budgetary discipline and healthy financial management.
Activity-Based Management and Activity-Based Budgeting will help us achieve this.
That is why we are asking the institutions to make their budgets more transparent.
Interinstitutional cooperation can also contribute to a more efficient use of funding and, where possible, this will need to be improved and extended.
We will be drafting proposals to that effect this coming year.
The institutions will need to display more than budgetary discipline.
They will need to play an exemplary role.
I would like to mention two areas which are important to me in that respect.
Equal treatment, not only in terms of gender, but also in terms of all the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty.
Equal treatment should be the cornerstone of our staffing policy.
I would therefore ask the institutions to look into the barriers to equal treatment, the measures required to remove these barriers and the impact this has on the budget.
I do not rule out the possibility that increased environmental awareness on the part of the institutions will also require adjustments in the budget in the short term.
But whilst we in the environmental action programme only talk about the exemplary role of the government, here, we can put our money where our mouths are.
The institutions need to make use of the amendments to the EMAS Regulation, as a result of which organisations like ours can now also take part in Community' s audit system governing environmental management and the environment.
In this connection, we need to consider our buildings and the materials we use.
We need to develop mobility plans.
I would like to discuss all 35 paragraphs from the report with you in detail, and I know that you enjoy this subject matter just as much as I do, but I need to restrain myself, not only from a human point of view, because my fellow MEPs have heard the same tale a few times now, but also from a budgetary point of view.
In the final analysis, this will all need translating and then distributing in writing.
We would urge the other institutions to develop plans in order to avoid the unbridled growth of the work for the translation services.
We hope to set a good example.
I will therefore merely indicate a few aspects by way of thumbnail description, namely the importance of paying off the buildings as soon as possible via capital injections, the drafting of a statute for European political parties, and the statute for assistants.
I will, however, say a few words on the Council' s budget.
This budget has experienced strong growth.
I do not deny the fact that there is a great deal of internal reorganisation and that strict budgetary discipline is being exercised.
However, it just so happens that the Council is taking on an increasing number of operational activities in its budget, and this is why, slowly but surely, a kind of shadow Commission is being formed - a second institution where European policy is being executed.
That is an objectionable development.
Parliament should not have to be sidelined because this expenditure is being included in the Council' s budget, for fear of breaching a gentlemen' s agreement.
Transparency of the European safety and defence policy' s expenditure is too important.
If necessary, this can also be done via the Council' s budget, by including a separate heading.
Only by means of a transparent budget can Parliament exercise democratic control on the spending of European funding.
This subject shows once again that the budget is not so much a technical-financial matter, but mainly a political issue.
, rapporteur. (ES) Mr President, I find myself in a rather strange and uncomfortable situation because, despite having the unanimous support of the Committee on Budgets, I am convinced that at midday I will have to ask for the report to be returned to committee.
Why?
Because while we are debating this report here, the Council is also debating this same proposal and it is therefore possible that, if an agreement is reached, we will not be able to vote on the resolution today, but rather we will have to ask for the report to be returned to committee in order to ratify the agreement with the Council and vote on it on 2 and 3 May.
Ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the report may seem excessively technical: it deals with the adjustment of the financial perspective to the implementing conditions.
Clearly, the adjustment, as its name suggests, has to do with how the Structural Funds have been implemented in previous years, since the amounts in category 2 of the financial perspective do not only represent a spending ceiling, but also a spending target.
In 2000, no less than EUR 14 000 million of the Structural Funds could not be implemented, since it was the first year of the new programming period; that is to say, EUR 14 billion, of which 8 billion was rebudgeted in 2001 and therefore around 6 billion remains to be rebudgeted, to put it in round figures.
This EUR 6 billion can be rebudgeted, but we must remember that, given the new rules of the Structural Funds, this is the last time we will be able to operate in this way.
Therefore, amounts which are not implemented in future years can very easily be cancelled.
That is why we are concerned.
It is in our interest that everything is implemented correctly and that there are no delays in programming.
I believe that this objective is shared by the Commission, the Council - whose absence I regret, although I understand that it is holding a meeting in Brussels on the same issue - and Parliament.
Our differences so far relate to two chapters.
One lesser one: on whether a new budgeting of payment appropriations had to be included.
We believe that this is important in order to prevent the problems which we have had in previous years.
The other institutions do not agree.
This will not be the central issue.
And the other difference relates to the profile of this new budgeting.
Originally, the Commission was in favour of more linear budgeting.
Based on our experience, and advised by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we proposed a new way of budgeting for commitment appropriations in more of a bell-shaped manner: what is technically known as back loading, which involves allowing the large initial amount to be implemented now and then making another charge, a rather more significant one, at a later stage of the programming period.
Because we are convinced, from experience, that the appropriations could not be implemented next year in the way the Commission proposes.
We believe that a perspective such as this will allow a more harmonious development of the implementation of the Structural Funds.
The specific figures we have proposed are not a question of principle.
The question of principle is the profile of spending.
And this is the question on which, after yesterday' s meeting - where we heard an intervention from the Commission in which it gave us details on the state of negotiations of the new programming - we believe that we are perfectly able to reach an agreement within a reasonable time scale, which the Council could accept and which would solve the problems of Greece, Spain and Italy in particular in relation to future programmes.
I simply wish to defend these positions and say that, in the spirit of honest cooperation between institutions, it would in no way violate any article of the Treaty if the date set in the Interinstitutional Agreement, 1 May - which, by the way, is not a working day - were delayed until 2 May, which is the day Parliament meets.
In the meantime, we have a meeting of the Committee on Budgets on 24 and 25 April, and, if the Council reaches an agreement this morning, the Committee on Budgets could approve the agreement definitively and, even without debate, approve it during the part-session of 2 and 3 May.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. Mr President, I am delighted to follow Mr Colom i Naval's excellent speech.
I am speaking also on behalf of my colleague, Mr Wijkman, who is not here.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation is very concerned that the EDF is still not budgeted.
There is now something called the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the ACP and EU, the only parliamentary assembly in the world which does not look at a budget.
It is quite ridiculous that this state of affairs should be allowed to continue.
If we are going to implement sectoral targets in the development budget then we need to move towards a budget which can have result-oriented strategy included in the budget itself so that the country strategies that the Development Commission is trying to put into place can decentralise and give greater control to our delegations. Otherwise we have an old-fashioned budget looking at a new model of economic management.
Another thing I would like to mention is information technology and sustainable energy in the development budget.
Transport and communication has been old-fashioned stuff that has been put in the budget year after year, but there are new technologies that we also need to take into account.
Finally, a global fund for the combating of Aids needs to be considered in our budget.
Just asking the chemical companies and pharmaceutical companies to cut prices is not enough.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to extend heartfelt thanks to both rapporteurs Mr Costa Neves and Mr Colom i Naval for their work.
I hope that we will be able to conclude the Colom i Naval report with a Council agreement within the not too distant future.
I also hope that the wishes of my Committee will be taken into consideration in this connection.
With regard to the Costa Neves report, I believe that the rapporteur has set the right tone.
However, it is always a little difficult at this stage to be too specific until we have the Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to make an observation with regard to the employment programmes.
Over the past few years, this Parliament, the Commission and the Council have developed all kinds of employment programmes.
I believe that this year, we should perhaps take stock and try to draw the necessary conclusions.
I must admit that I have been very concerned recently, because the Commission displays a slight inclination, when we talk about open coordination, to listen only to the Council, and to overlook the fact that the budget falls within the remit of both arms of the budgetary authority.
It is, of course, up to the Council to give substance to open coordination, but with regard to the budgetary issue, both arms of the budgetary authority are competent.
The Commission, and especially the Council itself tend to overlook this.
I have the impression that the Council is, in some respects, acting in a way reminiscent of Mafia leaders in the United States who exchange mutual territories, and not so much like the competent budgetary authority that the Council should be.
This is also evident from its absence today.
That is, in actual fact, a very important, if not entirely clear, debate.
In any case, we will be taking a closer look at those employment projects and the issues surrounding open coordination in general, and will draw the necessary conclusions.
Mr President, in the opinion submitted to the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs highlighted a number of priorities, almost all of which can also be found in Mr Costa Neves' report, for which I would like to give him my thanks.
First of all, I would reiterate that the creation of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice is of strategic importance to the whole of the European Union.
This priority, which was formally confirmed at the Tampere Summit, generated a major work programme for the Commission with extremely tight deadlines.
We therefore believe - and I direct this point in particular to the Commissioner - that the justice and home affairs sector must be allocated the manpower and administrative resources required to carry out the mountain of tasks before it, in an efficient manner and within the agreed time scales.
One of these tasks - the asylum and immigration policy, including the fight against criminal networks - clearly occupies a central position and I should like to thank the general rapporteur for having taken this up expressly in his draft resolution.
Lastly, I should like to draw the Commission' s attention to the difficult problem that the European Union will face in the future, which is the effective control of its external borders.
The EU' s borders, which are already very extensive and difficult to control at the moment, will be even more so in the future, when the current applicant countries, from which immigrants heading for the EU originate, will then become gateways to the territory of the European Union.
That is why, Commissioner, we believe that you must lay down strict guidelines in the 2002 budget that will enable us to face up to this challenge.
The EU cannot become a fortress, but neither can it start to resemble a labyrinth of criminal immigration networks.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Costa Neves for his cooperation, congratulate him on his report and tell him that the priorities in the field of external policy are perfectly clear: enlargement, which does not come within heading 4; the prevention of conflicts and crisis management; the reconstruction of the Balkans; the European Union' s Mediterranean policy; the Nordic dimension, of course, and cooperation and improvement in human rights fields.
I would in particular like to stress that the Committee on External Affairs has asked - the Commissioner for External Affairs and I had the opportunity to talk about this with Mr Patten last week in Santiago de Chile - that the second Summit of Heads of State or Government of the European Union and Latin America and the new agreements which are being negotiated with Chile and Mercosur be considered as priorities.
The Committee on External Affairs therefore insists on these priorities and, of course, all of this must be carried out with the most effective management and the greatest transparency.
We hope that the cooperation with the rapporteur continues at first reading.
Mr President, as budget year 2002 is very important - one might even say incredibly important - because of enlargement, which is now entering a crucial phase, and because we have significant problems with the common agricultural policy and have not yet made full use of the Structural Funds, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism wishes to propose three key points.
We believe that structural measures under the four Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, Equal and Urban are very important, as are innovative measures.
We believe that it is important for at least some TENs to be extended so as to eliminate bottlenecks.
In the long term, environmental and employment policy has to be improved and emphasis should be placed on greening the budget, which has not been taken into account up to now.
We do not think it is the end of the world that none of our committee's conclusions has been incorporated into the guidelines so far, but we hope that this will be possible in future.
As a mountaineer I would like to say, in parentheses, that the fact that 2002 is the International Year of the Mountains should be reflected in the budget.
Otherwise, I accept the guidelines and support them.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the main rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, you could be forgiven for thinking that this year's budget procedure chiefly consisted of considering the agriculture budget.
I am indeed grateful to him for emphasising the agricultural side, but in concrete terms this would mean - and this is something we welcome - that the 2002 budget would be taking the first steps towards the required reform of EU agricultural policy. However, these steps would be somewhat less incisive because the 2002 budget will probably be very much marked by the need to overcome the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises.
On behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would therefore suggest that we take the issues before us particularly seriously, and that we therefore ensure that provision is made for the possibility of bringing together appropriations - including those in the area of compulsory expenditure - in the form of a fund for "animal diseases and market emergencies". This would guarantee that we really have sufficient funds to deal with the crisis, which has assumed catastrophic proportions, in conjunction with the Member States.
On no account will we accept an attempt to tackle problems by means of across-the-board cuts, as was discussed for the previous budget.
We trust that there will not be a request of this kind from the Commission when the preliminary draft budget for 2002 is submitted.
In the context of export refunds and of a new EU agricultural authority, which is now on the cards, we should also try to continue the trend of further reducing expenditure in respect of exports, where it is still very high.
This would not only make it easier for us to energetically defend our position at WTO level, but would also increase our overall flexibility as regards agriculture and rural development.
In other words, despite all the problems that the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises are currently creating for us, we would like to see Commission's preliminary draft budget containing the first positive steps towards the much-needed reform of EU agricultural policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present the priorities of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the 2002 general budget.
The first point relates to the issue of statistical information, or rather the lack of it.
Statistical information is highly important for the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
We repeatedly find ourselves in situations where the statistics made available for our work are quite simply totally inadequate.
This applies to the structural indicators, for example.
The committee is therefore calling for sufficient funding for the budget line on statistical information.
Secondly, we are calling for adequate risk capital to be made available for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
Thirdly, we consider it very important to have adequate resources for the Financial Services Action Plan.
The same also applies to the Commission, of course.
We are reacting here to the Lamfalussy report.
It is better to tackle this point than to go through the legislative procedure at a snail's pace.
Fourthly, we wish to stress the need to improve the human resources of the Commission's Directorates-General.
Lastly, it should be ascertained whether the Prince programme can be continued during the first six months of the year 2002 to tackle the particular difficulties of small and medium-sized businesses which have still not made sufficient preparations for the switch to the euro, partly because of their financial resources, in contrast to larger companies and banks.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on establishing a clear set of priorities.
I particularly welcome the emphasis on food safety and consumer confidence and improving the implementation of the EU budget.
However, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I have to express my concern at the absence of any major areas of this committee's priorities in these guidelines.
The committee's opinion has been appended but I would urge the rapporteur and the Commissioner to accord the following areas greater emphasis during this year's budgetary process.
First, the funding for the information society does not really correspond to the importance attached to it by the Heads of State or Government when it was launched with much fanfare at Lisbon.
The information society is an area that has caught the imagination of European citizens and they want to see results. But within the EU budget it is nothing more than an afterthought.
If we are to really connect the EU to its citizens, we must put our money where our mouth is.
We need to recognise that this is where the future of new European jobs lies.
However, the EU, and more importantly the EU budget, has never taken this on board.
We also have to address the issue of the possibility of the emergence of a digital divide in Europe.
We must do all we can to prevent the emergence of an information underclass.
That would drive a thick wedge between those who have access to information and those who do not.
I therefore urge the Commissioner to seize the initiative to ensure that the resources are enhanced to allow the information society to conform to the principle of equality, in terms of both accessibility and opportunity.
My second point relates to energy.
It is clear that we are too dependent on external resources.
What we must do is enhance Europe's renewable energy capacity.
We must avoid a situation similar to last year where industry across Europe was brought to a standstill by a small group of people.
Therefore, we need corporate approach looking at alternative sources of energy.
Finally, what I am trying to obtain is not a shopping list of priorities for these guidelines; I am, however, trying to ensure that adequate support and resources are targeted to areas that underpin Europe's future economic success.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, which, although it cannot be described as a large spending committee, has an important role: to protect the rights of citizens who appeal to this Parliament to look after their rights.
We have two very modest requests of the budget which are contained within the Buitenweg report.
One is that there should be a proper database so that citizens can follow their petitions through the Internet.
We expect that to be up and running by the end of next year and we want there to be money for that.
Secondly, in preparation for enlargement, whatever language regime we choose, preparations must be made to enable citizens of the applicant countries to petition this Parliament in their own language.
Finally, I should like to make the point that the Committee on Petitions does not require money, but that it does require the support of Parliament, the Commission and the Council so that it can have access to documents.
That is free.
It does not cost anything.
But I can tell you that at present there are a number of petitions - for instance the Lloyd's petition - concerning which the Commission and Council are refusing Parliament access to information.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the budget guidelines.
In other words, we are discussing the political priorities we wish to set in the budget for the coming year.
I would like to make it very clear that not every issue that arises in Europe is an EU issue.
And not every EU issue has to be specified in the budget.
It is certainly important to make these distinctions here.
That is why I would like to concentrate on a couple of key areas.
The number one topic is, of course, the problem of how, in view of the foot-and-mouth crisis and the BSE situation, we can take budgetary measures - and all of this has an impact on the budget - to achieve sustainable agriculture guaranteeing optimal consumer protection and so that we can also sell European products in other parts of the world.
That is the be-all and end-all for our farmers.
This is an important task that we have to tackle together in the context of the 2002 budget.
The second topic is that the European Union is gaining ever greater importance because of the responsibility it is assuming in the area of common security and defence policy.
I am gradually coming to the view that it is no longer acceptable for the 15 foreign ministers of the European Union - and it is perhaps worth asking if we really need so many - to travel around the world, dispensing European largesse, and making promises that we in the final analysis have to struggle to implement using budgetary sleight of hand.
This is not acceptable.
The Council really must consider if everything it is doing in this way is advisable.
The third key area is this: we are now coming to a very critical phase in the enlargement negotiations.
And the more concrete the progress we make with enlargement is, the greater the impact on the budget.
And this is also an area where we have to state in the clearest terms that it is not enough to tour the capitals of the applicant countries slapping everyone on the back and saying "Things are going well".
Not if the Council balks at making available money and appropriate instruments when it matters and is tight-fisted when it comes to providing financial resources.
That is just not on.
The final topic that I would like to mention, as it was also discussed in the Committee on Budgets, is justice and home affairs policy.
This is, of course, a political priority that just involves a couple of established posts for Mr Vitorino.
It does not have an impact on the budget.
Justice and home affairs policy does not have an impact on the budget.
That is simply a matter of fact.
So we need to make a distinction between politically significant themes, including justice and home affairs policy, in the coming year.
But this area is not a top priority for the budget guidelines, because it is not considered to be very significant.
I would, however, also like to mention the subject of administrative budgets.
I would like to ask, without making any bones about it, who the administration is there for?
It should not be an end in itself, but rather a means of delivering, organisationally speaking, what the various institutions have to achieve.
That is why we in the European Parliament should consider at this point - in the middle of the parliamentary term, which actually falls at the end of this year - whether the way we work is correct across the board.
I am not a great supporter of the way we now keep establishing one subcommittee after the other; for example, there is now talk of setting up a Subcommittee on Consumer Protection.
Instead, we should be considering whether we can adapt the existing committee structures so that we can discharge our legislative responsibility more effectively.
These are issues that we should certainly be discussing this year, and this naturally has an impact on the budget.
We are also discussing the financial perspective.
The WTO will also have budgetary consequences for us in 2002.
I have already mentioned the subject of enlargement and foreign policy, an area in which we are into our third year of special arrangements.
We are talking about the Sixth Framework Programme on Research, which we want more money for.
We are also taking about inflating administrative budgets.
The Council now wants an additional EUR 10 million.
So we are also coming under enormous pressure as regards administrative expenditure.
In short, that means that all the grandiose announcements made by the Heads of State or Government in Berlin in March 1999 to the effect that Europe's ability to act would be guaranteed up to 2006 are proving, just two years later, to be unrealistic and inaccurate.
I can accordingly only ask the Council to finally come clean here - to drop their trousers, as we say in German - and adjust the financial perspective, as otherwise we will not be in a position to meet what is required and expected of Europe in budgetary terms in the long run.
Mr Ferber, on moral grounds I have to reject your last proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your comment, Mr Schmid, you saved me from having to say the same thing.
Of course, it is tempting, when Markus Ferber makes such an offer, to take him up on it.
Although seeing him with his trousers down is not a particularly appealing prospect, the idea of debating the issue he has raised here is not at all bad.
Because a proposal such as the one he has just made, that is to give the financial perspective a thorough overhaul, is certainly something that needs to be taken very seriously and is a very good starting point.
However, we have to recognise that we are, of course, dealing with taxpayers' money.
We are dealing with tax revenue.
It is all very easy to stand there and say: "The framework you have established is pure nonsense, we can just sweep it aside, because we need more."
It is all very easy to say that with hindsight.
Of course, the world has changed over the last few weeks and months, and I will make no secret of the fact that over the last few years I have repeatedly asked whether the financial resources for one thing or another really are adequate in view of the acute problems we are faced with.
These acute problems are some of the issues the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to address during the budget debates.
Consumer confidence and food quality are, of course, also acute problems.
These are two of the really major priorities that in recent weeks and months have really run into difficulties because of unforeseeable events in the fields of agricultural policy and public food supply.
But we cannot just stand there now and act as if nothing had happened, we cannot just bury our heads in the sand and say that everything must carry on as before and that what was agreed in the past will remain correct for ever.
At this point we really must make the question of consumer protection and food quality, in the context of a reform of agricultural policy, one of our top priorities.
Now let me mention another top priority and urgent issue. In this case I must insist that we cannot simply forget and sweep aside something that we have fought hard for for two years, by which I mean the issue of peace in Europe and, in particular, peace in the Balkans.
This is not a subject that can just be brushed aside because a new and more serious problem has arisen, and perhaps one that affects us more directly.
Rebuilding the Balkans and providing peacekeeping forces, providing support for the people there, are also issues that impact on the future viability of Europe as a whole.
Everything that we fail to do now to create peaceful structures there may rebound on us at some time in the future.
Which of you would like to guarantee that we will not be drawn into military conflicts again in the future if we give people the impression that we are more likely to support them when they are fighting each other?
It must be obvious at the moment that the best thing is for them to work together with us to maintain peace in Europe.
Another acute need that is also the result of events in recent years, but is at the same time also a pointer for the future, is the fight against unemployment.
This is an area in which we have, in the past, been successful in Europe, in the European Union.
Last year, the unemployment rate fell from 8.7% to 8%.
The European Union itself has, of course, not borne the greatest part of this burden, but we can certainly claim to have played an integral part in making progress by virtue of our proposals and initiatives.
If social inclusion is taken seriously and we refuse to accept that sections of the population are excluded from participating in the labour market, for example, then we have to take appropriate countermeasures here.
People have a right to expect us to fight hard against unemployment.
But social inclusion - as Neena Gill has already said - also means that with the advent of new technology everyone must have an opportunity to participate in this society.
Such participation cannot depend on whether people have enough money to buy a top-of-the-range computer and use it for their children's education. We must make absolutely sure to involve everyone.
One point that is certainly much more important in political terms than in budgetary terms is, as Markus Ferber has quite rightly said, the issue of immigration flows.
I am pleased that we in the Committee on Budgets agreed that we would deal with this subject under the headings of "migration" and "provision of aid".
How can we deal with immigration that is either unwanted or which we may find desirable at some point in the future?
I am not talking about criminalising it or reacting to it emotionally, but we must tackle this subject.
I regard it as being very positive that we can reconcile this with the wording of the corresponding part of Mr Costa Neves' draft report.
My next point is the common foreign and security policy.
This is another point that may not have a particular impact in budgetary terms at the moment, but which is certainly important politically speaking.
We should no longer be worrying about how we in Europe can enhance the networking of military structures or how we can get more military units on the ground - European security policy should also be about disarmament, that is to say about dismantling the weapons of mass destruction that threaten us.
This should not just be a one-sided matter; it must also be in our interest to contribute to a global process of dismantling weapons of mass destruction.
That should be an important priority for us.
In conclusion I would like to say that we intend to accept the draft report prepared by Mr Costa Neves, which we consider to be very good.
There is room for improvement in some places, and we have tabled appropriate amendments, and I know that there is a lot of support for these, for which I am deeply grateful.
We will always consider the budget - not only this year, but every year - from this point of view: do we as a Parliament actually have a voice in the budget as a whole or do we only have a right of say on one part of it?
As we see it, there can only be one overall budget, without distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, and it needs to cover revenue and expenditure alike.
Only then will the budget procedure be complete, and that is our long-term goal.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg for their excellent reports.
The 2002 budget guidelines clearly show the budgetary policy the European Parliament is to adopt.
Parliament wants to simplify EU administration and make it more efficient, underline the importance of the personal responsibility of officials, improve the way the budget is implemented, strengthen economic development and promote sustainable agriculture.
Commission reform and making administration more efficient are key objectives.
To achieve this the intention is to move towards an activity-based budget and administrative system.
People must be responsible for their own actions in matters of efficiency and economy.
Personal responsibility must be taken for delays, and the same applies to the fluidity and legality of financial operations.
In this regard the reports clearly allude to the slow handling of the Structural Funds programmes by the Commission.
We shall return to this subject in connection with the discharge procedure for 2000.
In the reports, the key to smooth, efficient and responsible administration is a newly revised Financial Regulation, which is an urgently required measure.
Parliament is also demanding that delays and arrears should be dealt with.
My own group demands that the problem of arrears should be sorted out more effectively, and says that we should be able to dissolve outstanding commitments after a certain period of time has passed.
One particular problem is the agricultural budget.
The margin in its financial perspective has been almost used up as a result of the BSE crisis.
The idea of savings in the agricultural budget, which was discussed at Berlin, would not appear to be the solution at present.
The BSE crisis is jeopardising the entire budget because of the need for extra storage and exports.
In this connection, however, I cannot personally agree with Commissioner Schreyer' s publicly expressed call for a cut in subsidies.
Farmers are the only section of the population in Europe whose income levels are determined directly by the EU.
For that reason, they cannot be expected to foot the bill personally for the BSE crisis.
Agricultural aid does not encourage over-production, because it is not connected to the volume of production and is based on surface area and number of livestock.
We must remember that our fiercest competitor, the United States, subsidises agriculture on a scale that is clearly greater than in the EU.
It would be important if the Commission were also committed to Agenda 2000.
The main question for the future will be the trend in administrative expenditure under heading 5.
The Council is developing its own military crisis management organisation and has asked, among others, for 51 new posts in the second supplementary budget in the middle of the budgetary year.
Crisis management is clearly a matter of operational expenditure.
For that reason, the Council must explain more clearly what the issue is here, in other words, is the Council creating a 'new Commission' for the EU' s second pillar, one which would be outside Parliament' s budgetary authority?
As this is clearly a case of non-compulsory expenditure, Parliament cannot endorse these plans.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I too wish to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent preparatory work and for the sterling work they have done in general.
I shall concentrate my comments on the Costa Neves report, as the rapporteur has already said what needs to be said about the Buitenweg report, and she, of course, has the full support of our group.
In particular, I would like to draw your attention once again to her comments about multiannual plans.
We need long-term planning for the administration of the European Parliament.
We are also largely in agreement with the Costa Neves report, and we particularly support the clear priorities it sets.
The guidelines should not, of course, go into detail; they should clarify the EU's priorities for next year, budget year 2002 that is.
We think that the priorities identified, for example the priority given to agricultural policy, are correct.
The foot-and-mouth crisis demonstrates that there is a profound crisis in the EU's agricultural policy.
We hope that the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 to be undertaken now will lead to the necessary reform measures being taken, and that it will also result in Parliament being given a greater role in formulating agricultural policy.
We regard this as necessary first and foremost because our agricultural policy has led to a widespread collapse of trust amongst the public.
We need to recover that trust by means of a change, of course, towards more rural development programmes, and away from market support measures. We also need greater involvement by Parliament in the decision-making process.
The priority is no longer additional money, but rather fundamental reform.
The second priority is eastward enlargement, which presents enormous challenges for the EU.
We very much hope that the appropriations provided for 2000 will actually be implemented.
We must utilise these appropriations.
We only have to think about environmental policy in the enlargement countries to realise that substantial appropriations are required.
That is why I am hoping for more support in committee, and I will take Mr Ferber at his word, as he has already promised this support.
I believe that as a committee we must move forward and make appropriate demands, because everything that is not addressed in good time now will return to haunt us later on.
In this area in particular there is an urgent need for a reform of EU policies to ensure that eastward enlargement is affordable and feasible in the long term.
I believe that the call for the financial perspective to be adjusted is justified.
We all know about the problems we had last year with the financing of the Stability Pact for the Balkans, and with the financing of the MEDA Programme.
We also have a duty to continue to pay great attention to the area of external actions and to ensure that good work is done in that area, especially with regard to conflict prevention.
But this is not just about more money.
I believe that this is an area where we need to think more about efficiency.
There is an urgent need for reform in various external policy areas.
We hope that the additional staff the Commission acquired last year will also lead to greater efficiency in this area.
Overall, and I would like to stress this one again, we support all three reports, but we need to put our heads together once more on the subject of eastward enlargement and come up with something more specific.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their work.
I would like this year's budget to be rather more far-sighted than last year's, which we had requested should contain an appropriation for what subsequently proved to be an international crisis, BSE.
I would venture to say that it has now caused collective neurosis, and this is a sign to all of us policy-makers that we must staunch the flow, so to speak, and endeavour to provide the citizens with food safety.
With regard to the various aspects of the budget, I would stress, on the one hand, that it would be appropriate for the ECSC to try to incorporate the annual income produced by the assets into the general budget, in order to comply with the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation, and, on the other hand, the need to create two separate budget headings for budget revenue and outgoings.
In the field of culture, we will have to fully support the enhancement of educational and professional skills.
As regards a fundamental area such as agriculture, we will have to support it more and more in the future, particularly in the face of the now imminent eastward enlargement, together with the small and medium-sized businesses, which are the real core of the European economy.
Let us take note of our weakness, now, in economic terms, and let us endeavour to produce a budgetary policy which will reinvigorate our economy and boost its development.
Mr President, clearly, Mr Colom i Naval has not applied Goethe' s maxim "In der BeschrÃ€nkung zeigt sich erst der Meister" [Only in moderation is the master revealed].
In his report on the financial perspective, he is right to draw our attention to the considerable underspending of appropriations for structural measures in 2000.
It appears that EUR 14 190 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 7 988 million in payment appropriations were not implemented in 2000.
This is a considerable problem which has been around for years.
However, I do share the rapporteur' s view that something needs to be done.
The policy adopted hitherto cannot be sold to the citizens.
But what a surprise.
Both the Commission and Mr Colom propose, by way of adjustment, to re-budget the unspent amounts to the year 2002.
I cannot quite follow this line of thought.
There is every reason to get to the bottom of this problem.
What, for example, is the reason for the payments falling behind the commitments to such an extent?
Would that not be due to the fact that the Commission services are unable to properly manage all commitments with which the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission over the past couple of years?
Is this not quite simply a question of far too generous budgeting?
In my opinion, the solution can be found in the quote of Goethe.
We need to learn from the mistakes we made in the past, and economise as a Parliament.
The unspent appropriations should not always be transferred to the subsequent years.
We must tailor the appropriations to the Commission' s implementation capacity.
Furthermore, the Union must cut back its activity to those areas of policy where European action clearly adds value.
Programmes which are not effective must be abandoned.
The Costa Neves report remains ensnared in woolly statements; they can be interpreted in any way one wants.
I would like to gain a clear picture of his plans.
It is really beyond belief that enlargement - surely the top priority of the next couple of years - is missing from Mr Costa Neves' list of political priorities.
I suggest including this major development in the report at this late stage.
Finally, we object to the Commission proposal on the statute and financing of European political parties.
It is not up to Europe, but the parties themselves, to decide how they want to organise themselves.
They are responsible for their own revenue.
Furthermore, parties organised at European level will only widen the chasm between the citizen and European politics.
Mr President, I should like, as others have done, to congratulate our two rapporteurs for introducing our budgets for 2002 and, in particular, referring first to that of Mr Costa Neves, perhaps as the bulk of my speech this morning, I would like to say to Mr Wurtz that he has indeed struck the right balance in terms of priorities, in terms of responsibilities which the European Union has to manage - agriculture is central to that - and social issues, as we noticed in the Lisbon run-up and the follow-on in Stockholm last week.
These are essentially national responsibilities, national budgets.
We can do very little at European level to have large social programmes of the kind to which I think you were referring.
What strikes me most in these two budgets is the emergence of interinstitutional cooperation, which ten years ago was perhaps more of a wish than a practice.
I have in front of me the Council priorities, although for the first time in history no one is here to represent the Council.
It is somewhat ironic that it says in the first paragraph of their document: "The Council welcomes the spirit of cooperation that governed work on preparation and emphasises the importance of continuing the good collaboration between the two arms of the budgetary authority and the Commission."
Nevertheless one has to take at face value the statement that the Council wishes to examine closely the report which the Commission is to submit before 30 June 2001 on progress in reducing outstanding commitments to bring them down to a normal level.
Those who were present in December last year will remember that when Parliament put forward this joint declaration, no one in the Council actually welcomed it.
On the contrary, they seemed somewhat hostile to it.
So I certainly welcome the fact that they wish to cooperate with us in trying to reduce the backlog of commitments, in trying to make sure that there is a better parallel between the legislative and budgetary procedures and that performance targets are set, particularly in Category 4 in external policy.
Another area which reflects interinstitutional cooperation, which is important in Mr Costa Neves' report, is information policy, where for years we have been trying to get good value for money, and for years we have met with little success, to say the least.
No wonder we find 50% of the information funds still in reserve, still waiting for the Commission's proposals.
I urge the Commission to come forward with these as soon as possible, hopefully having discussed things with Parliament's own administration before doing so.
Lastly, on external policy, our rapporteur has indicated the need to set priorities.
We know that scarce resources in the budget will be with us for the foreseeable future.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy there is a very good idea, although not one taken up in Mr Costa Neves' report at the present time, that we should be seeking external advice on how to set priorities in foreign policy, so that we can begin to have some direction in the longer term as to how our money should be spent.
We should investigate that more.
Turning to the Buitenweg report, I should also like to emphasise the very clear emergence of interinstitutional cooperation in environmental and transport matters and as regards an interinstitutional recruitment office - which I very much hope will soon be up and running, to ensure that European citizens get the best value for money.
There are one or two areas where perhaps there will be difficulties regarding interinstitutional cooperation, not least as regards early retirement.
While we certainly support that, we would prefer to have a compulsory system, were that to be possible under the statute.
We have had our discussions on the 2001 budget on that particular matter, and will certainly be looking to have these proposals applied within Parliament if possible.
But most important - and here I address the Secretary-General of Parliament - is the letter which the president of my group sent to the President of Parliament yesterday about the absolute need to have a multi-annual plan for enlargement before the first reading of Parliament's budget so that we can get a grip on what is likely to come in terms of expenditure in linguistic services and a whole range of other matters.
Please do not expect us to approve what you might propose later in the summer without having had a full debate with our political groups.
That is highly unlikely to happen unless we are given the time to examine them effectively.
To conclude, I welcome the fact that this interinstitutional spirit is emerging.
We would like to promote that, respecting the fact that each institution has the right to take its own decisions.
I hope that we will come to the right decisions concerning value-for-money for the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Costa Neves, for the remarkable job they have done in getting these guidelines together in such a short space of time.
They are relative newcomers to our committee and they have shown their grasp of what our committee is about.
With this type of guideline we will not go far wrong as we go through this year.
I wish to comment on several items.
First, Mr Costa Neves' report and the Commission's budget.
The big problem that we have had in the last two years has been with Category 4, especially the Balkans, trying to get the correct amount of money, having arguments with the Council, using the flexibility instrument and all in all not having a satisfactory procedure.
Hopefully those problems will be solved and we should not be in that situation for next year.
Having said that, we still await the World Bank report on the needs of Serbia.
But when the ad hoc delegation went to Serbia earlier this year, and we were discussing this with the World Bank, they made the point that they would be looking at the supply side to see what the needs of Serbia were.
To my understanding this meant that we will see what the donors can give before we decide what the needs are.
Even with that type of statement, we will not be in the same situation on trying to find the funds for Category 4 for next year.
We will see problems arising in the future with Category 5.
The present SAB 2 for 2001, as Markus Ferber mentioned earlier, is causing some people concern, not just about the needs of the Council in that SAB but also about what it is going to do to the margin of Category 5.
When we had the trialogue last Thursday, the Swedish Presidency took on board, and were very amenable to, what we were saying.
We stressed that there is a need for the three institutions to get together as soon as possible to start talking about the margins - especially in Category 5, but we have to start looking at Categories 3 and 4 as well.
On Category 1, the BSE crisis and now foot-and-mouth are raging, if that is the right word.
Foot-and-mouth is certainly raging in the Member State I come from and in the region that I represent.
The Council and Commission have made it quite clear that there will be no new money next year in Category 1.
Whatever the consequences of these two diseases, the money will have to be found from within Category 1.
Members need to be made aware of that before they start expecting new monies to be made available by the Council.
The fourth point on the Costa Neves report is the Commission reforms referred to in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9.
These are essential.
I would ask the Council to give some indication as to what they will be proposing for a legal base for the early retirement scheme.
Until we know that we cannot really make our mind up as to what we should be supporting for next year.
On the Buitenweg report, can I comment on the fact that enlargement is a problem.
The Interinstitutional Agreement states that any needs for enlargement will be met through a revision of the financial perspective.
What then do we do when we want to plan for language training, new recruitment or adaptation of buildings?
This is what Mr Elles was touching on and I am trying to be more subtle by saying that what we need to be doing is looking now at what the needs of enlargement are, and once again talking with the other institutions to look at a revision for enlargement.
We need to resolve this between the three institutions.
It is something that will not go away and as each week passes it approaches quicker and quicker.
The Colom i Naval report seems to have caused a lot of problems recently but hopefully we will have a solution in the very near future and those in the Member States who have been ringing around and those in the Commission who have been - dare I say - panicking can put their minds at rest.
Finally there is the Haug report which no one else has mentioned but I need to mention it.
If I were not the chairman of the Budgets Committee but just a simple member, I would say that I have doubts with Mrs Haug's report and I would not vote for amendment 3. But, of course, I am the chairman and I cannot say those things, so I won't.
Mr President, I would also like to thank the three rapporteurs for their fine reports and add that I definitely believe that these reports indicate that we consider the budget a political instrument.
The three reports establish a number of obvious political priorities.
In particular, I should like to highlight Mr Costa Neves' report. It contains a follow-up to the decision made at the Lisbon Summit last year and confirmed at the Stockholm Summit, namely that we must create the most competitive economy in the EU within the next ten years.
I think this is a splendid priority, and we must ensure that it is reflected in the Budget, especially within the area of what are called internal Community policies.
I am also delighted that we are continuing the work of ensuring that structural fund appropriations are followed up so that what we commit ourselves to is also what is put into practice and so that a proper balance between commitment and payment appropriations is established.
In collaboration with the Liberal group, I have put forward an amendment to the effect that we must continue with the reform of the funding under the so-called 'A 30 lines' .
Some organisations are funded year after year and actually become dependent on these funds.
This is something that must be addressed.
As a parliamentarian, I believe we must support the Commission' s work on ensuring transparent management of the funds so that taxpayers can be certain that efficient management is in place and that the political objectives are being fulfilled.
The argument that 'we are used to being funded' must not be the decisive factor, and there must be the possibility of innovation and new initiatives.
Finally, I would like to add that it is important that we continue to support the Commission' s reform through our prioritising of the Budget.
It is essential for the EU that the Commission has a good reputation externally and that there should be no doubt that we have a good and stable administration.
In this respect, we should obviously take account of the future significance of enlargement for our administration .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we support the majority of the 2002 budget guidelines, namely those that give priority to food safety and the BSE crisis and some general measures on immigration, unfortunately, the resolution is guilty of abuses that our group cannot accept because they are detrimental to the interests of farmers.
To seek to call into question the common agricultural policy because of mad cow disease is not only immoral behaviour, but it is also a refusal to draw all the consequences from 15 years' worth of oversights and cover-ups, which have led to the situation as we know it today.
Our group is not in favour, therefore, of paragraph 11 of the resolution, which not only demands that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory spending be abolished, but also that agricultural legislation should now be brought under the codecision procedure.
With regard to Mrs Buitenweg' s report, some of its provisions are unacceptable.
To call for administrative expenditure to be brought under differentiated appropriations is to pave the way for a swift and significant accumulation of further amounts remaining to be paid.
A final word on Mr Colom i Naval' s report.
We are dubious about the proposed increases being introduced gradually, especially because the suggested plan would not prevent considerable amounts of non-committed funds from accumulating.
Mr President, no one would seriously question that food safety, food quality, consumer protection and sustainable agriculture should be priority economic policy objectives for the EU.
But as we all know, there is more than one way to skin a cat, so the real question is how we intend to achieve this objective in practice.
Off-the-shelf solutions are often used to achieve policy objectives - in this case, the Costa Neves report cites the new European Food Safety Authority.
We all know that new authorities need additional budgetary resources, but that these are hard to come by.
If we really want to achieve the economic policy objective I have mentioned, we cannot rely on doing this just by creating a new authority.
No, if we want to attain this goal, we have to reform the common agricultural policy, particularly, of course, with the planned eastward enlargement in mind.
In previous parliamentary terms, we have supported large agricultural concerns at the expense of small farmers.
We need to act quickly to put this right, so that the remaining small farms, which have always produced food of a very high quality, once again receive an income guaranteeing their economic existence. That is the only way we can translate these objectives into reality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group accepts Mr Costa Neves' s budget guidelines with great satisfaction, principally, because they clearly demonstrate to the Commission and the Council the course that we wish to take in drawing up the 2002 budget.
We have always argued that interinstitutional cooperation is the best way to make progress in a budgetary negotiation.
We have even argued this at the most tense moments in relations between the Council and the European Parliament.
Nevertheless, experience tells us that clear and very specific guidelines promote consensus in this House.
That is why there are so few amendments and, furthermore, they promote the message which we must send at the beginning of the process, above all to the other wing of the budgetary authority.
Also, adjusting the financial perspective because of the lack of implementation of the 2000 budget has become a crucial issue for Parliament.
The consensus proposal presented by the Commission satisfies the two concerns of both budgetary authorities: firstly, it does not raise the overall figure for appropriations until the end of the programming period, as the Council wants, bound as it is by the budgetary limitations of the Member States; and, secondly, it transfers most of the commitment appropriations until the end of the period, which favours compliance with the Berlin agreements, which is what this Parliament demanded.
We therefore hope that the Council can give the green light to this proposal, on which, through the Committee on Budgets, this Parliament has already expressed its favourable opinion.
It is true that modifying the scale of commitment appropriations could create certain negotiation problems for the Commission with particular Member States, especially in relation to programmes yet to be approved in Objective 1.
However, the agreement we may reach envisages a further month of negotiations between both institutions and also provides a further four weeks to approve these new programmes in Brussels, especially those which relate to Objective 1.
Ladies and gentlemen, I repeat that the worst option would be not to have the opportunity to rebudget, because that would mean losing more structural appropriations, which were possibly going to be lacking at the end of the period.
If the Council reaches an initial agreement today, we should not have any problems reaching a final agreement and, in any event, I repeat, we have sufficient time before 3 May for this agreement to come to fruition.
We would like to thank the Commission for playing the role of mediator between the other two institutions.
On occasions, we in this House complain about the Commission' s lack of initiative, trapped as it is between two other institutions which hold different positions, and having very little room for manoeuvre.
But what we can never deny is the Commission' s capacity for mediation and compromise in order to produce reasonable proposals.
I would finally like to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on her guidelines for the budget of other institutions, which takes the route of consensus, which will be useful for us and will mean that, for her, the negotiation of the budget will be sufficiently fruitful, peaceful and calm.
Mr President, I too want to start by congratulating Mrs Buitenweg both on the report itself and on the way in which she has sought to accommodate and integrate different viewpoints.
I welcome the emphasis she has put in the adoption of ABB because I believe it is critical to the future transparency of all the EU institutions and will affect how they will work.
My group particularly welcomes the reference to the assistance statute and the funding for political parties.
I also wholeheartedly support the emphasis in these guidelines on enlargement and the implications of decisions taken at Nice.
However, what concerns me is the piecemeal approach taken to date by all the institutions when looking at the budgetary implications of this topic.
What is needed is the joint comprehensive strategy that this report calls for, encompassing all aspects of enlargement both in the short term and in the longer term.
It is crucial that we fully anticipate and evaluate the budgetary consequence that enlargement will have on all the institutions, because if we do not we will have difficulty maintaining budgetary discipline and efficiency.
We have therefore asked for each institution to present a strategy setting out how it sees the impact of enlargement on its services.
The strategy needs to be radical, especially in relation to interpretation and translation services, because this is likely to be the biggest area of growth: we could end up with a public service of something like 60 000 employees and that will hardly be value for money for the European taxpayer.
That is why my group is very concerned about paragraph 12 which asks for figures to be included in the PDB before we have actually debated a strategy.
That really is putting the cart before the horse.
Secondly, I have further concerns about the wisdom of including paragraph 19 in these guidelines because it asks for a full review of all the standing committees at the halfway mark in this Parliament.
All this will achieve is greater disruption and confusion, and it goes against the level of planning we are asking from all the institutions elsewhere in the report.
Therefore, I would urge our colleagues in the PPE-DE to withdraw these amendments.
Mr President, the Community budget is the blood supply to a sustainable common agricultural policy.
It is difficult to recall a more challenging time for agriculture and the future of European farmers.
BSE and foot-and-mouth have added a new and unexpected dimension to the European agenda.
The psychological impact on farmers and rural communities is considerable.
The consequences for farm income, and by implication the agricultural budget, are difficult at this time to comprehend.
The continuity of farming as a sustainable career for new entrants has again been brought into focus.
Consumers remain confused and bewildered.
There is still considerable misinformation on the safety of the food chain, and in particular meat products. Hence the worrying decline in meat consumption.
Against this background I caution against any attempt to radically alter the administration and structure of the agricultural budget agreed in Berlin.
With both BSE and foot-and-mouth farmers by and large are innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control.
It would certainly be a serious mistake to allow the current crisis to panic us into introducing drastic budget changes which would militate against the sustainability of European family farming.
Mr President, first of all I want to say that we very often discuss the budget as if it were an end in itself.
We argue about amendments that the European public will not understand.
We debate the difference between commitments and appropriations and all sorts of technical details that mean nothing to the European public.
These things are necessary, but they should not be the picture that is presented to the people of Europe.
The people of Europe want a budget that serves their interests and a budget that serves the political objectives of the European Union.
This is extremely important.
The long-term objectives of the European Union should be served as best we can by the budget.
In sitting down to draw up our long-term plans we should recognise the interests of the Union, its cohesiveness, its solidarity and its influence in the world.
We are being misled at the moment on the whole question of the size of the budget.
Mr Wynn says that the Council says there is no more money: absolute rubbish!
There was a time when we had a limit of 1.1%.
I went around the cities of Europe with Mr Colom i Naval and others and we asked them to sanction expansion of the budget by the 1.27% - we needed at the time.
We got it - and very responsibly we did not spend it.
It is still there.
We now have a crisis in agriculture particularly and that crisis needs to be addressed.
In Berlin we did not foresee that we were going to have a foot-and-mouth crisis and we did not foresee the BSE crisis either.
We are, therefore, in a new situation and it is misleading and incorrect to say there is no money to resolve it.
When we had swine fever, we gave EUR 800 million to German and Dutch farmers.
Today, when the British farmers have a major problem, are we going to change the rules of the game and refuse to give the British farmers the assistance to which they are entitled under the Treaties?
We cannot change the rules and we cannot deny it to them.
Their own government has crucified them by refusing to allow them into the single currency.
The European Union cannot add insult to that injury by saying that it is not its responsibility that they have a serious problem in the area of foot-and-mouth.
If the Council insists there is a limit, we have to insist that it is 1.27%.
There is plenty of money to resolve the problem for the next two years and following that we can still have that 1.27% which I hope will finance enlargement.
Mr President, I feel it is exceptionally important that the budget guidelines should address important and major issues.
We have in actual fact undertaken to receive new countries as Member States in time for the European elections in 2004, and most of us are probably agreed that this is a great and historic commitment of ours and something which should also be reflected in the Budget guidelines.
In my view, that does not emerge clearly enough in the section relating to the Commission.
Our commitment to those countries now negotiating for membership means that those countries which fulfil the Copenhagen criteria in the negotiations are also entitled to become Members.
There is obviously a significant degree of uncertainty built into this.
We do not know to which countries this will apply, or how many of them there will be.
Nor, to relate the issue to Mrs Buitenweg' s budget guidelines, do we therefore know how many new languages will have to be interpreted and translated from and into. That point is worth emphasising.
The future I am describing is just three years away from us.
The enlargement process does not only entail a commitment with which the applicant countries must comply, but also a commitment with which the EU must comply.
In this connection, I believe there are two things which must happen with immediate effect.
The first thing is that the Commission must come back with calculations of the budgetary consequences of different permutations of the enlargement process, depending upon which, and how many, countries are concerned.
The other thing is that we can no longer put off the language issue but must be completely serious about getting to grips with it.
Mrs Buitenweg' s guidelines are excellent in the way they address the issue.
I assume, therefore, that it will also be vigorously pursued in the course of the year.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each year, at the beginning of the budgetary procedure, we face the challenge of responding to a public which is justifiably concerned and to the challenge of discovering whether we are capable of achieving a serious and effective balance in order to guide the next budget in such a way that taxpayers will know on what, how and why the European Union is going to spend their money.
I would firstly like to express my satisfaction at the excellent work of the general rapporteur, Mr Carlos Costa Neves, and to congratulate and wish Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Colom every success so that they can reach the agreement we all need as soon as possible.
All of us are concerned, and with good reason, not only about achieving a financial regulation which meets the legitimate demands of this Parliament, but also about the Union' s political will to deal with the phenomenon of illegal immigration.
I am grateful that Mr Costa Neves has had the political sensitivity to lend budgetary support to this priority.
I would ask the Commission and the Council to show the same concern and sensitivity, which must be translated into programmes in favour of true integration, into effective support for the regions of origin and into the creation of a common immigration policy which will support and facilitate the work of the Member States in this area.
Although immigration, the repercussions of enlargement on agricultural spending, the animal health crisis and consumer protection generate disquiet and concern throughout the Union, the sectoral problems must also be responded to within these budgetary guidelines.
I would ask for solidarity for the fisheries sectors in Spain and Portugal.
Thousands of workers and hundreds of vessels are waiting for compliance with the safeguard clause laid down at the European Council in Nice in relation to aid for the restructuring of the Community fleet which has been unable to work.
Given Morocco' s clearly hostile response throughout the negotiation process, the European Union must respond effectively and with solidarity.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to two areas.
Before I do that, I would like to thank both Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg for their clear explanation and the start they have made.
Allow me to begin with the fisheries sector.
Partly in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, I have observed that this sector is facing a difficult time.
I would draw your attention to the cod recovery plan for the North Sea, which is having a major impact on the fishermen in the surrounding area.
An agreement with Morocco, which is failing to materialise, has, in turn, huge implications for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen.
There is increasing criticism with regard to the use of Community funding to finance agreements with third countries, and with good reason.
The spending of that funding, particularly in the developing countries, is not being monitored effectively.
In addition, the Green Paper is casting its shadow ahead, and it could be used as a crowbar to step up the involvement of the fisheries sector in the sustainable management of fish stocks, and to modernise the fleet.
The question is, therefore, to what extent a kind of set-aside programme, which would include nature conservation, as is applied in agriculture, could also be successful in fisheries.
There is hardly any room in the fisheries budget.
Neither is there any room for extra spending with regard to the social and re-training policy for the benefit of the fisheries sector, never mind extra investments for the working conditions and safety on fishing vessels.
This week, a report will be discussed which clearly shows that the fisheries sector claims no less than 24 000 victims a year as a result of accidents at work.
In agriculture, it is obvious that the crisis in the beef sector requires an in-depth discussion on the agricultural policy' s overhaul.
A key element in this connection is that food is a basic necessity of life.
A high level of interaction is required between the farmer and consumer, the government being a vital link.
The current policy brings this insufficiently into focus, and one can question whether the Berlin Agreement provides sufficient room for such a switch-over.
If that is not the case, we must really examine how this overhaul can be financed, and it is questionable whether, for example, a consumer levy for food produced in a sustainable manner should not be introduced in the EU, given the fact that such a levy has been in place for many other products for a long time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why does the Council want a competitive Europe?
And why do we support this objective?
For us, it is a case of safeguarding jobs in Europe and creating new and attractive jobs.
That is the number one priority.
The crisis in farming caused by BSE and other diseases will lead to employment problems in agriculture, the meat trade and many other businesses.
That means that we need to think about how we can plan for the future and open up new possibilities for the workforce.
There are two very well known approaches to moving forward here, namely investment in training and in research.
As regards research, money particularly needs to be invested in market research, that is to say into what products consumers buy, and also, of course, in product research - for example, how can renewable energy be produced in the agricultural sector to counteract Europe's dependence on imports? There are two sectors that will create a great many jobs in the future.
One of these is the computer industry, including the development of hardware and software, the information technology of the future, and the other is that we all want to live to a healthy old age, which means that we need social support mechanisms, and we need research into biotechnology to guarantee a healthy old age.
To achieve this, we therefore need access to finance, particularly for micro-companies.
Nowadays, it is almost impossible for a company with less than 10 employees to obtain finance unless the family, or extended family, can provide security.
We must advocate concrete measures in this area, as companies with less than 250 employees after all account for 60% of GNP and 60% of employment in Europe.
Mr President, can I first congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg on their excellent presentation of the expectations for next year.
I am sure that Parliament is properly under control for that period.
This morning I want to concentrate on just one issue: structural funding.
Why it has not yet been fully used and what should its future be?
I want to be both controversial and constructive.
Either through poor administration or delayed planning of what should happen and what should be approved by the European authorities, and perhaps in conjunction with the national authorities, we are behind on spending on structural funding both for inner-cities and rural areas.
Now, I want to be controversial and I am spelling out that word, because I do not agree that all we should do is push back the spending and get an enormous lump in four or five years time.
We should be looking ahead.
When enlargement takes place, the countries coming into the European Union will be expecting structural funding; the very funding which our existing countries will be deprived of because they will not be able to benefit if we have to satisfy one budget on structural funding.
In other words, the new countries will expect and should obtain funding for their requirements.
My way around this is to say that the funds that have not been used so far should be lost to the system.
As we have heard, this is the intention.
But why not take advantage of that straight away?
Why not send back the funding that has not been used to the countries who pay the contributions?
They are mainly the ones hit by foot-and-mouth.
They need to use that money to compensate for the crisis in rural areas.
- Mr President, on behalf of the Environment Committee, I would like to add a few final words before the Commissioner sums up.
We have watched with interest the development of the budgetary process so far and we thank the two rapporteurs who have produced a good report along the right lines.
But I want to emphasise some issues and I hope Mrs Schreyer will take them up and endeavour to ensure that they are pushed through the Commission.
First, we have long called upon the Commission to do more with regard to greening the budget.
The area of agriculture remains largely untouched and much more work needs to be done on greening the Structural Funds and other areas of the Commission's activity.
We would look for a fresh initiative from the Commission on this.
Make sure the money is properly spent in a sustainable way.
With regard to the spending of money external to the Union, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, we would hope that the Commission will focus its efforts, particularly through the Phare Programme and other projects guaranteeing the implementation and enforcement of European Union legislation.
These countries have signed up to the acquis communautaire and we expect them to satisfy its requirements before they enter the Union.
We cannot compromise on environmental standards in those areas.
I hope that monies will be directed towards ensuring that.
As regards public health, an area of competence that was enlarged during the Amsterdam Treaty and is currently undergoing reform, we would hope that the outcome of that reform will be an enlarged programme on public health issues and that the Commission will accept that and find the necessary funding - which inevitably will mean more than they are spending now.
Whilst the legal justification for action in the area of public health is clear, it seems to me that there is still a lack of clarity with regard to the legal basis for action by the Commission in some other areas.
I would ask the Commission to renew its efforts to clarify the legal basis for some areas of action in the field of the environment.
There are two other important issues which I want to bring to the attention of the Commission.
First, there is an ongoing confusion about the funding of certain NGOs and the monies provided by the Commission for their funding.
Please get this sorted out.
Finally, we have long argued in this Parliament about the problem of the subsidy on tobacco production in southern Europe and the other issues related to tobacco production.
We need a new initiative from the Commission on this.
It is time to break the deadlock.
The continued spending of money in that way is unacceptable.
I hope the Commission has heard what we say.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present crisis in farming - the BSE crisis and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease - has stimulated public interest in the EU budget.
People keep asking if it is still possible to finance it or if this crisis has shot the EU budget to pieces.
These questions demonstrate that the EU's budget planning must be flexible enough to cope with unforeseen expenditure.
On the other hand, expenditure to which there is a legal entitlement has to be financed, multiannual programmes have to be implemented and there most also be scope for setting new priorities.
Today we are debating the priorities for the 2002 budget, and this is the first time, as has already been emphasised, that all three institutions involved in the budgetary process - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - have identified their priorities at this stage.
I would like to thank the Council, who are absent today, for this new form of cooperation through the General Affairs Council, which discussed external policy in its priorities back in January, and through the Ecofin Council, which discussed the priorities for the 2002 budget as a whole in March.
I would also like to thank the European Parliament very sincerely, and you in particular, Mr Costa Neves, as the general rapporteur on the coming year's budget.
Mr Costa Neves, setting priorities is the first building block for cooperation on the budget for any given year.
It extends to the adoption of the budget and following on from that to the entire budget year, in the context of implementation.
For my part I would like to offer full cooperation so that we get a good budget and good budget implementation in 2002.
The framework for next year's budget is determined by the financial perspective, by Agenda 2000, which has been referred to so often.
Overall, on the basis of this financial perspective, new financial commitments that can be entered into next year could rise by 2.9% compared with this year.
The financial perspective would allow a far higher rate of increase in means of payment, namely 7%, but just how much of this is actually necessary will become apparent when the preliminary draft budget is produced and after that under the further consultation process.
The financial perspective allows the highest rate of increase in agricultural expenditure.
I am stressing that point in particular because it has been touched upon in many of the speeches we have heard.
At any rate, in accordance with the financial perspective, an increase in absolute agricultural policy expenditure of EUR 2.5 billion is possible next year as compared with this year.
That is certainly not chicken feed.
But, of course, the question that arises is whether we can cope with this rate of increase without having to make decisions about structural savings.
We all know that this depends on market trends and, of course, also on certain decisions about common market organisations that have still to be taken: the COM in sugar and the COM for cotton, to name just two.
These are still on the Council's table.
However, another key factor, of course, is how last year's agricultural policy budget turns out and what the prospects are for the further spread of foot-and-mouth disease.
As you know, the EU budget has to reimburse 60% of certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in connection with foot-and-mouth.
For several weeks now, there has been a working group of the Agriculture, Budget and Health and Consumer Protection Directorates-General, which makes almost weekly estimates of cost trends, and I have to say that because of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease there has, of course, been a sharp rise in costs.
Estimated expenditure passed the EUR 100 million mark a week ago.
These reimbursement payments will fall due next year, in the 2002 budget, and will, of course, have to be provided for, just as a decision has still to be made on expenditure arising from the BSE crisis, in the form of a second package of measures to combat the effects of that crisis.
The subject of an interim review of agricultural policy has also been raised.
This is a process that will now be starting in order to examine our agricultural policy.
In all areas of policy, including agricultural policy, we keep asking whether all the expenditure is justified.
And for a great deal of expenditure that we have to set, such as that to deal with surpluses, it is worth asking if action is really being taken in the right area or if it would not be better to spend money elsewhere. In the case of agriculture, it might, for example, be better directed towards achieving objectives in the areas of consumer and environmental protection, animal and landscape conservation, and structural improvement in rural development.
When it comes to the agriculture budget - let me emphasise this point once again, as it was also confirmed in Stockholm - the upper limit in the financial perspective has to be observed, which is why a proposal for structural savings might have to be agreed for the 2002 preliminary draft budget.
We are currently examining whether or not this will be necessary.
But one thing is clear, and I think I can say that there is a consensus on this amongst everyone involved in the budget process: on no account will rural development programmes be cut.
This would be totally counterproductive if in the middle of a crisis during which everyone is talking about the need for reform, and in which everyone is talking about the need for more environmental protection, for more landscape conservation, for instance, if in those circumstances that programme were to be cut.
I believe it is fair to say that there is a general consensus within the EU that that would be totally out of the question.
This crisis has shaken consumer confidence in food safety, and President Prodi stressed in his first speech here as President of the Commission how important food safety would be in the Commission's work programme.
And you, Mr Costa Neves, on behalf of Parliament, have made it clear both in your report and in your speech how important this is for the next budget. The same point has also been made very clear in other speeches this morning.
I believe that we can definitely say today that the European Food Safety Authority will be set up at the beginning of next year, and I believe that as regards budgetary provision there is a general consensus that the resources for this - by which I mean both operational appropriations and human resources for the European Food Safety Authority - will be included in the 2002 budget.
I think that is good news for all consumers.
Of course, full provision is made for important structural support programmes in the budget planning process.
The new period of support started last year, and because of the major changes not all programmes could be approved in time or the relevant funds committed.
That is why the wise precaution was taken of stipulating in the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement that appropriations not committed in the previous year can be carried forward.
EUR 6.15 billion are involved here.
Mr Colom i Naval made some observations about this.
Of course, we need to find the must practical solution possible for this re-budgetisation and for adjusting the financial perspective.
I also regret that we have not managed to get everyone together so that we could agree the relevant figures today.
Nevertheless, I think that things are heading in the right direction, and to respect the IIA, a decision needs to be taken by 1 May.
Given that 1 May is a holiday, I think that 2 May would be just as good.
Mr Costa Neves, on behalf of Parliament, you have identified some further priorities for the next budget that I would like to comment on.
Firstly, the problem of illegal immigration.
I would like to point out once again that the 2001 budget already includes funding for an action to carry out educational and information work in the countries of origin, in order to tackle the problem at source.
Many people are brought here by gangs of traffickers.
This really is about trafficking in human beings, and we need to do everything we can to combat this.
And, of course, those people who said that in the field of legal policy it is not always a matter of providing new operational appropriations, but rather the appropriate human resources, were quite right, and Commissioner Vitorino's Directorate-General, which is responsible for this area, has so far been allocated additional posts in every staffing round.
Secondly, there is the area of e-learning.
It has been pointed out how important this is for the objective of making Europe a knowledge-based economy.
Of course, the issue of equipping classrooms with computers or giving schools Internet access is above all a matter for the Member States, under the principle of subsidiarity.
We should not forget that.
But at the same time it is naturally a good thing if all the Member States adopt ambitious targets.
Financial aid for meeting these objectives is available from several EU programmes, and this should be made more visible to the public, so that it is clear to them what their money is being spent on at EU level.
In other words, this is a good example to demonstrate that EU taxes are not just spent on emergency actions such as culling cattle, but that these taxes are also being invested in the future of the rising generation.
Because of the frontloading of the Balkan programme over the last two years, it seems that it will no longer be necessary to increase the budget provision for external actions next year.
As Mr Wynn remarked, this still has to be confirmed by the World Bank report.
The Commission would like to prioritise the Mediterranean Development Assistance Programme, not so much by entering into new commitments, but rather by implementing existing commitments in concrete and visible projects from which the public benefits.
I would like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is for the reform of the Commission to bring the peer group evaluation process to a satisfactory conclusion, so that the 317 Commission posts in priority areas can be filled.
That is why we are once again requesting the budgetary authority for these posts.
At present there are 27 700 posts in all in the European Union's establishment plan.
I believe that this is a number that we should keep reminding people about, because the public often imagine that far more people are involved.
The Commission accounts for 18 400 of these, the Council for 2 650, and Parliament for 4 260.
I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg for her report, which makes it clear that the margin for administrative expenditure is rather tight and that successful cooperation is therefore needed if we are to get by here in future.
I totally agree with her approach, which is that administrative preparations for enlargement should be undertaken jointly by all the institutions and that this is genuinely an area for sensible interinstitutional cooperation.
I would like to briefly expand on the question of Category 8.
These funds are made available for the new enlargement countries, so if there is no enlargement, this funding is, of course, not made available.
I do not think that it makes much sense at the moment to talk about topping up pre-accession aid.
In conclusion, the budget process does not just mean taking decisions about figures; it is also about converting the figures into successful policies.
That is why implementation issues have quite rightly been addressed in priority setting by the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
Reducing old liabilities, reducing payment delays and making budgetary decisions easier to understand are cornerstones of our policy here and will be covered in the Commission's progress report to Parliament.
The decision that the budgetary authority will present weekly figures on budget implementation means, and I am proud to say this, that the Commission will really be in the vanguard of the movement for greater budgetary transparency.
We are also working on making the budget plan more comprehensible, step by step, so that it is a source of information not just for budget experts, but also for the public.
Last year we introduced activity-based budgeting, and this year we are creating a clear link between strategic objectives and the allocation of resources, especially human resources.
This will make the budget process more transparent, and will gradually make the budget what it ought to be - an expression of our shared political priorities.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place - and, if appropriate, Mr Colom i Naval' s may be withdrawn - at 12 noon today.
Determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0101/2001) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for the European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 as concerns the use of ESA 95 in the determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource.
Mrs Haug has the floor.
. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the adoption of the 1996 Council Regulation on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community, we have had a new and modified system, ESA 95.
However, this new system for budgetary and own resources calculation will not apply until the new own resources decision comes into effect.
When ESA 95 was adopted, it was assumed that the new own resources decision would be adopted in 1999.
We now know that in fact that did not happen until September 2000.
It will probably come into force on 1 January 2002, if all the Member States ratify it without delay.
So that is the legal position.
It is evident that the Member States have now adjusted their own national accounting systems and that data is no longer available on the 1979 basis.
This means that the letter of the Commission's proposal amending the regulation on the determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource does not match actual practice.
We, the entire Committee on Budgets, are assuming that the switch from ESA 79 to ESA 95 will have no impact on the level of own resources, that is neither on the balance between the Member States nor, of course, on the total volume of own resources.
So far, so good.
Honourable Members will perhaps think that this is a rather dry subject, but we have taken advantage of this opportunity under the codecision procedure, and we should never forego any opportunity to emphasise the importance of own resources in setting the European Union's budget and financial perspective.
When you do that, it does not seem so dry any more, because it is no secret that Parliament, as one arm of the budgetary authority, would like to have full budget rights, that is to say codecision not just on expenditure but also on the revenue side.
That is why we are now trying to take a tiny step towards that goal.
The Commission is willing to actively support us in this task.
I really wish to specifically thank the Commissioner very sincerely for that.
It is willing to present a working paper on the state of play regarding the collection of own resources to us at the beginning of the budget process.
This document will also provide information on good and in some cases not so good collection practice in the Member States.
And it will provide us with a good basis for discussion, for a debate with the Council on EU revenue.
However, it is also no secret that on this issue the Council's approach is just as unwieldy as the rather long title of the regulation whose amendment we are discussing right now.
Not only will it not consider codecision with Parliament on own resources, as was apparent at Nice, it does not even want to talk with us in either a formal or informal trialogue.
And please note that we are not talking about negotiations here, just discussions.
The Council is simply refusing to cooperate with Parliament on this - and not just refusing to cooperate but refusing to grant Parliament some of its parliamentary rights.
This not only affects the budget, it seems to be a general trend at present.
Members are having to fight for their parliamentary rights as regards the framework legislation on financial services.
We are having to fight as regards the directive on the European Company statute.
We are having to fight over human resources for the common foreign and security policy.
I really do not claim that this is an exhaustive list, but one thing is clear: safeguarding Parliament's rights is not something that can be taken for granted in 2001 - Members themselves have to constantly fight to secure these rights.
That is why I am utterly convinced that my colleagues, including the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, will firmly support us when we insist that there should at least be a discussion with the Council on our own resources.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group agrees with Mrs Haug' s report on payments to the VAT-based own resources.
This Parliament has tried, through every means possible, to influence the Council on its new decision on own resources.
Unfortunately, and despite the fact that Mrs Haug last year played the roles of both general rapporteur for the 2001 budget and permanent rapporteur for the European Parliament on own resources, we were not able to make progress in the conciliation procedure with the Council in a manner which was satisfactory to us.
The Council continues to believe that revenues are its exclusive prerogative and does not allow any significant progress in relation to Parliament' s participation.
This is an unfortunate circumstance which those of us who deal with own resources have to face.
Our role is purely consultative, and we believe that this involves the very definition of Parliament' s competences.
The modification of the European System of Accounts, from the replaced 1979 system to the more representative 1995 system, is a good measure which will allow a more realistic and representative revenue since it will provide a more accurate reflection of the accounts of each Member State.
We fully accept the first amendment, in particular because it refers to the neutrality of this change in the system of accounts.
And, since our powers as MEPs are so limited in the field of own resources, the rapporteur' s request for more information, even of a quarterly nature, will improve our position.
We therefore also fully recommend the second amendment.
The third amendment, if we take account of the comments of our Chairman, Mr Wynn, may be a little more complicated, but I believe we must vote in favour on this amendment and then we see what result it has later.
The result will possibly be the same as always: they will ignore us.
In any event, the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 allows us to hold a dialogue on own resources.
These amendments increase the possibility of such a dialogue and must therefore be accepted.
Mr President, Mrs Haug' s report, which is being discussed, concerns a technical alteration that would provide a more accurate basis for collecting VAT-based contributions.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.
The collection system for contributions is a complicated political game that results in Member States attempting to maximise their own benefits and minimise what they pay out.
Although the size of EU contributions is determined as a share of GNP the structure of the contribution is very different from one country to the next.
In Member States where there are large ports revenue from customs duty is considerable and, for that reason, the amount of duty paid in contributions is substantial.
In Berlin there was a lengthy dispute regarding contributions.
As a result, EU financing is becoming more dependent on fourth resources, i.e., direct transfers of funds out of national parliaments' budgets.
The increase in portage from 10% to 25% was a clear concession to the countries with large ports.
The resulting gap in the EU budget is to be bridged by increasing the GNP share.
The other change is the progressive reduction in VAT-based contributions, which will also increase the GNP share.
This is leading to a situation where EU contributions are becoming tied more than ever to budget transfers from individual Member States and gross national earnings, which must now probably be considered only fair.
Only the question of the reduction in contributions made by the United Kingdom will remain open in the future.
In the future enlargement will wreak havoc on the EU budget.
There are a hundred million inhabitants in the new Member States, representing only 4% of GNP, however.
As a result, the contributions from the old Member States will clearly increase from what they are now, and may even double.
In any future decisions taken we must ensure that a rise in contributions does not jeopardise development in the old Member States, especially in the matter of increased regional and social inequality.
. (DE) Mr President, Mrs Haug, ladies and gentlemen, just now we were talking about the expenditure side of the budget, and we are now briefly discussing the revenue side, although only on a statistical basis, that is in relation to the European system of integrated economic accounts.
This data, which is collected via the integrated economic accounts system, is used for various important purposes, such as the own resources ceiling, the calculation of gross national product, the share according to which Member States' contributions are collected and for determining Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource.
The legal basis that we are discussing now relates to the last of these.
What we are talking about now is instead of using the old 1975 basis to use the new statistical basis so as to avoid statistical double counting or costly re-accounting procedures that lead to many errors.
Here in Parliament this has been dealt with by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The latter supports the Commission proposal without reservation, whereas the Committee on Budgets has now formulated various amendments.
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 do not relate to this proposal concerning the statistical basis. Amendment No 2 requests a document on the collection of own resources and Amendment No 3 calls in particular for the trialogue to consider own resources.
Mrs Haug, the Commission cannot accept these last two amendments, although we have agreed to comply with Parliament's wish - the wish of the Committee on Budgets - to provide more information on the collection of own resources in a working paper.
This will mean a delay in the whole decision-making process.
The Commission regrets this, as the Court of Auditors and also the Committee on Budgetary Control have repeatedly criticised the Commission for using the old statistical basis for calculating VAT contributions when collecting own resources.
The situation will have been sorted out by 2002 with the ratification of the own resources decision.
Nevertheless, the Commission would have welcomed it if the statistical simplification and improvements that it proposed last September could have come into effect sooner.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Discharges
Mr President, I wanted to ask who is representing the Swedish Presidency here today for this important debate.
Can you give me a name?
Yesterday, the State Secretary responsible, Mr Malmberg, informed me that to his great regret he cannot be with us today.
I regret this all the more as there will probably be a debate about Sweden's national budget, and he will not be with us here.
Could you please tell us who is representing the Swedish Presidency in today's debate at political level?
Thank you.
Mrs Theato, as always, you are very well informed.
And as you are well informed, you will see that the Council is clearly absent.
I am not going to criticise the Council.
It will explain its reasons at the appropriate moment.
We take good note of its absence.
Mrs Theato has the floor once again for another point of order.
I trust that it is the last one, Mrs Theato.
Mr President, thank you for your trouble. However, I would like the Minutes to show that this House regrets that the presidency is not represented at this important debate.
Your words will appear in the Minutes.
Mrs Stauner has the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report winds up the 1998 discharge procedure.
As this is the first discharge to which the Prodi Commission has been subjected, it has been full of suspense.
The 1998 discharge decision was postponed in April 2000 and discharge was subsequently granted in July 2000, but all this leaves a lot to be desired.
I would like to address just three particular matters of concern.
In 1998, for the fifth consecutive time, the Court of Auditors declined to give a positive Statement of Assurance, or in other words to certify that European taxpayers' money had been used carefully and thriftily.
Parliament therefore certainly did the right thing when it called on the Commission to arrive at a positive Statement of Assurance for the financial year 2003 at the latest.
Unfortunately, the Commission has failed up to now to take concrete and measurable steps in this direction.
It is not enough that the Commission has repeatedly referred to the general reform programme.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission if careful use of European taxpayers' money should not be a priority theme for the Commission.
Or does the Commission perhaps want to celebrate an anniversary in 2003 - ten years of being refused a positive Statement of Assurance?
We judge the Commission not by its words, but by its deeds.
That is why I specifically welcome the deadlines that we have set you for achieving this objective.
The FlÃ©chard case in particular has made it clear that the role of an independent Financial Controller is vital in determining whether a fraud case is admitted or not.
You now want to scrap the independence of the Financial Controller and make him report to the relevant Director-General as part of the reform programme.
There can be no doubt that this would lead to a spectacular fall in the error rate, but probably not because no more errors or frauds were being committed, but rather because the authorising Directors-General would ensure that such matters never came to light at all.
The introduction of an independent disciplinary chamber able to carry out a fair and neutral disciplinary procedure, with the officials responsible being appropriately held to account, is also another long-standing request from Parliament that the Commission has failed to comply with.
The Commission has equally failed to seriously pursue the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to prosecute cases of fraud.
On the subject of access by Members of Parliament to information and documents, I would like to seriously ask the Commissioner how we are to carry out our verification duty if you refuse to let us have information and documentation?
At the beginning of its period of office, the Commission espoused the cause of transparency and openness.
I myself saw during the 1998 discharge procedure how wide the gap is between rhetoric and reality here.
Nor was there any substantial improvement for the 1999 discharge procedure.
You only have to look at Annexes I and II to the Blak report to see that the rapporteur received 22 of the audit reports he requested and, believe it or not, did not receive 11 reports.
I think these figures speak for themselves.
