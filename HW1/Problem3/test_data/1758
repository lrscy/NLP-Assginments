Finally, Mr President, why should we want to deprive Member States of the right to withdraw recognitions when they believe this to be essential for their own safety?
The debate on this report is suspended.
It will continue at 3 p.m.
Mr President, the draft resolution we are about to approve by codecision takes account of a profound change in the VAT system for travel agents.
The urgent need to approve this legislation results from profound changes in the travel industry over the last 30 years, and the innumerable exemptions and derogations currently applicable in a sector where profit margins are very slender.
The principal changes relate to the possibility of companies deducting VAT when they deal with conferences or incentive tourism and on-line bookings, areas where European travel agents must be protected from competitors from outside the Community.
I only hope that the unanimity achieved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs can also be obtained in the Council.
. Mr President, I remember that when my first report was voted on a few months ago, the Commission memorably stated that when it took decisions under the comitology procedure it would be willing to give information to Parliament, but not full information.
This caused great hilarity in the House at the time.
Also, if Parliament objected to a decision it would 'possibly' take account of Parliament's objection.
As you can imagine this caused consternation in the House.
That is why the report was referred back to committee.
I can now report that we have looked at the matter further.
We have had intense discussions with the Commission and what is before you today is a result of those contacts.
The Commission has agreed to forward to Parliament all the information laid down in the interinstitutional agreement that we already have in principle with the Commission.
If Parliament objects to an implementing measure adopted under comitology, then the Commission must either withdraw it, amend it or take account of Parliament's objection in some other way, or come before the House to make a statement to explain why it is taking any other course of action.
That is a significant step forward.
It is not ideal, but it is suitable to tide us over until the new constitution comes into force, which will introduce a new category of delegated legislation giving us further powers under the terms of the constitution.
I commend it to the House.
Clearly it marks considerable and appropriate progress from the point of view of Parliament.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Report (A5-0253/2003) by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Initiative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (14363/2002 - C5-0590/2002 - 2002/0824(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the text)
After the vote:
. Mr President, if the Council is to maintain the text, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was unanimous in wishing to reject this proposal, both for technical and political reasons.
It is possible for Parliament to vote to finally reject the text, rather than refer the matter back to committee.
I do not think that the committee will change its mind, for technical and political reasons.
If the Council is not good enough to be here then we should finally reject it now.
Mr President, I have a small oral amendment.
The committee still addressed its demand to the Convention.
We should change this to 'Intergovernmental Conference' in order to demonstrate that we are up to date.
. (FR) We voted in favour of this report, which concerns the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens and which makes it compulsory for bosses to provide protection and to comply with restrictions on the use of such substances.
Yet the best way of providing protection would be not to use products which give rise to such serious risks to workers' health, and to replace them with less harmful products as soon as techniques are perfected and replacement products are discovered.
. (PT) I decided to support this report, which aims to replace several previous directives on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work.
Indeed, as the advisory group from the legal services department noted, this proposal respects the spirit of the texts codified, simply compiling them into a single document and incorporating the formal changes demanded by the codification process.
I believe this 'codification' to be an appropriate measure for promoting better safety regulations for workers, which is indispensable in the European context.
Dangers such as those dealt with in this proposal, which are so often hidden, must be avoided; that is beyond dispute.
In other words, circumventing them is much better than making amends for them.
Prevention is better than compensation.
This proposal clearly moves in that direction.
In accordance with what was laid down at Lisbon, it aims not only at more employment, but also better employment.
. (PT) I applaud the unanimous approval of this recommendation by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
As has been pointed out, care should be taken to ensure that the use of 'comitology' does not detract from our full compliance with Parliament's legislative procedure and powers of colegislation.
This will prevent any consequent adoption of legislative provisions through implementing measures other than the codecision procedure.
The task is above all to establish a system permitting Parliament properly to exert the powers of control entrusted to it and, if necessary, to contest any implementing measures with which it disagrees, providing those measures originate in the codecision process.
Indeed, Parliament has always come out in favour of greater transparency in the work of the various committees, emphasising in particular the need for the agenda and minutes of committee meetings, attendance registers, drafts submitted to committees in relation to implementing measures, provisional timetables and results of votes to be passed on to Parliament.
Furthermore, all committee documents - except classified documents - should be made available to Parliament and the general public.
. (FR) This report is yet another attempt to bring together the patchwork of disparate national regulations on this subject, this time relating to fertilisers.
Why not?
However, we do not wish to stand surety in advance, by means of a vote in favour, for whatever this regulation might be used for once it has been placed at the disposal of the chemical-fertiliser companies.
This is all the more true given that, as regards the presence of cadmium - which is extremely toxic - in certain fertilisers, the European authorities have once again failed to exert pressure on certain states, and behind those states their groups of chemicals companies, to force them to stop producing and authorising fertilisers which are harmful to the environment and to health.
Not only, therefore, have they not succeeded in ensuring that the cut-off date of 31 December 2001 was met, a date which they themselves had fixed, but they have just granted a scandalous new time limit, namely the end of 2005.
. (PT) Over the last few years, every aspect of the travel industry has undergone profound changes.
Indeed, observers have noted a growing rise in the number and range of services on offer, and a parallel increase in numbers and types of customers.
Given these historical changes, a rapid overhaul of the special VAT scheme for travel agents, in force since 1977, has become imperative.
I therefore wish to express my full support for Parliament's report and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques.
I agree unreservedly with the approval of the changes to the VAT scheme for travel agents, which involve taxing tour operators based outside the EU when they offer their services to European consumers.
This measure will eliminate the unfair competition affecting the European travel industry.
It also strikes a blow against tax evasion on the part of European companies falsely claiming to be based outside the EU and not charging VAT to consumers.
Once these adjustments have been made, the European travel industry will be able to compete on fair and even terms in the highly competitive world travel market, inaugurating a state of affairs which can only have favourable repercussions for our consumers.
Tourism in the Algarve, therefore, can only benefit from this new system.
. (PT) The massive transformation of the labour market we have witnessed over the last few years requires us to alter our information-gathering procedures.
The labour force sample survey proposed in this report will allow us to take ever-more effective steps to create jobs.
The features of this survey, which includes six new variables and the option of differentiating structural variables, will allow us to understand the labour market better and define future economic and employment policies.
In order to achieve the aims of the Lisbon Strategy especially in terms of employment and labour flexibility and in view of the entry into force of so many provisions linked to the European employment strategy, I voted in favour of this report, which approves the Commission's proposal to strengthen this important surveying tool.
. (PT) In voting for this report on the organisation of a quarterly labour force sample survey for the Community, I want to highlight the six new variables introduced: continued receipt of wages and salary, supervisory responsibilities, involvement of the public employment services in finding the current job, overtime hours, contract with a temporary employment agency, and lack of care facilities as a reason for non-participation or part-time work.
All of these will improve the availability of comparable statistics on employment and unemployment trends and describe the structure of labour-market participation by individuals and households.
This deeper understanding will undoubtedly help completely to fulfil the aims of the European employment strategy, and more effectively to adopt measures implementing the Lisbon strategy.
These measures are anxiously awaited by the citizens of Europe.
. (FR) VAT, like all indirect taxes, is a scandal.
It is a tax which is paid at the same rate by the poorest and by the wealthiest, by the unemployed worker and by the billionaire.
In other words, the real problem is not 'administrative cooperation' between States, as proposed by the author of the report, but the fact that VAT's share in State revenue is much greater than that of income tax, which is, at least to some extent, in proportion to the size of taxpayers' incomes.
We are demanding the complete abolition of VAT, and its replacement by a tax on incomes and on wealth which would be highly progressive, to the point where the tax paid by the wealthy classes would make up for the loss of earnings caused by the abolition of indirect taxes.
We voted against this report.
. (PT) As I said in my explanation of vote on the Frassoni report, I agree with this reform of what is known as the 'comitology' procedure.
Greater transparency in the exercise of the Commission's implementing powers, as well as proper Parliamentary control, will undoubtedly allow Community intervention measures to be adopted more effectively and appropriately.
Greater participation at this stage, rather than mere control, will provide better guarantees for citizens that the aims and principles prevailing when the basic instruments were conceived and took shape are being pursued.
That participation will also ensure greater convergence with the legislators' intentions.
. (FR) This report expresses the content, if not the form, of the recriminations of Dutch employers against the European provisions which might result in making it, not impossible, but more difficult for them to sack their employees who are resident in another Member State.
This situation arose as a result of an exceptional combination of circumstances, and the Dutch bosses and authorities regard it as intolerable, as does the rapporteur, who invites the Commission to look into this problem, as if the European authorities needed any encouragement to curtail the rights of workers, when the minds, the concerns and the actions of those authorities are already only too heavily biased towards the bosses.
Naturally we voted against this rapport.
. (PT) In the interests of satisfying the political desire expressed at both Tampere and Laeken to put into effect the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters ('... which ? should become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union'), we have, in the course of this plenary, approved various proposals containing measures whose aim is to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters.
In this context, the ne bis in idem principle is undoubtedly one of the urgent prerequisites in order for mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters and a strengthening of legal security to take place within the Union.
This is a general principal in the criminal process, one which helps to strengthen citizens' rights and freedoms, particularly with regard to procedural guarantees.
It is recognised both at international level and within the various legal systems of the Member States; it aims to safeguard the right not to be tried or prosecuted twice for the same offence.
The aim of this framework decision is to provide the Member States with common legal provisions in relation to this principle, so as to ensure uniformity in the interpretation and implementation of those provisions.
This principle should, therefore, be applied horizontally across the Member States, so that citizens cannot be tried or prosecuted twice for the same offence.
Mr President, I could not wait to take the floor once again in this Chamber and, not least, to deliver these explanations of vote.
I have to say that this regulation, tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Ingo Schmitt, is a major step forwards in European politics, for it replaces 15 - which would soon have become 25 - separate agreements with a single European agreement with the United States of America.
Mrs Elvira Bassi, however, a pensioner from Cremonia in Lombardy, Italy, aware that I was going to speak on this subject, said to me: 'Remember that we pensioners are still waiting for the discounted fares which will enable us to travel more by air.
We want to see the whole of Europe and the whole world, but plane tickets are too expensive.
One day, will we have a discounted European air fare for pensioners and the elderly?
. (FR) Air transport provides one of the many examples of the fact that the so-called European Union is, more than anything else, the cobbling together of the conflicting interests of Member States and their trust companies and major industrial groups.
The European authorities would like Europe to be a bloc in worldwide competition.
They have been no more able to achieve this in the air-transport sector than they have elsewhere, because the big European companies are also in competition with one another.
When it is in their interests to associate with or sign agreements with non-European companies, and in particular American companies, the opinion of the European institutions will not be able to prevent them from doing so.
The author of the report, a supporter of free competition, seeks to reconcile the desire to achieve added value for the Community's airlines with the desire to tame the savage nature of their rivalries.
Let the defenders of capitalist Europe shift for themselves in seeking to square the circle. We, on the other hand, are voting against this report, because we are against this system based on competition which, whether regulated or not, makes an enormous mess of things.
.
(EL) The Commission proposal forms part of the EU's overall strategy to regulate aviation relations between the Community and third countries and to concentrate at Community level competences which have hitherto come under the jurisdiction of the Member States, thereby strengthening the process of swindling the Member States out of their capacity for independent negotiation and reducing their national sovereignty.
Following the referral by the ?U to the European Court and, essentially, the conviction of the eight Member States who have signed 'open skies' type bilateral air service agreements with the USA, the ?U has found a first class opportunity to force the Member States to consent to its intervention and participation in what was hitherto the strictly national matter of negotiating and concluding or renegotiating existing bilateral air service agreements.
In this way, the ?U is literally 'butting into' negotiations between Member States and third countries and this is fostering European integration and the interests of the European aviation monopolies to the detriment of the Member States' capacity to negotiate independently with third countries in accordance with their national interests in order to achieve agreements which are beneficial to them in the field of their aviation relations.
We shall vote against this report because, despite any efforts to mitigate the adverse arrangements, it moves along the same lines as the Commission.
.
(PT) While noting with approval the restrictions introduced by the rapporteur on the European Commission's sphere of competence and freedom of action, limiting and adjusting its capacity to intervene in the area under consideration, I abstained from voting on this report because I believe that its conclusions stem from a legal decision with which I do not agree.
Indeed, this report appeared after the decisions of the Court of Justice, delivered in judgments of 5 November 2002, were made public.
These judgments resolved the positive conflict of jurisdiction between various Member States and the European Commission.
Observing the imprecise, even deficient nature of existing legislation in this area, the Court of Justice decided, as is becoming its custom and practice by force of repetition, to confer on the Commission the jurisdiction it claimed.
While this is nothing new, it is nevertheless deplorable that the principle of subsidiarity is for the most part interpreted in a concentrationary, upward-looking way by Community institutions, limiting the ability of Member States to draw up contracts independently, and thus running counter to its own aims and origins.
Mr President, Mr Watts' report concerns an agreement on maritime transport between the European Union and China.
Of course, I voted for the motion and I support this extremely important agreement between Europe and China, but I still wish - and I would like to voice this desire once more - that, in promoting the trade and economies of other countries, Europe would concern itself with monitoring respect for human beings and democracy in these states.
China is still a communist state and it still has a long way to go: let us help it along the path of European democracy.
.
(FR) We voted against this report, not because we would reject any agreement between Europe and China on matters concerning maritime transport, but because this particular agreement bears the stamp of inequality, and of the imperialist relationship between Europe and the rest of the world.
This is demonstrated by the main points of the agreement, which is heavily weighted in favour of the interests of European shipping companies and their shareholders, and the interests of businesses linked to them.
The agreement does all this and yet it obviously seems so natural to the rapporteur that he does not even show any semblance of caring about the treatment meted out to those who work in the holds of merchant ships, those workers, often Asians, on the back of whose sufferings the ship owners, and especially the European ship owners, and the major groups for which they operate, are enabled to grow fat.
I voted in favour of this report because I feel that the European Community and its Member States will benefit from deeper and more varied trade relations with the People's Republic of China, particularly as regards maritime transport.
In this connection, I applaud the undertaking to ensure non-discriminatory treatment of vessels flying the flag of the other party and to authorise the establishment of subsidiaries, branches or representative offices.
These measures will promote the strengthening of trade relations, as well as greater contact and understanding between civilisations, which could ultimately benefit both parties.
It is important, moreover, to retain the bilateral agreements previously concluded between Member States and the People's Republic of China in all areas not covered by the agreement that is now proposed, as well as to retain such agreements in their entirety wherever their provisions are more favourable.
Mr President, when I think of Mr Radwan, who drafted this report, I see him as I saw Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge when I was a child - sailing through a pool of gold.
I do not know whether, in the heat of this past summer, the pool of money in which Mr Radwan bathed was full of euro or dollars, but the fact remains that this report provides excellent protection for the money which the European citizens deposit in their banks.
Once again, however, I have to speak on behalf of many pensioners, who ask me when they will have rules forcing banks to give pensioners more money and to be more willing to give loans to the elderly who, having few years left to live, have trouble obtaining loans because they do not have much time to repay them.
. (PT) This important report has earned my support.
There can be no doubt of the need to carry out more accurate assessments of the risks involved in the granting of loans by banks, which is why adopting a new agreement (Basel II) is important.
Furthermore, it has been proved that the existence of clear international rules governing minimum capital requirements (Basel I) contributes to the security of financial and legal trade.
For these reasons, conducting an assessment of the new system is of the essence.
Indeed, as the rapporteur warns, we may be about to enter a procyclical phase characterised by limited bank lending and even by economic downturn.
This situation may put a stop to the granting of bank loans, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises.
This will penalise entrepreneurs setting up in business most heavily, and could threaten the future potential of the European economy.
Without playing down the positive effects of the new agreement, therefore, (in particular the prospect of more opportunities for the use of collateral), the Commission must, in the directive which follows the Basel II Agreement, pay close attention to the current state of the European economy and to the rapporteur's calls for a spirit of greater democratic legitimacy in the drafting of these rules, as well as to his warnings about the possibility of unfair competitive advantages over European banks enjoyed by US financial institutions not covered by the agreement but operating within Europe.
I voted for the Mastorakis report, Mr President, because it is genuinely important and commendable for Europe, and therefore for Parliament too, to help the poorest regions to become wealthy regions, which, in turn, will thus be able to help the regions which are currently rich regions but will in the meantime have become poor.
I must point out, however, that it would be appropriate for Europe to define what a region is.
We know, for example, that, in many countries of Central Europe - countries which will become European Union states as of 1 May - regions do not exist.
There will be territorial boundaries marked on paper which are figurative, invented, not uniform de facto geographical realities.
Therefore, greater consideration needs to be given to defining what a region is in Europe.
Mr President, following on from what Mr Fatuzzo said, it is worth remarking that the concept of 'region' is radically ambiguous.
For example, when it comes to constitutional affairs the ancient nation of Scotland currently counts as a region of Europe.
However, when it comes to the funds which we are discussing, Scotland itself has several extremely diverse regions.
For example, the Highlands and Islands include some of the most isolated islands in Europe with extreme problems of transport because of weather and tidal conditions and the costs involved.
The Highlands is one of the most underpopulated mountain regions in Europe.
That contrasts with the Central region of Scotland and again with the Borders region, which is sparsely populated and has its own particular problems.
I am delighted that what we did today in these two reports was to reject proposals for radical renationalisation of Structural Funds.
The United Kingdom Government has been leading the charge on that.
I was glad to see that the European Socialists, including the UK Labour Party, today apparently deserted Mr Brown's proposals about renationalisation.
We came to good conclusions about the need to sustain structural funding at European level and to take seriously the problems of territorial cohesion and permanent geographical disadvantage.
.
(EL) The enlargement of the European Union is creating a new actuality in the regional policy of the Union, which is why there is a need, among other things, to:
continue to distribute resources to regions in danger of exclusion not as a result of their actual progress, but as a result of the change in statistical conditions following the integration of the 10 new Member States of the ?U;
continue to provide transitional support to regions which have exceeded 75% on an actual, not just a statistical basis;
reject the development of the nationalisation of regional policy as a result of the freezing of the budget at pre-enlargement levels;
concentrate on underdeveloped and other acutely structurally disadvantaged regions;
strengthen inter-regional cooperation;
include the regional dimension in all EU policies.
Finally, the Mastorakis report includes worthwhile special proposals.
Basically, the June Movement believes that the structural development funds should be phased out.
Only to the extent that we do in actual fact have the structural development funds should the very small islands too be given their place.
Their particular handicap necessitates support for development processes that can increase settlement and employment, that is to say the promotion of a year-round society on the small islands too.
The June Movement is voting in favour of the report but would point out how grotesque it is that, at the same time as providing development aid, the EU is imposing upon the island societies, through its demands for tendering, a situation in which transport, which is absolutely crucial, is made unnecessarily more expensive.
.
(PT) The European Union's central aim should be to promote economic and social cohesion.
As the Structural Funds are one of the principal tools for achieving that aim, they should be retained at their current levels.
The rapporteur makes some important points, with which we agree, especially:
his opposition to renationalising structural policy, which is a central plank of European unity, and his defence of least-favoured areas, which should remain the Structural Funds' number one priority;
his assertion that regions no longer eligible for Objective 1 as a result purely of the statistical effects of enlargement will not suffer from those statistical effects.
Any pertinent measures should therefore be taken to avoid this injustice, without introducing funding cuts for these areas.
As for the rapporteur's recommendation that the current minimum level of 0.45% of Community gross domestic product continue to be dedicated to the Structural Funds in the next period, the only problem is that this figure is clearly not enough to ensure economic and social cohesion, especially given the fact that enlargement will embrace countries whose per capita income is, on average, about 40% of EU levels.
. (PT) I voted for this report, welcoming in particular the judicious inclusion of a set of 'warnings' relating to current Union cohesion policy.
If these warnings are heeded, they will enable us to take safer and more effective steps forward in harmonising the levels of development of the different regions of Europe.
In other words, it will enable us to pursue the ultimate aim of cohesion.
I hope that the Commission will consider in detail the proposals presented here, from the special needs of the Union's ultra-peripheral regions (where cohesion policy has already proved a valuable spur to development), to the need to simplify the rules for implementing regional policy (by, for example, reducing the bureaucracy involved in payments), to rationalising aims depending on their actual effectiveness.
A particularly sensitive issue is that of artificial increases in the gross domestic product of certain regions of Europe as a direct result of the current enlargement process.
Many, including myself, have asked the European Commission to pay great attention to this area, and I trust that the positive responses I have received from the Commission to my written questions on this issue will come to form part of official policy in future.
.
(PT) Regional and cohesion policies play an important role in European integration.
Objective 1 regions should therefore remain the political and economic priority, and be given greater emphasis.
The regional inequalities emerging as a tangible result of cohesion policies call for a redefinition of those policies' priorities.
Community policies linked to the Cohesion Fund must be gradually regionalised, and their renationalisation must be opposed.
) I envy Mr MacCormick, who has succeeded in saying so much in one minute to illustrate his vote, while I can only manage to say a few words, as on this occasion too, to justify why I voted for Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz' report on cohesion policy in the islands and regions with low population density.
With regard to the latter, the European Parliament is doing well to treat this issue as a matter of importance.
In this connection, I would like to recall, in particular, the Sami people of Finland and Sweden.
As regards the islands, which genuinely have low population density and really are inconvenient places to live, I propose that the Member States increase the pensions of pensioners living on islands.
Greece, for example - the native land of our Commissioner, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou - would see the population of its islands rise again unexpectedly if pensions were higher there.
Mr President, I would like to say that my first explanation of vote was a compendious explanation of my two votes.
I am delighted that you carried these reports on regional funds and I need say no more.
.
(EL) Like my group, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on structurally disadvantaged regions.
The enlargement of the ?U with 10 new members and the stagnation of the Community budget at the same levels are giving rise to serious concerns about Union action in island regions, mountain regions and regions with a low population density in the Union.
It is important to maintain and strengthen 'cohesion policy' and not to create a programming and financing split and inconsistency.
The political principle of 'solidarity' must be fully respected in order to reduce the structural disadvantages of these regions.
The facility to increase funding to disadvantaged regions, depending on the extent of their handicaps, is particularly important.
Finally, I wish to emphasise the urgent need to stop soil erosion in island areas, such as the Aegean, with an extensive drywall network conservation programme.
Basically, the June Movement believes that the structural development funds should be phased out.
Only to the extent that we do in actual fact have the structural development funds should the very small islands too be given their place.
Their particular handicap necessitates support for development processes that can increase settlement and employment, that is to say the promotion of a year-round society on the small islands too.
The June Movement is voting in favour of the report but would point out how grotesque it is that, at the same time as providing development aid, the EU is imposing upon the island societies, through its demands for tendering, a situation in which transport, which is absolutely crucial, is made unnecessarily more expensive.
- (FR) This society of ours, which is fundamentally unequal owing to the inequality between social classes, also hides a multitude of other inequalities.
Thus certain regions which, owing to their geographical position, do not offer every advantage from the point of view of capitalist profit, inevitably receive less investment.
The advocates of the liberal economy do not, themselves, have any means of going some way towards compensating for this inequality, other than to appeal to a state or to the European institutions, which boils down to the same thing.
We would not be against this type of compensation if it relieved, for the working classes, the handicaps resulting from the actual operation of the capitalist economy.
However, the destructive forces of the capitalist economy are more powerful than the derisory resolutions of the European Parliament.
Even if subsidies are approved for less-favoured regions, at the end of the day it will not necessarily be those regions and their working classes who benefit from them.
This has been proved precisely by the ultra-peripheral regions which the report presents as a model for isolated mountain regions.
In spite of aid and subsidies, both national and European, RÃ©union, Guadeloupe and Martinique, to name but a few, still have a particularly high level of unemployment and particularly low wages.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(IT) It must be clarified once and for all what is meant by disadvantaged when the term is applied to an island as such and not just to the outermost regions.
This is a concept which has already been enshrined in Declaration No 30, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, although I regret to say that the different translations of the document are extremely misleading.
One way of boosting the development of structurally disadvantaged regions could be to make greater and more effective use of the Structural Funds.
This depends, not least, on the provision of much more information, a more streamlined, flexible procedure and a more rigorous assessment of the quality of projects and interventions.
I would therefore like to express my appreciation of the PomÃ©s Ruiz report, which has the merit of portraying the light and the shade - more shade than light - of a situation which, with the basic premises having been identified, now calls for financial commitment, more courage and political will following specific recognition of ongoing structural disadvantages, the nature of which has thus far been wholly unclear.
Hence the importance of a substantial change, of acting upon this recognition through the convergence of other policies.
I would cite, in particular, the need to activate the appropriate derogations provided for in Article 87 of the EC Treaty on state aid, which are essential if we are to close an economic divide which has grown up and is the result, as well as of geographical handicaps, of the short-sightedness of the ruling classes, including the Community, over a number of decades.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on Mr Poignant's report.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, like all the problems linked to the world of work in the European Union, employees in the maritime sector also constitute a problem which cannot be ignored.
Due to a lack of skilled labour at national and Community levels, shipowners are being forced to recruit crew members from third countries.
In the interests of making this process easier, the Commission has accordingly pushed ahead with a programme for training third-country crew members and for recognition on the part of Member States of qualifications issued by third countries.
In this connection, it should be said that more vocational training means enhanced safety at sea and less shipping accidents.
Bearing in mind that many shipping accidents are caused by human error, it is essential to ensure a high standard of training for the crews of European vessels.
The proposal now under consideration stipulates, for example, that English should be used as the working language when a ship's crew and the authorities on land have no other common language.
I believe that before a request is made to recognise training in a third country, evidence should therefore be provided of a lack of European personnel available to perform the duties in question.
Without detracting from the merits of the proposed training scheme, I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Commission and of Parliament to the importance of continuing vocational training for third-country and European seamen.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr Poignant, on the need to make the maritime professions more attractive, as a means of combating unemployment and boosting human resources in a sector in crisis.
To my mind, the European Union lacks a plan of action designed to promote these professions.
Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Poignant and all the honourable Members who took part in the debate.
The amendments proposed confirm the Commission's approach to the specific procedure for recognising seafarers' certificates and coincide to a significant degree with the Council's position.
The Commission is prepared to accept almost half the amendments passed by Parliament, which really do improve the proposal.
The Commission, however, cannot agree to the amendments introducing the possibility of withdrawing the recognition of individual maritime training institutes in third countries, namely Amendments Nos 3, 12, 15, 17 and 20.
This action would be neither practical nor productive.
The Commission is in favour of overall and comprehensive recognition of the systems and procedures of third countries which guarantee the same educational value of individual institutes.
The Commission greatly appreciates Parliament's efforts to examine the withdrawal of these amendments.
On the same subject, the Commission can accept Amendment No 19, which has been amended slightly by the Council, making provision for a mechanism for warning a third country if there are indications that an individual training institute no longer meets the requirements of the STCW Convention, which is the basic training and certification convention.
In all events, the Commission rejects Amendment No 24 proposing to annul the mandatory use of English for communications between ship and shore whenever the communicating parties do not speak the same language.
This provision, which has been endorsed by the Council, simply aligns Community legislation with the relevant requirements of the SOLAS Convention, which has applied throughout the world since July 2002.
I believe that, in order to avoid ambiguities during communications between ship and shore, the parties directly involved in the communication should communicate in the language with which they are most familiar.
Thus, if the parties do not speak the same language, they must communicate in English; otherwise they will not be able to understand each other.
In addition, I should like to thank Parliament for its very interesting amendments as regards the introduction of a European certificate of conformity for certificates of competency and endorsements and recognition by the Member States, namely Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6.
This is indeed a valuable suggestion and the Commission will incorporate it within the framework of a special legislative proposal on the Member States' certificates of competency, which will call for the facility of recognition of certificates between the Member States and, at the same time, will safeguard compliance with the applicable requirements.
In addition to this, I should like in particular to draw your attention to the Council conclusions on improving Community shipping and seafaring professions approved by the Ministers for Transport in Luxembourg this year.
The Council called on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on the recognition of certificates between Member States.
The Commission will submit a legislative proposal on this matter in the immediate future; consequently, the amendments can be withdrawn because the subject will be specifically covered in the coming year.
I should also like to draw your attention to Amendment No 16 requiring the Member States to inform the Commission and the other Member States before withdrawing any endorsement confirming the recognition of certificates issued by a third country.
The Commission believes that, given the urgency of such situations, the Member States should be given the opportunity to withdraw their endorsement even before informing the other Member States.
The Council agrees with this view and we really do believe that it is important for Parliament to decide to re-examine this amendment.
Last but not least, I fully agree with Amendments Nos 7 and 13, as amended by the Council, whereby third countries will be reassessed in order to verify if they have taken adequate measures against fraud involving certificates.
It really is of major importance to prevent fraud in connection with certificates of competency and several MEPs have already stressed this need in connection with this issue.
We are certain that the European Parliament will support the Commission's views on the above amendments.
Madam President, honourable Members, if this directive is approved at first reading, we shall soon have at our disposal an effective and reliable system for receiving foreign seafarers on our ships.
Thank you, Commissioner.
During your speech, Mrs Scallon, who was one of the registered speakers, rejoined us.
Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur and I welcome the Commission proposal for the revision of the current rules concerning recognition of non-EU seafarers.
The present rules are cumbersome and have led to duplication and high administrative costs.
It is therefore logical and beneficial to establish recognition of training given in third countries.
It is essential that recognition, not only of third countries' systems and procedures, but also of their continued compliance, be, for a substantial initial period of time, strictly monitored at European level, as such recognition will be global in nature.
One particular difficulty highlighted by various Community seafarers was the question of the lack of language understanding and fluency in communicating with third country seafarers.
I welcome therefore the fact that language requirements are included for the certification of third country seafarers.
This is essential to ensure safety, particularly in emergencies.
Maritime safety is a priority and we must do all we can to ensure that human error is kept to a minimum.
The Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency will carry a huge responsibility.
I would like to emphasise also that we must do everything possible to support and encourage seafaring as a profession within the European Community itself.
I would like to highlight certain amendments for support: Amendment No 11 which clarifies that certificates issued before the directive enters into force would remain valid; Amendment No 21 which provides that only countries complying with the STCW Convention should receive recognition and Amendment No 22, which proposes a definitive period for Member States to implement these proposals.
Thank you, Mrs Scallon
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the report (A5-0226/2003) by Mr Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of social security systems [COM(1998) 779 - C4-0137/1999 - 1998/0360(COD)].
Madam President, simplifying and updating this regulation is of major importance in promoting the mobility of workers in the European Union.
I would remind the European Parliament that, eighteen months ago, a specific action plan promoting mobility was agreed and a number of these important promotional measures concerned the need for coordination and cooperation between social security systems, but not just that.
The question of mobility is directly linked to competitiveness, to job creation and to social cohesion and it essentially forms the precondition to a real European job market.
During the previous years' application of this regulation, its provisions have proven to be exceptionally complicated, long-winded and unwieldy.
Thus, the system no longer responds to new developments in the Member States' social security systems or to the new mobility conditions in the European Union.
In other words, this regulation urgently needs to be simplified and updated and this is precisely the aim of the Commission proposal.
Simplification will result in Community legislation which is more comprehensible to the citizens for whose sake it is created.
As regards updating, I should like to highlight three basic amendments.
The first concerns the personal aspect of the regulation.
The proposed regulation will apply not only to workers who move but also to all citizens of the European Union covered by the social security legislation of a Member State.
Freedom of movement cannot only benefit workers; it must benefit all European citizens.
The proposed regulation, and this is the second amendment, aims to broaden the material aspect of the application of coordination rules.
Thus, the social insurance sectors include new forms of benefits, such as early retirement benefits.
The third important amendment proposed by the Commission concerns unemployment benefits for cross-frontier workers.
The Commission proposes that cross-frontier workers should receive benefits from the state in which they last worked.
This is important in order to put an end to the complicated and unsatisfactory distinction between full and part-time employment of both typical and atypical cross-frontier workers.
Every year the Commission receives thousands of protests from workers who work in one country and live in another and who are frequently subject to discrimination due to the inefficient coordination of social security systems.
Thus, we believe that this proposal will help not only to update the system, which is necessary, but also to simplify it, so that it functions more smoothly both for the citizens and the Member States.
.
Madam President, as we have been hearing, Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is the mechanism for the coordination of social security systems between Member States, not their harmonisation.
For example, it is the regulation which gives you the right to reimbursement of emergency health care costs when you are taken ill in another Member State, providing you have your E111 form with you, as I am sure all of us here do.
The basis of the regulation is to provide those people from one Member State living or working in another with the same right to social security provision as a national living in that Member State.
It is parity of treatment.
It does not mean that your national system comes with you - which is something that people do not understand - but that you switch to the new system, where you should be treated on an equal footing with others.
In amending this regulation, we are constrained by a strict legal base within the Treaties and by numerous Court of Justice rulings about the scope of the regulation: definitions of social security and not social welfare in general, for example.
It is true to say that as a committee we found this a frustration.
The inability to build bridges between national systems is problematic and it leads many people to feel poorly served when gaps appear between the systems.
They feel it is Europe's job to provide those bridges.
One of the three main issues we are told that advice services deal with is that of people who have resigned from their job in order to move to another country with their partner or spouse and who lose entitlement to unemployment benefits by doing so; hence Amendments Nos 2 and 43 from the committee.
Member States could help by recognising this as a valid reason for unemployment.
As we have heard, the Commission's proposals aim to simplify and modernise the regulation.
The Council has been working through those proposals since 1999 and Parliament has followed the workings with a view to cooperation where there is progress for people and where it aligns with ECJ rulings.
However, we have also looked to signal where there are problems and seek solutions where possible within the regulation's limited scope.
I have been very grateful for that cooperation with both the Council and the Commission and, of course, for the very supportive cooperation of colleagues within the committee.
We have a mutual desire to see the necessary revision of the regulation within this legislature.
Our committee supports the extension of the scope of Regulation 1408/71.
We support the move to include pre-retirement benefits for however long they continue to exist, given current moves to extend working lives, and paternity benefits.
The majority of the committee deeply regrets that a weak legal base has meant that the extended family definition we wish to see in Amendment No 20 is so problematic.
We look forward to seeing a progressive solution being found in the Council in its response to the European Parliament's vote on the Santini report.
If this persists it is the view of many of us that we shall see cases brought before the European Court concerning the lack of mutual recognition of marital status for same-sex couples.
The committee is pleased, however, that in the European Year of People with Disabilities there appears to be progress on the cross-border export of certain disability benefits.
I appreciate the action of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten in bringing forward the proposed new Article 55, which is supported by many political groups.
This means that Amendment No 42, the committee's bridging, and, to some extent, warning amendment, can be replaced by Amendment No 55.
The lives of many disabled people have been made an absolute misery by the current situation in which disability benefits cannot be exported.
These people have not been able to exercise their freedom of movement because they cannot afford to.
Another area where the work of colleagues has been very helpful has been on the subject of frontier workers who face particular difficulties in juggling two systems.
The revised text of recital 4 makes a particular reference to the taxation issue.
I want to make the point here that this is a reference and not an attempt to harmonise taxation across the European Union.
It points out that there are difficulties faced which need resolution, even though this regulation may not be the place to do it.
It is a problem that can only increase as some Member States merge their tax and social security payment systems, and where people may find that they are paying twice for a service that they can only receive once.
The amendments concerning Articles 57 and 59 also pick up on the need to deal with potential problems before they affect individuals, and are indeed linked to previous European Parliament decisions.
As I mentioned earlier, the scope of the regulation is limited: it cannot answer all questions relating to frontier workers or access to healthcare, particularly when this is currently dealt with under the Treaties as a set of goods and services rather than universal social service.
We can, however, aim to ensure that the regulation is as clear and comprehensive as possible so that employers cannot side-step their obligations to their employees and ask them, for example, to become self-employed to avoid payment of social security.
The regulation should be a support to free movement, not a barrier, and we hope that our joint work will lead in that direction.
Madam President, today's regulation is a milestone in our history.
We want to modernise, we want to simplify and we have been working on that for more than 10 years now.
It looks as if we are now nearing the end today, in the first reading.
Please excuse me, Mrs Lambert - I would normally thank the rapporteur first, but this time I would like to commend the Commission services, firstly Director Rob Cornelissen, who has not only convinced the Council but has also supported us with his advice and actions, and our other colleagues and in particular Herwig Verschueren, who also made a major contribution.
That is not all, Madam President; I will be coming back to that shortly.
Amendments have been submitted by all groups in Parliament.
What we want is for this regulation to be ready in time for the coming enlargement.
That is absolutely essential.
Furthermore, the social security regulation is being established through the codecision procedure, while the Council is demanding unanimity.
The IGC changes that, and quite rightly so.
I am now going to list its blessings.
The scope of applicability of the regulation has been extended.
Everyone living in the territory of the Member State legally will now be treated equally.
In other words, they will have the same rights and obligations as citizens of the Member State.
Secondly, acquired rights will be preserved for all time.
The export of rights in the context of social security has now been established clearly and unambiguously for the first time, even if only certain periods are insured in some Member States.
Thirdly, the rules on pensions are being greatly simplified.
The arrangements for early retirement, which have caused problems for so many people, will also, where such problems still exist, be included in the coordination.
Fourthly, there is more clarity regarding the rights of people who fall ill abroad.
If acute help is needed abroad, then everyone has the same rights.
Furthermore, we would very much welcome an amendment in which the requirement for permission to go abroad for medical treatment is amended to reflect the most recent decisions of the Court.
In other words - incidentally, there is a grammatical error in the English text - no special permission is needed for outpatient care, although it would be needed for in-patient care.
Cross-border workers.
The retired cross-border worker maintains his rights in the country in which he worked.
What is new is that cross-border workers' family members are also getting rights.
Unemployment.
Opportunities for the unemployed are being improved; the unemployed will be able to look for work abroad under certain conditions without losing benefits.
Incidentally, my colleagues and I have submitted an amendment on that point; I would like the Council to say a unanimous ''yes' to an amendment that gives Luxembourg a transitional period of five years, as it is particularly affected by the new regulation because of the large number of cross-border workers there.
They will then have the opportunity to adapt to the new benefits system in the country in which they are working and availability for the labour market there.
There are also amendments on the provision of living allowances, and so on. The new text for Article No 55 - which Mrs Lambert has already mentioned - is much better and I hope that it will receive support.
The eighth point; people with disabilities will no longer lose their benefits when they move to a Member State.
I am very pleased about that, especially in the Year of the Disabled.
The ninth point; not immediately obvious but nonetheless of importance is the paragraph that establishes that where problems exist, the Member States can no longer drag these out but are required to find actual solutions within a specific time.
Two brief points; the first is the question of homosexual marriage, an issue that has been much discussed.
Is the Commissioner of the opinion that the coordination regulation is the right place to compel the thirteen Member States that do not recognise the marriage of homosexual couples and have not incorporated it in their family law to do so via the regulation?
Would Amendment No 20 not cause the regulation to run into problems?
I do have sympathy for Amendment No 49.
Moreover, we have not sorted out a problem that occurs where a social security system is subject to the country of employment principle, but tax legislation is not in step with it.
That is another point where I would like to see a logical arrangement.
All in all, however, I am very satisfied with the proposal.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, making the European labour market possible is in fact the goal of all the Member States, and, since 1971, we have also had an instrument for this purpose, that being Regulation No 1408.
How, though, do things stand in practice?
A number of Member States have set up various obstacles and allowed them to remain in place.
That is why I am glad that the long-overdue reform of Regulation 1408 is at last on the table.
Had it not been for this nonsensical unanimity rule in the Council, it would have been there much sooner.
That notwithstanding, we have proved that we are capable of coping, shortly before the end of the parliamentary term, not only with enlargement, but also with giving a social policy reform greater depth.
The first thing to be said about it is that it makes everything simpler, which is what both the public and Parliament want, and it also incorporates rulings by the European Court of Justice on such things as the entitlement to medical services.
Secondly, there are also qualitative reforms, and this House and the committee have encouraged and emboldened the Commission to formulate these as such.
They include, for example, the right of unemployed people to remain in Europe for up to six months for the purpose of seeking work; this involves family members and people who are no longer involved in economic activity being included in the scope of the Regulation.
It involves all these things, because we are of course inviting to Europe not only workers but also their families.
Like Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I am especially glad that we have made a special arrangement for people with disabilities, something that the Council was initially unwilling to accept.
I hope that we will now be able to reach a compromise.
What is important is that nobody who wants to avail themselves of the mobility option and whom we wish to support in their desire to do so, should fall through the social security system's net.
It is also important that we should reiterate that this is about coordination and about the acknowledgement of entitlements, and not about the transfer of social benefits from one state to another.
There were also, of course, a number of conflicts - not with Mrs Lambert, whom I thank for her cooperation, and nor even that much with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, apart from the point relating to families, which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has just mentioned.
Some Member States take a very narrow view of what constitutes a family - I would say they have a twentieth-century view of it - whilst others have a more modern approach in line with the twenty-first.
What we, in fact, regard as important is that this definition, when we decide on one, will have no legal significance in terms of the Regulation, and that we will not be enforcing some sort of acceptance of a lifestyle on any Member State.
For that reason, we should perhaps show a bit more tolerance.
My final point is that it matters a great deal both to me and to my group that we should now - great and important though this reform is - keep this Regulation open-ended.
There will without doubt be more cases in which we will have to get involved, particularly when we are joined by ten new Member States next year, when we will gain experience and perhaps have to make more changes.
It is for this reason that we also support the Commission's idea of flexible action in areas that are left open and also of regulating those matters that have not been sorted out, such as taxation and the occasional possibility of double taxation - which will perhaps happen in the next legislative period.
Madam President, I too can say that I am delighted with the Commission's attempt to simplify the promotion of mobility, for that is really what this is about.
We all want citizens to be able to really demand justice in the free movement of workers.
This has not been a success to date.
Just one look at the statistics shows us that only around 2% of the citizens work in another country.
However, I should in this respect also like to deliver a few notes of discord which do not concern Parliament.
Once again, we have managed to work well with the fellow MEPs.
As Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has stated, work with the European Commission was also perfectly feasible.
I did, however, see it as a sword of Damocles that the European Council is threatening to call it a day after all if we do not bring our requirements under control.
I find this hard to take, certainly where frontier work is concerned.
I should like to underpin this with a few examples.
In my area, which is between the Belgian border zone - in which I live - and the Netherlands, the opportunity is currently presenting itself to deploy 800 workers at a large company, Volvo, just across the border.
People will certainly be recruited from my area.
I still, however, hesitate to advise people to actually do this unless 100% guarantees can be given concerning sound and proper social security.
I find it impossible to explain to, for example, a 62-year old lady who has become disabled, that she will lose her disability pension in Belgium and will not qualify for old-age pension in the Netherlands until she reaches the age of 65.
These are all situations that cannot be accounted for because there is insufficient coordination at the moment.
For that reason, we have all joined forces and tabled yet a few more amendments to avoid scenarios of this kind in future.
With these amendments, we want to force the institutions and the Member States to coordinate their efforts more effectively.
The amendments tabled by us, fortunately by a number of groups together, pertain to very specific cases which often affect frontier workers.
This receives my support.
In my view, it is unacceptable for the Member States not to be able, and willing, to acknowledge this problem.
Surely we cannot have a situation where a united Europe is being sabotaged because a number of national officials and politicians treat frontier work as a marginal issue.
I am therefore pleased that in its proposal, the European Commission is making every effort to enforce cooperation by the Member States.
As soon as this regulation has been adopted, I hope that it will actually be enforced, and I would urge the Commission to see that it is.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lambert's report presents an entire set of extremely interesting measures.
The main aim of the report is to ensure that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights.
For those of us in this Parliament who hope that cultural and human exchanges increase in the context of the free movement of persons, this report really is a step in the right direction.
The simplification of regulations, coordination, the harmonisation of procedures based on the application of the principle of equal treatment, which gives employees or self-employed persons from other Member States the same rights as the citizens of the state responsible, all contribute to European integration.
Some measures contained in the report are particularly noteworthy.
Personally, I find that they are very much in step with the changes that have taken place in our societies.
I am thinking in particular of the desire to treat maternity and paternity equally, the proposal seeking to include third-country nationals in the directive's scope, and even the definition of the term 'member of the household' applying to unmarried partners in a long-term relationship, irrespective of sex.
Although I, together with my group, do support this report, I wish, Commissioner, to underline the paradox between the stated desires and the dangers of adopting measures less comprehensive than those provided by the social security systems in several European countries.
France, Italy and Germany, for example, are about to implement or have already implemented reforms intended to break up existing social security systems, on the pretext that they have excessive budgetary deficits in terms of the Maastricht criteria.
By extending the sphere of operations of private bodies, we will be moving towards a reduction of national assistance or even its total disappearance, which could prove extremely dangerous for the future.
And yet, the principles and aims underpinning the creation of social security systems in Europe still apply, in the context of developing a European social model that has proved itself by enabling growth and improved living standards for decades.
I would add that these aims are all the more necessary given the increase in levels of precarity and poverty in Europe today.
According to a recent Eurostat study, 15% of the Union's inhabitants are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.
If you take away all social transfers, this figure rises to 24% and the situation is in danger of worsening.
The question facing us in Europe today goes far beyond establishing coordination, even though this is clearly crucial.
What we are faced with is a real societal choice.
Do we want a model of economic and social development that is equitable and provides assistance, which will enable us to stimulate growth, or will we take the route of allowing all social systems to disappear, at the risk of allowing the number of people in a precarious situation, the poor and the marginalised to skyrocket?
Choosing the first option would require a genuine form of European social governance to be established, based on a form of downward harmonisation.
This would clearly also involve reviewing the Maastricht criteria.
Madam President, first of all, I should like to express my thanks to the Commission.
Two names have been mentioned: Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mrs Lambert, sitting next to her.
I should like to take this opportunity to join in thanking them.
As Mrs Oomen-Ruijten said, if you want to assess something in a historical framework, this can be done in two ways.
Historically, we have been given a patchwork of provisions, a patchwork of adaptations, of a coordinating directive, No 1408/71, with its later amendments.
We also have a catalogue of problems.
It is then very good if we can make a little progress.
This could represent a historical step forward.
The historical vantage point should perhaps be a next step, but I shall come to this in a moment.
I should first like to take stock of what we all have actually managed to achieve.
I think that it is quite favourable in itself.
It is clear, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten stated before, that we have achieved a number of things that are already acceptable to the Council and to the Commission.
These issues concern, for example, the inclusion of stateless persons and refugees, or regulations, or improvements should I say, in the field of bureaucratic obstacles to frontier work, and we could go on like this for a while.
Quite a few problems nevertheless remain, as everyone knows.
Only 2% of the European population carries out cross-border work in some form or other.
If you engage in conversation with frontier workers, as has already been mentioned in the form of personal recollections, they will tell you that the problems know no bounds.
We are also keeping a few issues open, and I think that we should take the following historical steps at some point.
If we only consider the definition of families, then we will not solve the issue; we have to try to solve this by referring to the Santini report.
Or if we look at a number of other issues related to family reunifications and benefits, etc., then one thing is very clear. We are now talking about improving the coordination of these systems; we are talking about modernising them and we are doing this against the backdrop of workers' mobility in Europe and a better-functioning labour market.
In future, and this would be a historical step, we will still need to move towards some form of harmonisation, because we will otherwise fail to solve other problems, as the social security systems are under pressure in every Member State and, in actual fact, come into conflict with each other, which leads to the further development of this patchwork.
I would like to see an end put to this.
Madam President, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Jean Lambert for her work on this issue.
I would also like to compliment the Commission and the Commission staff for their assistance.
Freedom of movement has been one of the core tenets of the single market.
If this is to be a reality rather than an illusion, then the opportunity to move with social security benefit, with guaranteeing rights of social security, must be seized.
Over the past few years there have been many moves to bring about a resolution to what seemed to be an intractable problem.
I believe that the Council and the Commission text, as well as some of the proposals coming from this House, offer the best possible solution for ensuring that people who are forced or who wish to move across different countries can be secure in the rights to their benefits.
One of the difficulties we have faced over the last number of years with this regulation has been its complexity, not just for the individual who wishes to benefit from it, but also for the authorities that are forced to interpret it.
One of the great things we have done so far in our work with Mrs Lambert and others has been to abridge that text, make it simple and readable.
More needs to be done but we have gone a long way towards that end.
One of the difficulties I have with some of the amendments being put forward is the question of harmonisation.
As Mrs Lambert says in her own report, the fundamental principle here is about coordinating national systems, not replacing them.
We have seen in other areas of work in the European Union that coordination achieves quicker and better results for the individual than merely trying to enforce harmonisation.
Therefore I would have to oppose some of the amendments seeking tax harmonisation and also the equal right to unemployment benefit.
The last point I would make is on the question of the definition of the family.
Again, this presents difficulties in many countries where certain types of unions and certain types of marriages are not recognised.
We have to ensure that national legislation is applied in those areas.
We can see advances being made in every country towards coordination.
The issues raised in Amendment No 38 in particular can best be dealt with in the context of the newly implemented regulation, and we should leave it at that.
Madam President, freedom of movement is one of the four fundamental freedoms set out in our Treaties.
Ensuring that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights and consequently coordinating national social security legislation is, therefore, a crucial element, as a number of my fellow Members have said.
I am thus convinced that social security systems that function harmoniously and in a coordinated way are valuable assets for European societies.
Acquired rights, the policy of simplifying pre-retirement benefits, clarification of sickness benefits, the assets that our colleagues have suggested in the field of handicaps, are the basic building blocks for improving this report, which addresses in particular the social protection of frontier workers and of those who move around within our territory.
Even if those only represent a small percentage of the population as a whole, the problems that they face clearly warrant our full attention.
On this matter, I have a specific example in mind: I remember inviting to Paris some Belgian doctors, who had practised in their country for 20 years.
When they arrived at the social security office in Paris, they were told they had lost their rights.
This shows that we must welcome this text.
Nevertheless, some of the amendments contained in this report appear to be somewhat problematic.
I am thinking in particular of Amendment No 3 and of extending the regulation's scope, which I do not feel would be appropriate given the potential financial impact of such a measure.
As for Amendment No 20, I believe it disrupts the balance of the regulation for no good reason.
This is why I believe that Parliament must be reasonable and accept Amendment No 49, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten suggested a short while ago in her speech.
Madam President, of the four freedoms pertaining to the internal market, the free movement of persons, and particularly of workers, is the one that has been realised the least.
One can dream of greater labour mobility and of lifting internal borders for those looking for work.
For those who are actually involved in movement of this kind, the reality is often a nightmare.
Few feel up to the task.
Labour mobility in Europe is far too rare and far too little attention is given to those who do take the plunge.
To the politicians in the capital cities, these people are often treated as a marginal issue that takes place at the national fringes, away from the hub.
We, European politicians and policy makers, often hear the comment that we should not get involved in social security because it is a national issue.
We should only confine ourselves to Regulation 1408/71.
This Regulation, as its name suggests, is more than 30 years old and has become more ambiguous as time has gone on.
Moreover, it took five years before there was some kind of agreement within the Council about the simplification proposal that the Commission submitted in 1998.
This has been a laborious process and has not by any means reached completion, but, fortunately, clear guidelines have now been drafted for it.
Since these have already been mentioned by others, I will not repeat them.
I greatly value the work that the Commission and the Council's working parties have carried out and, needless to say, also our rapporteur, Jean Lambert, who has entered into very extensive consultations with these other bodies.
Nevertheless, many problems still persist.
I have the impression that we have solved many of those problems thanks to our amendments that have often been drafted in line with the Commission and the Council.
However, there are two other important bottlenecks that affect the practical side of things.
First of all, it is important to know what Member States will actually introduce within the scope of the Regulation and what exceptions and excuses they will dream up in order to circumvent the provisions.
For that reason, the application regulation and annexes are of major importance.
These have not been presented to us to date, but are being prepared in the Council.
In my view, we should most definitely take this into consideration when we settle on our final opinion.
As far as this is concerned, the Member States have been warned and, together with our colleagues in the national parliaments, we will keep a close eye on our ministers and council representatives in the process.
Secondly, the problems in practice often touch upon other rules and regulations which do not strictly fall within the scope of the Regulation.
This is in the case where, for example, in social security regulations, age limits are used or definitions for people for whom derived rights exist, that are based on family law in the Member States.
Or something which is quite common in the Netherlands, combinations of general social security regulations which serve as a basis, alongside additional regulations that fall outside of the scope of the Regulation.
Fiscal regulations are another major problem area.
European coordination rules are lacking.
There are only bilateral agreements between Member States, and these are often at odds with these fiscal regulations and fail to comply with the rules in the Regulation.
This is a huge problem, particularly for the frontier workers who live in one EU country and work in another.
The Commission has assured us that those problems cannot all be solved within the Regulation and this is why we have shifted a number of amendments from the articles to the recitals.
This, however, does not mean that the Commission and the Council should take them less seriously.
I should like to add this quite emphatically.
On these points too, I expect the Commission - this may be a new Commission - to actually take powerful initiatives in the fullness of time, because it is at least as important to solve these problems as those in the current Regulation.
Madam President, I often visit businesses and people on the border between Denmark and Germany and hear again and again about the problems of living on one side of the border and working on the other side.
It means, indeed, that many people do not even try to do so.
In actual fact, there are only 1 000 people who commute across the Danish/German border in spite of the fact that unemployment south of the border stands at 12%, and north of the border is as low as 6%.
There are obviously linguistic barriers to taking up work on the other side of the border, but the different ways in which the tax and social security systems are set up are also of very great importance.
What of course distinguishes Denmark is that we fund our social security systems across the border via the general taxation system, while in the rest of the EU more use is made of earmarked social security contributions.
This has a role to play in creating part of the problem we experience.
I should not, in a way, mind it if we in Denmark were to obtain reforms whereby future payments were better at reflecting the individual's responsibility for the common good and whereby the costs of social security arrangements were made clearer, that is to say through an increase in the number of earmarked contributions.
Such reforms could also reduce the problems posed by the Danish social security system in relation to other countries' systems.
That is not, of course, at present on the agenda, however.
We are concerned here with simplifying the coordination of the social security arrangements between the Member States, and there is a great need to simplify these very complex rules which, over the years, have become progressively more complex.
I should like to thank Mrs Lambert for the work she has done.
I am in favour of Parliament seeking to cooperate with the Council on these issues and seeking to work in tandem with it.
We must not delay the reforms unnecessarily.
I believe it would be easier to get the reforms through before, rather than after, enlargement.
We must not, therefore, be so focused upon the ideal that we fail to obtain a workable solution right now.
Madam President, in order to safeguard the freedom of movement of persons within the European Union, it is essential to safeguard their social security rights.
The work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, is thus of the greatest importance, and I congratulate her.
The fact is that nobody should fall outside the existing social security systems of the European Union, including third-country nationals, though that issue has been dealt with elsewhere.
I also believe, however, that there should not be a comprehensive list of social security regimes covered by coordination in this case.
This will give us room to make additions later on, as and when problems arise.
I would like to emphasise that the Commission's own proposals and innovations, aimed at updating the regulation (which, as we know, dates from 1971), are to be welcomed.
We must go further, though, without forgetting the regulation's four principles, as the rapporteur points out.
I would lay particular emphasis on certain proposals aimed at improving the draft presented to Parliament, above all: the recognition that people leaving employment in one Member State for family reasons should not consequently lose the right to unemployment benefit in their new country of residence; the extension of the provisions to refugees, stateless persons and their families resident in Member States; definitions of frontier workers, refugees and stateless persons and their rights, although those rights should also be extended to their families; recognition of the rights of retired frontier workers, the extension of the concept of the family and the inclusion of paternity leave; the improved situation of people with disabilities, which has already been mentioned, preventing them from temporary loss of entitlement to disability benefits or from having to claim those benefits afresh; the opportunity, also afforded here, for two or more Member States to conclude conventions with each other based on the principles and in the spirit of the regulation.
I can only regret, however, the various attempts to undermine the social security systems of different Member States, mine in particular.
This could jeopardise the true reach of several of the rights we are upholding here.
That is why I am calling for these proposals to be taken into account, and also for all attempts to undermine the social security systems of the Member States be reviewed.
Madam President, I should like to extend a warm thanks to the rapporteur for the work she has done.
I have often thought that this report was going to outlast her mandate, for that is nearly how long it has been on the table.
This was not due to a lack of diligence on her part, for that was, in fact, immense, but rather due to insufficient diligence on the part of the Council.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten rightly pointed out that it was not as a result of any lack of diligence on the part of the Commission.
This suggests that we are dealing with a very difficult issue politically speaking.
Why?
Because a great deal of money is involved.
That is the first reason.
My second point is that, in everyday life, the Member States do not for one moment consider the people that might break out of their own mould from time to time.
They actually assume that everyone remains in their own country, from the day they were born until they die.
They, in fact, find it highly inconvenient if that status quo is upset when people move abroad.
They may be prepared to take certain measures, but as few and as little as possible, and they then try to snatch back as much as they can.
If there is any bother with the budget, then those are the people who are tackled first.
That is why the Regulation is also used to limit rights rather than to increase them.
Anyone who would like to study this more in-depth should come and have a look at what has happened in the Netherlands and Belgium on this score, where neither country is particularly blameless.
Finally, I should like to raise another matter, which is the issue over which there is still a difference of opinion, namely the issue of tax and social security.
In fact, I think that Mrs Jensen has already made a very valid point on this matter.
She also gave one of the best examples in Denmark, because all social security over there is covered by taxes.
What is annoying is that in some cases, people pay taxes in one country and social security contributions in another.
As, for example, social security contributions are relatively high in Belgium and non-existent in Denmark, at least in the form of contributions, you are extremely unfortunate if you pay tax in Denmark and social security in Belgium.
If the reverse is true, of course, you are extremely fortunate.
You then pay relatively little in taxes in Belgium and receive an awful lot of social benefits in Denmark.
That is therefore a matter which needs re-addressing and which remains an issue.
This is not harmonisation, but it is important that the two types of taxes should be treated in the same way, at least in one and the same country, and this is an issue which really deserves an all-out effort on our part.
If we do not solve it, we will never bring about a sound labour market in Europe.
Madam President, like the previous speaker, we must congratulate not only Mrs Lambert, the rapporteur, for the work she has carried out, but also, Commissioner, your staff for their work and for the coordination which has developed between the Parliamentary committee and the Commission which has led to the streamlining and updating of a text that concerns one of the fundamental aspects of this European Union of ours, which is the freedom of movement - as you yourself said - not only of workers, but of all Europe's citizens.
This text has been streamlined and updated and takes account of the rulings of the Court of Justice, but also of the current realities of employment and of certain types of self-employed workers.
In my opinion, we must welcome the text and call for this work to be concluded before the end of the year, before enlargement takes place, because this will make progress easier to achieve.
In the little speaking time left to me, I should like to focus on one issue: the situation of frontier workers.
These are truly Europeans par excellence; it is they who suffer as a result of differences in legislation and who least understand the steps forward Europe is taking, and yet they are the ones for whom everything possible should be done, to enable them to perform their jobs across borders.
As has already been said, the progress that has been made is clear to see.
I wish, however, to emphasise the need to research new forms of working together, new forms of institutional cooperation between Member States, when problems in implementing these regulations persist, particularly in cases where there are differences in their implementation.
There are many such differences and there are also many delays in harmonising these.
With regard to this fundamental issue, proposals have been tabled in Amendments Nos 51 and 52, on which we will vote tomorrow.
I believe that this issue of coordination will require ongoing effort and fine-tuning.
Today, coordination is necessary in that responsibility in these fields falls to the Member States.
This does not mean, however, that we should not raise the necessary issue of harmonisation in order to protect the European social model.
Madam President, it goes without saying that the hotchpotch of laws and regulations governing social protection in the various countries of Europe needs to be harmonised.
This is done to a minimal degree, however, and never with a view to bringing each country's social legislation into line with the national legislation that is most favourable to workers.
Some amendments tabled by the European Parliament improve the Council proposal for a regulation and we will be voting for them but how can we talk about these few changes without condemning the policy currently being pursued by the European States, the general thrust of which is to weaken the social protection of workers, to reduce pensions, to increase social security contributions whilst reducing benefits: in short, what we are seeing in most European countries?
Whether this situation develops gradually or overnight, life is becoming impossible for low-paid workers, self-employed workers and the unemployed to support themselves properly.
Access to care is increasingly becoming a privilege of the wealthy.
This is an outrage.
Why, furthermore, should we have this political guideline when national prosperity is increasing, admittedly slowly but increasing nonetheless?
In France, for example, we are told that social security is in deficit.
Why is this so?
Partly due to unemployment, a situation for which the workers are not responsible and of which they are in fact the victims.
Mainly, however, because the State is digging into the social security coffers in order to bestow gifts on employers through reducing social costs.
What governments call pension reform or social security reform is basically large-scale plunder from workers to the benefit of a few wealthy parasites.
In any event, I wish to use this speaking time to state that European workers have the moral right to defend themselves, to strike and to demonstrate because they have no other way of opposing what is actually nothing less than organised theft.
Madam President, I also commend the rapporteur, who has approached this complicated and important brief with great conviction and enthusiasm.
The principle of simplifying and modernising social security rules to make them more efficient and user-friendly certainly deserves support.
However, although I am sympathetic to a number of the points she raises, in certain respects I suggest that her proposals go too far.
I am against Amendment Nos 1, 44 and 45, as they include references to taxation.
I hear what various colleagues have said on this subject and particularly welcome the comments made by the rapporteur herself, that this regulation might not be the right place to address that.
I agree with that point.
Regulation 1408/71 is about coordinating social security, which derives its legal base from Article 42, which is not concerned with taxation at all.
I can understand why some colleagues would wish to extend the scope of this regulation into the field of tax, but this is not a Community competence and should not become one by the back door or indeed the front door.
If these amendments are passed I would hope that the Commission might still reject them.
I invite the Commissioner to reflect further on this point.
I am also against Amendment Nos 2 and 43 concerning payment of unemployment benefits, both of which only just scraped through in committee.
The rules in Regulation 1408 must provide a balance between encouragement of labour mobility and avoidance of abuse.
The term 'family reason' in the amendment is, in my view, too vague.
EU citizens do and should have the right to seek employment in any Member State.
For them to seek unemployment benefit in a Member State without having worked there and for the EU to endow them with rights to benefit, irrespective of individual Member State rules is just not reasonable.
I understand the problem but this is not the solution.
I shall be recommending support for many of the rapporteur's other amendments, but for the reasons I have mentioned above, I cannot recommend approval of her overall report.
Madam President, extension, modernisation and simplification of Regulation 1408/71 are long overdue.
For over 30 years we have been waiting for this work to be done.
The amount of progress that has been made is a credit to Mrs Lambert, the Commission and the staff on both sides, and indeed the other groups in this House.
Certainly those whose task it is to implement the Regulation will welcome its simplification, because it is a minefield for those who have to interpret the various court judgments that have been laid over the actual regulation itself.
It has repeatedly been said that this is about coordination.
It is true that it is not about harmonisation.
I would argue, however, that it should eventually be about harmonisation.
We are sticking our heads in the sand if we think we can create a European labour market if we do not move ultimately towards harmonisation, both of our social welfare systems and of our tax systems.
It is a nonsense to think that we can go beyond the current 2% of movement to a real movement of labour if we do not get serious about this issue.
Its purpose is to extend and to modernise.
I particularly welcome the changes that were made in relation to commuting workers whose lives will be made a lot less stressful as a result of the changes that have been achieved here.
In conclusion I welcome the indication from the Irish Government which intends to prioritise an agreement on this proposal during the course of its presidency.
Hopefully it will not have to deal with it, because the Italian presidency will already have done so.
At any rate, I look forward to it being concluded by the time this Parliament ends in June 2004.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot fail to congratulate and sincerely thank Mrs Lambert, who has succeeded in bringing to debate this document which we have been waiting to discuss for five years now.
For a long time now, thanks to a previous amendment of Regulation 1408, many pensioners who are in financial difficulties due to illness or disability have been unable to draw their pension or illness allowance when they change their country of residence within the 15 Member States of the European Union.
Amendment No 42 to Article 27a of Mrs Lambert's report is concerned with addressing this issue, stating that, until the new state of residence starts to pay the allowance provided for by its own law, it is the previous state of residence which is to pay this allowance until the disabled person starts to draw it from the new state of residence.
The amendment to Article 55, however, tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Pronk, Mrs Lambert herself, Mr Hughes and others, states clearly that, if the new state of residence - France, for example - does not provide for such allowances, the allowance is not to be paid.
I therefore fear that, although I do not believe this is the wish of the majority of the Parliamentary committee or of Parliament, if these amendments are both adopted, the citizens of any Member State moving within the European Union will continue to be without a pension.
I hope I have misinterpreted the intention conveyed by the Italian translation.
I reserve the right to clarify this point with the rapporteur and I hope that the regulation will be a genuine step forward in the protection of European workers who move within the Community.
Madam President, we have all of us said today that there is a sound basis for revising Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
We all know people who have run into difficulties because they have taken up work in two different countries, and it is therefore crucial to emphasise that people have not, as a matter of simple fact, been given the right promised to them since the Common Market was founded.
It is therefore quite natural that we should break down the barriers that exist.
On the other hand, we must also acknowledge that there is probably no regulation that has been more demonised than this one.
Over the years, opponents of the EU in my own, and other, countries have used it to give people the impression that our social security would be harmonised, that we should be forced to change our social security systems or even that our national pension schemes would be abolished.
I must of course deplore the fact that these people have not appeared in the House today to engage in this debate.
I should like to emphasise today that the Danish Social Democrats are not, in general, afraid of freedom of movement, and I certainly do not think that freedom of movement would undermine national social security arrangements, even if these would then apply to a wider circle of people.
Neither practical experience nor calculations show that there would be hordes of people suddenly wanting to migrate.
On the other hand, I also think it important for us to understand that, if unintended consequences arise - if, for example, too many contributions leave the country or if social security arrangements are shamelessly exploited - then we should definitely not look passively on but take action straight away.
This is emphasised by Amendments Nos 10 and 52, in which we say that our countries can establish bilateral contacts - of the kind with which we are already familiar - and that we must talk to each other if someone runs into difficulties.
That would, of course, also prevent all forms of fraud.
It is important for the Commissioners also today to emphasise at least three things in addition to what has been said in the House: firstly, that there is no question of harmonisation; secondly, that we shall not accept any form of deterioration whatsoever and shall step in if we see the systems weakened; and, thirdly, that we shall not accept unintended consequences and fraud.
A fourth thing also to emphasise, of course, is that we cannot accept, as a result of this proposal, any impairment of the schemes we already have.
I think that is very important.
I do not myself believe that this will happen.
I do not for a moment believe that migration will be on a sufficiently large scale.
I do, however, believe it important for people to have this emphasised to them by the Commissioner responsible, and I should be delighted, Commissioner, if you could do this for us today.
Madam President, I should first like to explain that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Mr Manuel PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, who has been unable to reach the House as yet.
I must congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
In our view, the principle of free movement of persons between Member States is as important as the principles like the free movement of goods or of services.
It could even be deemed more important than the latter.
The free movement of persons differs from the other principles referred to in that it may be restricted, prevented or subject to conditions if the right to social security of persons moving within the European Union are not respected.
Article 34 in Chapter IV of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, entitled Solidarity, lays down clearly the right to protection in a range of cases.
These include maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency, old age and loss of employment, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices.
Article 34 also lays down that everyone residing or moving legally within the European Union is entitled to social security benefits and social advantages in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices.
We see the guiding principles of the regulation as being equality of treatment for citizens of other states and for national workers, regardless of whether the workers are self-employed or not, aggregating contribution periods in various countries if necessary, banning multiple payments and allowing social security to be transferred to other countries.
This is what will promote freedom of movement and family reunification.
It follows that we believe the proposed regulation should be welcomed.
It will facilitate more widespread support and simplify earlier provisions.
In addition, it is not intended as a replacement for national legislation. Rather, it aims to coordinate national systems in order to provide a better service and improve the support available to the citizens of Europe.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation 1408/71 has been around for more than three decades and was created in order to coordinate Member State legislation in the field of social security.
Its main aim is to ensure that workers moving within European Union territory do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights.
Over the years, various amendments have been made to this regulation that have made it extremely complex and some very positive developments have taken place in the social security systems of the various Member States, including my own.
These facts demonstrate the urgent need for this regulation to be reformed.
The Commission's proposal, which is to be welcomed, clearly sets out the aim to be attained: to coordinate social security systems with the prospect of enlargement in mind.
This involves coordination and not harmonisation.
The intention is to modernise and simplify the regulation and, in this context, a significant step forwards has been taken in various areas, in particular with regard to the rights of the unemployed, pensioners and frontier workers and their families.
The list of types of social security covered by coordination has also been extended and measures are set out for solving the problem of double taxation.
The rapporteur has really shown great commitment to the work on reforming this regulation and I congratulate her on this.
I must state, however, that some of the proposals she has put forward raise difficulties, which meant that the PPE members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had to vote against the report.
I shall confine myself to discussing one of them, which concerns the definition of the family: Each Member State recognises a particular concept of the family in accordance with its national legal system.
It would not, therefore, be legitimate to impose any type of family model on the Member States.
Madam President, I asked for additional speaking time because I am aware that rapporteurs often do not have a chance to reply to particular points which could be cleared up during the debate.
Mr Pronk and others have explained the taxation issue very well to those - within his own political group and elsewhere - who have concerns about it.
This is an indication that there are issues which need to be looked at.
As regards Amendment Nos 44 and 45, I would urge Mr Bushill-Matthews, amongst others, to look at Amendment Nos 51 and 52 and to see if he cannot at least support them.
As regards one or two comments on Article 3 and the scope of the regulation, if they are references to the issues about refugees and stateless people, then they are already included in the current regulation.
This is not an addition but a rewording, because the original proposal - which was a rather elegant, all-embracing one from the Commission - had to be changed because the issue of third-country nationals was dealt with some time ago in a separate proposal under the able rapporteurship of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
The issue of moving for family reasons is included not least because, as I indicated, it is a question that the advice services say comes up very frequently.
It was also the subject of a significant case in the Committee on Petitions.
A British woman who moved from the UK in order to follow her husband in his work as a member of the armed forces discovered that she fell between two stools in terms of her entitlement to unemployment benefit.
If she had known how to work the system better in terms of nuancing it, she would not have been caught by resigning four days before moving.
Therefore, that particular issue is there because it affects a large number of people.
I would like to thank colleagues for a very focused and informed debate.
I hope we manage to get a very positive vote from Parliament tomorrow.
The next item is the report (A5-0228/2003) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on a Commission communication to the Council and the Parliament: Mid-term review of the fourth fisheries protocol between the EU and Greenland [COM(2002) 697 - 2003/2035(INI)].
Madam President, on a point of order, I am aware that we are overrunning somewhat and that you will be taking the statement on CancÃºn at 5 p.m.
Everyone from the Committee on Fisheries is present just now.
I was wondering whether it would be possible to deal with Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos' report and Mr Ojeda Sanz's report before we adjourn for the CancÃºn statement?
That would enable the Commissioner and everyone from the Committee on Fisheries to be present for all of these reports.
No one anticipated having to come back late tonight and it would perhaps mean there would be very few people here from the committee for these reports if we delay them.
Would that be possible?
Mr Stevenson, I understand your position.
Regarding the report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos your wish has been granted, as the debate will begin immediately.
We will see if it is possible to deal with the second report, on fisheries, after the report by Mrs Ramos.
We will now begin the debate on the report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
- (ES) Madam President, Greenland is an autonomous region of Denmark.
It was part of the Community between 1973 and 1984.
In 1984 a referendum was held in Greenland and 52% of its inhabitants expressed their wish to withdraw from the Union.
Thereafter, relations with Greenland have been governed by the Greenland Treaty. This treaty accords Greenland a similar status to that enjoyed by 19 other territories, namely Overseas Country and Territory status.
As a result fisheries products from Greenland may be exported freely to the Community in return for a favourable fisheries agreement.
The latter was originally intended to last 10 years but has been extended several times.
The 2002 fourth protocol provided for the mid-term review currently under way.
The review is justified because of the lengthy period of time involved and the significant sums at stake.
The scope of the communication from the Commission extends beyond matters relating exclusively to fisheries. This is because relations with Greenland involve many other issues.
The Committee on Fisheries therefore believes Parliament must take the initiative and draft a general report dealing with political relations, development aid to Greenland and fisheries relations.
The report should be set in the broader context of the Arctic dimension.
(Madam President, I must point out that I am unable to see on the screen an indication of the number of minutes elapsed since I took the floor.
I would like to know how much time I still have available.)
As I was saying, in addition to dealing with relations between Greenland and the Union, the communication from the Commission contains a review of the current state of the agreement.
Any amendment would have to be approved by the competent local authorities in Greenland.
Consequently a thorough review is suggested, but only after 2006 when the agreement expires.
A mere adjustment is proposed for the intervening period.
Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind criticisms made in the House and by the Court of Auditors.
We therefore believe that even in the case of minor adjustments, the principles of good governance, transparency and optimal use of Community financial resources should be applied here and now.
There is no need to wait until 2006 to do so.
The conclusions reached by my colleague Mrs Langenhagen on the fourth protocol two years ago are still perfectly valid, as far as the mid-term review stage is concerned.
There is a need to take issues other than fisheries out of the agreement.
It is also necessary to keep the European Parliament informed on the use of fishing rights and to promote the establishment of joint venture companies.
In addition to promoting joint venture companies, the Committee on Fisheries is now calling for the promotion of temporary relationships between undertakings.
Such arrangements are more flexible.
In this case they are better suited also to the current situation of both the European Community's fisheries sector, and the fisheries sector in Greenland.
The Committee on Fisheries is also calling for the cost of the agreement to be shared fairly, as is the case for agreements for the southern regions where the cost is divided equitably between the shipowners and the Community budget.
I note, Commissioner, that the Commission has not even suggested this for the current adjustment.
Further, the reason adduced does not seem to me to be particularly convincing.
The reference to the small size of the administration in Greenland does not really provide adequate justification.
The European Union pays Greenland a substantial sum each year in return for this agreement.
The amount involved is EUR 42.82 million per year. This makes it the second most expensive agreement of all, after that with Mauritania.
The price is actually exorbitant if it is also taken into account that at least EUR 14 million is not linked in any way to payment for fishing opportunities or the development of the fisheries sector.
The fishing opportunities relating to the remaining EUR 28 million have a very low take up.
Only the German, Danish, British and French fleets have quotas.
No other fleets are allowed to make use of fishing opportunities paid for but not fished.
This is certainly not the case under the southern agreements.
Commissioner Fischler, we are delighted that this taboo was broken in the agreement reached between the Commission and the Government of Greenland in June.
We welcome the fact that other fleets will be allowed access to fish for certain species and for experimental fishing activities, even if access is restricted.
There is actually no provision for the promotion of joint venture companies or of temporary relationships between undertakings.
Arrangements of this nature could prove very beneficial for Greenland, given that its economy is stagnating.
They could also be beneficial to the Community.
EUR 6 million was set aside for this purpose under the previous agreement.
My fifth comment is that the agreement includes quotas for species such as cod and Norway haddock that are almost non-existent in Greenland waters.
The Community pays for these although nothing is caught.
We welcome the fact that the negotiators agreed on more realistic quotas in June.
This means there will be increased opportunities for catching halibut, shrimps and queen crab.
We are glad the negotiators made an effort to do away with the so-called paper fish.
My sixth comment is that the Community's financial contribution has increased for each successive protocol.
At the same time, the fishing opportunities have decreased.
Viewed in this light, the agreement is not sustainable.
Further, the protocol is inconsistent, as Mrs Langenhagen stated at the time.
In conclusion, the Commission is certainly to be congratulated on reconsidering the current arrangements with Greenland.
It is encouraging that sensible steps have been taken.
I mentioned some of them.
They are part of the agreement reached with Greenland in June.
Nonetheless, we believe that the Commission should be more ambitious and strive to introduce radical changes as of now.
I assume the hope is that this fisheries agreement will cease to violate the principles we hold most dear.
I refer to the principles underpinning Community financial provisions, namely transparency and optimal use of financial resources.
More than a simple cosmetic review is needed.
There is every reason why the European Union should support Greenland.
A fisheries agreement is not the best way for the Union to do so, however.
I made this clear to the Fisheries Minister for Greenland at our meeting here in Strasbourg last July.
Greenland is the key to the development of the Union's Arctic dimension.
It would therefore be appropriate to consider financing areas of that relationship other than fishing with recourse to heading 4 of the financial perspective.
Another option would be to finance them through the European Development Fund.
Be that as it may, Parliament is basing its position on this report by the Committee on Fisheries.
The House trusts that the Commission and the Council will take its position into account as of now.
That would be the ideal.
If this is not possible, our position should be borne in mind when preparing for negotiations on a new agreement in 2006.
Mr President, honourable Members, let me start by thanking Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos for her report on our communication on the subject of the mid-term review - and I emphasise mid-term review - of the fourth fisheries protocol between the European Union and Greenland.
I am glad, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, that you endorse the Commission communication.
It was on 30 June 2003 that the Commission and Greenland completed the mid-term review, which is provided for in Article 14 of the protocol.
The fourth protocol was signed yesterday, and it is hoped that all parties will ratify it.
It provides answers and solutions to the concerns expressed in our communication and in your report.
Let me set out just a few of the new elements in it.
There have, firstly, been substantial corrections to the quotas, in order to adjust catch possibilities in line with the scientific evidence.
There is no quota for cod, for Atlantic redfish in the western waters, or for blue whiting, in order to do justice to the EU's fishing capacity.
There are, therefore, no more paper-fish.
Secondly, and in view of certain catch possibilities not having been used to date, we have now introduced the standard transfer clause, whereby we can transfer unused catch possibilities to other Member States not in possession of a quota.
The agreement with Greenland is thereby brought into line with other agreements with third countries making provision for financial compensation.
In July of this year, for the first time in the history of this agreement, unused quotas were transferred to other Member States that did not have them.
Thirdly, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, your report calls for the introduction of licence fees.
That will be happening with effect from 1 January 2004 as an equalisation of burdens between the Community and the shipowners.
That, too, brings this agreement into line with those with other third countries and also makes it possible for us to monitor the fishing effort.
Fourthly, we have responded to the lack of transparency by introducing a budget support programme, and Greenland's regional government has consequently committed itself to a structural reform of its fisheries policy, aiming at greater privatisation and a reduction in subsidies.
Greenland has also undertaken to substantially replenish the budget of the Greenland Institute for Natural Resources, which should make it possible to expand the scientific capacity of that Institute.
Finally, we are also promoting exploratory fishing and extending it to include cephalopods and mussels.
Success in this area will make it possible to make Greenland's fisheries more diverse and include new species in the next agreement with the country.
These changes have been made in dialogue with the authorities in Greenland and in accordance with the principles of the new partnership and fisheries agreement.
I believe that they make the agreement with Greenland more balanced and more transparent, as the financial compensation now corresponds to the catch possibilities actually used, and as reform of Greenland's fisheries policies is supported.
Although, as I have said, this is only a mid-term review, the more extensive relations with Greenland post-2006 were dependent on this revision being carried out.
Our communication, and the endorsement given by your report, have made it possible for us to revise the fourth protocol in such a way as to remove all obstacles to a deepening of our relationship.
- (ES) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on this report, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos on her excellent report, as is our custom in this House.
I should also like to welcome the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has adopted the main amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets.
In this connection, it is worth emphasising that the fisheries agreement with Greenland comes second in order of importance for the Union in terms of what it costs the Community's budget.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos has already pointed this out.
It represents an annual commitment of EUR 42.8 million.
As was explained earlier, however, this sum does not accurately reflect genuine fishing opportunities for the Community fleet.
This is because in the agreement itself, the fishing quota estimated by the Commission is valued at EUR 28 million.
Indeed even that sum is too high if it is set against actual catch.
The Committee on Budgets recognises the special relationship between Greenland and the European Union.
The committee is also aware of the specific economic situation in that country.
Fishing remains crucial to the economy of Greenland.
Nonetheless, although the committee recognises the need to provide financial support for Greenland, it is opposed to the current approach of including such aid in the financial compensation that is part of the Fisheries Agreement.
Consequently, the Committee on Budgets believes it is essential for the Commission to table a proposal for a new protocol before the present one expires in December 2006.
The financial compensation in any new protocol should be in line with actual fishing opportunities.
A different proposal on financial aid to Greenland should be tabled concurrently.
Further, the committee is pleased to note that the Commission presented a mid-term review of the current protocol.
This is in line with the European Parliament's call for general assessment reports to be presented before the start of negotiations on renewal of protocols or agreements or indeed on new arrangements.
These general reports should contain cost benefit analyses.
I would therefore urge the Commission to present similar mid-term reviews for all agreements exceeding annual costs of EUR 3 million for the European Union's budget.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I was extraordinarily pleased to hear what Mrs Ramos and Commissioner Fischler had to say on this subject, which has been occupying us for such a long time.
It is my belief that we are now very, very close to a very, very good solution, and it is not all that often, in the area of fisheries, that we can speak in terms of an historic moment, as Commissioner Fischler has just done, but, for the first time since the fisheries agreement with Greenland was concluded in 1985, unused catch quotas have been transferred.
As we have just heard, this happened a few weeks ago and explicitly refers to 2003; I am talking about 2003!
One of the core demands formulated in Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos' report has thus been met.
I am sure, however, that this is where the Commission would like someone to stand up for them, and that I am willing to do.
We are told that they had earlier not proposed a transfer.
That is indeed so, but the implementation of such a measure is quite simply not in their capacities.
The authority to do so resides simply and solely with the quota holder, and there is no transfer if they do not want there to be one.
This transfer of quotas on a voluntary basis, now approved for the first time, is an impressive demonstration of my country's willingness to resolve the issue of quotas that have not been fully used up, and to do so finally, but in a spirit of partnership.
Contrary to what I have often heard said in recent months, Germany has not been engaged in egocentrically stonewalling European policy on these matters; on the contrary, we are backing the European Community.
Let me point out, though, that this regulation will not work without effort.
I warn against interfering with the principles of European fisheries policy.
This rapprochement must not be allowed to erode the principle of relative stability.
I believe that we should have further serious discussions about this.
So let me repeat that today's arrangement applies to 2003 and constitutes no kind of guarantee to other Member States that they will receive quotas that were - to take an example - formerly Germany's, as Germany will in future be backing a fleet that will fish around Greenland.
I would like to follow this positive aspect by mentioning another weak point.
What we are dealing with here is what we term the mid-term review of the protocol, as agreed in the protocol itself.
Having been a rapporteur on the subject, I still remember it very well.
I wonder, though, what effect Parliament's present opinion will have in future, as we know that amendments were agreed on as long ago as the end of June.
Have we been asked about them?
Will we, in future, be allowed only to nod them through as we did in the past, or will we be permitted to express appropriate outrage?
I am thinking not least of the effects of the fisheries agreement on the Budget, about which we have just again heard, when I emphatically demand - not only here and now, but also tomorrow - that Parliament be involved in the negotiating process.
We will end up having to amend the relevant treaties if that is to happen.
As a matter of principle, I regard anything else as an excuse!
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I feel it would be appropriate to start by recalling that the main reason for the existence of this agreement was Greenland's leaving the European Union.
I also think it is important to recall the reasons why Greenland chose to leave.
It left the Union because we wanted forcefully to remove this small and extremely remote community's inalienable right to fish within the two hundred miles of its exclusive economic zone, which are today clearly protected under International Maritime law.
This is perhaps the greatest mistake the European Union has made to date; it has already caused us serious problems in the past and still poses a threat for the future.
In small areas criss-crossed by national borders, such as the North Sea, having the European institutions jointly organise fishing for highly migratory surface fish species has been the right approach.
Moving from specific cases and solutions to common ownership of fishing resources under a supposed Community law is, however, no longer acceptable.
The same set of articles in International Maritime Law that defines the ownership of marine biological resources also defines the ownership of mineral resources, specifically fossil fuels.
The same European Community that sanctioned the application of these articles to delimit the ownership of underwater fossil fuel mines in the North Sea by various Member States claims that they do not apply to biological resources.
In other words, we would have a law that can only be used for protecting the interests of the States at the centre of Europe, where gas and oil is found, but which does not apply to protecting the interests of Europe's peripheral States or outermost regions, which contain enormous maritime areas with substantial resources.
In the ten-year period that we feel must now be started in order to ensure that the European institutions discuss the status of the 'Western waters', a thorough review must be conducted of the issue of access to waters, European legislation must be adapted to the broad principles of International Maritime Law and the best ways of safeguarding sustainable fisheries in the Atlantic must be studied.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Greenland agreement differs from the other fisheries agreements that the EU has entered into with third countries because it secures the EU access to fisheries resources via financial compensation and offers of market access for Greenland products.
Nor shall I conceal the fact that, for me as a Danish parliamentarian, Greenland and the fisheries protocol with Greenland are of quite special importance.
This is the fourth fisheries protocol with Greenland, and one which is of great value to both parties.
The financial compensation amounts to EUR 900 per capita in Greenland and gives the EU access to Greenland fisheries products, which constitute more than 90% of Greenland's total exports.
The fisheries agreement with Greenland also makes it possible for fishing rights to be exchanged with Iceland, Norway and the Faeroe Islands, something that maintains an overall balance in the north-east Atlantic.
The fourth protocol contains clear improvements on previous protocols in the shape of increased transparency, so that the Community's quotas now correspond to the real fishing possibilities in Greenland's waters, and the EU has, moreover, a continued option on the quantities laid down in the third protocol in the event of the stocks improving.
There is good cause for acknowledging your contribution, Commissioner Fischler, to what you called 'the historic agreement'.
The fourth protocol proposes that, upon expiry of the protocol, under-utilised fishing possibilities might be used up by countries other than those that derive direct benefit from the agreement in accordance with the principle of relative stability.
There is no doubt that the EU's fisheries agreements with third countries are now a significant part of the common fisheries policy.
The general expansion of the coastal states' fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the seventies meant that 95% of fishing stocks and 35% of the sea was subject to the coastal state legislation.
Traditional fishing grounds were lost, and a need was created for cooperation with third countries in order to ensure the continued survival of the Community's fishing fleets with a view to preserving the Community's share of world catches and securing continued supplies of fish to the EU's markets.
The fisheries agreement with Greenland came into force in 1995 in connection with Greenland's withdrawal from the EU as a result of the self-government agreement with Denmark.
Unfortunately, the Commission neglected to inform the European Parliament of experimental fisheries and of the creation of joint ventures.
Joint ventures are, in particular, something I expect a lot of, and I shall propose that we in the Committee on Fisheries initiate a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages.
I am able, in the end, to support Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos's report, and I should like to commend the work she has done.
Mr President, firstly we welcome the reduction, if not the complete elimination, of paper quotas: this is a more realistic approach.
Secondly, the establishment of a relationship between financial compensation for fishing rights and payment for development is an improvement in the agreement.
In the Commission's press release in June it noted that these two aspects have been separated.
As a result, it should now be possible to identify clearly what has been paid for.
It should also allow for greater transparency and accountability.
While this is very welcome, it does not give much detail.
I would like the Commission to give us more details as to what is going to be funded by the development fund and how it is going to be managed.
Whilst this is a welcome change in the way in which the Commission looks at fisheries agreements, it should take the same approach with the ACP agreements.
The Commission says that this is too difficult for all sorts of reasons, though it was one of the focal points in the recent partnership agreement discussion paper which the Commission produced.
We want to see this approach taken in the ACP agreements as well.
This kind of approach, separating development from what is actually being paid for the fishing rights is extremely important, as has been mentioned by other speakers.
If it is possible for Greenland, then it should also be possible for the ACP countries.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteurs, Mr Ojeda and Mrs MiguÃ©lez, because they are both presenting us with fisheries agreements and our Committee on Fisheries has done its duties perfectly in these reports.
I am going to refer essentially to the issue of Greenland, because I believe it to be important.
We are seeing great unanimity here on the part of all Members and this seems to me to be very positive and very important.
We are in a good frame of mind!
Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on your speech and the communication that has been made.
Parliament and the Commission are in agreement, which is very important and, with a view to the new Protocol which is going to be signed from 1 January of next year, I believe there is agreement already between the Member States themselves.
If you will allow me to say this, I believe the Commission has backed down, or if I may put it another way, the wise are ready to rectify.
As far as I remember, we in this Parliament have been calling for greater equity, greater transparency and greater justice in this agreement compared to the agreements in the south since 1994 and now this is beginning to be acknowledged.
I would also like to congratulate the new Director-General for Fisheries, Mr Holmquist, and the Director for Foreign Policy, because I know that they have made extraordinary efforts to make progress on the new line which Parliament is presenting at the moment and which - we all agree - is the line we must use for the agreement with Greenland.
The previous one, as has been said several times, was a scandal, and this is how the Court of Auditors saw it, as did this Parliament, because there were paper fish, there was wastage of quotas, which were not used by the States who could do so, as happens with the agreements in the south, and also there was non-payment of licences by ship owners.
Now this is being unified with the criteria of the agreements in the south and I believe that this is a truly positive step.
There is agreement in the Commission, there is agreement in the Council, as I understand it, and there will also be agreement in this Parliament.
Moreover, this is something we should all be pleased about for the sake of the interests of the European Union and all its Member States, naturally, and also in the interests of Greenland.
We are moving in the direction of mutual interest, and that is what is needed.
Experimental campaigns have been authorised since July, for new species, and there are possibilities for diversifying fisheries in Greenland, which is positive - I was in Greenland when I was chairman of the committee - and I know that there are other scientific possibilities and they must therefore be exploited.
I would draw your attention to mixed undertakings - I believe this is very important - and to temporary associations of undertakings.

The fishermen of Greenland themselves had asked me personally to help them achieve mixed undertakings, and therefore the issue is of interest to them, and I believe that by diversifying fishing opportunities in Greenland and by making it possible to use all the fisheries quotas, we will have done something very positive, as I have said, so that we can all be happy with the new Protocol which is going to be signed now from January and also in 2006.
Mr President, I should like to open my speech by asking a question; is there a common fisheries policy, apart from the one that is used to uphold the privileges enjoyed by some countries and fleets?
According to the draft constitution now before us, which will be going to the Intergovernmental Conference, there is not.
In the third part of the common policies, in the section dealing with agriculture and fisheries, fish are called agricultural products, and no reference at all is made to the CFP.
In a discussion of the Union's seas and maritime resources, this is as surprising as it is Kafkaesque.
It says nothing about the CFP, nothing about ensuring equal rights for all countries and fleets whilst, of course, preserving fish stocks for our children and grandchildren.
For this reason, amongst others, I support the report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos on the mid-term review of the 4th Fisheries Protocol with Greenland.
I support the report precisely because it represents a step in the right direction, calling for the fishing countries, fleets and companies unfairly excluded both by the incorrect application of the principle of relative stability, and by the current protocol to be given the opportunity of fishing in Greenland's waters.
The rapporteur opens the way for the discussion which is necessary to improve the forthcoming protocols, whilst upholding, as one would expect, Greenland's rights and its decision-making process.
Mr President, I congratulate Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos on her report.
She has highlighted some vitally important issues, not least the discrepancy between what we pay to Greenland every year - EUR 42.8 million - and what we get in return - fishing rights worth EUR 28 million.
I am glad that Commissioner Fischler has pointed out that the protocol signed yesterday goes some way towards adjusting this matter that the auditors have criticised in the past.
It is worth remembering, as Mr Casaca said, that these were the terms of an agreement drawn up at the time Greenland left the European Community.
A substantial part of this compensation package is to support the Greenland economy and the desperately poor Inuit population of Greenland.
I know this is a fact that Mrs Langenhagen is an expert on and has asked Parliament to deal with sympathetically in the past.
However, I support the rapporteur when she insists that those non-fisheries-related aspects of relations between the EU and Greenland have to be financed under heading 4 of the financial perspective or through the European Development Fund.
The fisheries budget must only be used for fisheries purposes.
On the other hand, I wish to sound a note of caution on that aspect of the report which calls for a share-out of under-utilised fishing rights.
Commissioner Fischler drew attention to this in his statement, and the protocol signed yesterday appears now to be able to allocate these under-used fishing rights to other Member States.
I would urge the Commissioner in this respect to remember the beleaguered whitefish fleet around the North Sea, particularly that of the UK, which is now tied up for half of every month with the quotas slashed by 50%.
If there is to be a handout of under-utilised rights or joint-venture partnerships, please ensure that the whitefish fleet in the North Sea comes at the top of the queue.



Mr President, very briefly, I wish to start by congratulating Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos on her magnificent report, which we all acknowledge to be extremely well thought out and sensible and which, as a matter of fact, follows on from a previous piece of work undertaken by Mrs Langenhagen, who was rapporteur when this fisheries protocol was first drawn up and who has also made some suggestions that represent a step in the right direction and which are in line with the Communication that the Commission is now presenting to us.
I believe that with this Commission statement, together with this declaration of intent, if it is put into practice - and we all hope that it is - we will finally put an end to the somewhat bizarre situation in which we have been operating until now.
First of all, as has already been said, we have been paying out compensation under the common fisheries policy that is worth almost twice the real value of catches - and this is no small matter; we are in fact talking about a straightforward doubling of the figure, which amounts to a tidy sum.
Secondly, we are finally seeing budgetary transparency, something that was previously lacking, as pointed out recently by the Court of Auditors.
Furthermore, there has been discrimination as regards access to resources in this area.
I would recall the specific case of my own country, which has historically always fished in these waters but which, after joining the European Union, because it had no agreement with Denmark, lost those historical rights.
We have a great deal of respect for the principle of relative stability but we feel that there must be flexibility so that quotas that go unused in any given year are taken over by those that can actually use them, without this, of course, preventing us from continuing to seek to divide up these quotas equitably, and consequently ensure relative stability.
This is why the Commission's document represents a step in the right direction and I hope that it is put into practice, together with the appropriate legislative measures.
Mr President, I am sorry to sound a note of disharmony in this debate, but this report needs to be taken in two respects.
First of all we have to isolate the fact that European taxpayers' money has to be spent with transparency - and at the moment it is not.
Clearly we are overpaying for the fishing rights and we should pay for the amount of fish that is caught by European fishermen, but if we wish to pay for Greenland development aid then let us pay for it separately.
I am not against it but it cannot be paid for with paper fish through a fisheries agreement.
I am very surprised at the Commission's attitude to the idea that we should now open up the number of species that can be caught in and around Greenland.
Anyone would think that the common fisheries policy has been a great success, when in fact we see fish stocks in European waters as a whole declining more and more.
The idea now is to open up more quotas for more species.
I have often said in this Chamber that fish unfortunately do not swim separately and very often, when one species of fish is caught, others also swim into the nets.
If the fishermen do not have quotas, these fish are discarded.
We all know that a disgraceful amount of fish is discarded in the European Union every year.
We need to review the whole idea of having third country agreements.
Very often it leads to the European Union exploiting third countries' waters and means that fishermen in these third countries are driven out of business and the whole thing is being brought into disrepute.
Often the money which the EU spends does not reach the fishermen or the countries for which it is intended.
It very often ends up in the wrong place.
We should review the whole situation.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos for the thorough airing she gave to this subject and for the usefulness of her report.
I also want to thank the Commissioner for having tidied the whole matter up and made what was certainly an unacceptable situation a bit more acceptable in these renegotiations.
I should like to refer to what my friend Mr Casaca said about the appropriation by the European Union of the fish of Greenland.
That also applies to the Azores, I am sure, and to Ireland, though the Azores' waters are not so rich.
The truth is something different.
At the time they joined the European Union there was only a six-mile limit in existence.
It was subsequently that the European Union extended it to 200 miles.
Then the fishermen of Greenland, Ireland and perhaps the Azores as well, began to see what might have been.
I agree - and have frequently repeated - that in order to have a common agricultural policy it was not necessary to take fish into common ownership.
We could have had a decent common fisheries policy without taking fish into common ownership.
We got the worst of all worlds, in that the Union owned the fish, but the national governments had the job of policing them.
That is where a very bad job was done.
That is why the stocks are run down.
What was everybody's business was nobody's business.
It was not the common fisheries policy in itself that destroyed the stocks, it was the lack of the necessary supervision.
If the Union had had the job of policing the catching of fish, we might have had some success.
Greenland withdrew from the Union.
It was not exactly as Mr Casaca said, but it withdrew after the 200-mile limit was extended.
It should have stood its ground and maintained solidarity.
It would have benefited from the structural funds, amongst other things.
At the very best, structural funds have only given EUR 300 per capita to any state in this Union - that was in Ireland.
The Portuguese, Greeks and southern Italians got a lot less than that.
However, according to Mr Busk's calculation, the people of Greenland are receiving EUR 900 per capita per annum.
That is too generous.
I believe we have mixed up our foreign policy with our fisheries policy.
We have given Greenland a deal that it had no right to expect, seeing that it voluntarily walked away and did not accept in good faith that it would have been fairly treated within the Union.
We are unable to comply with Mr Stevenson's request to move on to the debate on the Ojeda Sanz report because we are already behind schedule by almost a quarter of an hour with regard to the Commission's communication and we cannot increase the delay.
The debate on the Ojeda Sanz report will therefore take place this evening at 9 p.m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the Commission communication on the preparations for the 5th WTO Ministerial Conference in CancÃºn.
Commissioner Lamy has the floor.
Mr President, as Commissioner Fischler and I will be attending the fifth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference at CancÃºn, in Mexico, next week, in order to negotiate on the EU's behalf, the Commission had a discussion this afternoon on the current state of preparations for this conference. I would like to say a few words to you about this, and then reply to any comments you may have to make.
As you know, the success of the round of trade negotiations launched at Doha, eighteen months ago now, is still the European Union's primary concern as regards trade.
It is our expectation that greater openness to trade in goods and services and to investments will consolidate growth in Europe on the basis of the ground rules, which are to be strengthened in order to provide a framework for this greater openness.
What is also important, though, is that we are seeking to better involve developing countries in the world trade system, in order that they may benefit from the opening up of commerce and enjoy more of the benefits of globalisation, the harmful effects of which - and these do, emphatically, exist - will at the same time be alleviated.
As we will be able to finally judge at the end of this programme of negotiations, the hurdles have been set fairly high.
What sort of results do we need from CancÃºn to ensure the success of this negotiating round, which, at Doha, we called the 'development programme'?
That is what we, members of the World Trade Organisation, are going to consider together at CancÃºn next week, when we proceed with a sort of mid-term review in which what really matters is that we will at last know whether or not we will manage to wind up the negotiations between now and the end of next year, as we decided 18 months ago now.
That, basically, is the question that we are going to try to answer in CancÃºn, and if we are to answer in the affirmative, we first confirm that these negotiations are subject to a deadline of the end of 2004.
If our answer is to be in the affirmative, we will, in CancÃºn, have to be able to point to the completion of 50% of the negotiations across the board.
The fact is that these are not negotiations in which subjects are dealt with one after the other, with one being agreed on before moving on to the next; rather, these are wide-ranging negotiations on some twenty subjects which can be said to represent a balance between points that opposing sides wish either to defend or to attack.
The issue at CancÃºn is, then, whether, as regards these negotiations as a whole, we have covered about half the road, and whether we are sufficiently convinced of that to leave the final deadline of the end of next year unchanged.
Our concern, the European concern, is that this mid-term review will see the confirmation of this balance, as envisaged in the original programme, between the opening up of markets on the one hand and the strengthening of trade ground rules on the other.
We are very attached to this balance, and, in political terms, we see it as essential, corresponding as it does to our own economic system, by which I mean one that is open to trade, but bounded by a framework of rules reflecting social, health and environmental concerns.
This characterises the European Union in these negotiations, and it must be retained.
For that purpose, it is important that we make progress at a tempo comparable to that of the subjects raised in the course of negotiations as a whole.
Looked at from this angle, where do we stand?
It has been clear over the past weeks that things have been speeding up in Geneva.
It is apparent that the prospect of the meeting next week has already given a boost to negotiations that were occasionally tending to slow down.
The President of the General Council of the World Trade Organisation, the ambassador who chairs what is termed the WTO's General Council in Geneva, has put on the table a draft final statement which will serve as the basis on which the negotiators at ministerial level meeting in CancÃºn will work.
Commissioner Fischler and I have already said on many occasions that we are not enthusiastic about this draft.
We see various points in the draft statement as being seriously problematic, but it is a good thing that it actually exists and is clearly set out.
Some things in it, I repeat, are not acceptable.
Whether on agriculture, on industrial tariffs, whether on the environment or on geographical descriptions, we see this text as unbalanced, and so, I might add, do the other members of the WTO, but, as the WTO spokesman so humorously said, the ministers need something to do at CancÃºn.
As negotiators on behalf of the Fifteen, we will continue to fight for a result that strikes a balance between the opening up of markets and the laying down of rules making it possible to give the developmental dimension a more prominent place in all subject areas.
We are often asked whether we are optimistic or pessimistic about CancÃºn's chances of success.
You have not yet asked this, but I would like to say to you that Commissioner Fischler and I are neither the one nor the other.
We are negotiating on behalf of the EU, which has mandated us to do so.
Its mandate sets limits to what we can accept, and, as is customary, we will give you an account of the progress of the debates, as things happen and on the spot.
We will be accompanied by those who actually have political authority over us, namely the EU's Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, as well as by representatives of other parties involved.
We will therefore have the chance, on the spot, to evaluate precisely where we have got to, but let us be clear in our own minds about the fact that we have been formally mandated following debates held over recent months, both in the Council of Ministers and in Parliament.
Commissioner Fischler and I will therefore take this mandate as the basis for what we do.
I will conclude by emphasising that we will be taking with us good news when we set off for CancÃºn at the end of the week, and by that I mean the agreement reached last weekend on access to medicines.
It may be said that this agreement derogates for the first time from current patent regulations in order to allow countries in need of them to import generic medicines.
This agreement shows that the World Trade Organisation is capable of responding to the needs of developing countries.
This is no longer merely a project, a speech, or a vision, but tangible confirmation that globalisation can, and must, go hand in hand with development.
To sum up, although this agreement is only a small part of the enormous problem of poorer countries' access to medicines, it nonetheless marks a forward step, and, with you as my witnesses, I welcome it on behalf of the EU.
Apart from that, we know where we stand on the various subjects and, as I have just said, we will act on the basis of the mandate you have given us.
Mr President, we all realise that both Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler will need to stay within their mandate.
Within that mandate are included the Singapore issues and, in particular, investment.
Commissioner Lamy, you know from the last time we discussed this in this Chamber that the PSE Group feels it is quite inappropriate to pursue, of the Singapore issues, investment in particular.
Do you feel that the mood amongst developing countries is such that we risk causing great disruption to the discussions if we insist, against their will, on pursuing the question of investment?
Frankly, in our opinion, this is not the time.
I would be pleased to hear whether you accept that we ought to drop the push for investment to be included.
