The EU is Mercosur's number one trade and investment partner.
We have goods and services worth EUR 50 billion crossing the ocean annually.
In addition, the aggregate value of EU investments in the Mercosur countries in 2005 was around EUR 100 billion.
Also, and most importantly, we genuinely believe in the potential of an economically and politically integrated Mercosur.
The recent creation of the Structural Convergence Fund and Mercosur Parliament are most encouraging signals.
The EU is a firm supporter of this integration process, not just in words but also in concrete deeds.
The European Union has been and will continue to be the quasi-exclusive donor to Mercosur integration.
A sum of EUR 50 million has been committed over the last five years and the same amount is available for the current Financial Perspective (2007-2013) to help build Mercosur's institutions, strengthen civil society and take economic integration forward.
The conclusion of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement would be a colossal step forward in the integration process of the region.
That is why the European Union remains firmly committed to concluding the negotiations and is keen to advance in negotiations once there is more clarity in the Doha Development Round.
The strategic partnership with Brazil is a decision in favour of Brazil and in favour of Mercosur.
The two levels of relations - national and regional - will complement and mutually support each other.
In no way does the partnership replace the biregional EU-Mercosur negotiations.
We are in full agreement with Brazil that Mercosur is and will remain the only platform for our bilateral economic and trade relations.
I am convinced that by engaging with Brazil, Mercosur's largest member, we can bring a real added value to the regional integration process.
Shared experience in a joint agenda with the EU will encourage Brazil to better support Mercosur efforts to build a common market and a political union.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and the Commissioner for their necessary and relevant comments in the light of the text of the clear question put by the Committee on International Trade.
Brazil, as we all know, is a large and admirable country with enormous potential which is at a crucial point in its political and economic development.
Our mutual relationship is strong and we can and should strengthen it further.
Brazil's special links with Portugal, and Portugal's links with Brazil, are also known, recognised and respected by all.
- (PT) We well understand the position of our good and esteemed Portuguese friends, their interests and their concerns, because we share them.
(ES) However, the European Union, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have always expressed support for consolidating the regional integration of Mercosur, negotiating with the block and, as far as possible, supporting regional consolidation.
As has been said here, Brazil undoubtedly has a key role in this.
If the Communication from the Commission and the strategic relationship proposed with Brazil go in this direction, so much the better.
This would still be supporting the European Parliament, which expressed itself here in the debate and in the vote that took place on the report, for which I had the honour to be the rapporteur, on the EU's negotiations with Mercosur, which was adopted a year ago, and to which I refer.
Therefore, given the confusion that had arisen from this Communication, Parliament needed to ensure that this point would be clarified and that we would be kept informed.
We are also aware that the expectations of concluding an ambitious agreement between the European Union and Mercosur cannot go on forever, and if Mercosur itself does not make progress with its integration, and the European Union's negotiations with Mercosur remain stagnated, with or without a Doha agreement, a decision would have to be taken on them, and once again the most important thing would be effectiveness: a bilateral agreement with Brazil.
But unless this happens, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim is to reach an agreement with Mercosur.
In short, yes to Brazil, but without damaging the negotiations with the whole of Mercosur.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we on the INTA Committee requested this debate because we are very concerned as we see that we are concluding more and more agreements of different kinds which affect all our work in the external economic sector and which also, of course, always have a foreign policy component.
We have bilateral free trade agreements, regional free trade agreements, partnership agreements and strategic agreements and we worry about how these can be brought together so that we have a consistent European approach for responding to the challenges of globalisation in the foreign policy and external economic sector.
Commissioner, you have rightly said that Brazil is an important country for us.
I am also very grateful that the President-in-Office of the Council is present, and we all, of course, share this opinion.
It is not just an important country; it is in many respects also a fantastic country.
The question simply is: how can we sensibly combine this strategic agreement with, at the same time, the idea of concluding a regional agreement with Mercosur, which has got itself into very troubled waters?
It is simply not true that we get along wonderfully in the negotiations.
It is very complicated.
Alongside this we want to conclude a multilateral agreement in the Doha Round.
It does not seem at all likely that we will be able to bring this agreement off as a crowning achievement, if we can bring it off at all.
So how do you want to bring all this together at the same time?
That is our question.
Of course, it is also a strategic agreement.
What is the nature of a strategic agreement?
It contains a great deal if you look at it.
There are very many political declarations of intent on Brazil and all of them very sensible.
Again, in my Group we are very happy that they are also included, but how do you want to link this to the other members, e.g. in Latin America, with whom we have free trade agreements?
Or how do you want to feed this back again so that our trade policy is imbued with a uniform European policy in such a way that all partners can understand this too?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mercosur is a reality that owes a lot to the European Union.
Undoubtedly Mercosur is essentially the fruit of the free and sovereign decision of its members, there is no doubt, of its four full members, soon five if, as we hope, there are no obstacles to the pending ratification of Venezuela's application for membership.
It is obvious that it is therefore the fruit of its members.
However, it is also obvious that, since its origins in 1985, with the Foz de IguazÃº declaration and the Treaty of AsunciÃ³n in 1991, the European Union has been very close to what was then in its infancy and is now a reality.
It has been very close, supporting, sharing and defending the very existence of Mercosur and what Mercosur was aiming to do, because we knew that the regional relationship, between regional framework and regional framework, had many benefits for them and also for us.
For this reason the European Parliament has always supported giving maximum impetus to the association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur.
An agreement that can stand up, which is ambitious as well as balanced.
An agreement which, alongside the trade dimension, the strictly trade dimension, also has a political and institutional chapter, as well as a chapter aimed at promoting sustainable economic and social development.
These are values that have been defended by the European Parliament throughout its relationship with Mercosur.
This is why Members of this Parliament that are dedicated to external trade issues in the Committee on International Trade are surprised, as reflected in various speeches, at the announcement of a strategic bilateral agreement with Brazil.
We have all always felt that the regional framework is the most effective way to achieve these objectives, and the real pillar on which to base our relations.
It is obvious that the growing role of Brazil deserves not only respect, but real congratulations.
President Lula and his Government are consolidating a role of leadership for the country that is contributing a great deal to the stability of the area and progress for millions of people.
Everyone is aware, if we look at the figures, of how important Brazil's influence is in our trade relations with this dear part of the world and how increasingly important it will be.
However, a specific, strategic relationship between the European Union and Brazil, as announced on 30 May, runs the risk of damaging the regional relationship between the European Union and Mercosur.
We heard the Secretary of State and the Commissioner trying to put our minds at rest on this, and we received those explanations.
However, we ask that in these negotiations Parliament should continue to be kept informed, because we all understand that, in theory, a specific strategic agreement with Brazil is possible, but that we would not want and would not support anything that weakened the regional relationship.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the issue of Brazilian beef continues to dominate the headlines, as it is a problem that affects the farmers and consumers of Europe.
As an Irish Government MEP, I met with the Brazilian Ambassador to the European Union in May of this year and again at the end of August to highlight my concerns regarding Brazilian beef exports to the EU.
These include illegal removal of tags, smuggling of cattle across borders from foot-and-mouth-affected areas, and the proper testing of cattle.
The EU has rightly adopted the policy of regionalisation whereby, if there is an outbreak of foot-and-mouth in a country, only the affected area is excluded from exporting beef.
This policy worked well in Ireland in 2001 and in the UK this summer, as strict traceability policies were implemented immediately.
This level of traceability does not exist in Brazil and this is unacceptable from an EU point of view.
In the EU, beef farmers have to comply with stringent standards imposed by the Commission.
I would urge the Commission to ensure that the same standards and regulations are applied in Brazil as currently exist in Europe to ensure a level playing field for all.
I am delighted that Commissioner Fischer Boel is visiting Brazil next month and I hope that after her visit she will be able to answer the justifiable concerns of the farmers and consumers of Europe.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think we should not beat about the bush.
The problem is not the respect that we owe this great country, Brazil, the problem is the turn that international relations are now taking.
Mr Mandelson and, it seems, the Directorate-General for Trade have abandoned the ideal of multilateralism and are embracing the bilateralist approach of the United States.
What used to be the trademark European position in international trade was that we at least wanted bi-regionalism; in other words, to discuss things region to region.
Well, we were told, we are in talks with Brazil, and we are in talks with India: as if we needed to compensate in some way for the memory of British imperialism by the memory of Portuguese or Spanish imperialism!
India is two and a half times the size of Europe, including Turkey.
India is three times the size of Latin America.
Our aim is to help create a multipolar world.
This means that first of all, we must help with the unification of Mercosur and the Andean Community, and then the unification of the entire South American Community of Nations.
In this respect, we have nothing against discussions, whether with Bolivia or Brazil, but we must bear in mind that we should be seeking to unite and not divide.
We must put Mercosur before Brazil in our list of priorities and, when we hold talks with Brazil, we must consider the consequences that this could have, including for our discussions with ASEAN on sugar.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, even though negotiations with Mercosur are only making slow progress, the EU should send the clear signal to the government of Brazil and our other partners that it will not be concluding any bilateral agreements with individual governments that oppose the processes of integration in the respective regions: not with Brazil, which is a member of Mercosur and potentially a future member of Unasur, not with Columbia or Peru, which are members of the Andean Community and also potential members of Unasur.
The difficulties in the negotiations with Mercosur are not trifling matters.
The future of farming, not just the future of agribusiness and the service sector, industrialisation, technology transfer, access to medication, these are all questions to which we must find answers together with our Latin American partners if we want real cooperation with this region.
Our aim should be a process of cooperation in which the interests of the citizens are central.
Cooperation should not be limited simply to dividing up market shares and access to energy and water or to distributing patents on intellectual property.
My Group has warmly welcomed the fact that Brazil, like Thailand, has been taking significant steps, despite objections from the pharmaceutical industry, to improve access to medication.
These steps should be supported by the Commission and Council.
We also welcome the fact that Brazil has already declared itself willing to discuss the problem of the destruction of the rainforest in the Amazon, because this is essential for stabilising the climate.
Even though destruction has slowed down in the last two years, it has not stopped.
Pressure from both the European Union and the USA and other players for access to biofuels, particularly ethanol, instead of better controls on their consumers' behaviour, is another danger for the rainforest and food security.
Every so often we hear from the Brazilian authorities that the country has to expand its agricultural industry in order to improve its financial situation in the face of its problem with foreign debt.
As you know, new governments in the region are trying to follow new paths to resolve this problem.
Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Paraguay and Argentina have joined forces to create a Bank of the South and thereby to become independent of the World Bank and the IMF.
This is also good news, even if we as the European Union are shareholders in other banks and therefore suffer the loss of credit allocations.
However, we then must abandon our kind of conditionality.
The European Union should not look on passively here, but be pro-active and develop and extend these approaches that are completely in line with our own aims of cooperation and environmental protection.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, it says a great deal that the new bilateral strategic partnership with Brazil has been brought about under the Portuguese Presidency.
I value the fact that each Member State is given the space to leave its own mark on the EU policy during its presidency.
I would add, however, that Member States should use this elbow room only whilst taking into consideration the continuity of the current EU policy agenda.
It is precisely for this reason that I share the concern that I sense in the issue that we are debating here.
For some time now, the European Union has had the objective of entering into an interregional association agreement with Mercosur.
This objective is thwarted by the bilateral strategic partnership with Brazil.
Firstly, the other Mercosur countries feel cheated by the European Union.
Instead of an interregional agreement, the Union evidently prefers a bilateral agreement.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission what initiatives it is taking to dispel these concerns in countries such as Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
Trade relations with these countries are just as important for the Union.
A second reason for my concern with regard to Mercosur lies in the stability and political course of this collaboration.
Over the past few years it has been clear that Brazil wishes to profile itself more forcefully on a global level as the continent's natural leader.
This manifests itself not only in an assertive role within the WTO, but also for example in the desire to acquire a seat in the Security Council.
As a result, Brazil has less of an interest in its own role on the continent.
After all, Mercosur consumes just 10% of Brazil's export.
The country therefore seems less prepared to invest in other Mercosur countries.
With its entry into the global arena, Brazil is indicating that it feels it has outgrown its role within the region.
The reverse side to this Brazilian policy is the threat to the stability and political course of Mercosur.
Following the withdrawal of Brazil, Venezuela is endeavouring to assume the leading role within Mercosur and therefore within the entire continent.
ChÃ¡vez is attempting to enhance its role within the region with the aid of oil funds and anti-western rhetoric.
Venezuela operates a protectionist, internally oriented economic policy, in which major economic sectors are threatened with renationalisation.
In the meantime, there is no more room for free trade and the opening up of new markets.
I assume that the Council and the Commission are aware of the fact that these developments have consequences for the countries of South America, but certainly also for the economic and trade interests of the Union in this area.
I call upon the Council and Commission to exploit the fact that a bilateral partnership exists with Brazil in order to turn around the trend that I have just described.
The Union must urge Brazil to use the new political weight of the bilateral partnership with the EU in order to display new political leadership within Mercosur and on the continent.
This must serve to prevent the isolationist policies of countries such as Venezuela and Bolivia from extending further across the continent.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to comment on the content of the partnership.
I am of the opinion that the content of the EU partnership with Brazil must not focus solely on topics such as bio-ethanol, but equally upon getting the Doha Round off the ground.
After all, the role of Brazil has until now predominantly been the achievement of individual successes in relation to agriculture, whilst the country is not truly prepared to compromise with regard to NAMA and services.
(PL) Mr President, it is my conviction that negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur should be a priority for our work in the forthcoming months.
Despite the many problems we are currently encountering, multilateral cooperation in the context of this region is far more advantageous, as it will enable cooperation within the framework of all the states associated together in Mercosur to be maintained and at the same time deepened, regardless of their economic position in the region.
A successful conclusion to the negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur has a chance of leading to the creation of the largest free trade zone in the world, which will translate into a significant increase in trading volumes and a strengthened position for both partners, the European Union and the Mercosur countries, in the world economy.
It is evident that the greatest beneficiaries of this agreement will be small and medium-sized enterprises, in both the EU and Latin America, and we are all aware that small and medium-sized enterprises that are growing in strength mean new jobs, better quality of services and social wellbeing.
I think that partnership with Brazil, as our largest partner in this region, is very important, and we should develop it, but under the aegis of cooperation with Mercosur, and this means that first we must put together an association under the Mercosur framework, and only then, with this as a basis, should we build up any bilateral cooperation with individual Latin American countries.
Building up cooperation with just one country in the region may undermine understandings that have been arrived at previously and become a factor that holds back work on an association agreement with Mercosur.
This is why I think, and I would like to stress this once again, that concluding an ambitious arrangement with Mercosur that is advantageous to all - the EU and the Latin American states that have joined to form Mercosur - should be a priority for us, and Brazil, as the strongest country in this region, should be the motor for this negotiation process.
(PT) Mr President, Secretary of State, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Brazil strategic partnership is not a threat to regional balance nor to the EU's economic and trade relations with other Latin American partners.
On the contrary, it favours those relations, as mentioned in the joint statement from the EU-Brazil Summit on 4 July.
Today's question has the benefit of provoking a debate on EU-Latin America and EU-Brazil relations, both of which are extremely important.
As already mentioned here, I see the EU-Brazil partnership as filling a gap.
It was not acceptable that the European Union's strategic partnerships with the BRIC countries should leave out the 'B' for Brazil.
The Portuguese Presidency was right, then, to promote the EU-Brazil Summit, in line with what it did in 2000 when it held the first EU-India Summit, which did not harm relations with the other countries in that region.
There are therefore now better conditions for Europe to give a fresh impulse to relations with Mercosur and to the Doha negotiations.
Strengthening the EU-Brazil dialogue makes complete sense because it will enable cooperation to be enhanced in key areas such as energy security and sustainable development, biodiversity, climate change, the fight against poverty and exclusion, promotion of democracy and human rights, etc. Brazil's demographic weight, economic development and political stability inevitably make it a key player on the international stage.
Europe can only gain from regarding Brazil as a strategic partner.
As the Secretary of State has already said here, relations between the European Union and Brazil cannot be analysed solely in an economic context.
That is too narrow a view that overlooks historical links, cultural and linguistic affinities, cooperation between universities and many common interests in various areas.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do the South Americans still believe in an interregional agreement between the EU and Mercosur?
This, I believe, is the question that we must ask ourselves.
The trade strategy of the Mercosur countries follows two different paths, on the one hand allowing Mercosur to develop further, but on the other hand, as in the case of Brazil, concluding as many bilateral trade agreements as possible in order to secure a market position for the individual country, if necessary at the expense of the other Members of Mercosur.
It sometimes resembles the combination of an Argentine tango with a Brazilian samba.
Nevertheless, provided that both the EU and Mercosur continue to believe in the value of a broad-based collaboration between the two continents, then hope remains, despite the pressure of US President Bush to establish a free trade area of the Americas.
With 34 countries, the enthusiasm of the Mercosur members is not tremendously great.
They are disappointed with the lack of support offered by the United States during the recent heavy economic crisis.
Europe is now already Mercosur's most important trading partner, yet there is still huge potential for growth between both trade blocs.
If, therefore, we can do something to resolve the mutual discord between the Mercosur countries, for example by means of collaboration in multilateral trade negotiations such as the WTO, in which the EU and Mercosur frequently have common interests, perhaps we may once again come a little closer to achieving an interregional agreement.
(GA) Mr President, there is one point which I want to make about trade between Europe and Brazil, and that is the standard that we observe here in Europe, as far as meat production is concerned, and the strict rules that we lay down for the European meat trade.
That notwithstanding, we accept meat imported from Brazil, a place where no such rules apply.
I think that it is time for the Commission to address itself to this matter and ask questions of its own.
Why is there a big difference between the stringent standard observed here in Europe and the standard permitted in Brazil as regards the traceability of meat, stock tags, and foot and mouth disease?
It is time for the Commission to raise these matters, as the great discrepancy in terms of standards is seriously disquieting for customers.
Trade is one thing; health for life is quite another.
(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think that it is clear that Brazil, due to its size, its population, its natural resources and, above all, its role on the international stage - I am thinking about the role that it is playing in the reform of the United Nations system, the role that it is playing in relation to the whole subject of climate change and the debate on energy resources - fully justifies the Communication presented by the Commission in terms of being able to benefit from a strategic partnership between the European Union and the great country that is Brazil.
And this strategic partnership, in my opinion, needs to be on three levels: from a global perspective, a regional perspective and a bilateral perspective.
However, it is one thing to give Brazil the treatment it deserves as the great country that it is, and another for the European Union not to continue with its commitment to the work that it has been doing to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur.
I do not think that this was the Commission's intention in its Communication; I think that we can clearly gather from this Communication that the two hypotheses are perfectly compatible: on the one hand, the strategic dimension with Brazil, and, on the other hand, determined support for integration processes, of which the European Union is the most complete and obvious example.
Another thing is the Association Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur not being concluded on the terms that we would all like, and it is an agreement that has been delayed for too long now.
The question is a legitimate one: How long is the European Union going to keep waiting to conclude this agreement?
I think that we need to support regional integration processes, and it is only with this perspective, only in this dimension, that we will understand the advantages of union and integration.
Mr President, the priorities of this House in trade negotiations are clear.
Firstly, we want a successful multilateral round.
Secondly, we want successful biregional arrangements and as a fall-back - but only as a fall-back - we look to improve bilateral arrangements.
I have to confess that when I first heard about the priority given to the Brazil strategic partnership agreement, I felt we were rewarding a country that has been one of our more awkward partners in the multilateral negotiations in the Doha Round.
I also felt it would undermine Mercosur, where, without Brazil, there is no Mercosur.
However, having heard the Council this morning, having spoken to my Portuguese colleagues, I am convinced that there is a possibility that a successful strategic partnership agreement with Brazil can make it easier in the Doha Round if we develop understanding between ourselves and a key Doha player.
It can make it easier to get a Mercosur agreement if we find solutions to some of our more intricate economic challenges and of course a good agreement with Brazil would signal to them that we support their domestic priority of tackling social exclusion and poverty.
So I am not entirely convinced, but I am more convinced that an agreement between the EU and Brazil is now a more desirable objective than it was a few weeks ago.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in such a changing global geopolitical context, our Parliament, on several occasions, has expressed its unwavering determination to strengthen the partnership between our two continents.
As I see it, this new entity must be Mercosur. It can help us find ambitious, balanced and political solutions to the issues of energy supply, reducing the greenhouse effect or even the quality of our agricultural products.
The regional integration of South America cannot be furthered and cannot be effective if we choose to negotiate with one of the members of Mercosur, rather than working in partnership with the new entity as a whole.
For my part, I am campaigning for regional integration, which as I see it is a vehicle of stability and prosperity for this part of the world, and for us, and should be supported and monitored. I also think it would be a shame if Mercosur countries were to move away from this major project because of our lack of political ambition, and thus fail to seize this opportunity for both continents, Latin America and Europe.
This would clearly set us apart from the US policy of creating a vast economic free trade area for the entire American continent.
(PT) When we ask what contribution a strategic partnership between the European Union and Brazil can make to developing the relationship between the EU and Mercosur, with a view, amongst other things, to concluding the much-wanted, long-delayed agreement, I think there can only be one answer: that contribution is of major importance.
At the same time, it must be said that a strategic partnership between the EU and Brazil would always be justified and that in this matter the only flaw is the time that has already been lost.
Of the four 'BRIC' countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China - Brazil was the only one that the EU had not held any high-level meetings with until the Summit on 4 July.
That is even more of an anomaly given that Brazil is the major regional power in South America.
It is a democracy, with the imperfections which new democracies tend to have, which shares our own framework of values.
It is a traditional and reliable ally and an economic partner of major importance both at regional level and in terms of the global economy.
For all these reasons a strategic partnership with Brazil is justified, because this country is a strategic partner of the European Union in its own right.
However, there are also other reasons for strengthening the relationship and developing a strategic partnership with Brazil.
As stated in the communication from the Commission, this relationship can and must be a driving force for developing dialogue with Mercosur.
The two partnerships are not in opposition to one another; they are complementary.
The relationship can and must also be a factor favourable to the quest for solutions in the context of the World Trade Organization.
Just as, finally, the relationship can and must be a sign that the European Union recognises the special importance of this country in international relations and is intending to take that fact into account in the context of the discussion on UN reform.
Mr President, it is increasingly necessary for the European Union to act as a global-scale economic partner and a strategic partnership with Brazil is a sign that we want to follow that path.
That is the way we must go if we want to obtain an agreement with Mercosur.
To exclude Brazil from privileged bilateral relations would be unfair and, above all, a serious political mistake.
(RO) Mr. President, I would like to emphasize the importance of this document and, as a member of the EU - Mercosur Delegation, I would like to emphasize the importance of the region.
It is a large region, with a high population, which is promising and must be helped towards economic growth.
This is a region with many natural resources and, in fact, the European Union absorbs 25% of the Mercosur region's exports.
It is important to assist this region for economic development, for industrial development; its role in climate changes will be extremely important and, for this reason, we must support regional integration.
For the 2007-2013 strategy, one fifth of the budget allocated for the relationship with Mercosur will finance education and development of the information society and this is extremely important, taking into consideration that, in Brazil, the illiteracy rate is approximately 90%.
Also, I believe that Brazil plays an important role due to the fact that almost half of the Mercosur region's population is located in this country.
I repeat, climate changes are extremely important and this region plays an important role.
(EL) Mr President, there is no doubt that Brazil plays a significant commercial role on the world stage.
Further strengthening of economic ties between the EU and Brazil is therefore desirable.
The EU is Brazil's main trading partner, whilst Brazil is ranked just our twelfth most important trading partner in the EU.
The strategic partnership between the EU and Brazil should not, in my view, cause divisions in the en bloc approach of the Mercosur region.
Nevertheless, this relationship can play a complementary role in two spheres: in the multilateral negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and in the free trade area between the EU and Mercosur.
This area will be the largest area of inter-regional cooperation; it will highlight the lack of progress in the multilateral negotiations in question and in inter-regional negotiations.
The progress of both areas of negotiation is to a large extent interlinked.
The free trade area between the EU and Mercosur, like the Doha Round at the WTO, has become caught up in issues of trade in agricultural goods.
The role of Brazil is particularly important here: given its influence on economic stability and integration in the wider region, Brazil ought to contribute creatively to bring about a balanced and ambitious agreement between the EU and Mercosur.
At the WTO level, Brazil cannot expect only the markets in agricultural goods of developed Member States to open up further.
Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, like the other emerging economies, Brazil must take its due share of responsibility in the current Doha Round negotiations, through genuine commitments to opening up particularly protectionist markets and complying with the rules and disciplines of the WTO.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, to begin with I would like to express my conviction that the Portuguese Presidency is following a correct strategy as regards achieving a strategic partnership between the European Union and Brazil.
I feel that the European Union should initiate and finalise this partnership as quickly as possible.
The role of Brazil in the modern globalised world is clear, economic and cultural, as is the role played by Brazil in the United Nations.
A strategic partnership between the European Union and Brazil will enable mutual relations to be energised, and will be of good service to today's political, cultural and economic order on a world scale.
I repeat, it will be of service in improving political harmony in the global sphere.
I do not think this strategic partnership will prove any kind of hindrance to the development of a strategic partnership with Mercosur.
Partnership with Mercosur requires a strategic partnership with Brazil.
(PT) From the outset the Portuguese Presidency's programme included holding a summit meeting with Brazil.
It became clear that the parties would propose laying the foundations for establishing a strategic partnership.
It does not therefore make much sense to express any surprise or concern now about disregard for Mercosur and undue or premature favouring of Brazil.
The scale of the Brazilian trade market for European exporters must not be underestimated.
The European Union cannot lose the opportunity of obtaining a strategic partnership with Brazil.
The facts show that the European Union's relations with Mercosur and Brazil respectively are already condemned to go at different speeds.
It is not ideal, but there is no evidence that one going faster does any harm to the other.
On the contrary, it might even be a strong incentive to speed things up.
Brazil today is an emerging world power, the only one among the Mercosur member states, with a market representing 85% of the Mercosur market.
It is a representative democracy.
It is one of the European Union's principal trade partners and a country whose 200 million inhabitants speak one of the most widespread European languages in the world - Portuguese - and whose values of civilisation and culture are closely related to those of Europe.
Without prejudice to the advantages which real progress in relations with Mercosur would mean for the EU, I do not think there is or ever has been any weighty argument in favour of delaying advancement and enhancement of our relationship with Brazil.
Nor is it up to the European Union to oversee the internal ups and downs between Mercosur members.
To think otherwise and to put off indefinitely the achievement of the Union's very important objectives, with respect, is to indulge in wishful thinking that is incompatible with the present day situation, acting as though our plans and wishes had come true, when they have not and we do not know when they will.
(PT) The experiment at regional integration in Mercosur has essentially been a success both at the economic and the political level.
Mercosur's contribution to democratic consolidation in the region and growth in the volume of trade within that bloc are unquestionable facts.
It is true that at the moment the negotiations between the EU and Mercosur are at an impasse because of the wait for commitments and agreements to emerge from the Doha Round that may serve as a new starting point for our bilateral trade negotiations.
Although I do not wish to appear too pessimistic, we run the risk that the Doha Round will merely result in our losing precious time.
The EU should contribute to the success of South American regional integration by putting all its efforts into the success of the negotiations between the two blocs.
Our relationship must be much more extensive than a mere free trade agreement.
Under discussion here is a global agreement that goes much further than figures and quantities of goods to be traded.
The association agreement includes cooperation and political dialogue, which are fundamental pillars for our future relationship.
No one doubts nowadays that the European Union needs Ibero-America and its great instrument, Mercosur, in order to achieve its objective of building a more balanced and multilateral international order.
The joint statement by the President of the European Commission and the President-in-Office of Mercosur, the President of Uruguay, TabarÃ© VÃ¡squez, following the meeting on 19 September promising a joint public statement by the two blocs by the end of the year on the environment and climate change is an important example of that political collaboration.
Mercosur offers great promise as far as economic integration and making South America politically stronger on the international stage are concerned, but that does not mean we can overlook or pretend not to see what is before us - the incontrovertible political presence of Brazil, by sheer force of the facts, as the leading power in South America.
Brazil is the soul and driving force of Mercosur.
With its 190 million inhabitants and an economy representing approximately 75% of Mercosur's GDP, Brazil is the only BRIC country with which the Union had not held a summit until now.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is absurd to think that the European Union can teach Brazil anything about the importance of Mercosur or appoint itself Mercosur's champion before Brazil.
That is absolutely ridiculous.
Similarly, Brazil is the only Mercosur member country aspiring for a place on the UN Security Council, which it merits and which will give the whole of Latin America a voice within that important body.
Mr President, in the past I was a champion of EU-driven regional integration in Latin America through preferential support for regional multilateral blocs, such as Mercosur.
But, regrettably, in spite of the closeness of its constituent countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) culturally, Mercosur remains too weak politically compared to national interests, therefore impeding an EU-style single market in the region - although this, of course, should be our long-term objective.
Mercosur's functioning is worsened by the recent decision by Venezuela to join, with ChÃ¡vez's anti-free-market rhetoric leading to even more protectionism in Mercosur, whose talks with the EU have for some time now been stalled.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that the EU is instead championing a strategic bilateral partnership - as agreed this July - with Brazil, which is an economic giant, but one whose share of global trade is still small in comparison to other developing countries, precisely because Brazil has failed to sign profitable bilateral free-trade agreements, placing too much faith in Mercosur.
Unlike Mexico, which already has a deal with the EU and is the other dominant player in Latin America today, ChÃ¡vez's petrodollar generosity towards Argentina has forced President Lula of Brazil to ignore Mercosur issues and allowed President Kirchner of Argentina to further his protectionist stance.
Populist Ecuador is also making noises now, joining Mercosur in spite of joining the anti-US, Venezuelan-led Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) trade initiative.
One recent spat between Argentina and Uruguay clearly demonstrates the lack of effectiveness of Mercosur in resolving its partners' differences over the pulp mill being constructed by an EU Finnish company, Botnia, on the banks of the River Uruguay.
President Kirchner failed to stop the project, and at the same time antagonised his neighbouring country - and Mercosur partner - Uruguay by refusing to allow Mercosur's supranational institutions to arbitrate this dispute.
Instead, what did he do?
He called in the King of Spain to arbitrate.
(MT) Mr President, we have before us today an agreement that reaffirms and consolidates the important role of the European Union in the global political sphere - a role to which we should attach great importance because it is part of the success of this union of states.
This agreement emphasises the strengthening of the relationship not only with our neighbouring countries, but also with countries from other continents, especially countries that are home to thousands of millions of people of European origin such as those of Latin America and Central America.
It is in the interest of both sides that these relations continue to be strengthened by means of dialogue and the exchange of ideas.
However, we have to ensure that democracy in the countries that benefit from any assistance that we give is safeguarded.
We should also ensure that all assistance, both direct and indirect, is targeted at reducing poverty, increasing equality and, last but not least, reducing the imbalance between the two regions of the world.
This should always be within the bounds of transparency and accountability.
Protection of freedom of expression and of fundamental rights should also be a priority in all negotiations.
Whilst the European Union should provide assistance to each country in particular periods, but requires special help, we must ensure that this is done within a structured framework so that no one is left behind and so that wealth is distributed fairly.
As Members of this Parliament we must as far as possible promote relations between the European Union and Mercosur and determine how to strengthen any weak points so that in these relations we can ensure efficacy and success as far as possible.
With new challenges such as climate change being given increasing importance on our agenda, we should view these relations as the beginning of a strategic partnership that leads to an environmental dimension and sustainable development that produce reciprocal wealth.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your contributions.
I have already had the opportunity on previous occasions to explain, justify and inform the European Parliament about the first EU-Brazil Summit, its results and objectives.
Moreover, the importance of this strategic partnership with Brazil has been amply highlighted by many Members here today and I cannot but welcome the fact that those Members who at first seemed doubtful or more hesitant about the intention of the Portuguese initiative, now in fact seem more favourable towards the strategic choice which Portugal, as the country holding the Presidency, but also the European Union as a whole, made with regard to Brazil.
Naturally we are speaking and have spoken here about Brazil's importance politically and economically, and as regards the environment and energy, which are fundamental realities in the contemporary world which we cannot ignore.
It would be odd, as pointed out here, if the European Union were to have strategic relationships, strategic partnerships with Russia, India and China, but not with Brazil.
We believe that we have bridged that gap and we also believe that in a few years' time everyone will unequivocally applaud this initiative by the Portuguese Presidency.
However, we also always made it absolutely clear that this strategic partnership which we believe the European Union should establish with Brazil in no way excluded or limited other relations which we also wished to extend on the economic and political levels with Mercosur.
I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that I am fairly at ease about that because Portugal was always amongst those EU countries that always fought for a close and deep relationship of solidarity with the Mercosur countries in all aspects of that relationship.
We therefore have no hesitation and do not wish to allow the impression to be created here that a partnership with Brazil excludes or could exclude a close partnership with the Mercosur countries.
Such a vision, which instead of being a vision of complementarity could be a vision of exclusion, does not seem helpful to us and, above all, does not seem to correspond to reality - quite the reverse.
Furthermore, as has been pointed out here, it is the final statement from the EU-Brazil Summit itself which explicitly and completely unequivocally states that the European Union and Brazil will work together so that the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement might finally become a reality.
We are all aware of the ups and downs which the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement has gone through.
We really are at an impasse due largely, as we know, to issues of trade between the European Union and Mercosur.
The Doha Round began in the meantime and what happened there obviously also influenced the trade dimension of the EU-Mercosur negotiations.
I want to make it quite clear to you, however, that once the Portuguese Presidency considers that the minimum conditions are established to relaunch that debate and that relationship, we shall not hesitate; we also assure you that, if that is not during the Portuguese Presidency then Portugal as a Member State - as it has always done and as has always been its aim - will not fail to call the attention of its partners to the real need to relaunch the negotiations on the Association Agreement with Mercosur in all its dimensions.
In conclusion, I must tell you that we are considering holding, if possible still within the Portuguese Presidency, a high-level troika meeting with the Mercosur countries.
We are studying that possibility and, as I say, as a possibility for the Portuguese Presidency's agenda, which is, as you all know, a very full and very complex agenda, but we shall do what we can to be able to relaunch - at the political level too - this debate with the Mercosur countries.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am also very grateful for the atmosphere, the debate and the real openness on this issue.
I think we have to be responsive to the realities of the time and, fortunately, we now have many more important partners for multilateral cooperation than maybe 10 or 20 years ago.
The reality is that Brazil is the only country missing from the BRICS group, one of the five which are regularly invited by the G8 to its summits and a country which represents EU investment equalling the level of investment in Russia, China and India cumulatively from EU countries, so it is a really important partner.
It is even more important to add that the strategic partnership is complementary to overall broader priorities, including cooperation with Latin America and with Mercosur: in the partnership itself, one of the strategic common issues is the promotion of regional integration and an EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.
A lot has been said about the content and some concerns voiced.
We addressed them.
For example, in the food safety area in the first half of this year, an intensive programme of inspections was carried out, especially regarding beef, fishery products and poultry.
We have witnessed significant improvements in food safety, and many deficiencies have been largely rectified, but of course the work will continue, as some of you said, even at political level.
The Commissioner will visit Brazil next month to discuss this area, and that is a very important area of closer cooperation.
It is our common cause, our common interest, that the Doha Development Round is concluded successfully.
We are doing all we can in this regard on all sides in order to reach the end, hopefully this year.
I shall make a small remark on what could be done in promotion of cooperation with other countries.
There is, for example, one area which I wanted to raise as a good case.
Brazil is the first country from Latin America to cooperate in our research programme and, via this experience and bridge, I think we can gradually do more in other countries.
So it is not against the others; it is one of the leading economies and partners in the area and cooperation is growing overall.
It is very complementary to our ambitions to bring more integration to the Latin American continent.
The Commission will keep you duly informed about the process, as requested.
We are now awaiting the political response to the communication from the Brazilian side.
On the basis of this response, we will try mutually to draft an action plan proposal and then hopefully get this action plan agreed and implemented.
Last but not least, I want to express my gratitude to the Presidency for its commitment and very positive input, regarding not only the first historical summit, but also the development of cooperation between the EU and Brazil and between the EU and Mercosur as a broader area.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Green Paper on urban transport (debate)
The next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on Urban Transport.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Rarely has a debate been so topical, since you have only just come out of the meeting. Thank you for delivering a copy of the Green Paper to me so quickly.
You know the rule, ladies and gentlemen: we will apply the catch-the-eye system.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks on behalf of my Group!
That is a fantastic idea - promoting mobility while taking measures to avoid disasters and environmental pollution.
But you have stressed that you want to observe the principle of subsidiarity.
When we read through the paper, you make very practical proposals, on city tolls and other matters for instance.
How do you want to ensure that your good proposals and the debate we are all waiting for and which we will be having for a whole year do not lead to us telling cities and regions what to do, but only to an incentive actually to adopt best practice?
We are agreed that we have to do something for cities and establish best practice.
We are familiar with the accident statistics.
In many cities and towns there is a high accident rate, but not in others.
This is due to how matters are handled locally.
How then do you want to manage the development of collective ideas without the cities and regions getting the feeling they are being patronised by Europe?
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, we know that we are still at the beginning of an entire process and I therefore look forward to hearing the responses of stakeholders and the concrete actions that you are planning for next year.
I feel, however, that it is highly important that you place this on the political agenda in order to show that this is a priority for the Commission and for the European Union as a whole, in order both to bring about sustainable mobility and to achieve our agreements in relation to climate control.
I think that one of the most important things is to establish an instrument through which good examples that already exist in many cities can be exchanged in such a way that we can learn from them.
Each city is different and each problem is different, yet I believe that it all comes down to establishing an effective mechanism and I wonder what your view is on this.
How can we exchange all the good ideas that form the basis of associations in small and large cities so that we can learn from them?
(FR) Mr President, I am especially pleased, Commissioner, with the five objectives you have just defined, although as you mentioned afterwards, there will be concrete measures following the consultation, which ends in March.
If you will allow me, Commissioner, I would like to repeat what the members of our Urban Housing Intergroup have pointed out: namely the need to adopt an integrated approach, not only for cities, but also, as you said earlier, for the suburbs.
As part of this integrated approach, bearing in mind that the European Union invests regional funds - the ERDF, ESF and EAFRD, the latter involving both rural and suburban areas - it seems to us that you and your fellow Commissioners need to take these various aspects into account, so that the integrated approach can truly be implemented by cities and municipalities.
Therefore, today I once again call for the integrated approach to be taken into account in this issue of urban transport.
Mr Jarzembowski, these are proposals.
They are not complete.
In a box, at the end of each set of questions, we have asked what the role of the European Union should be.
Therefore, I am not going to predict what the outcome of the debate will be.
The question is open and in fact it must be demonstrated that there is real European added value.
We are not going to claim to exercise any sort of supervision over European towns and cities.
Mr El Khadraoui, I think you hit the nail on the head: we want to make this a political priority.
I think you voiced my own thoughts on the subject.
I would like elected officials, by supporting each other and through good practice and sharing the best experiences, to convince their compatriots somehow to engage in these bolder and more environmentally-friendly urban policies.
Mr Beaupuy rounded off what you said by pointing out that we can only truly succeed with an integrated approach, which effectively means that town planners also have to design towns and cities in a certain way, taking into account future mobility requirements, and specifically the construction of suburban areas: this should not be haphazard.
I would like to thank Mr Beaupuy in particular, as well as the urban mobility group, which I am sure will make a valuable contribution.
(PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to express my thanks for the interest in the subject of urban transport.
This is an extremely serious and difficult subject, especially as the EU is concerned with urban policy.
The very raising of the subject at European Commission level in relation to towns shows that we are dealing here with an unusually interesting interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity.
I am very much in favour of the Commission's actions in this sphere.
In supporting the Commission's actions in this sphere, I would like to ask the Commissioner, although perhaps this question is a bit premature, but nevertheless, how are we to understand the arrangement whereby the Commission will implement the principle of partnership in this matter, in other words, what are the possible instruments of partnership?
Are we talking about an exchange of experience?
Are we talking about a partner who also in some sense does more than just propose, but actually demands?
On the back of what Mr Jarzembowski has said, I would also like to ask for support for the Committee on Regional Development having reinforced cooperation with the Committee on Transport and Tourism in this matter.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for your speech and for the Green Paper, the details of which we are still not familiar with.
It is true that more and more people are living in cities and conurbations, but there are also, of course, specific problems associated with shrinking cities, which should not be completely disregarded.
My first question is: are they also in our field of vision?
We have capacity overload in the inner cities, primarily associated with individual private transport resulting in very high emissions, particulates, noise and also safety problems.
Secondly, if we now want to increase public transport, and networking it intelligently plays a crucial role in the solution, the question then arises, of course, whether we will be able to use capital from the Structural Funds for this purpose at all.
Thirdly, as regards the many individual proposals for freight transport logistics and so on: do we also have a forum for exchanging best practice models, in which this exchange can take place in an organised manner?
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the report.
You write here that you want to promote alternatives to the car, namely travel by bus, rail, cycling and walking.
However, you also know that 95% of EU cofinancing, which the cities are asking for, goes solely to road transport.
You are therefore considering whether you should say that at least 50% must in future go to these alternatives, because my home city of Berlin argues, for example, that EU funds should not be spent on local public transport.
I think that is mad!
If you do not change the funding, you will never be successful.
Therefore, how do you want to ensure that the EU's alternatives can be considered in future?
Mr Olbrycht, partnership can be expressed through sharing good practice and, at the request of the towns, through a set of guidelines concerning, for example, the use of a town's central infrastructure, or through more harmonised information: sometimes there are signs that show a motorway in one colour in one town or Member State, but in another colour in a different town or Member State.
We should think of ways of harmonising information.
Therefore, obviously I think that this partnership will fully take account of the intentions of the regions and that we will find synergies to generate resources.
Mr Stockmann, the Structural Funds are available for some pilot initiatives.
In my trans-European networks budget and the budget of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport in general, we have resources for monitoring pilot schemes, particularly through Civitas, which you are familiar with.
It is true that we also need to clarify further the use of the Structural Funds, which leads me on to say that Mr Cramer's comment is justified and that, in some cases, we need to be more careful about how the Structural Funds are used.
It is true that the European Union has not indicated a percentage for the use of the Funds: it is up to the towns, cities and regions to decide.
For this reason, therefore, I believe that through this Green Paper and through the debate, our task will be to convince the towns, cities and regions to make better use of the Funds.
I think the example you gave is a very interesting one.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I very much approve of some of the things you have mentioned.
You have highlighted the upgrading of public transport, greater road safety, and environmental aspects in driver training and satellite navigation.
All this is associated with certain problems - it costs a lot of money.
Mr Cramer has already demonstrated one form of concerted action.
I should like to put forward a second, which has not yet been mentioned.
We have the miracle cure in our hands.
We have the internalisation of external costs in front of us.
We hear that this method of calculation is ready and aspects of urban transport that cannot otherwise be paid for could be subsidised and paid for by comprehensive internalisation of external costs.
Two questions on this: when can we realistically expect the presentation of a preliminary model, which we can subsequently expand and enlarge?
Can you also envisage using this money for similar projects?
(FR) Mr President, personally I am just as keen as Mr Jarzembowski that local authorities should be free to govern and I do not think that we can impose any sort of transport policy on an independent local authority elected by universal suffrage. We would be misguided to do so.
That said, it seems to me that the Community added-value is indisputable, since we are trying to tackle the greenhouse effect.
What we are dealing with is the production of pollutants, particularly at regional level, by transport, which we know is the main source of pollutants and greenhouse gases.
Therefore, I do not think it is excessive for the European Union to become involved, including for conservation reasons.
On the other hand, I do believe that there cannot be any coercive policy.
There could be an incentive policy, Commissioner. I sometimes like to think that this would be hugely successful if there were, for example, a Community URBAN programme for transport; in other words, a programme that encourages local authorities to engage in sustainable mobility based on a set of sustainable mobility guidelines.
I do not know whether you can envisage this.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner for his political courage in dealing with this issue and suggesting that subsidiarity is an opportunity.
In the Committee on Petitions we are constantly seeing petitions from citizens at local level who are asking for the help and protection of the European Union, precisely to resolve problems that can no longer be resolved locally, because they are matters to be resolved globally, such as environmental and security issues, etc.
I would like to ask the Commissioner if in intelligent systems the subject of information to citizens is taken into account, as it could enormously reduce stress about disinformation.
Also, whether the problems of road safety on the daily commute to work will be taken into account, as this is one of the areas in which we are having the most problems.
Also, what would be the ideas regarding this rationalisation of the distribution of goods, which often causes these congestion problems.
(RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the development of the European Union is based upon mobility and free movement of persons and goods.
80% of European citizens live in towns and 40% live in cities.
60% of them believe that there is, in fact, congestion and pollution at an urban level and over 70% of them are waiting for a European action.
I believe that the Green Paper on public transport will also solve, has to solve, the issue of the 40% of the citizens who do not own a car and live in towns and, especially, the integration of disabled people into economic and social life.
Urban planning is extremely important and I also request the use of certain funds - structural funds, JESSICA, regional funds - for urban transport development.
I support the use of the project and the expansion of the CIVITAS project and CIVITAS+ and, especially, the encouraging and supporting of new Member States in order to benefit from these funds for urban transport development.
(FR) Commissioner, you are embarking on an ambitious project that concerns us all.
I truly hope that, in this transport debate, we do not forget the important role that transport has for territorial cohesion.
You talked about access to towns and cities by urban transport.
I sincerely hope that in this great debate, we remember to talk about rural areas and, as you said, incentives for local authorities in terms of rural transport, which is often overlooked.
Mr President, I would first of all like to thank those MEPs who have voiced their initial reactions. It has been extremely interesting to hear what they have to say.
Mr Leichtfried, we do in fact have the problem of the regional disc scheme, or 'Eurovignette', which is being examined as part of a study planned for 2008 in connection with the Eurovignette Directive.
The date is set in the Directive and the work is already under way.
I think we need to consider urban charging, as well as how the revenue generated is used.
I think that this is a very important issue, because it might, if we had a legal framework, help mayors to be able to use this tool in some cases, while monitoring the allocation of the resources generated.
To a certain extent, the final question in our questionnaire provides an answer to what Mr Savary said.
I quote: 'In the longer term, what added value might derive from targeted European support for the financing of clean and energy-efficient urban transport?'
The question almost echoes what Mr Savary asked; namely whether there could eventually be a Community programme.
It is too early to say, but it is crucial that we raise the question.
I would like to thank Mr Savary for saying that there is a certain amount of Community added value in such an important policy for the future.
Mrs Ayala Sender, public information is of course a major factor in intelligent mobility and we know that, in this respect, satellite navigation, combined with progress in new information and communications technologies, must ensure that a bus stop, say, can also be a passenger information point.
There is plenty to do here and it is essential that the most effective technology is made available to towns and cities.
You also mentioned rationalising the distribution of goods in town and city centres: there is a huge amount to be done there also.
Mrs Å¢icÄu, thank you for raising the problem of access for the disabled and for people with reduced mobility in general.
I think that this is another major aspect of this issue.
We must give 'European citizenship' content, and I can see only advantages in having a real charter on rights and obligations for passengers that would also be beneficial to these citizens.
Mrs Douay was right to remind us that, of course, mobility must be considered as a whole.
There are people who live in towns and cities, there are people who go to towns and cities to work, and there too there has to be a more integrated approach.
However, I will finish by saying both to you, Mrs Douay, and to all MEPs: we have made quite a rough sketch, if you like, because we did not want to confine answers at this stage within certain restricted rules.
The questions are deliberately open.
That said, I am also weighing up all the effort needed to achieve a coherent and efficient action plan, otherwise there will be no European added value.
Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and I sincerely look forward to continuing this exciting debate on urban mobility over the coming months.
Commission Question Time
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am happy to contribute by answering on the issue of the specificity of sport.
It would be very timely to discuss this even in more depth - not now, but later on - because on 11 July this year the Commission adopted a White Paper on sport.
This was a very important contribution, which stressed the importance of promoting the training of young, talented sportsmen and sportswomen in proper conditions, which is crucial for the sustainable development of sport at all levels.
This was an institutional and very political contribution to the question and to cooperation on this matter.
I quote from the paper: 'Rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally trained players could be accepted as being compatible with the Treaty provisions on free movement of persons if they do not lead to any direct discrimination based on nationality and if possible indirect discrimination effects resulting from them can be justified as being proportionate to a legitimate objective pursued, such as to enhance and protect the training and development of talented young players.'
I think this is a very important clarification of how to understand this issue.
The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the compatibility of UEFA's measures on home-grown players with Community law, with a view to striking the right balance between the need to comply, on the one side, with Community law and the autonomy of sports organisations, and with the interests of European football on the other.
This is done in the light of the declaration annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, the so-called Nice Declaration of the European Council in 2000, and the White Paper on Sport, which specifically mentions, as action number 9 in the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan, 'to complete the analysis of rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally training players'.
This comprehensive comparative information on football academies in Member States and on home-grown players is not available at present.
In 2006, the Commission launched a study on sport academies in Member States, including the issue of home-grown players.
The results of this study are expected to provide valuable input for its analysis.
Concerning the second part of the question - because it consists of two sentences on the specificity of sport - Chapter 4 of this White Paper develops the concept of specificity of sport within the limits of existing EU competences.
As described in more detail in our Staff Working Document in the annexes, decisions taken by the European Court of Justice and the Commission show that the specificity of sport has been recognised and taken into account in the past.
The Commission shares the view that certain values and traditions of European sport should be promoted and will continue to recognise the specificities of this sector, while respecting EU law.
However, a case-by-case approach remains the basis for the Commission's control of the application of EU law, and in particular competition and internal market rules.
This is in line with the current Treaty provisions.
In order to provide legal clarity for all stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement of governance in European sport, the above-mentioned Staff Working Document and its two annexes explain in depth this issue of specificity.
It concerns sport and EU competition rules and sport and internal market freedoms, and takes stock for the first time of European Court of Justice case-law and Commission decisions in the area of sport.
I want to underline that, for the first time, the specificity of sport is set out in our policy document much more than it has been at any time in the recent past in the EU context.
That is one of the most important contributions - not only to this answer, but also to the promotion of sport in the European Union.
UEFA's rules requiring clubs to have a certain proportion of players that are locally trained and home grown is designed to make sure that clubs do not rely only on their financial muscle in the transfer market, but have to invest locally in their communities in training.
It is a vital scheme.
Yet the Commission, on this point in its White Paper, has not come off the fence in saying that it is a scheme that is acceptable under the Treaty and now, Commissioner, you say it could be, if... - and you are still investigating.
May I ask the Commission, why is it taking so long?
When will the Commission be in a position to endorse this welcome scheme?
Member of the Commission. - I would love to give more of an answer, but there is already a kind of step forward if we recall our debates a year ago, or at least from the perspective of Parliament.
I think that the answer I quoted, which is part of the communication, of this policy paper, is an important assurance that we want to support the specificity of sport, particularly of football, in terms of the protection and promotion of young people and the training of, and investment in, young people.
The study has not been completed, because we do not have all the data we would like to have.
I hope that with the complementary questionnaire we are now working on we will get the remaining figures.
It is very important that partners from Member States' associations, federations, clubs and leagues, work with us.
Hopefully in a foreseeable time - I would like it to be early next year - we will be able to give a definitive answer.
In two weeks' time we will meet with all stakeholders from the world of sport in Brussels to debate the content and implementation of the White Paper.
I believe that this part will be very crucial for concrete action and the promotion of the values of sport.
On behalf of the Commission, I can tell you that we remain committed to these issues, and all the sensitivities must be dealt with duly.
Before we take any decision - not only in this area, which is quite specific - we have to carry out a thorough analysis and then take real decisions.
(DE) Commissioner, without wanting to offend the Commission or the Court of Justice, I have the feeling that neither our judges nor our Commissioners, or the female members of the Commission, are seen very often at a football ground.
If they were there more often, they would notice that we are currently at the start of the European Cup season, in which we have teams playing against each other in which often just one member at any one time is a member of the national squad.
We have therefore witnessed the nurturing of new blood being totally neglected and we attribute an exclusively economic dimension to it all.
Football is more than an internal market, and football is not merely competition in the legal sense.
Football is a sports competition between national, regional and local teams.
Something needs to happen here, and fast.
Can the Commission promise that something really is happening apart from studies being undertaken?
Member of the Commission. - I am sure that something really will be done.
I use football as a great example, because in a way Europe is the best in the world in football.
I think we can be the best in many other areas like, for example, higher education, which is usually not seen as the best of Europe.
No, what Europe needs is not only to refer to its successes or to refer to the importance of football or sport for its historical developments and current achievements, but also for the future.
A balanced approach to sport activities is one of the answers, which means it is not about money in the first place, but about the rules and values that govern the world and money to support healthy investment.
I know about the imbalances, the problems and doubts about the credibility of competitions and about corruption, and too much money deciding who is really a strong partner or strong competitor.
Since 1999, with the Helsinki Report - you remember, maybe, even better - and then the Nice Declaration, there has been, I think, a new momentum.
The Commission had never come forward with a policy paper.
If we come forward, not just with a paper in hand, but to offer actions - and there are 53 actions offered under the name of the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan - then we can do a lot.
If we stay credible in implementation, I think we can prepare also the first Treaty article on sport, because we do not have a legal base now, and that is why we cannot define some of the actions, and that is why we have to decide case by case, on individual problems.
There are many collateral issues in this answer, so more credibility means cooperation of EU institutions, national legislators, but also governing bodies in areas of sport.
They set the rules, they govern and they have to be also credible in governing individual disciplines or games or competitions.
I would say a sports forum, which we will organise under the Portuguese Presidency, could be one of the answers for permanent or regular transparent and credible dialogue on all problems and possible solutions, whether on a small scale, in Europe or in broader international cooperation.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, in his letter Michel Platini, President of UEFA, asks the leaders of the 27 EU Member States to intervene by dealing with the rising wealth of football clubs, which are spending ever more on players and other purchases, thus turning football into a business rather that a sport with values.
However, in his statements before this letter, the President of UEFA asked politicians not to interfere in football.
He said that the EU and the European Parliament should confine themselves to their political roles and stay away from sport.
Do you agree with these views held by the President of UEFA, and to what extent?
Will the White Paper on sport be a good opportunity to clarify these outstanding matters?
Would the Commissioner agree that our record in controlling the import of timber from illegal sources is lamentable - simply dreadful?
Given this experience and the potential for corruption and falsification of documents that exists, how can we have confidence that any certification of biofuel crops will be valid?
Might we not end up making a bad problem worse?
Member of the Commission. - First of all, I cannot confirm that there is a lot of illegal timber being brought into the European Union, but what I can clearly say is that, so far, there has been a very limited amount of biofuels coming into the European Union.
We have not had any effect whatsoever in terms of negative consequences for rain forests.
The certification schemes that are proposed will be implemented.
I have no doubts whatsoever about that, because the general performance by customs within the European Union has been very positive.
(DE) Commissioner, what has just been mentioned is a problem.
A second problem apparently is that due to the increased use of biofuels, prices of staple foods are beginning to increase, particularly in countries where this really can become a problem and many people, particularly in these countries, are no longer able to afford their staple foods.
Are you aware of this problem?
If so, what are your thoughts on it and what is being done about it?
Member of the Commission. - (DE) The main reason for the current price increases for food is rising demand, particularly in China, India and also in other states.
That is the main reason for the price increases.
My colleague, who will take the floor after me, will explain what measures we need to take.
It is clear that we have to produce more because demand also has to be covered.
As far as biofuels are concerned, their influence on food prices is very marginal at present because consumption of biofuels globally is still low.
We do, of course, have to take account of this because a great deal of maize is currently being produced for biofuels in the United States.
This can influence a certain sector, but there are ways to continue to meet rising demand.
I am of the view that we in the Commission have to find an answer to world market prices.
My colleague has already prepared some proposals on this.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, there is a view that growing biofuels and trading in them may absorb the surplus production of developing countries via conversion to biofuels for their own use or for export.
Does the Commission believe that the biofuels sector could unlock the Doha Round of the World Trade Organisation negotiations?
Member of the Commission. - It is a normal Nordic approach: rather short but straight to the point.
I can clearly say that the next two months will be crucial for the Doha Development Round.
Negotiations have now re-started on the basis of the proposals that were submitted in July by the chairs of the respective negotiating groups on agriculture and on industrial products.
The chairs, in producing their negotiation proposal, have done an honest job.
I think we can say that they have distributed the pain fairly.
They put pressure on each of the key players on each issue of the so-called negotiation triangle - AMA, NAMA and domestic subsidies - which is most sensitive for the different players.
It is obvious as well that the text of the chairs is not cast in stone.
The WTO membership had a chance to offer preliminary reactions to these texts before the summer break.
But now negotiations really have to get down to specifics.
A further round of discussions on modalities kicked off at the very beginning of September, taking place in Geneva.
The objective of the WTO Director-General, Pascal Lamy, and the chairs is to be in a position to issue a revised paper some time in October to serve as an ultimate basis for a final deal on modalities, to take place no later than this autumn.
Whether this will be the case, whether there will be a final paper, depends entirely on the negotiating engagement of the different players.
The United States should now translate President Bush's political commitment at the APEC Summit into concrete negotiating moves to try to clinch a deal.
It is imperative for the United States to be seen to engage and to move on agricultural subsidies, not least in respect of its objective to ensure access to the developing countries' agricultural markets.
Brazil, India and, by the same token, other emerging economies have to move in the right direction and deliver their side of the bargain, and that means cutting, to some extent, their actual tariffs on industrial products.
The reality of these talks is that the distance to the finishing line - if we talk in economic terms - is fairly short at this stage, certainly very short compared to the road that we have been travelling until now.
The value of remaining concessions that both developed and some developing countries need to bring into the final package is small compared to the systemic gain of doing the deal, especially as global economic conditions are becoming more and more uncertain.
But the clock is ticking.
If there is no agreement on modalities in the autumn, an early conclusion of the DDA becomes very unlikely.
The United States presidential campaign will pick up speed and the round might then be put into the deep freeze for years.
For the round to succeed now, all parties need to show flexibility and willingness to reach a compromise.
The European Union will continue to reach out to the various constituencies of the WTO membership and their key members to ensure their constructive engagement.
I want to thank the Commissioner for her response.
I would have liked it if Commissioner Mandelson was here as well, because I know he had a meeting in America last week, where he was disappointed with the response.
But, very briefly, you spoke about the developing countries and you mentioned, as part of that, Brazil and India.
From an industrial point of view and from an export point of view, they cannot be classed as developing countries.
Yet at the same time, from a cultural point of view, they are classed as developing countries with regard to the benefits that they will get.
Should Europe give more in the agricultural field, in particular when you see that the US Farm Bill, which has now come into being, is taking more subsidies out of the package that was originally negotiated, and Europe seems to be giving all of the leeway, whereas America is not taking any of the pain?
Is that a correct way to continue?
And, finally, if autumn is the deadline, the end of October is autumn.
Winter starts on 1 November.
So do you see a time frame there for that to be successful?
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
You said that it is very important that the US make an offer.
It has been strongly suggested in recent days that the US has in fact made a very significant and very interesting offer on domestic market supports.
I would just like to ask you if this is so, and, if it is, could you give us any information?
My second question is: would you not agree that, certainly up to now, we seem to be the ones that are making the concessions?
Can you confirm that Commissioner Mandelson has offered 70% cuts in support to EU farmers, and, if this is so, do you support this position?
Would you not agree that such cuts would devastate European agriculture and, in particular, the beef sector?
Member of the Commission. - First of all, when we looked at the negotiating papers from the two chairs, Mr Falconer, who is responsible for the agricultural sector, put a paper with some gaps between the figures.
And when we look at domestic support, which is the most difficult issue for the Americans, it is obvious that they have now signalled that they will be able to operate within the gap or within the two figures mentioned in the Falconer paper.
The negotiations, or discussions, are ongoing, so it will be extremely difficult to say where the final game will end up.
But I have to say, the difficult issue for the European Union is, as far as the agricultural sector is concerned, of course the tariffs.
But even more important than the tariffs is the way that we treat our sensitive products.
This is simply key and more important, actually, than the reduction of the tariffs in the different bands which we are operating.
So I can only encourage you to keep a close eye on the way to treat sensitive products as this will be key in the final game.
(DE) I do understand that we have to deal with these negotiations on quota prices etc., but what I do not see here is the negotiation or dissemination of what Europe represents, the dissemination of our way of life.
Madam Commissioner, the question for me is whether you are entering into these negotiations and saying: we do not want any products that have been made by children!
We do not want any products that have been made by forced or slave labour!
We do not want any products that have not been produced in compliance with core labour standards!
Is this the issue and are you making an issue out of it?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is still of the opinion that there is a window of opportunity for a positive outcome of the Doha negotiations in the very close future, as I mentioned in my previous answer.
I can only say again that, unless a breakthrough is achieved before the end of the year, I find it very difficult to see a possibility of finalising the negotiations, because of the upcoming presidential elections in the United States.
However, current offers made by some of our negotiating partners are still falling short of what could be required to obtain a balanced outcome to the negotiations.
Regarding the scope of a final EU offer, the ongoing common agricultural policy reform constitutes clearly the limits of the Commission's negotiating mandate, and this means that we cannot accept a deal that means that we have to reform our common agricultural policy again.
It is clearly in accordance with the mandate given by the Council, and the negotiation limits that we have will also be, of course, the equivalent concessions from our WTO partners in agriculture and elsewhere, resulting in improving market opportunities for our exporters.
It is important that when we talk about the reduction of tariffs we sometimes fear that our agricultural sector will come under immense pressure from imported commodities.
We have to remember that the coin has two sides, which means that a reduction of tariffs will also take place on the new emerging markets that could be - and I am sure this will happen - of huge interest for European producers to enter into, such as, for example China, and India.
So we are still striving towards a positive outcome of the Doha Round.
It is obvious that a multilateral solution is to be preferred, whereas a bilateral one could be supplementary to the multilateral discussions.
We are doing our very best at this stage, but it is crucial, if we find a solution, for it to be a balanced solution - within the three pillars of agriculture but also between agriculture, industrial products and services.
(EL) Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
I have the feeling that you are speaking more as a Commissioner for International Trade and less as the Commissioner for Agriculture.
Does Mr Mandelson, the Commissioner responsible for International Trade, also share your view that the review of the CAP will not do any damage?
Does he share the view that accepting the modalities of July 2007, which go beyond the offer made by the EU in October 2005, does not exceed the negotiating mandate given by the Council of Ministers of 2005?
If so, before you make any commitment to our trade partners, you need not ask for a new mandate from the Council.
Member of the Commission. - When the CAP reform was agreed among the Ministers in the Council in 2003, it was the mandate that was given to the trade and agricultural commissioners.
Within this mandate we could negotiate.
What we are now presenting - or what we will be presenting on 20 November - is the health check of the agricultural policy, and this is not a new reform.
It is not a new reform and therefore it is not my perception that, whether or not we get a Doha deal, it will have influence on what we are suggesting as the health check of the common agricultural policy.
So it will not be influencing or moving the mandate that we have already got.
(DE) Madam Commissioner, genetic engineering in farmed foods makes many people in Europe uneasy, anxious and afraid.
Is this subject again playing, or will it continue to play, a greater role in the Doha Round?
Member of the Commission. - It is obvious that what we have experienced throughout the last few months in terms of the price increases in Europe, especially as reported in the newspapers in Germany throughout the summer break, has of course raised many questions.
These are quite new questions on agricultural policy in Europe, where we were previously fighting against overproduction, intervention stocks, and we are now in a much more balanced market, thanks, I think, to the decoupling of the direct payment to farmers, which allows farmers to react to the market instead of calculating the best outcome on the cheque from Brussels.
It is clear that in the Doha Round the prÃ©fÃ©rence communautaire or the security of food supply is not in itself an issue.
It is, of course, crucial to everybody round the world to be sure that they can feed their own people, but it is not exclusively a chapter in our negotiations.
In addition to expressing unease about yet further concessions damaging to our agricultural interests, can I ask you what focus there has been in the negotiations on raising beef production standards amongst those who seek greater access to our market, so that we might end the prejudicial impact on our own producers of permitting food imports where traceability and quality fall far below the standards that we expect of our own producers?
Member of the Commission. - I think I have heard this before.
I might be wrong, but it reminds me of some question raised by the Irish Minister and some Irish MEPs on the import from Brazil, traceability, and the opinion of the Irish farmers on lack of traceability.
It is obvious that we are following this case closely, and I know that my colleague, Commissioner Kyprianou, will be meeting the committee in Parliament.
We want to ensure fair trade, which means that importers or exporters into the European Union have to meet the same quality standards as our own producers.
I will be visiting Brazil next month to see if they can show me what I want to see: that is, how things work in Brazil concerning the possibility of tracing back the products that are taken into the European Union.
Question No 36 is inadmissible as its author is no longer a Member.
Subject: Amendment of the CMO in wine
On 4 July 2007 the Commission unveiled a proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine.
Funds for the 'national envelopes' are allocated according to a key which is based to 50% on the historical input of Member States, 25% on area and 25% on production.
Moreover, adjustments have been made in favour of certain Member States.
Will the Commission say which criteria were used in the selection of the specific allocation key and why the funds are not allocated on the basis of the historical payments of Member States over a representative reference period, as occurred in the case of all those CMOs which have so far been amended?
Furthermore, given that the overall amount of resources is limited, how was it decided to adjust input for the benefit of some Member States, which necessarily results in a corresponding decrease for the others?
Member of the Commission. - In order to propose a fair share between Member States of the overall amount that will be allocated to the national envelope, and of the amount transferred into our rural development policy, we have actually been using three different criteria: areas under wine on the basis of all the available historical data that we have; secondly, the production in terms of volume on the basis of historical averages; and, thirdly, expenditure, on the basis of an historical average, except for Bulgaria and Romania where the budgetary requirements calculated within the framework of adhesion were used, as those were the only reliable figures that we could use.
The weighting between these three different areas is 25% on area, 25% on production and 50% on the budget for the envelopes and the transfer into the rural development policy.
50% for area and 50% for production for that part of the envelope which is specifically related to promotion in third countries, which I consider to be a new and very important forward-looking policy for the wine sector.
When we had this discussion on the redistribution between Member States' envelopes, we made a positive correction for three Member States so as to limit their reduction in view of the important divergence for these Member States between their share in historical expenditure and their share in the two other criteria.
This correction was not made to the detriment of the amounts allocated to other Member States, meaning that we did not cut other amounts to find money for these three Member States, so we simply increased the total budget.
This makes it possible to share Community support equitably by taking into account, on the one hand, the respective reductive capacity of each Member State and, on the other hand, effective implementation of the new measures proposed within the framework of the reform.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when the Commission believes that it is necessary within the framework of the law to make structural changes for some Member States, is it examining the possibility of reacting in a similar way to help Greek wine-growers recently hit by the catastrophic fires?
Their income for the coming years will be significantly reduced.
Huge areas covering thousands of hectares of vineyards have been burned; this means that the vine-growers have suffered loss and that their plants have been damaged.
In view of this, does the Commission intend to demonstrate solidarity and to help these people?
Member of the Commission. - First of all, I think that everybody who watched the devastating forest fires in Greece on the television wondered what would happen afterwards with the damaged areas.
I have had the possibility to discuss it with Greek Members of Parliament, with the Minister, with the Ministry, with the Minister for Economics from Greece as well, while travelling round to find solutions.
And there are different solutions, and that will be for my next question.
I can only say we cannot solve the problems of the forest fire within the CMO for wine.
That is excluded.
And I can tell you, if we re-open the distribution of money between the envelopes and Member States, it will be like opening Pandora's box, and I have no more money available than the present budget of approximately EUR 1.3 billion every year for the wine sector.
We have to find solutions to the consequences of the fires within rural development policy, within the regional funding, and I am quite sure that decent solutions will be found.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: Payment of CAP support for areas hit by fires
The recent fires in Greece had a disastrous impact on farming, particularly in the olive oil, fruit and vegetable and wine sectors, with serious consequences for the environment and the development of these regions, posing a major threat to the continuation of farming activity.
How must the application of cross-compliance be redefined so as to ensure the legitimate payment of uniform decoupled aid to farmers affected?
How will the implementation of the new COM for wine be ensured in areas hit by fires, in particular as regards the Commission's proposals for granting direct aid to wine-growers who use practices that respect the environment?
What additional provisions and clarifications are required in the new regime for raisins so that immediate crisis-management measures can be implemented?
Is it possible to increase the resources for operational funds in order to finance such measures in the event of emergencies?
Is it feasible to create a specific national programme to support farmers with funding from the COMs for fruit and vegetables and for wine?
Subject: Funding of non-governmental organisations and bodies for immediate reafforestation in Greece
Greece recently suffered the greatest environmental disaster in its history.
However, many Greek environmental bodies and monasteries located on burned land possess the know-how and the scientists necessary to organise the rapid reafforestation of these areas by extensive planting operations.
How can the Commission provide funding directly to non-governmental organisations, monasteries, environmental bodies etc. (i.e. outside the framework of the third CSF) so that they can immediately restore the environment in Greece's forests which have been destroyed by fire?
Which Community initiatives could be used for this purpose?
Member of the Commission. - First of all, I can again only express my sympathy with all the people that have been hit by the consequences of the fires.
I think it is important to say that the single farm payment - the direct payment to the farmers - is not at risk.
The possible destruction of the crops, of animals or of buildings, has no consequence on the decoupled payment since there is no obligation to produce.
As regards cross compliance, one important rule is that the reduction of direct CAP payments under cross compliance can only be decided as a result of actions or omissions directly attributed to the farmer.
Therefore, forest fires like the ones we saw in Greece this summer would not result in the reduction of payments.
As far as wine is concerned, in the event of partial destruction, vineyards could be eligible within the restructuring scheme, under the current Regulation, and within the national envelopes that will be foreseen for the new CMO.
The reformed CMO for fruit and vegetables foresees new crisis prevention and management tools.
However, this new regulation will only be in place from 2008, and there is no retroactive clause.
As for the last question, the financial rules do not allow the Commission to transfer possible savings from the market organisation budget to specific national programmes to support Greek farmers.
Concerning the specific question on non-governmental organisations, monasteries or environmental bodies, the Commission does not have the possibility to directly support these for the purpose of environmental restoration activities.
European Union assistance is only possible through specifically designed programmes and interventions which are drawn up by Member States following the principle of subsidiarity and submitted to the Commission for co-financing.
I want just to mention some specific possibilities in our rural development policy which could be used to help as well.
I referred to these in my previous reply.
The first option concerns the programme 2000-2006, and can involve modification of the programme complements of national operational programmes and the regional operational programmes in order to reconstruct agricultural potential after national disaster measures.
This can, for example, mean that a farmer can get money for buying cattle, fruit and olive trees or to restore buildings that have been destroyed.
However, I have to repeat very strongly that it is not possible, via rural development policy, to compensate farmers for lost income.
The second option is the new rural development programme 2007-2013, which includes measures for restoring agricultural production potential, as well as forestry potential, following natural disasters.
It must be noted that interventions through these two options would be limited to reforestation and reconstruction of production potential, and again cannot be used to compensate for loss of income.
I want to conclude with the possibilities that will be available within state aid schemes.
A disaster like the forest fires in Greece would normally be considered exceptional occurrences, which actually allows Member States to grant support to compensate for material damage.
Nationally funded assistance to agriculture and forestry may be given following notification of a state aid scheme, and is subsequent to approval by the Commission.
I would also remind you that there is a much easier possibility, which is to use what we call de minimis state aid, which means that Member States can pay farmers, with the new changes that have taken place, EUR 6 000 - and you can do that every three years.
So, without asking anyone, you can actually pay direct to the farmer up to EUR 6 000 to help immediately, if necessary.
deputising for the author. - (EL) Commissioner, I would like to ask if you have received a specific draft plan for the reconstruction of the regions affected by fire.
What will the procedure be for approving such a plan?
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is good to be here again.
I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question concerning the funding for research.
Her question refers clearly in the first instance to research funded by the European Union and in my answer I shall deal with these aspects.
However, the need for increased investment in research at national as well as European level, private even more than public, is central to achieving the Lisbon goals.
At the same time we have to make sure that this money is well spent to ensure the maximum effect.
The question is essentially in four parts and I shall reply to each of them in turn.
At the same time, we must bear in mind that it is still very early to draw definitive conclusions and lessons from the sixth and seventh framework programmes.
But before turning to the four aspects of the honourable Member's question, I should like to recall that European Union cohesion policy, especially the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, also makes an important contribution to the development of the European research area.
The Commission estimates that cohesion policy support for research and innovation will more than triple in the programming period 2007-2013 compared to 2000-2006.
Turning to the first element of the question, what are the sectors of research that the Commission considers to be lagging behind in funding provisions under the plans 2007-2013?
The Commission believes that it has a good balance between the more top-down thematic areas in the programme and other, more bottom-up activities in framework programmes, such as frontier research and fellowships.
It would not be appropriate to single out specific areas in particular need of funding.
The closer you look at our 10 thematic priorities, the clearer it is that we need more funding and more research in practically all of them.
But, to give you an example, I could mention the research infrastructures of pan-European interest, for which the final budget in Framework Programme 7 is much less than the Commission had originally proposed.
This is an important area where we have real added value in Europe.
We are seeking to combine funding from many sources, especially from national and regional sources and the European Investment Bank.
It is also evident, following the first call for proposals of the European Research Council, that we are faced with serious oversubscription.
We have received many more excellent proposals for fundamental frontier research than we have money to fund.
Looking at thematically orientated research, we can clearly see the need to better support research areas such as energy and climate change.
Here, Member States can help not only by increasing investment in research but also by exploring ways of combining research efforts rather than allowing them to remain fragmented.
This is also one of the areas which we advocated in our Green Paper on the European Research Area.
Turning to the general criteria, the thematic priorities for funding are set out in the Cooperation Specific Programme.
These research areas are the ones which will be supported through calls for proposals during the 2007-2013 period.
Our proposal was made after an extensive consultation with stakeholders during 2004, including a web-based consultation on the cooperation themes as well as input from industrial stakeholders through the European Technology Platforms.
It was also based on an extensive ex-ante impact assessment.
Results from ex-post evaluation and monitoring exercises also form an important element in determining the priorities for research funding.
This learning from past experience was indeed a key element in defining the priorities in the Framework Programme, as you suggest in the third part of your question to which now I turn.
You asked how assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of the research that was funded under the sixth framework programme influenced the selection of new research projects.
Here we have to distinguish two different ways of making that link.
First, at the more detailed, operational level, we should note that the several thousand FP6 projects are monitored by the Commission services.
These colleagues are in frequent contact with the research community and their up-to-date insight into the progress achieved within this project is an important element in preparing the Framework Programme 7 work programmes.
But, in the second place, at a more global level, in 2008 the Commission will organise the ex-post evaluation of FP6.
This assessment of the overall impact of the different research activities will be carried out by high-level experts.
The results of this FP6 ex-post evaluation will be a major input in the forthcoming mid-term review of FP7 in the year 2010.
Finally, turning to the last part of the question, when considering the priorities for funding in each research sector, the topics to be funded are specified in the annual work programmes and the call for proposals.
Each year, we undertake consultation with the right variety of stakeholders in drawing up the work programmes.
We also call on the assistance of external advisory groups, key specialists in the area, who provide input on ensuring that the work programmes contain the most essential areas of research, taking into account ongoing projects that have been funded in previous calls for proposals.
Once the individual proposals have been received in response to the calls, they are evaluated by expert peer reviews using a standard set of evaluation criteria.
The proposals funded are those which receive the highest overall mark for the call or part of the call they address.
In conclusion, I believe that it is fair to say that for research funded through Community instruments we have a transparent system which allocates funding to the most relevant areas and also ensures it is then awarded to the best proposals.
(EL) Thank you for your rather informative reply.
I should like to ask whether international progress in research is taken into consideration when decisions are made on various actions, seeing that we live in a globalised world.
To what extent do young people in Europe receive special funding for participation in research?
Member of the Commission. - Of course there is no other way than to look at the global context.
If you look in practice at what other major communities around the world are focusing their research on, then it is the same as ours.
More than that, we do combine our efforts in many areas.
One of the things we really strengthened in the seventh Framework Programme was precisely international cooperation.
We are funding and supporting that, and will do so more in the future, because we believe that in the world of globalisation the challenges which lie ahead of us - be it food, health, drinking water, climate change, security or energy - are global and it is for us all to deal with them in the proper way.
Commissioner, you mentioned among the top priorities the thematic subjects energy and climate change.
That is a correct priority, and the European Union needs a breakthrough.
How does the Commission intend to organise cooperation between the best brains in the EU to work on this subject, and maybe - even more so - to promote cooperation between the best brains in the world?
Because this question is a crucial one.
Member of the Commission. - Yes, we are truly focusing on that.
It was basically that philosophy - it is shared in the existing framework programme - but the truth is that we are now also focusing on the preparation of a strategic technology plan for Europe.
It should be adopted by the Commission by the end of the year.
In that, we are of course consulting practically everybody in this area in Europe.
So we have consulted all the technology platforms which already exist.
We have had very open talks with them.
They are, from bottom up, practically all included in our activities and we are trying to find a proper way of having this coordinated.
You properly said that it is also vital that we share in the best possible way, in an international way, on how to address these questions.
But in that respect, there are two things: when you also try to address it from the private sector, you have to do it in a balanced way, before or between the cooperation and competitiveness, and that is exactly what we try to take into account.
(DE) Commissioner, the Council has reduced research funding for 2008.
How are you preparing for the health check, the mid-term review of the Financial Perspective?
Do you believe that we can submit new initiatives and proposals here that also reflect the importance of research in the European budget?
Member of the Commission. - I think it is more the principal question of how far this mid-term review should go.
I think that is the question we have to answer.
If the answer is that we have to address, because of the urgency, some of the issues that are inside the already agreed financial period, then I am sure that area of science and research would be one of the candidates that needed to be addressed.
Subject: ITER project
ITER is an ambitious project that undoubtedly smacks of scientific serendipity: we can find things without knowing how to look for them.
There are also many non-EU countries involved.
Have the partners to date handled their commitments, economic or otherwise, in the proper manner?
Member of the Commission. - The ITER project, as the honourable Member knows, is a project which is an international flagship of the world fusion energy research programme.
Since its inception during summit discussions in the late 1980s, Europe has played a leading role in the successive preparatory stages for the project.
The Commission can be justly proud of the confidence shown by the ITER partners in according Europe the central role of the host party to the joint implementation of this project.
The JET facilities, designed and built through the joint action of Euratom and its members, provided an outstanding example of what can be achieved when leading fusion research organisations pool their expertise and resources.
The ITER project extends this principle from the European to the global level of cooperation.
ITER technical objectives and design are based on the steady and scientifically rigorous prospect process of development, in fusion research worldwide which has witnessed dramatic increases in the performance of experimental fusion facilities over recent decades in an atmosphere of international scientific cooperation that has transcended political barriers.
Beyond JET, ITER extends the experimental side to the level where the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy can be demonstrated.
Since the signature of the ITER Agreement in November 2006, the ITER partners have all handled properly the commitments that they accepted through the ITER negotiations.
At the political level, all the partners have pursued to completion their respective constitutional requirements for ratification or acceptance of the agreement, which is now accepted to enter officially into force within October this year.
In the mean time, the partners have properly honoured their undertakings to abide by the terms of the agreement to the fullest extent possible until it enters into force.
The staff of the international ITER team and the ITER site in Cadarache in France is building up with representatives of all partners now present.
The partners are providing their financial contributions to the budget of the ITER organisation and are pursuing conscientiously the necessary joint technical preparations for the technical and scientific contributions to which they have committed themselves.
In the European Union, a joint undertaking for ITER and the development of fusion energy was established by the Council Decision of 27 March 2007.
Its role is to prepare and coordinate activities for the construction of the demonstration fusion reactor and related facilities.
To date, its supervisory body, the governing board, has met twice and adopted a first work programme and the administrative decisions necessary for the joint undertaking to be operational early 2008.
In particular, the headquarters agreement with Spain has been signed.
The governing board also appointed the director, the chief executive officer of the joint undertaking.
ITER is indeed an ambitious project.
In bringing it to fruition we shall be pushing back the boundaries of our experience in the scientific, technological and organisational domains.
It is the nature of experiments that the results cannot be forecast with certainty.
But ITER is not an enterprise that we have entered into lightly or in the expectation of serendipity.
ITER consists of long-term international partnerships and commitments, bringing together partners that represent over half of the world's population to address issues central to our common future, the development of sustainable, non-polluting sources of energy at the service of humanity.
The prospects for ITER rest on the strong scientific and technological foundations of the project and on the enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated to date by its partners - by all of them; or rather, by all of us.
There was never such cooperation in the world as we have gathered in ITER.
(FI) Commissioner, our experience of one particular cooperation project, Galileo, is bad.
The European Union had to finance it, contrary to the original plans, while not all parties shared in its financing as planned.
Is the Commissioner's answer to be interpreted as meaning that we may not have any problems with ITER as regards fulfilling the commitments made, i.e. we will not have the same problem with ITER as we did with Galileo, where the parties concerned neglected the responsibilities they had committed themselves to?
Member of the Commission. - First of all, I would like to thank you for the question concerning the area of nanotechnology.
The Commission takes the question of safety and consumer protection very seriously and it is working to ensure that the public can benefit from the innovations that nanotechnologies may bring while being protected from any adverse impact.
Much effort is dedicated to addressing safety issues.
Something like EUR 28 million from FP5 and FP6 has been dedicated to projects expressly focused on environmental and health aspects of nanotechnologies, and such research is planned to increase significantly in Framework Programme 7 too, both in size and in scope.
As you know, the Commission adopted an action plan for nanosciences and nanotechnology for Europe 2005-2009 and Parliament adopted a resolution on it, in which the action plan was well received.
In the communication published this month on the implementation of the nanotechnology action plan, we fully address the second part of your question.
A wide range of European and wider international, especially OECD and ISO, approaches are pursued, both regulatory and non-regulatory, to address the potential adverse impact of nanotechnologies.
The Commission is performing an assessment of regulatory aspects in relation to health, safety and environmental aspects of nanotechnology-based products.
Preliminary results indicate that, overall, the existing Community regulatory framework gives good coverage with regard to nanotechnology-based products developed today.
Different aspects of production and products, such as the ones mentioned in the question, like cosmetics and medicines, are already subject to various Community provisions, albeit not specific to nanotechnology.
Consequently, there seems today to be no need to develop new legislation for nanotechnology-related safety risks or to propose major amendments.
Nevertheless, on the basis of scientific development or regulatory needs in specific areas which the Commission closely monitors, regulatory changes may be proposed where necessary.
It is not nanotechnology as such where regulatory aspects should be considered but rather nanotechnology-based products.
The Commission is convinced that the moratorium on nanotechnology would be severely counterproductive.
Apart from denying society the possible benefits of such technologies, it may lead to the emergence of technological paradises outside Europe, where research and innovation are carried out without regulatory frameworks.
Finally, I would like to mention another Eurobarometer survey, which was about new technologies and was carried out in 2005 on a sample of 25 000 people.
If you compare it to the NanoDialogue exhibition, which you mention in your question, this one was based on 700 respondents.
Eurobarometer found that, on the whole, Europeans supported the development of nanotechnology, with approximately 55% in favour.
These technologies are perceived as useful to society and morally acceptable.
Understandably, as many as 42% of respondents were uncertain about the effects of this new technology, but according to the survey almost 70% of the respondents who expressed an opinion as to its effects were optimistic.
(SV) I think we are agreed that the worst thing for nanotechnology would be if the products we release now are poorly monitored and damage the reputation of the technology in its early development.
I do not believe that traditional toxicity tests assess the risks of nanotechnology sufficiently reliably; on the contrary I think that the toxicity tests required in current legislation must be updated.
I think that we need a labelling system so that consumers can choose for themselves, and I wonder whether the Commission is planning such legislation.
Member of the Commission. - I fully agree with you and with the first statement.
The worst thing would be if something happened, so we have to prevent that and we have to be on the safe side.
That is the name of the game and I fully agree with you.
Proposing legislation does not fall within my responsibility, but falls within the responsibility of my colleagues in the Commission who deal with protection.
I am sure they are looking at that very carefully.
What I can say is that we are doing everything possible in research to try to analyse the potential risks that you mentioned, and this is certainly something done under my responsibility.
(DE) Commissioner, where will the focus be in the nanotechnology sector in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research?
The population has very high hopes here, particularly in the 'live a long and healthy life' sector.
Do you too see totally new opportunities here in the medical sector for being able to live a long and healthy life?
Member of the Commission. - Yes, the answer is clearly positive.
This is one of the areas.
Nanotechnology, if one were to compare it, is a bit like information technology, because there is a horizontal influence on many sectors.
One of the sectors where the results are very promising is health, so this is also part of our research, which is also, without any doubt, orientated in this direction.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your answers.
I was very pleased to hear that you think that the common regulatory framework is developing in the right direction, and also that you challenge the NanoDialogue project and findings of the study to which the question is referring.
I think that the Eurobarometer shows clearly that European citizens are in favour of developing nanotechnologies.
My question for you is that, in his question, Mr Schlyter says that nanotechnology involves increasing risks.
Do you have any data now that shows nanotechnology would pose such a risk, which Mr Schlyter seems to say is already a fact?
Member of the Commission. - Without any doubt, this is an area which needs attention, not least as concerns risk.
When we enter into areas which in practice have this inherent potential then we have to act with caution.
If we do not want people to turn against something which, if handled carefully, would certainly benefit them, then we have to do things in a way in which everything possible is done so that this does not happen.
That is exactly our approach.
At this very moment, of course, there have been no incidents connected to this area, but it is obviously one in which it is much better to take a cautious approach.
That, surely, is the right way to proceed.
Questions 43 and 44 will be answered in writing.
Subject: London buses
According to figures released by the Greater London Assembly in June, the so-called 'bendy buses' (long single-deckers with two carriages) found in many European cities and introduced in London in 2002, were involved in 1 751 accidents in 2006.
This is 75% more than other types of bus, and represents an average of almost five accidents per day or more than five accidents per year for each 'bendy bus' in London's fleet.
Given this clearly unacceptable situation, particularly in comparison with other types of bus, what steps is the Commission taking to ensure that there are adequate safety measures for the operation of 'bendy buses' and that drivers receive the necessary level of training?
How can they be considered safe enough for operation in crowded urban conditions?
The Commission is not aware of worrying statistics in other European cities that use articulated buses.
However, Community legislation addresses the problem in several ways.
Directive 97/27/EC relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers lays down the standards for the manoeuvrability of buses in general, as well as specific standards for articulated buses.
Directive 2003/59/EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers is aimed at improving the level of driver training.
In this respect, it would be desirable for national legislation transposing the Directive to make provision for special training programmes for drivers of articulated buses.
In terms of driver vision, European legislation addressed the problem of heavy goods vehicles by Directive 2007/38/EC on the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles registered in the Community.
However, the Commission is aware of the need to take account of other categories of vehicles, such as urban buses.
That is why, as requested by the legislator in the abovementioned directive, the Commission will submit, when the time comes, a report on the results obtained, accompanied, if appropriate, by a proposal for the revision of existing legislation.
These are my answers to Baroness Ludford.
I think my question is well-timed, as just today the Commission has published its Green Paper on urban mobility.
I cannot expect the Commission to address my personal sense of loss that the iconic double-decker London Routemaster bus has been replaced by these low-level continental-type 'bendy' buses (or 'articulated' buses, as the Commission put it), but I am grateful for his reference to various pieces of EU legislation which ought to apply.
Could I ask him actually to make contact with the Mayor of London and Transport for London to investigate why these buses have a 75% worse accident rate than other buses, and to examine whether these directives are being properly applied in the UK, and specifically in London?
Mrs Å¢icÄu, rail priority axis No 22 must, in effect, link Germany with Greece via Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Sofia.
A branch to the north of this axis will go, via Curtici and Brasov, to Bucharest and Constanza.
Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the other countries concerned, are making considerable efforts to construct this railway line so that eventually their respective capitals and the port of Constanza will be linked to the rail network of the rest of the European Union.
These efforts should continue during the period 2007-2013.
These projects are potentially eligible for Community funding through the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds, or even via the trans-European networks budget.
More specifically, Romania is prioritising the development of the Curtici-Brasov-Bucharest-Constanza railway line.
A 92 km section to the north of Bucharest has already been built.
Projects are under way between Bucharest and Constanza. These should be progressively completed between now and 2010.
Romania has indicated, in its transport operational programme for 2007-2013, that it plans to develop the Curtici-Brasov-Predeal line using EUR 1.1 billion from the Cohesion Fund.
In terms of the Sofia link with the EU network, a major step was taken with the signing of the contract for the construction of the road and rail bridge over the Danube at Vidin-Calafat, financed by the ISPA Fund.
The bridge should be completed in 2010.
In addition, Bulgaria plans, in its transport operational programme for 2007-2013, to develop part of the Vidin-Sofia line.
The cost of the work to be carried out up to 2013 comes to EUR 320 million, out of a total of EUR 1 380 million for the entire line.
Romania is committed to completing, by 2013, all preparatory studies for the upgrading of the CraÃ¯ova-Calafat line to the north of the Danube bridge, so that it is ready to carry out the work shortly after 2013.
There you have it. I apologise for giving you all this information verbally, but obviously we can supplement this if necessary in writing, Mrs Å¢icÄu, if you request it.
(RO) Mr. Commissioner, indeed, if possible, I would like to receive this information in writing as well.
I would also kindly ask you to organize a seminar on structural funds in Romania, because I consider that the new Member States need to be supported in order to be able to gain access to structural funds and develop their transport infrastructure.
The European Union's access to the Black Sea is important and, for this reason, I believe that, for the mobility of passengers and goods, it is also important to develop the railway.
I come back to the question regarding the high-speed train: the mobility of passengers is important and, for this reason, I request a dialogue in order to be able to achieve, step by step, whatever is necessary for this important project.
I will answer Mr Posselt.
The Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava railway axis No 17 is one of the 30 priority projects of the trans-European transport network.
The Stuttgart 21 project that you mentioned is a major link in this priority project.
On 19 July 2007, an agreement was signed between Mr Tiefensee, the German Minister for Transport, and the authorities in the Federal State of Bade-Wurtemberg, the region and city of Stuttgart and Deutsche Bahn.
This agreement is a key phase in the elimination of the bottleneck represented by the Stuttgart-Ulm section, since it includes funding for the work to start in 2010.
The Commission is keeping a close eye on the modernisation of the sections between Stuttgart and Ulm.
In July 2005 it appointed a European coordinator for this line, Mr PÃ©ter BalÃ¡zs, who has already submitted his second report.
This report was sent to the Chairman of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism.
It is available on the website of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport.
The coordinator, Mr BalÃ¡zs, is continuing to give great attention to the Stuttgart-Ulm bottleneck, which must be eliminated.
In his report, the coordinator analysed the progress of the Paris-Bratislava priority project and concluded that most of the project could be completed in 2015.
However, given the complexity of the Stuttgart-Ulm section, this section will not be built until 2019.
It is clear that a priority project does not exclude continuation to other destinations.
Other priority projects, such as the Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nuremberg-Dresden axis, will extend the Paris-Bratislava project as far as the Black Sea and Greece, while the Eurocaprail priority No 28 project will link Brussels to Strasbourg via Luxembourg.
In July 2007 Member States submitted their proposals for Community cofinancing.
These proposals are currently being evaluated.
Based on this evaluation, the Commission will propose the RTE-T budget allocation for the period 2007-2013 to the European Parliament and Council.
Those are the answers I wanted to give you, Mr Posselt.
Personally I am extremely interested in the Paris-Budapest axis, and I can tell you that Mr BalÃ¡zs and I are really keen for every effort to be made to complete this major project.
(DE) Commissioner, the historical credit for setting in motion what Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand had decided to do back in 1982, and which is now finally becoming reality, goes to you.
I have two brief questions.
Firstly, the Strasbourg-Kehl-Appenweier and the Munich-MÃŒhldorf-Salzburg cross-border projects are also highly complex.
Is there any news on these?
Secondly: can you perhaps appeal once more to the rail companies - when we are already deploying so many European funds for cross-border routes - and ask them to stop cutting back cross-border train connections?
We are expanding the railways with our money at the same time as the rail companies are hacking transport routing to pieces with national timetables.
Mr Papadimoulis asked me a question, which I will now answer.
The Commission has taken note of the Greek court of arbitration's decision of 13 July 2006 on flights carried out as a public service requirement, and of the decision of 6 December 2006 concerning the relocation of Olympic Airways to Athens International Airport.
The Greek authorities have already informally consulted the Commission on these decisions on compensation, which were the subject of a preliminary examination.
Based on that preliminary examination and the documents submitted at this stage by the Greek authorities, the Commission is still unable to adopt a position on the nature of these decisions under EU rules on State aid.
If these decisions were to involve further aid, they would obviously have to be notified under Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
The Commission's services informed the Greek authorities of this preliminary evaluation and we are awaiting their response.
Broadly speaking, the Commission is doing everything in its power to ensure that the aid which it has ordered to be recovered are actually recovered.
That is the information I can give you, Mr Papadimoulis.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, it is not just Olympic Airways that owes money to the state.
The state also owes money to Olympic Airways, a very large amount.
In total, Olympic Airways is demanding more than EUR 1 billion from the Greek state.
I would like to ask you whether the Commission intends to wait for, and especially to respect, the final judicial decisions by the Greek courts having jurisdiction.
I am informed that next week you are to meet with the responsible Greek Minister with whom you will be discussing these matters.
Can you outline for us which points you agree on and where you disagree with the Greek Government on this subject?
In Greece there is considerable concern, and a significant section of public opinion blames the Commission for liquidating Olympic Airways while it was still in operation, for a token price, for the benefit of its competitors.
What reply can you give on this subject?
For the time being, we are awaiting clarification from the Greek authorities on the ruling of the court of arbitration.
We have not been in contact recently with the Greek authorities concerning any privatisation plans.
The issue is not whether the court of arbitration has taken the correct decision but whether the contractual relations on which it was based as a point of departure are compatible with Community law.
I cannot say much more about it, Mr Papadimoulis, since, as you yourself stated, I have just agreed to a meeting with the new Greek minister. I think that we will have the opportunity to discuss this with him then.
That is all I can tell you at the moment. We need more information from the Greek authorities before we can take the necessary decisions.
Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you for dealing with that last question.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(DE) Madam President, please allow me to speak on the Rules of Procedure.
I have been talking with my colleague, Mrs Madeira, and have also, of course, listened to the Commissioner's answers.
We have been asking our questions now for about three years and have not managed to get an oral answer to a single question.
Of course the written answer is also very detailed and correct, but it is easier to ask and make inquiries verbally and it makes the result even more interesting still.
Do you have any advice or guidance as to how this could perhaps be achieved in future?
Mr Leichtfried, thank you for your comments.
All I would say, in connection with the Working Party on the Internal Reform of Parliament, is that conduct of Question Time is one of the issues that we are looking at very carefully, and your comments will be taken on board.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00)
European Institute of Technology (debate)
The next item is the report by Reino Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Institute of Technology - C6-0355/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am happy to be here tonight to take a very important step with not only your approval but your engagement in proposing and establishing a European Institute of Technology (EIT).
As you all know, much progress has been made over the last month on this important proposal as a result of joint efforts.
I would like in particular to thank Mr Paasilinna, the rapporteur on this issue; the Chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler; Ms Hennicot-Schoepges from the Committee on Culture and Education; and also Mr BÃ¶ge from the Committee on Budgets, for their relentless efforts and very valuable contributions.
Without these contributions we would never have achieved our current status and possible outcome.
The report adopted by the Industry Committee and the text of the general approach adopted by the Council clearly go in the same direction.
I think this is very important.
It undoubtedly makes it easier to move towards a compromise text.
The EIT will provide an environment whereby partners from business, research and academia who are excellent in their respective fields can work together and spur their innovation potential.
We have agreed that the EIT should develop gradually.
Two to three Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) will be set up in a so-called start-up phase.
Further KICs will then be developed in the second phase, subject to the evaluation of the EIT and KICs' activities.
Long-term strategic activities or policy guidance will be provided by Parliament and the Council through the adoption of a strategic innovation agenda.
Your Parliament report contains useful amendments that clearly enrich the proposal and I thank you for them.
By way of example, I welcome the proposal to report to the European Parliament and the Council on the selection process for board members, to ensure that this is done transparently.
There is also a proposal to amend the name of the EIT to the 'European Institute of Innovation and Technology' but to keep its well-established brand 'EIT'.
I also welcome those amendments aimed at streamlining the EIT's financial management in clarifying that the procedure laid down in point 47 of the interinstitutional agreement applies to this setting-up.
The Commission can also support very many of your amendments, either as drafted or in spirit, where we need to adapt the wording.
However, we have concerns with some of your amendments suggested by the Industry Committee.
I will focus on four main issues.
Firstly, the education aspects.
We need to be careful to avoid watering down the education dimension of the EIT, which is a cornerstone and one of the most innovative features of the proposal.
We share Parliament's views that the mobility of researchers and the mobility of students will be instrumental and should therefore be highlighted.
But I strongly believe that the wording on degrees and diplomas should remain untouched.
Second, the presentation of the EIT has been established on a pilot-phase basis.
I think we all agree that the EIT should develop progressively and be subject to continuous evaluation.
However, there should be no doubt as to the long-term vision and commitment of the European Union regarding this initiative.
Uncertainty about this point - and especially at the beginning - will threaten the viability of the project altogether.
Third, the participation of third countries: we fully agree with the principle of facilitating third countries' participation in the EIT - this is one of the very important conditions.
However, it has to come along with the principle of preference for EU Member States.
The EIT is and should remain a European-driven initiative.
Fourth, the participation of the EIT and KICs in the Community programmes: there should not be a shadow of doubt on this.
The EIT itself will not seek to participate in Community programmes, nor will its administrative costs be funded by them.
The KICs, on the other hand, will be entitled to bid for funds but in no way benefit from privileged access - no preferential treatment.
To make this crystal clear, I believe that the right approach would be for the institutions to agree on a political declaration to this effect to be annexed to the proposal.
The financing of the EIT is now the key outstanding issue.
You know that last week the Commission adopted a proposal for a revision of the multiannual financial framework to accommodate the needs of both Galileo and the EIT.
I hope that this will provide a solid basis for discussions and an agreement by the budgetary authority before the end of this year.
This was requested by the European Council in June.
I am looking forward to the discussion.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the European Institute of Technology has been in preparation for more than a year and time has passed because the Commission's original proposal needed improving considerably.
Parliament's committees, led by the Committee on Industry, Research and Industry, have been reworking the proposal to give it a new look.
Parliament and the Council have been guaranteed more say in the matter, without jeopardising the EIT's autonomy.
The election of the EIT's Governing Board will very much bring to mind the way the European Research Council was elected, and so the science world has been arguing over the procedure.
Some attempt has been made to strengthen the opportunities SMEs might have to participate.
That is exactly where the impact on employment will be greatest, and that is exactly where we find the flexibility speedily to implement innovation.
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology will, as its name suggests, focus on innovation.
The two other elements of the 'knowledge triangle', education and research, will remain, but innovation is clearly the apex of the triangle and is the priority.
Innovation must be given special attention because it is innovation which is Europe's Achilles heel.
It is incredible that the Americans file over a third more patent applications with the European Patent Office, our very own patent office, than we do ourselves.
This is a good place to start.
The sceptics may ask whether the Union will be competitive without innovation or increasing innovation.
Well, we are talking about inventions and processes which can be widely introduced in the world of business.
Do we not need more?
We had better get a move on because the United States is forging ahead and China is not far behind us.
The Lisbon Strategy is also urging speed.
Why do we not even have faith in our own strategic decisions?
Research and development accounts for an increasingly lower share of the Union's GNP than in the other world economic powers.
We spend less than 2% on it, whilst the United States spends almost 3%, Japan more than 3%, and just Sweden and Finland spend almost 4% on it.
Our high standards of education, training and research, however, produce far too few commercial applications, or at least they are not realised in Europe but in the United States - there especially.
The problem obviously has many aspects and relates in part to how willing universities and colleges are to cooperate with the business world, together with the fact that our patenting system is awkward, and so on.
Of course, the EIT will not eliminate these problems, but it may to some extent ease them.
The brain drain should be something to be taken seriously.
Why is that?
Because we are trying to become the world's leading knowledge-based economy and brains are draining away!
The EIT will offer the private sector a new kind of contact with the educational and research community.
It will help create opportunities for the commercial exploitation of the results of research and strengthen cooperation in both directions.
The Institute will not become a super-university which robs top universities of their best researchers and scholars.
Parliament's amendments will see to that.
The EIT will be able to offer the best universities and colleges a new and long-lasting opportunity to work closely with companies which are hungry for innovation.
It may help the best universities to attract the world's best and most able students, scholars and researchers so that they may develop and utilise research and innovation and the processes and methods involved in its management working side by side with top companies.
It cannot be denied that the proposal contains areas which overlap with current instruments.
The technology platforms under the Seventh Framework Programme and the broader-scale JTIs, as long as they are brought into operation, are largely based on the same principles as outlined for the EIT.
The same goes for the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.
There may be some slight degree of overlap, but Europe is not witness to too much innovation but too little, so there is room for new competing enterprise.
It is all a matter of how the EIT fits into the current jigsaw.
I believe that it can be made to fit into the European research scene without offending against that environment.
We have added a trial stage with evaluations to the project and increased the powers of Parliament.
A week ago the Commission announced a proposal to take cash away from administrative bureaucracy and to support agriculture, wine and potatoes if you like, and to put it into innovation.
Should we not do that?
It is an interesting idea.
Crucial to the EIT's fate now is the willingness of the Member States to finance it, Member States which are not investing enough.
Do we all stand behind the Lisbon objectives?
This will be a test of that.
The EIT may produce more added value with a view to achieving the Lisbon objectives, but only if it does not cannibalise the Lisbon programmes.
The Union needs innovation, ladies and gentlemen.
People need it; our future needs it.
Why would we not support necessity?
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission presents its proposal to establish the European Institute of Technology as a project creating an important European institution that will integrate research, education and innovation and will help to transform innovative discoveries into commercial opportunities.
As a result, the Committee on Budgets examined the draft budget very carefully.
Unfortunately, it turned out that the combined draft budget presents numerous problems and is very ambiguous.
The main problem is that the funding was not explicitly included in the multi-annual financial framework for 2007-2013: the sum involved is EUR 308 million.
There are doubts about a further EUR 1.5 billion given the proposal to finance the Institute from other programmes, in particular the Structural Funds and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
Although there have been a number of discussions with both the Commission and the Council since the Committee on Budgets adopted its opinion, the matter of the Institute's financing has not yet been solved satisfactorily.
However, the additional funds could only materialise, as already mentioned, as part of a review of the financial framework.
Of course we will not know how effective and successful the EIT will be until it has been established.
However, it has to prove its viability by attracting money from the private sector too, as the Commission also proposes.
This can only be achieved if the projects are topical and they are of a high quality, and if the results are successful.
I hope the Institute will succeed in these endeavours.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its report on policy strategies for 2007 the European Parliament expressed scepticism regarding the European Institute of Technology, stressing the risk of duplication of structures already in existence and fearing that it might compete with already limited funding for research.
Certainly, there is a need to improve Community efforts with regard to research, innovation and education, to create public-private partnerships and, above all, to facilitate access to new knowledge by small and medium-sized enterprises.
