It is therefore no accident that we struggle the most with rethinking and reinforcing our national, linguistic and cultural identity, and we expect you to help us with this, since your Presidency can help in rebuilding an identity that is now inseparable from the consciousness of European citizens.
The opportunity and duty for the Slovenian Presidency is taking further steps to take the region's European mission and enlargement into a new phase.
Slovenia is the gateway to the Western Balkans, and Europe's path leads through this gateway.
The Member States' enlargement fatigue cannot become reform fatigue in this region, since it would endanger the stability of our region.
Finally, concerning the Reform Treaty, I am proud that Hungary was the first to ratify the Reform Treaty.
Although there are only very few matters in which political agreement can be reached in Hungary today, Europe has been one of them.
Our region needs a Europe that works more and works better, and we are sure of the cooperation and help of the Slovenian Presidency.
I wish you great success in your Presidency.
- (DE) Mr President, the Alps are important this year for Europe.
Slovenia has the Presidency of the European Council, Switzerland and Austria are hosting the European football championships and all eyes are on the mountains.
I congratulate the Presidency on taking over the official functions.
It is an important Presidency.
The Lisbon ratification process is quite rightly your first priority.
The ESDP is being put to the test in Kosovo.
In Parliament we are looking to you to make clear to us - if we don't manage to achieve a Security Council resolution - that Resolution 1244 is a watertight legal basis for all ESDP measures.
My Group Chairman has said: we are against an accelerated stabilisation and association agreement for Serbia without cooperation with the ICTY.
We celebrate the fact that Slovenia is the first Member State from the accession countries to take over the Presidency.
We Liberals have always fought strongly for this enlargement.
We have also advocated it whenever we encountered antagonism at home.
We do not feel very much like celebrating at the moment, however.
I am from North Rhine-Westphalia and learnt from 2 300 people in Bochum yesterday that Nokia are closing their production facilities and will be relocating to Romania.
The impression was then created that it was happening with EU money.
I want to make it crystal clear for the FDP that the relocation of jobs within the European Union must not be facilitated with EU funds!
We shall be doing everything we can to ensure that no EU subsidies are flowing in this case.
I see that the President of the Commission is nodding.
I hope that we get a clear response to this from the Commission.
This is a very important subject, which scares people and makes them afraid of Europe.
This should not be!
We shall also ensure that eligibility for assistance is checked if national subsidies are directed into Romania.
This is a problem and we hope that the skilled and motivated people in Bochum will soon find work again.
- (PL) Prime Minister, you have my sympathy and commiserations.
Following your entry into the euro area, inflation in your country is 100% higher than it was a year ago.
Despite this, as Commissioner Almunia said two months ago, Commission President, you have conceded that this rise in inflation is one of the consequences of accession to Euroland.
One of your stated priorities is the matter of Kosovo.
Please bear in mind that its independence would be the first unilateral alteration of boundaries in Europe since the Second World War.
This is exactly what Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia are looking for, but Moscow is also interested in destabilising the situation in the South Caucasus.
This may actually threaten war in that region, and the greatest military conflict in Europe since the Balkans flare-up of the early 1990s.
Clearly we must respect the right of the Kosovars to self-determination.
(ES) Mr President, I wish the Slovenian Presidency well.
It is an excellent symbol of the transformation of the European Union.
Some very important matters will be dealt with over the next six months, and I will mention a few.
Firstly, there is the Spring European Council, which will focus on the Lisbon Strategy.
The truth is that we are in a difficult economic situation: growth forecasts are declining as a result of the financial crisis, rising inflation, the strength of the euro and a very weak dollar, and the extremely high price of oil.
Food prices are also rising.
The public expect effective decisions that will help restore confidence in a time of uncertainty.
Externally there is the issue of Kosovo, which affects such important principles as the stability of borders throughout Europe.
Do not be hasty.
I think that the December European Council acted rather hastily.
It took decisions such as sending a civilian mission, but apparently with no agreement on the legal basis.
It is paradoxical that this is happening in the EU, a community based on the rule of law.
The issue of Kosovo is a delicate one, requiring caution.
Try hard to achieve a fresh Security Council resolution.
In May, as you mentioned, there will be the important Lima Summit with the Latin American countries, which are so close to Europe in terms of principles and values.
Lima should also be used as a lever to break the deadlock in the negotiations with Mercosur and to drive forward the negotiations with the Andean countries and Central America on their respective association agreements.
In March the expansion of the Schengen area will be a reality at airports.
This is a decisive time for the EU's external borders, which brings me to the fight against illegal immigration.
A meeting is planned between the ministers responsible for border control, which I think is very timely.
There is a need for increased cooperation between those ministers, and the officials looking after external borders need to be fully aware that they are doing not only a national job, but also a European one, and that they share responsibility for what happens throughout the Schengen area.
Finally, I would also ask you to work on the fight against terrorism.
The public expect the European Union to produce results in this area that is so significant and important for their lives.
(BG) Mr. President, Mr. Barroso, Mr. JanÅ¡a, I cannot fail to note that the Slovenian Presidency is a very important sign to European citizens and in particular for the citizens in Central and Eastern Europe.
Slovenia has the opportunity to bring them all the self-confidence of being truly equal stakeholders in the European process.
We know Slovenia as a country which addressed, without much ado, persistently and consistently, the big issues of its transition and today has every reason to be referred to as 'Eastern Europe's best performer'.
This was made possible through the political consensus in that country.
This is exactly what we expect from the Slovenian Presidency: to push on, without any flourish of trumpets or big promises, in dealing with issues that are key to the European Union's future as highlighted in the programmed presented.
You have every chance of achieving this because today's discussion showed both political and institutional consensus in your support.
I believe that the Slovenian Presidency comes at the right time, especially in view of the challenges related to the Western Balkans.
Slovenia's historical and political experience will enable the European Union to be more effective in its policy towards these countries.
They need a new impetus to continue reforms and speed up their progress towards the European Union.
A goal entirely within reach as Slovenia, a former constituent republic of Yugoslavia, has shown in practice.
I believe that through Slovenia, the European Union will speak in a voice more understandable for many of the Western Balkan nations.
In both the direct sense of the word, and figuratively.
I feel I must mention that for the first time the Council will be speaking a Slavic language.
It seems to me that no one else could deal more successfully with the 'Kosovo issue' than Slovenia.
The risks faced by the entire region are huge, and that is why our expectations of you, Mr. JanÅ¡a, are also high.
We expect you to succeed in preserving the unity of the European Union, both in regard to the resolution on the status of the province and in regard to the commitment of the Union in the difficult period thereafter.
Mr. JanÅ¡a, for us, Socialists, it is important that the Slovenian Presidency be a success, and we will not just sit aside and observe, we will yield our real support for your efforts as best as we can and as far as our powers go, so that you can implement your programme.
I wish you success, so that you can prove that a small country can be big in Europe.
(IT) Mr President, Prime Minister JanÅ¡a, ladies and gentlemen, welcome, Prime Minister, on behalf of that radical party and those comrades who rushed to achieve your release, with the comrades and friends of the Mladina magazine, in late 1988.
You were in prison for the sake of democracy and for the sake of Europe.
Today you find yourself President of a European Union which is eliminating and abolishing the anthem and the flag, which with the Eurogroup is even distorting - please note this, Prime Minister - the traditional geopolitical borders on our European coins.
You are in favour of enlargement, but this is the same Europe that was deaf to the tragedy in Yugoslavia, and today is deaf to Turkey and all the enlargements that we hope for.
We - myself included - were also at Ljubljana when the Serbian air raids took place.
At that time we met with Mr Skolk, with the young people of the AZMSS, with President KuÄan and even with our friend Mr Kacin.
At that time you were fighting for a Europe other than the Europe that was betraying you, which wanted to see a neutral Yugoslavia because it was convenient for it.
Welcome.
If, on behalf of your country, Slovenia, you are going to be what you have been, then you will be the one here standing for the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, not we who represent Europe, not we who often represent its disintegration.
(The President cut off the speaker)
- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the night between 20 and 21 December 2007 we extended the Schengen border.
We gained a bit more freedom again and came another step closer to each other.
The barbed wire has finally been removed and Slovenia took over the Presidency of the Council of a reunited Europe on 1 January.
As a European, but particularly as an Austrian, a friend, a neighbour and an ally, I am very pleased about this.
President-in-Office of the Council, this debate revolves around six items.
Firstly, the fact that you hold the Presidency has more than merely symbolic value.
It makes us aware of historic developments that for many have either already become self-evident or are unfortunately seen as a threat.
Secondly, the ratification process started in Hungary.
You need to structure and galvanise the process and provide sufficient coordinated information to the citizens of Europe.
Thirdly, please use the targets for climate change and greater European energy independence to provide further impetus for growth, employment and social cohesion when implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
Fourthly, your geographical position, experience of history and the timing of your Presidency give you special responsibility in terms of Croatia's accession, freedom for Kosovo and the agreement with Serbia.
Fifthly, we are embarking with you on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Let this Presidency be one of cooperation, of mutual respect, thoughtfulness towards one another and mutual understanding.
The sixth and final item: do not confuse your European responsibility with the bilateral issues to be resolved or Austria's responsibility towards the Slovenian minority in Austria.
Bilateral treaties between two Member States do not fall within the European Union's remit.
(FR) President-in-Office, you have come before us with modesty.
You have even mentioned potential errors, and admitted to possible naivety.
Within the context of the Troika, I suggest you pass on this sense of humility to the French President, who will succeed you.
I have just one message for you: teach Europe some of the best lessons from your history.
You are Celts - me too!
You have been dominated by Bavaria, coveted by the Republic of Venice, incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Empire, occupied by Napoleon - my apologies for that one - divided up between Germany, Italy and Hungary and integrated into the Yugoslav Federation, and you have been independent since your referendum in 1990.
What a history!
Who is better placed than you to talk about intercultural dialogue?
Who has greater credibility than you to do so?
So make it a higher priority.
You have placed it fourth; I suggest you move it up a rung or two!
Having said that, please do not restrict intercultural dialogue to interreligious dialogue.
Also think about the contribution to Europe made by those who believe that religion and politics should not be mixed, because history has shown that when one meddles with the other, it always leads to problems.
To conclude, if you would permit me, in the spirit of what I have just said, I would like to read a short passage from your national anthem to our fellow Members, because it is beautiful!
'God's blessing on all nations, Who long and work for that bright day, When o'er earth's habitation no war, no strife shall hold its sway; Who long to see, that all men free no more shall foes but neighbours be'.
That is the spirit of your Presidency, and that is the spirit of Europe.
I am French, and I am not going to give up the Marseillaise, but for six months I am very happy to be Slovenian!
(Applause)
Mr Poignant, listening to you singing the Marseillaise or even the European anthem would certainly be a great pleasure.
- (PL) Prime Minister, the aims you have stated for your Presidency include the Treaty, the Strategy, the climate, energy, the Western Balkans, and if we add to this intercultural dialogue, that will be quite a lot for this small country, following the great success on which I congratulate you and all the Slovenian people.
At the last meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister LuÃ­s Amado made no mention whatsoever of the Eastern dimension, while you have addressed it only in the most general terms, but I think that it is one of the aims, and particularly as a representative of the Slav countries, you should have a better appreciation of the Eastern dimension of the Slav countries than even the Portuguese have - not that I have any complaints in this regard.
The question is whether enlargement, as in the forecast made now by the French, prior to their Presidency, will concern mainly the Western Balkans, or maybe something more.
I would like you to clarify your views on this.
A second matter is that your country's Presidency coincides with the pre-election period for the European Parliament and, as we know, a turnout of just over 20% of European citizens is not very big and the trend is for it to get smaller.
Do you have anything to offer in this regard?
How will you convince Europeans that this edifice is a good one and that participation in it is worthwhile?
And the last matter I wish to raise, which is linked to the first, is that the Slovenian Ambassador to Ukraine has said that Ukraine should enter or will enter the free trade zone during this Presidency.
This would, of course, be good; there are just a few conditions there that would need to be met, such as the approval of the Duma and properly functioning borders.
In what way will the Presidency assist Ukraine in this process?
And, Mr President, I wanted to finish by saying that:
You have the power and the responsibility to control speaking time and I'm asking that you do so in the future.
(FR) President-in-Office, during a presidency, there are some subjects you can choose and others that gatecrash the party, like security in the Middle East, or Iran.
In this regard, Iran's nuclear dossier is part of a complex process that touches on security in the Middle East and the Muslim world.
To restore trust, we need to talk about Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, extremists, human rights and poverty.
Many of the region's inhabitants are living on less than two dollars a day.
Is this acceptable?
I am not speaking from a moral point of view, but from a security one.
These people end up becoming extremists because they have nothing to lose and feel humiliated.
Nobody is born a suicide bomber, nobody is born a terrorist.
We have to create an environment that will enable everyone to live with dignity, in peace and freedom.
These are not my words, they are the words of Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
They imply that the beginnings of a relationship of trust should be established with the Arab world, in particular Iran, that it should not exclude any inflammatory subjects - neither that country's shocking revisionism regarding the Holocaust, nor the security of Israel - and that it should be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and dignity.
Does the Slovenian Presidency want to take up these words?
Most of all, does it really think it may one day be possible to denuclearise the region by avoiding any mention of the taboo that is Israel's nuclear programme?
(RO) Prime Minister, I would like to congratulate you on addressing us today as President of the Council.
Slovenia has the admiration of the other European nations for its remarkable development since 1990 and for meeting the standards for accession - be they negotiation chapters, adoption of the single currency, or the Presidency of the Council.
I would also like to congratulate you on defining the priorities of the EU for the next 6 months, in cooperation wth the German and Portuguese governments.
Undoubtedly, it is desirable that the Lisbon Treaty, which puts and end to a prolonged identity crisis in the European Union, be ratified as soon as possible and acknowledged as an authentic democratic act by all European citizens.
At the same time, it is also desirable that the goals of the Lisbon Strategy should be put into practice as soon as possible, because we are facing a wave of pessimism among the citizens concerning this policy.
The latest European Commission Eurobarometer of December 2007 indicates a relative drop in citizens' confidence in both of the Strategy's components: economic growth and employment.
Unemployment remains a major concern for European citizens, although there has been significant improvement compared with 2006.
With the new cycle starting in 2008 for the Lisbon Strategy, the European Parliament will adopt an action plan concerning workforce mobility, in order to strengthen employment at European level.
However, there is still the issue of restricted access to the European labour market, affecting over 100 million European citizens.
I therefore urge you, Prime-Minister, to support the initiatives of the Parliamentt and the European Commission concerning free access to the labour market.
I firmly believe that in this way Europe will secure its economic future by safeguarding the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty.
(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian I would like to welcome particularly warmly the fact that Slovenia holds the Presidency of the Council; that, of the countries who have recently joined the European Union, it falls to Slovenia to be the first to hold the Presidency; and that Slovenia is now in the Schengen area together with other European countries.
As holder of the Presidency, your fundamental task is to give a strong impetus to the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty.
This is a treaty that will enable this Parliament to have greater co-decision powers, that will make it possible to take decisions by qualified majority on some absolutely strategic issues and all within sectors where the fundamental rights of citizens will be given more attention and more protection: I am thinking of judicial cooperation and legal immigration.
Our suggestion is directed to this end, and we will have to attempt over the coming months to find room for an interinstitutional agreement to regulate the transitional stage on various issues: I am thinking, for instance, of the Europol package to be voted on tomorrow, and tomorrow this Parliament will ask you to make an undertaking for the Council to consult the European Parliament once again within six months of the entry into force of the treaties in the light of the new legal provisions that these treaties will offer us.
Again, on the common immigration policy I would ask for your commitment to a secure framework, as illegal immigration can only be combated while respecting fundamental rights with tenacity, conviction and accuracy, partly in order to avoid a recurrence of what happened a few months ago when hundreds of human beings clung to tuna nets in a vain attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe.
- (LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Slovenia on being the first new Member State to hold the EU Presidency.
I believe that other new Member States, when preparing for their presidencies, will be able to learn a lot from Slovenia's experience.
Certainly, one of the most important tasks of the Slovenian Presidency is to promote a successful ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty.
For my part, I can announce that Latvia plans to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in May, during the Slovenian Presidency.
The Slovenian Presidency's undertaking to strengthen the EU's role as a global leader in combating climate change and the use of renewable energy is to be welcomed.
For several years climate change and energy problems have been a focus of attention for the public and politicians.
It is, however, important that this priority is not only expressed as a fine undertaking, but can also be reflected as a priority in the EU budget.
In view of the fact that work should begin on the mid-term review of the Financial Perspective this year, it would be important to hear the Slovenian Presidency's thoughts about possible EU budget priorities within the context of the mid-term review.
I think that climate change and energy issues ought to be among these priorities, including directing a larger portion of the EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund towards increasing energy efficiency and fostering the use of renewable energy.
The Slovenian Presidency's undertaking to pay more attention to the western Balkans, including the Kosovo issue, is understandable.
The view expressed by Slovenia's prime minister, however - that the security situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina might be worse than in Kosovo - has met an equivocal reaction.
Therefore, it would be important to have a precise understanding of the Slovenian Presidency's position concerning the state of affairs in the Balkans and its proposals for stabilising the situation.
Thank you for your attention, and I wish the Slovenian Presidency every success in its work.
(NL) The President-in-Office of the Council bears the important responsibility of launching a new cycle of the Lisbon process at the forthcoming Spring Summit.
To be frank, my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, takes the view that the proposals presented to us by the President of the Commission in December lack ambition.
It is true, of course, that the previous cycle of the Lisbon Strategy created growth and jobs, but it is also true that Europe is now required to function in the context of accelerated globalisation and new world players.
The Socialist Group is convinced, therefore, that Europe will only be able to continue to play its role if it puts the maximum focus on sustainable development, on research and innovation, on investment in people; in short, on quality rather than low costs or low standards.
It is also clear to us that this needs to involve everyone in Europe.
Lisbon did not prevent a situation in which 78 million people risk descending into poverty and in which a large proportion of the jobs created are precarious and do not offer a decent income.
Therefore, Lisbon cannot succeed without genuine reinforcement of the social dimension.
This requires more than comments, Commission President; it must occupy a visible, prominent position in the guidelines and in an ambitious social agenda.
President-in-Office of the Council, we are counting on the Slovenian Presidency to make this clear at the Spring Summit.
- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I, too, am happy that Slovenia is taking over the Presidency of the Council.
I was this Parliament's general rapporteur for the enlargement round of the 12 countries and now seeing a country from this line-up take over the Presidency for the first time personally gives me great pleasure.
Slovenia is also the most successful of the new Member States, as a member of both the Schengen area and the euro area, and has proved that these new countries get on very well in Europe.
And it must be said that small countries are often the most successful as regards the Presidency of the Council because they get fully involved in this business.
I therefore wish you every success with it.
You have a multifaceted array of tasks ahead of you.
You have to see through and deliver ratification of the crucial Lisbon Treaty and you must already be preparing to implement this Treaty, which is at least as important.
You have a difficult problem ahead of you with Kosovo, and you have an exceptional opportunity to sort this out for us because you know this region very well.
However, this also shows that the European Union is often pushed on foreign policy issues so that we are played off against the Americans and Russians.
When I see that at the same time as we are discussing strategies for Central Asia, and Gazprom is concluding gas contracts with Kazakhstan, then I have to say that we are not really taking strategic action on issues that are crucial for our future and I think that perhaps something needs to be improved here.
Please allow me one final comment.
I too, coming as I do from North Rhine-Westphalia, would be grateful to the President of the Commission if he were able to provide clarification on the subject of Nokia.
Relocations may, of course, take place.
To put it clearly, Germany, more than almost any other country, gains extensive benefits from the European internal market or an enlarged European internal market, but it is very difficult to make this clear to those concerned if the loss of their jobs was facilitated with European funds or if unlawful national subsidies were used for this.
We therefore request clarification on this because if these rumours were to be repeated, great harm would be done to the European concept.
- (EL) Mr President, the Slovenian Presidency is very fortunate to be following on from two successful presidencies.
Slovenia is also the first of the 12 new Member States to take on the Presidency, and this makes its responsibility all the greater.
The Slovenian Presidency's programme undoubtedly contains worthy elements.
For my part, however, I believe that greater weight ought to have been given to the attempt to achieve greater understanding and acceptance by the public both of the Reform Treaty and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Slovenian Presidency supports the plans for the accession of the Western Balkan States.
This is also the position of my delegation, but, as experience has taught us, it should be borne in mind that the premature setting of the date for the commencement of accession negotiations can lead to deadlock.
We should also very seriously consider that the overwhelming weight of European public opinion appears to be particularly cautious about any further expansion, and this is something that we cannot ignore.
We must all be particularly careful on the subject of Kosovo.
We should realise that a power game is being played in the region.
On the one hand, US policy seeks to fully control the whole region, while Russia for its part wants to maintain contact with a region with which traditionally and for centuries it has maintained special relations.
In this game Kosovo is like a ping-pong ball.
At the recent Summit Meeting the European leaders did not take a decision on whether they would recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo.
Let us hope that we shall all weigh up the dangers inherent in unilateral recognition and act with particular care, because unsuccessful manoeuvres might set off chain reactions in the wider region, with unforeseen consequences.
Mr President, I am told that, when Slovenia opened its borders recently, the crowd there compared notes on how much they had smuggled across during the Communist days, even to the extent of having a model confessional box there for anyone who confessed their sins, who was then rewarded with coffee and brandy, so I can understand why President Barroso rushed to be part of these celebrations!

But, Prime Minister, you gave us, initially, a moving account of your country and indeed your own history.
You talked with pride of Slovenia and you talked with some emotion of your experience in the prison cell.
I hope that those are the emotions you will bring to the Presidency - the belief in human rights and the determination that Europe shall have that pride too.
There are two areas that I want to raise with you as you do that.
One is on our environment, because alongside human rights and our Lisbon Agenda goes a clean environment, a healthy environment and, indeed, a healthy people.
That environment needs to move on from Bali, which was a great talking shop.
We now need the action.
We need real action, realistic action, and that must start next week with our climate change package.
On the health field, we need legal certainty on cross-border health.
There is a great new opportunity for Europe's citizens - its patients - if we get this right.
We waited and had this delayed.
That must wait no longer.
We must make sure, please, that it now comes forward.
If we do not, it is not an option to do nothing.
The alternative is that the lawyers go on making policy for us.
Thirdly, on that, I ask you to pay particular attention to mental health.
If there is any criticism of Slovenia I have, it is the slowness with which it has enacted its mental health laws.
Now you have an opportunity to lead on mental health following the Green Paper and I hope you will take that up.
You are a small country, a proud country, and the small countries of Europe are usually the best Presidents of the European Union.
I wish you success in that.
I have confidence that Slovenia, under your leadership, will meet that pride in success and achievement by the time you finish in six months' time.
We still have another 10 minutes' 'catch the eye', each with a minute at the most.
(SL) The many good wishes addressed to Slovenia as the first of the new Member States to take over the Presidency of the Council indicate that the activities of Slovenia will attract special attention.
The expectations are great and so is the responsibility.
People outside the political institutions in the new Member States often think that the Union is led by just a few of the large countries.
This is where Slovenia has an exceptional opportunity to prove that the Union consists of 27 States which together are responsible for shaping the common policy.
In implementing the priorities and the inherited agenda, I expect Slovenia to pay great attention to cohesion and the reduction of differences in Europe.
In this short minute I would like to mention climate change and the energy policy, because Europe has set extremely ambitious aims for itself to develop into a society with low carbon emissions.
And that is what is important: a society with low carbon emissions.
I would like Slovenia to put forward some concrete proposals and projects and to achieve results in that area.
- (PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, Slovenia's Presidency is facing many ambitious tasks.
At the forefront of these ambitious tasks is ratification of the Treaty.
You will be the watchman, you will have the entire procedure in your hands.
I therefore have a request, and that is to spare a thought, please, for those countries which have not adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, those who have opted out.
It is a fact that Poland and Great Britain have opted out, but I am certain that these two countries will realise that they have made a mistake and will want to adopt the Charter.
They will want to offer their citizens the Charter.
They must be given help in this, and so I am calling on you to make provision for a simplified return procedure, a procedure that will be easy and quick, that will be an opt-in and will not require further ratifications.
The success of a Presidency, Prime Minister, is generally inversely proportional to the size of the country.
I am sure you will apply this principle.
(SL) Prime Minister, I welcome the points which you devoted to human rights today.
As a liberal MP from Slovenia and a former journalist, I am of the opinion that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are the two most important human rights.
For that reason I would like to use this solemn occasion to point out the great seriousness of the petition with which a quarter of Slovenian journalists are protesting against the overt and covert pressure they are experiencing.
The public discrediting of the signatories using their statements taken out of context, with the intention of portraying them as untrustworthy people, is an inopportune act.
In my opinion, it is a duty of the Presidency of the European Union to ensure that its representatives deal with the content of the statements and evidence in the petition.
- (EL) Mr President, our greatest concern regarding the proposals for a solution for Kosovo relates to the attempt to place a unilateral declaration of independence on a legal footing, and this would have momentous consequences for international law.
The recognition of Kosovan independence outside the framework of the United Nations, by means of a unilateral declaration, would constitute a dangerous development; it would perhaps lead to further bloodshed and a redrawing of the borders.
We believe that, as a very clear infringement of international law, it would also be used in other conflict situations as a method of resolving disputes.
Perhaps this could also happen in the case of EU Member States such as Cyprus.
The situation in Kosovo is a continuation and a result of interventionist policies and is a problem that can be resolved only within the framework of the UN and existing international law, without external intervention and infringement of the principles of its very charter.
The impact of measures that are taken unilaterally can currently be seen in Iraq.
It is only by means of legal, agreed political solutions that peace can be ensured.
Mr President, I join my colleagues in welcoming the Prime Minister here today.
President-in-Office, what a journey in 20 years: from languishing in jail to Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, to President-in-Office of the European Council, and now a member, as you tell us, of the EU, NATO, the euro zone and the Schengen area.
It is true that the current Balkan situation represents unfinished business; peace in the region is very important to all of us.
Thank you particularly for your sensitive handling of the forthcoming Irish referendum needed for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
Perhaps I could add to our referendum slogan your words in your concluding remarks when you said: 'I care about Europe because Europe cares about me'.
What better slogan for the Irish referendum!
We can take nothing for granted - it will be hard to deliver - but, believe you me, the Fine Gael Party, of which I am a member, our leader and all the Members of the European Parliament will leave no stone unturned to ensure a 'yes' outcome to the referendum of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland.
Thank you, and we look forward to delivering it to you during your Presidency.
Mr President, as a Finn I am a big fan of ski-jumping, and - to use an allegory - I would say to the Prime Minister that the task of the Slovenian Presidency is like the Planica hill, the instruments that you have are like Elan skis and I hope you have the willpower of PrimoÅŸ Peterka.
I think that this is going to be a successful Presidency for three reasons: one, you have prepared extremely well; two - and we heard it in your speech today - you are extremely humble; and three, you are very businesslike.
That is a recipe for success.
You have three big tasks.
If you can pull them off at the end of the Presidency, I think you have done it.
One, the Treaty: if you have got a lot of Member States to ratify without problems, you have done a great job; two, the energy package: if you have got some of that done, you have done a great job; and three, if you have succeeded with Kosovo, you have done it.
I think the Slovenian Presidency is going to be one of the best ones that we have seen for a long time.
Good luck!
Mr President, Slovenia is the first Member State which, having suffered under totalitarian Communism, can now take the lead in Europe as a whole.
Therefore it is your historic challenge and chance, Prime Minster, to take the lead also in promoting integration of different historic experiences, to create a united and balanced perception of our history as a common European history.
I think you, and all of us, need to be confident that the mass murders which happened under Communism will never be repeated again.
This can only happen if, in Europe as a whole, we pass the same moral and political verdict on totalitarian Communism as was passed on Nazism.
Two more speakers have come forward, both from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which was the group most strongly opposed to the 'catch-the-eye' system.
In this respect it is interesting as to who makes the most use of it.
(SV) Mr President, first let me offer my heartfelt congratulations to Slovenia and wish you all the best for the Presidency.
Janez JanÅ¡a, a colleague of mine, has already put a question regarding your statement that the security situation in Bosnia is worse than that in Kosovo.
I want to be sure that you really answer this question.
I therefore ask it again: on what do you base this assertion?
For it is quite simply not the case.
By making this statement you showed not only a lack of information but also a lack of diplomacy.
If the situation had been so complicated in Bosnia and worse than in Kosovo, your statement would have been positively dangerous.
I therefore expect an answer.
(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, we have various projects that are very important for us, including the 'Research on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises' project.
I would ask that the Council's conclusions insist that we are able to complete this at first reading because I believe that this is a pressing concern for our small and medium-sized enterprises.
The second point is that energy efficiency in production and consumption should be for us a focus of the debate.
A large number of jobs can be created here.
The Lisbon Agenda for new jobs and employment is very important for us all.
President-in-Office of the Council, my sincere thanks to you for the cogent introduction to your programme for the Slovenian Presidency.
All contributions to the debate from the responsible group chairmen and other Members have created the impression that you can count on the enormous and unreserved support of the European Parliament.
On behalf of us all I sincerely wish you every success in your work.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this very interesting debate, where I think there was a very large consensus supporting the priorities that were presented by the Slovenian Presidency.
During my first statement I highlighted some - because I could not go into detail on all aspects - of the priorities for our work during these six months: the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy and also our climate and energy package.
Specifically on this point, I was very encouraged by the support that many of you gave to our work on this matter.
It is very important that we now deliver on our commitments.
The Heads of State and Government agreed on ambitious targets - a 20% reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and 20% for renewables.
We cannot have the targets and then not deliver on the means of achieving those targets.
It is a question of coherence and of credibility, and I was very encouraged by the support given to this during today's debate.
I would like just to answer one question that was brought to the debate by Mr Schulz, Mr Lambsdorff and Mr Brok regarding a specific problem that is now being discussed in Germany - the question of possible funding for relocation of a company in Europe.
I can tell you that the operational programme on competitiveness for Romania has a specific clause banning the use of Structural Funds for the cofinancing of delocalisation.
The European Commission has not received any project relevant to this issue, so the Commission can confirm that no European regional development funding is implicated in this relocation.
Of course we consider that it would be unacceptable to use funding from European Union funds for relocation inside the European Union.
(Applause)
At the same time it is true that the European Union, through the PHARE programme, has funded an industrial park in Romania where several companies are now investing.
This is important and I will draw the attention of all my colleagues here, especially our German friends, to this debate and how important it is to have a responsibility in this debate.
We have to make a distinction between delocalisation outside the European Union and relocation in Europe.
If investment goes from Finland to Germany, it can also go from Germany to Romania.
Let us be honest about it.
We have to make clear that this is not delocalisation outside the European Union.
As you remember, the Commission and I have proposed a Globalisation Adjustment Fund that is already working precisely for cases where some jobs could be affected by delocalisations outside the European Union.
It is very important that European leaders at all levels in the European Union - in the Commission, in the European Parliament, but also at national level - also have the courage to explain the benefits of enlargement.
(Applause)
Germany is the country that is now exporting more to the new Member States.
The enlargement of the European Union is creating jobs in Germany too.
German companies are also investing a lot in the new Member States.
So it very important from a European perspective that we all explain that enlargement of the European Union is not only good for the new Members but it is also an opportunity for the European Union as a whole.
(Applause)
At the same time, I agree that we have to check that no Structural Funds money is used to finance a specific delocalisation of a company.
That would be unfair competition.
But I call on all those who are pro-European to stand up and defend this united enlarged Europe, and also to exploit the benefits that we all, in all the new Member States, are getting from this more dynamic Europe that we can build today.
(Applause)
Many thanks, President of the Commission, for this statement.
We wish the Slovenian Presidency every success.
We will now go together to the press conference.
Voting will then take place here.
Thank you for the very intensive and good debate.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) Congratulations, Prime Minister JanÅ¡a, for your speech to our European Parliament.
You are the first leader of one of the nations freed from the yoke of communism that joined the European Union in 2004 to be President of the European Council.
It is a challenge for you, for your people and for your government.
There are no large and small countries: there are good and bad ones.
Your economic results, your recent acceptance into the euro area and the prosperity of your people make you an example that should inspire many countries teaching lessons to others.
You are the final part of the 'troika' that began with Germany and continued with Portugal, and you will pave the way for the success of the Presidencies in the next 'troika': France, the Czech Republic and Sweden.
As I write these lines, I am thinking of Kosovo, your brothers in the Western Balkans, and their future in Europe.
in writing. - (IT) Thank you, Mr President.
The Slovenian Presidency commences at a time when, in Europe, a sense of moderate optimism regarding the EU's future is again beginning to be felt.
After a few years of confusion and uncertainty, the time has really come to make the EU 27 project take wing.
Once again, I would like to ask the Presidency-in-Office to reflect on one particular issue, and that is the two meeting places of the European Parliament.
Now, when we are constantly asking the citizens of our various countries to make sacrifices, we will give a really strong signal if we decide to focus all our work in Brussels.
The cost, in terms of financial resources and organisational inconvenience, incurred by Europe due to this monthly change of location is becoming truly unacceptable in the eyes of citizens, who cannot understand the reasons for such an absurd situation.
The seat in Strasbourg, which is of course a magnificent city, could be used for other prestigious purposes within the EU's activities.
Let us give a good example and, on that theme, let us turn words into action.
in writing. - (PT) As was clear from the debate, and as expressly stated in its programme, the Slovenian Presidency will continue to follow closely the agenda of the German Presidency, giving priority to the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We know that the political elites of the European Union want the Treaty to be ratified by all Member States before the 2009 elections.
They are therefore keeping up strong pressure to avoid referendums being held, except in Ireland where the constitution requires it, thereby making clear their attitude to democracy and getting closer to the citizens: only when there are no risks of the citizens voting against their opinions and interests.
Next, their major priority appears to be what they call the 'second cycle of the Lisbon strategy', to increase liberalisation and attacks on public services and social and labour rights.
We are also afraid that the situation unfolding in Kosovo is more of a threat to peace and development in Europe if there is a unilateral declaration of independence.
Meanwhile, the serious social problems of unemployment, precarious employment, poverty and growing social and territorial inequality remain unsolved.
We will keep up the fight to abandon these neoliberal policies and to embrace a different Europe of social justice, peace and social progress.
in writing. - (PT) With the Slovenian Presidency of the Council comes the opening of the third act of the farce orchestrated by the forces promoting federalist, neoliberal and militarist integration in Europe, in which the EU - with Germany at the helm - imposes a treaty that was previously rejected, avoiding the holding of national referendums.
They say that there is no need to hold referendums:
Because there is a 'broad consensus' in every country on what the Treaty proposes, especially in the national parliaments.
However, one of the main lessons of the referendums in France and the Netherlands was surely that they revealed a profound contradiction between the will of the people and the 'parliamentary majorities'.
Because ratification by the parliaments is as legitimate and democratic as ratification by referendum.
How then should we understand the claim that holding a referendum in Portugal would aggravate the risks of the Treaty not entering into force?
What they fear is a referendum result that differs from what they want, and so do not hold any.
Because the Treaty proposal is different from the one that was rejected previously and involves 'substantial change'.
Yet they do not say what.
However, do the promoters themselves not claim that the substance is the same?
Read the statements by Giscard d'Estaing.
They are motivated by fear...
The Slovenian Presidency's programme meets all the requirements of one who is interested in economics and is convinced that being in good economic shape is one of the keys to the success of the Union.
In the Presidency's programme I have found many important references to the Lisbon Strategy and to the role of the internal market in the process of strengthening the EU in the international arena.
The 21st century Union should concentrate on education and training.
A well-educated society has huge potential, and this in turn must find an application in the economy, which is chiefly based on flourishing small and medium-sized businesses that are easy to set up, without unnecessary formalities and expense.
These companies must have access to well-trained employees and to research resources, new technologies and so on. The Presidency is devoting much attention to this.
The Presidency's declaration that it will get involved in eliminating barriers and will concentrate on better regulation sends businesses an important signal.
One thing we know is that there is nothing worse than bad legislation.
It seems to me to be particularly important to link the initiative of removing administrative barriers for businesses with the opening up of new paths to new technologies.
The Presidency will also keep consumers in mind; the interests of consumers are just as important as those of business, and should be represented and protected in the same way.
The Presidency's programme is very ambitious, but it also sets out its priorities clearly, and I agree with those priorities.
It only remains for me to convey my congratulations and wish you every success.
in writing. - (HU) Before I start, I would like to welcome the ambitious programme of the Slovenian Presidency, which is treating the important cohesion of the Western Balkans as a prominent question for the whole EU.
According to the Commission's annual report for 2006, the accession of 2004 was a great result for the old and new Member States, but the smooth management of the process was the key factor in its success.
The EU currently has to confront new challenges that require greater efforts.
Maximum support from the Slovenian Presidency in fulfilling all the priorities of its programme is essential for handling these matters appropriately, including the creation of the preconditions for Croatian and Turkish accession.
The fundamental interest of the EU is supporting the processes of reform in the Western Balkans, and in sorting out the Kosovo situation within the framework of the European Perspective in a way that is acceptable to everyone.
Enlargement is a strategic and security policy interest for the EU, and requires an effective development policy and cooperation in partnership.
The emphasis must also continue to be placed on dealing with programmes for the Western Balkans that serve to reduce differences in the state of development and strengthen social, economic and regional cohesion.
However, stimulating investment in human resources and supporting the development of a knowledge-based, creative society are essential for ensuring balance between increasing competitiveness and cohesion, and encouraging the development of the Western Balkans.
In accordance with the principle of European solidarity, efforts must be made to end poverty and guarantee 'direct aid' for the countries of the Western Balkans too.
It is our joint responsibility to support the programme of the Slovenian Presidency so as to achieve the main objectives of the Union.
All the countries that have joined the European Union since 2004 are proud of the fact that one of them - Slovenia - is taking on the Presidency.
We welcome the new Presidency's announcements and the first steps it has taken.
The priorities for the first half of 2008 are to a large extent evidence that the work of Slovenia's predecessors is being continued, primarily in the sphere of revival of the Lisbon Agenda, ratification of the new Treaty and action to prevent global warming.
Continuity of work is a desirable feature in the European Union, bearing in mind the half-yearly cycle of the Presidency.
Independently of its declared priorities, Slovenia, because of its geography and history, is seen as a country with links to the Balkans.
This brings with it both opportunities to enlarge the Union further and, first and foremost, serious problems regarding the question of Kosovo's independence.
An understanding of this problem area is a clear ace that the new Presidency holds.
We also hope that a country which has gone through the labour of transformation and adaptation to EU standards will appreciate the problems new Member States face in terms of unreasonable obligations regarding renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
A balance needs to be found between care in protecting the natural environment and the need to keep the European economy competitive in global terms.
I wish you success, and thank you for your attention.
in writing. - (SK) The start of 2008, of 'Together in Diversity: the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue', is a significant period for the EU, all the more so due to the fact that the EU Presidency in the first half of the year will for the first time be held by a new Member State, Slovenia.
Four priority areas that emphasise the implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, energy, climate change and relations with the Western Balkans can contribute towards synergy in Europe.
Slovenia has an opportunity to become the architect of EU world leadership in the fight against global warming.
The acceptance of the euro is currently a hot topic in Slovakia.
Slovakia's acceptance into the euro zone will be decided during the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union.
Slovenia is an example to Slovakia: it was the first of the EU-10 countries and the thirteenth of all EU Member States to introduce the euro, which it did in 2007.
Slovakia can learn from many of Slovenia's experiences and can use them in its own preparation for the introduction of the euro.
I expect that Slovenia will do everything possible to make sure that the decision on whether to introduce the euro in Slovakia by the planned deadline of 1 January 2009 has a positive outcome.
I hope that by its actions the Slovenian Presidency can convince 500 million European citizens that even a small country with 2 million people is capable of successful leadership of the EU during its six-month presidency.
I believe that Slovenia will indeed succeed.
in writing. - (FR) I would like to give my warmest wishes for success to the Slovenian Presidency, which represents a form of consecration of the reunification of a Europe divided by the Cold War.
Slovenia, which has cooperated with Germany and Portugal to prepare an 18-month programme, ends a cycle of presidencies marked by a successful relaunch of the institutions and the heavy responsibility of seeing through the process of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is a major challenge to which we must all contribute, in each of our respective Member States, to ensure that the forthcoming French Presidency can put this new common foundation definitively in place before the European elections in 2009.
The Slovenian Presidency must also continue and complete the Lisbon Strategy to meet the challenges Europe has to face on energy and climate change, growth and employment.
I sincerely hope that the Slovenian Presidency will manage to guarantee peace and stability in the Western Balkans and produce a unified EU approach to the issue of the final status of Kosovo so that 2008, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, can truly be a chance for all Europeans to reaffirm their values of tolerance and mutual understanding.
in writing. - (HU) It is of historical significance that a new Member State that joined the Union in 2004 is leading it in the first half of 2008.
This is a major step forward in the recently acceded countries taking the places they deserve at the Union table.
There is a huge amount at stake for the first Presidency from one of the new Member States, and Slovenia is leading the Union at a key time.
The most important duties of the Slovenian Presidency are helping with the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty, dynamically setting in motion the new three-year cycle for the Lisbon Strategy and continuing to develop the integrated energy and climate protection policy.
The Slovenian Presidency is handling the integration of the Western Balkans, especially the question of Kosovo's future status, as a priority.
Slovenia's sensitivity and knowledge of the region may make the complicated organisation process a little easier and promote preservation of the unity achieved by the European Council of December 2007 with regard to the missions to be sent to Kosovo.
In March, during the Slovenian Presidency, the European Commission will propose legislation for a health check on the Common Agricultural Policy, which will be the overture to comprehensive conceptual and funding reforms for the CAP.
The Presidency will also emphasise programmes for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in 2008.
We are cheering on our Slovenian friends, so that they have a successful Presidency.
I am sure that the Slovenian policies and diplomacy will successfully solve the difficult tasks, and that, as a new Member State, we can be proud of our neighbour.
Agenda
We have an announcement before we start with regard to this afternoon's debates.
I should like to propose bringing forward the debate on the report by DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra on EUROPOL and taking it as the second item before the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan.
The order of business this afternoon would, therefore, be as follows: from 15.00 to 18.00: first of all, the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kenya, then the report by DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra on EUROPOL, then the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan; then at 18.00, as normal, we would go on to Question Time with the Council.
Are there any comments?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, for once we can agree, but I should like the Commission to note that it is Parliament that sets the agenda and only in exceptional circumstances can we respond to the wishes of individual Commissioners.
We can agree today, however, by way of exception.
Thank you for that point, Mr Swoboda; it clearly is an exception.
But I thank the House for its agreement.
(Parliament agreed to the request)

- Before the vote:
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to clarify a point which was raised in yesterday's debate on the proposal for a Consumer Credit Directive.
This point concerned the new version of Article 8 concerning the obligation to assess the credit-worthiness of consumers.
Both amendments 46 and 45 foresee that Member States whose legislation requires creditors to assess the creditworthiness of consumers on the basis of consultation of the relevant database may retain this requirement.
As I understand it, this also means that the sanctions foreseen in this national legislation for a failure of the creditor to fulfil these requirements could also be retained.
Madam President, yesterday the IND/DEM Group asked for all the votes to be roll-call votes.
I note in today's votes that, again, all the votes are roll-call votes.
Yesterday the President said that he was going to examine whether it was in fact possible for the IND/DEM Group to ask for roll-call votes.
Am I to understand that it is possible, and that from now on all our votes will be roll-call votes?
Mr Matsakis, it will be discussed at the Conference of Presidents tomorrow but what I would say is that this is an important vote, so it is probably in all our interests that it is by roll-call vote.
Mr Bonde has asked for the floor.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I had asked for the floor before.
Our voting yesterday went very well.
It was quicker than normal - smooth, calm and there was not a single request for the time-consuming and irritating check.
Therefore my group proposes we should continue with electronic voting.
Some six months ago I was promised an exercise where the numbers of the reports and the numbers of the amendments would be shown alongside our voting.
The new, much bigger screens can show the full voting list and save us much more time because we can vote immediately when we see the numbers in different colours on the screen.
We will not need to wait for the interpretation.
We will avoid the situation where those waiting for interpretation through a relay are voting on one issue while those who vote without relay are voting on the next item.
We would save a lot of time.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Bonde, we have noted that.
Work is ongoing on that project, but now I think the House would like to move on with this morning's vote.
3. (
- Before the vote:
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise a point of order: without wishing to interfere with the procedure, I would like to know if there is a rule by which it is compulsory each time to state, as well as the result, the number of voters, the number of abstentions and so on, or whether this is your own choice.
If you do not wish me to tell you I will not, but it is, clearly, good to be certain.
- After the vote on paragraph 60:
Madam President, could you at least put the results on the screens in front of us if you are not going to call them out?
You just have to raise your eyes if you wish to see the result.
- After the vote:
Madam President, I am advised by the services that each additional roll-call vote costs EUR 400, which makes the cost of yesterday's escapade in excess of EUR 25 000.
So, I would ask those who are calling for roll-call votes all the time whether they think that is a good use of taxpayers' money.
Madam President, if the cost of every roll-call vote is really EUR 400, I suggest that this Chamber is running itself with all the efficiency that it also applies to the common agricultural policy, to structural aid, to international development and to the rest of the European Union budget.
Surely we can do it more cheaply than that!
Madam President, here is a practical suggestion.
One of the expenses is that we translate votes, but these are only numbers, so we need only one edition of the votes.
We do not need to put them into every language because we are dealing with numbers, and the names are the same in every language.
So we can cut expense there.
I think of all the bits of paper we produce in this Parliament.
The most important thing for the citizen is to know how we vote.
(Applause)

- After the vote:
President of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Madam President, I wanted to intervene after the vote on the Lechner report.
I did not want to interrupt the voting, but I merely wanted to thank the PPE-DE Group for supporting the common position so that we now have a very strong majority, which will be a very good signal to both consumers and businesses that we intend to open up the market and protect consumers.
Madam President, I know that you have taken a very active role in this dossier and I think it is a credit to all the parties that we just got a tremendous majority in the end after many doubts and reservations.
Voting time
The next item is the vote.
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
Madam President, as someone who has followed, through the Committee on Budgetary Control, a number of the Court of Auditors' reports concerning misappropriations and fraudulent spending of monies from the agriculture budget, I must say how pleased I am to see this Parliament welcoming new technology in many different ways, especially in this field of agriculture.
I hope that in future years this information - as one of the amendments in this report suggested - can be spread via the internet to all those people across the European Union who would like to see it, especially to the various national audit authorities in each Member State so they can see, for example, if in Greece they are claiming more acreage for olive-producing land than they actually have.
I am also standing up because I want to talk about the Constitutional Treaty.
I want to make sure that this House gets a say and that people get a referendum in the future, and that is why I am giving explanations of votes on all reports.
Madam President, it may not be obvious why, as a representative of London, I am giving an explanation of vote on a matter concerning farming and the common agricultural policy.
But we have to recognise that the common agricultural policy also affects consumers right across the EU in the form of higher prices.
Therefore it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that we are monitoring how taxpayers' money is spent in a number of areas, including the common agricultural policy.
I understand that, in response to the common agricultural policy management needs, there is considerable need for information on land use, and that is why I think we all welcome the use of better technology.
I hope that many of my constituents will benefit in terms of providing that technology.
I also have to agree with my colleague that one of the reasons I am giving an explanation of vote is because the people of Europe and the people of Britain should be given a say on the Constitutional Treaty in the form of a referendum.
I would like to remind colleagues that we are taking explanations of vote on the reports concerned.
If anybody tries to speak about anything else, I am afraid I will stop your speech, in accordance with the Rules.
Madam President, I will with pleasure speak on the report itself.
The Graefe zu Baringdorf report, explaining as it does the new methods to address fraud and agrarian policy under the common agricultural policy (CAP), is dealing with one of the most inefficient, expensive, wasteful, bureaucratic and amoral systems of farm support known to man, and no amount of agro-meteorological gimmickry can rescue it.
Extrapolate from the experience of the CAP; infer from it.
Before handing new powers to any organisation, we should first look at how it exercises the powers it already controls.
Agriculture has been, since 1960, the European Union's chief competence.
Look at the mess it has made - the ecological destruction, the destruction of surpluses, the poverty inflicted on Africa.
Is this the institution that we now want to put in charge of foreign policy, of criminal justice, of defence, and if it is, should we not consult the people in the referendums that we were promised?
The Elder Cato is supposed to have ended every speech, whatever its subject, with the demand that Carthage be destroyed.
I shall end mine with the demand that the Lisbon Treaty be put to the people: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
Madam President, I do not think any of us should be unduly concerned about new technology, but it is important that it is properly used and not abused.
But there is much abuse, particularly in southern Europe in regard to the common agricultural policy, and I trust this technology may do something towards eliminating this.
If it does, we could save much more than the EUR 400 that someone complained about when it comes to bringing transparency to voting.
I note that this report talks about remote sensing.
Well, I would also say this: if Europe could get a sense of democratic sensing, then it would sense across Europe a great resentment at the shutting out of citizens and the denying to them of the right to express their opinion on the most important matter, namely the matter of how they should be governed.
Madam President, the common agricultural policy is a leftover from the 20th century.
We are seeing more and more demand for agricultural products driven by demographics and biofuels.
The idea that we as the European Union should spend a large part of our budget on subsidising agricultural production is, quite simply, out of date and, therefore, there is no reason why we need better technology to do the wrong thing.
We should stop doing the wrong thing.
I have to say that I voted in favour of this measure as a loyal Conservative following the whip, but I did so with great reluctance.
In addition, I have to question the right of this House - the democratic legitimacy of this House - to adopt this measure and any other measure given that we reject the verdict of the people on the Lisbon Treaty.
Madam President, I sense that this measure of remote sensing would actually be very efficient with regard to cutting out the bureaucracy that some of my farmers in the South East of England have to suffer at present with regard to tagging.
If this mechanism is to work properly, I recognise that it would be more efficient in the operation of the extremely inefficient bureaucratic system which we recognise as the CAP.
So in that regard, as a loyal Conservative, I followed the whip and supported this measure.
However, I recognise that an overhaul of the complete CAP system is long overdue and I call upon our colleagues in this Parliament who recognise the same thing to accelerate that process.
I do, however, sense - and I feel - that if we can remote sense cows, why do we not remote sense the people's views about the referendum?
Madam President, I am very happy to rise to explain my vote on the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, where I voted against it.
I did so because any kind of remote-sensing apparatus is bound to lead to longer-distance surveillance.
Where will that end?
We do not wish the people of Europe to be surveyed by some kind of remote sensor - cameras in the sky - because that is exactly what the Graefe zu Baringdorf report will lead to by extension.
Is this, we have to ask ourselves, an excuse to give work for the Galileo project, the enormous expense of which, if not used there, would have paid for all the roll-call votes in this House for the next ten years?
If the EU wants to survey anything, let it survey the wishes of the people of Europe and hold a referendum on the new Constitution signed in Lisbon, without delay.
Madam President, I know you actually share our views on this referendum because I know you personally want one yourself, because it would give legitimacy to this place.
But leaving that political difference aside, I - happily - am not a Conservative, therefore I do not have to vote blindly for complete nonsense.
I can vote with common sense, and I voted against the Baringdorf report because I find the whole idea of the spy in the sky and satellites deeply distasteful and extremely frightening.
I think it can only lead to long-term abuse.
It is bound to happen - and I know our lady friend down here, who is all motherhood and apple pie, thinks it is absolutely wonderful - but of course we have got to look at the next generation.
I am afraid I have a deep distrust of politicians.
If they can abuse a power, they always do, and I see this as being absolutely no different, so I voted against.
Madam President, I should like to explain why I voted against the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
The CAP has done nothing but ruin our farming industry in the UK for well over 30 years; we do not want interference from the EU; this will extend their interference yet again.
So the reason for voting against it is that we would like to get the powers of running our own agriculture back to Britain.
However, there is very little chance of that while we ignore the votes of the people in France and Holland in the referendum that we should be given on the Constitution.
- (CS) I would like to stress that I voted for the report on consumer credit, because I think that the report is a step in the right direction.
I am pleased that we have managed to tame the regulatory enthusiasm of the Commission and the Council for more detailed legislation, which, in my opinion, is not desirable.
There are differences between the Member States as result of their diverse law traditions and cultures of financing and an attempt to erase these differences by force will not, in my opinion, lead to success.
Therefore, it is good that the European Parliament has focused on the basic elements: principles of harmonisation of consumer credit (here I would like to stress the right to cancel an agreement and the option of early repayment without a financial penalty for the consumer).
I consider a two-week deadline for withdrawal from an agreement by either of the parties to be necessary for the legal certainty of all the parties involved.
At the same time it is important to ensure that in the case of a linked credit agreement this deadline may be reduced to three days at the request of the consumer.
It will enable consumers to take earlier possession of the product purchased.
I think that a provision that guarantees that early repayment of credit cannot harm consumers is more than sufficient.
The Member States will be obliged to integrate this provision into their national legislation and consumer interests will thus be protected.
(SK) Madam President, I have voted for the Council common position, which was amended by the Kurt Lechner report.
After more than six years of legislative work, the directive on consumer credit agreements is a significant step forward in the protection of contractual freedom and encourages responsible decision-making by consumers.
It is necessary to bear in mind that a large number of regulations does not automatically mean greater consumer protection.
A deluge of information can cause greater confusion precisely in the case of an inexperienced consumer and the objective of simplicity and transparency is missed.
In addition, it entails higher costs, which are in the end passed on to the consumer.
In spite of continuing interest in buying on credit and in spite of the use of consumer credit products, very few consumers are aware of the risks connected with consumer credit, for example that in the event of illness or loss of job they might not be able to pay.
I believe that this directive will help consumers to make the correct decisions on the basis of a quick and simple process of being able to compare more offers from domestic, as well as foreign, providers.
Madam President, on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection where this report has been gestating for a long period of time in both readings, it is well known that I have had some severe criticism of it from its early stages where it was confusing new products that are available in one market - such as the UK market, such as mortgages where you can offset your credit balance with the same bank against your mortgage - which under initial proposals would have been banned in this report, to where we have now, after six years, new concerns - even though we have been talking about this report for six years - about the early repayment of credit costs.
This is an amazingly important piece of legislation.
It will affect huge numbers of people including anyone that owns a home in my constituency.
I was talking about it in a Conservative meeting in the village of Harpole at the house of a man called Michael Orton-Jones who raised it with me personally, about the consumer credit directive and the money-laundering directives that are passed in this House.
We have got to be much more careful in the way that we deal with this sort of very important legislation.
Madam President, I represent London, the greatest city in the world, which happens to be home to Europe's two largest financial districts: firstly, the City of London, which, as we all know, is the pre-eminent financial force in the world, and, secondly, the Docklands - Canary Wharf - which used to trade in all manner of goods all over the world, and now it trades in financial services all over the world.
I think it was that great group of Swedish philosophers who said: 'Money, money, money, I work all day, I work all night to pay the bills I have to pay, ain't it sad.
But in my dreams I have a plan.
I'll get myself a wealthy man.'
In my case that is not going to be true, because I do not happen to subscribe to that particular taste.
But what I will say is that it is important for consumers right across Europe that we continue to look at ways to make it easier to have access to consumer credit, not only for my constituents in London but also for the financial services industry.
Mr Kamall, I am trying to take this very seriously, but I hope it is not going to degenerate into the radio programme Just a Minute that we know so well in the UK.
(Laughter)
Madam President, one minute without repetition, deviation or - what was the other one?
Hesitation!
Quite so.
Let us start, then, from first principles.
Why does the European Union need to have a policy on the harmonisation of consumer credit laws?
There seems to me to be a contextual misunderstanding behind this report.
Free trade and open markets do not require common laws on every aspect of commercial activity.
In fact, if anything, the opposite is true.
Free markets depend upon diversity, variety, pluralism and, although a degree of light regulation at national level may sometimes be in order, that does not equate to euro-harmonisation of every aspect of market activity.
This is important because it seems to me that the same conceptual error lies behind the extension of EU jurisdiction in the various fields proposed in the Lisbon Treaty.
As in the field of consumer protection, so in the fields of justice and home affairs, foreign affairs, defence and all the rest.
If these areas are to be transferred largely or wholly to Brussels, we ought at least to have the courtesy to consult our constituents first.
The Treaty of Lisbon should be put to the people: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
Madam President, harmonisation, as we all know, has been a primary tool of the EU since its inception.
It has reached into every facet of our lives and it is quite clear that it is a strategy - a strategy, of course, to diminish the relevance and the import of national decisions and the ability to take national decisions and thereby diminish national institutions.
So it has been the modus operandi of intensifying European integration and it is something therefore which I come to with quite a hostile attitude.
Because fundamentally I believe in the right of Member States to govern within their boundaries that which affects their citizens.
There is one aspect of harmonisation we could help on.
We could harmonise giving to the citizens of Europe the right to have their say on the Lisbon Treaty.
Madam President, I think it is relevant when making an explanation of vote actually to say how we voted.
In my case I voted in favour of this measure, again as a loyal Conservative, again following the whip and again, had I been left to make my own decision, I would have voted against it, for the reasons very clearly set out by some of my colleagues, particularly Mr Hannon's reference to free markets requiring diversity.
Madam President, I can ask the honourable Member if he can give way to me.
I just wondered if he could maybe re-assess his comments because, this being a second reading report, there was a ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Sorry, but we will have the explanation of vote from Mr Helmer.
Each speaker has one minute in which to give an explanation of vote.
Mr Helmer, please continue.
Madam President, I agree that credit should be a matter for national governments to decide, subject to local custom and practice.
The amount of credit taken across borders is not sufficient to justify harmonisation, but may I suggest that the European Union itself is running out of credit with citizens because it refuses to take the necessary action, through referendums, to legitimise itself?
Madam President, this reminds me of my days in the House of Commons.
If this report in the slightest way could have helped Mr Brown and this inept Labour Government back home not to have had the Northern Rock crisis, if this report had been in any way useful in teaching this Labour Government back home how to run an economy, well, I might have said this report is a good one.
But, being a loyal Conservative I had to support it; I followed the whip.
But if we talk about credit, credit means trust, and if the European Union cannot trust its citizens and the citizens of Europe cannot trust the European institutions, is that why we are not going for a referendum?
Because we do not trust our citizens to decide in the right way?
Madam President, I voted in this report in order to help Member States and I therefore pick out these bits: Amendment 46, split vote - Member States' own laws may not be waived.
I voted for that and I am glad to see that I was supported.
I voted for Amendment 9, part 1 - extending areas in which an obligation shall not apply.
I am sorry to see that failed.
I voted for Amendment 29, where it states that compensation must be according to national law.
I am sorry to see that failed as well.
I voted, therefore, in order to help Member State governments, but that should not be read to mean that I want a Member State government to interfere in the affairs of finance houses and banks.
As my colleague Mr Deva pointed out, they are signally ill-equipped to do so.
In the case of Northern Rock, they have spent half the Treasury money on trying to rescue it, and who knows if that is at an end.
What we know is at an end are the referendums on the Lisbon Treaty, and that should not be so.
Madam President, I have a confession to make.
I have absolutely no qualifications whatsoever for this job and yet I find myself sitting here helping to make legislation that affects around 400 million people.
When I look around the full Chamber, I fear that very many of the Members share my lack of qualifications, looking at the level of debate we seem to get here.
The people, the citizens of the Member States, have an enormous amount of intelligence collectively, yet we deny them the right to make their own decisions.
In my view, this is in an area that politicians should keep well out of and give the people their own decisions; in particular, please let them have a referendum on the EU Constitution.
- (MT) I wish to briefly explain the manner in which I voted in order to attract the attention of the Maltese authorities.
I would like to draw attention to two cases in particular.
Firstly, the case of the Gozitan boy, Mr Attard's son, which attracted media attention in the last two years because of the way in which his father suffered prejudice by being denied his paternal rights as a father figure and bringing the child to live in his country, Gozo.
Secondly, the recent criminal case of a 13-year-old girl, in which the authorities did not know where to send her; she was sent first to prison, and then to a mental institution.
This is a grave failure.
Thank you.
- (DE) Madam President, I speak on behalf of the ÃVP-Europa-Club [Austrian People's Party European Club].
We have blackballed all articles that include the right to sexual and reproductive health, because the interpretation of this text can also, of course, be used to terminate pregnancies at any point in time and we are against this.
We voted in favour of Article 127 on the headscarf ban, because young people should not be encouraged to wear political symbols and because we want to guarantee that freedom to vote and freedom of choice continue to be safeguarded for young people.
We also voted in favour of Article 116, but this does not mean that mandatory legal consequences would be derived from it.
Madam President, I came to this report actually with some trepidation, because I am always aware that many of these reports call for an extension of powers in this place that we do not actually have already.
In my constituency I represent a town called Rothley in Leicestershire, which is where the McCanns live.
They have been very active in calling upon this Parliament to be more active in holding registers of missing children and various other matters.
I also represent in the town of Northampton a new charity called 'KidsAid' founded by a gentleman called David Mackintosh, who again had strong opinions that most of this report was actually very, very good.
However, as is always the case in this House, political correctness took over, and you look at amendments 162, 163 and 164 and you see how this place tries to extend its powers.
There is a motto which is used around this place: if you do not succeed, redefine success.
It is what you have done on the Lisbon Treaty, and I very much hope that the people in my constituency get to have a say on that.
Madam President, I rise to offer an explanation of vote on the Angelilli report 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child'.
I note in the explanatory statement that the rapporteur says she 'wishes to point out that the aim of this report is not to draw up a list of problems to be resolved or rights to be taken into account as a matter of priority'.
I represent a constituency, London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world, and there are a number of children in my constituency.
In fact, I am the father of two children and, as the great philosopher once said, I believe that children are our future.
Therefore, it is important that we do take account of the rights of children.
But I really have to question whether this should be done at EU level.
Let us look, for example, at whether we want young adolescents to be given information and education on that dirty word 'sexual and reproductive rights'.
I think we should be very careful in looking for local solutions - and give the people of Britain a say on a referendum on the Constitution.
Madam President, Disraeli once replied to a delegation with the phrase 'to the liberalism that they profess, I prefer the liberties we enjoy, to the rights of man, the rights of Englishmen'.
Our national tradition of rights is not merely different from the European conception of universal entitlements; it is incompatible.
We point to specific liberties, ones at specific moments guaranteed in specific charters, whether Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights or in simple statute acts; we do not put our faith in universalist human rights codes interpreted by judges for whom we cannot vote.
I have to say, our tradition has had more success than that pursued by some of the continental states which have taken the universalist path.
We have not fallen, as other countries have, either to revolution or to dictatorship.
We believe that all rights are residual in the individual.
As Aldous Huxley once put it, 'liberties are not given, they are taken'.
That is why I fundamentally oppose the incorporation of the EU Charter in the Lisbon Treaty without a referendum.
The people must be consulted: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
Madam President, there are serious issues here and there are serious moral issues.
Certainly my vote was motivated in great measure by consideration of some of those.
I find portions of this report offensive.
I find it offensive to take the position that one must impose upon children what someone perceives to be, in their view, the reproductive rights for adolescents that we find in recital L and in paragraphs 162, 163 and 164 etc.
It does seem to me wrong and inappropriate to have foisted upon one society ideological and morally prejudicial values which might be at variance with the established ethical outlook of a particular region.
It is that which I fundamentally object to and, as Mr Hannan has said, it is that which the Charter will bring to us more and more.
That is why I want my citizens to be able to agree or disagree.
Madam President, I voted against this measure.
For the first time we come to an item where the Conservative whip was a free vote and I took advantage of that freedom.
I agree very much with what my colleagues have already said.
This measure contains much that I agree with: it contains a great deal of motherhood and apple pie, and we all agree with motherhood and apple pie.
But, on the other hand, it proposes that we provide sex education for children in order to reduce teenage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
It is my experience that if you tell children about something and teach them how to do it, the first thing is that they want to go out and do it, and we should not be surprised if they do!
We hear far too much about adolescent reproductive rights and not about reproductive responsibilities.
We should be more responsible in our approach to children, and it should be exercised by parents and locally.
In conclusion, I believe that, before we go ahead with this, we should have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
Madam President, I am very disappointed by this report and I have to say, taking advantage of the free vote, I voted against much of the report.
This report is not about the rights of children.
It is about the right of children to have sex and the right of children to have abortions, which I find quite difficult to accept.
But what about the rights of children and their parents to decide the future of Europe, and the future of the Lisbon Treaty, and the future of where we are going?
After all, all these institutions are not being built for us - they are being built for our children.
Are we going to ask what they and their parents feel and want to say about how Europe is going to develop?
No.
We shall decide, without any rights being conferred on them to tell themselves or us what their own destiny should be.
This is all wrong.
(Applause)
(NL) Madam President, just for the record, I voted against Mrs Angelilli's report.
This is not, of course, because I oppose children's rights - far from it.
Indeed, I welcome the fact that the report breaks a couple of this House's taboos, such as the taboo of structural violence against girls in the Muslim community.
The report even states - rightly, in my view - that the obligation for girls in the Muslim community to wear headscarves is detrimental to the development of their personalities.
Whilst I agree with all of this, I voted against this report, as it is a further example of enormous European interference.
I believe that all these matters can be dealt with better at national level and that Europe has precious little to do with it.
I would like to give a single example.
This report argues very strongly against prison sentences for minors, whereas in my country there is a broad popular consensus in favour of imprisoning even those serious criminals who are underage to encourage them to mend their ways.
(SK) Madam President, we need to keep renewing our knowledge throughout our working life, not only during our years at school.
Education is important for personal growth and better employment opportunities.
As companies assess the need for new qualifications and the requirements of the labour market, adult education will adapt to these requirements, thus helping to overcome the discrepancies in the labour market.
All this is taken into account in the Commission's proposal for an adult education action plan, and therefore I have voted in favour of it.
I agree that the EU Member States should help adult education by adopting active measures, motivating citizens to educate themselves and employers to provide suitable conditions for education.
There should be economic stimulus in the form of grants, tax allowances, contributions or cofinancing.
For this purpose a more active use of the Structural Funds, and the European Social Fund in particular, is necessary too.
I feel that it is exceptionally important for older people to get involved in lifelong learning and thus find a place in the labour market.
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Pack report, since one of the purposes of lifelong learning is to increase the flexibility of the labour market.
For people over 50, which also concerns me, such a policy creates a wider range of opportunities to react to changes in the labour market and adapt to the situation without major repercussions.
The report emphasises the positive effect of lifelong learning on social inclusion and employability, which in any case should not be disregarded in an ageing society, for example in my home country, Estonia.
- (DE) Madam President, Mrs Pack's report on 'Adult Education: It is never to late to learn' is in my opinion one of the most important programmes of action in the European Union: the motivation to take part in adult education programmes, the learning of foreign languages, the motivation to complete tertiary education and with it the chance of having better job opportunities and therefore a better income, as well as the opportunity for better integration of immigrants.
It is particularly important for women, however, that the relevant framework programmes for child care are available here.
In particular we must also pay great attention to the possibility of exchanging knowledge between the generations.
For this reason the ÃVP-Europa-Club was happy to approve this report.
- (CS) (Beginning of the speech not audible) ... the introduction to this report on adult education clearly emphasises the attention paid to life-long learning in all the EU institutions.
However, the accumulation of documentation, kind words, appeals and supporting votes, including my own, are not enough.
Let us encourage the educational institutions to get really conceptually involved in life-long learning.
This process must not be seen as some sort of appendix to traditional education, but should become a full part of the education system.
That requires substantial changes.
This process could, therefore, represent a significant financial burden for each country, which could be a limiting factor in the development of education.
When considering where to direct funds when adjusting the funding for individual EU policies, this sphere - and in particular the universities as the natural centres of learning - should not be forgotten.
Madam President, this report is entitled 'Adult education: it is never too late to learn'.
I wish the European Commission and those who want the Lisbon Treaty to go through would learn from that statement themselves.
Adult education is one of the most important parts of the education system.
Lifelong learning is something that I think most in this House will agree is a very good thing.
We all had amazing teachers when we were at school and we all remember them.
I had a brilliant mathematics teacher who taught me there were three kinds of people: those who can count, and those who cannot.
I had a brilliant science teacher who taught me that radioactive cats had 18 half lives.
But the most important thing is, I guess, a phrase that you will recognise, a phrase that the youth of today are using more and more.
'We don't need no education; we don't need no thought control'.
What we are doing with the Lisbon Treaty is putting another 'brick in the wall' between the voters who put us here and the European elites who abuse them.
Madam President, I should just like to acknowledge how patient you have been during these explanations of vote.
Thank you very much for laughing at some of the jokes as well.
You may be aware that I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world.
In London there are a number of educational institutions.
I myself went to school in London; I went to the London School of Economics to do my Master's course.
However, what I would like to say in regard to this particular explanation of vote is that we should not underestimate the role of the further education sector in lifelong learning.
In particular, there are some very excellent institutions: Bromley College, with its excellent head, Peter Jones - I would like to put that on record - and Westminster College.
We all deserve a say on the referendum on the Constitution.
I could return the flattery and say that up until now I thought we were doing quite well, but it is beginning to get a little repetitive.
Madam President, may I add my thanks, alongside those to yourself, to your staff and to the interpreters for patience and good humour.
Let me ask what any of this has to do with Brussels?
Under what Treaty article, indeed under what possible consideration of common sense is adult learning an EU competence?
Most of us accept that there is a case for multi-state initiatives to deal with plainly cross-border issues; I can accept that argument - or at least an argument for a coordinated European strategy on, let us say, pollution or tariff reduction, perhaps elements of aviation and so on.
Although, even here, European coordination does not equate to EU jurisdiction.
But, adult learning?
Surely this, of all fields, is one that ought to be determined by national electorates through their own proper democratic mechanisms and procedures.
Why do we always assume that the gentleman in Brussels knows better than the ordinary voter?
That same unlovely assumption lies behind the EU Constitution, now called the Lisbon Treaty, and that is why we should put that Treaty to the people: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
Madam President, there is much of apple pie and motherhood about this report.
But the fundamental importance of it is this: it signifies and typifies a belief that Brussels has a right to set agendas and to dictate to Member States how they should prioritise issues and expenditure that quite patently are within their own domain and should be exclusively so, because any region has the right to decide within its limited budget what its priorities are.
If adult learning and increased expenditure is a priority, it should be so decided by that region or that nation, not by Brussels and not because of Brussels but because it is right for those circumstances in itself.
We all learn - I have learnt much since I came here in 2004.
What I have learnt most is the utter contempt in which the European elite hold their citizens and that is why they are denying the citizens the fundamental right of a vote.
Madam President, I can tell you that, on this occasion, I voted against the measure, but I also voted in line with the Conservative whip, and this time I did so with a good will because I would have intended to vote against it anyway for the reasons that have been so clearly set out by my friends and colleagues, especially by Mr Hannan and Mr Allister.
This is nothing to do with the European Union.
I am in favour of education.
I am in favour of adult education.
I am absolutely against Brussels deciding how it should be done.
Like Mr Hannan, I am unable to work out any basis in the Treaties on which it should be done.
We have no legitimacy in terms of the Treaties for passing a measure like this.
We equally have no legitimacy in the face of the rejection of the Constitution in France and in Holland for passing the same measure.
We should now have referendums across the European Union on this question.
Madam President, on a point of order, could I, being an adult and having had some education, ask Mr Hannon, who has, obviously, greater education than I, what his Latin expression means?
I am sure he will tell you after we have closed the sitting!
Madam President, this has been one of the liveliest debates in this European Parliament since its inception.
Had we done this before we might have had the television cameras here and our constituents might find out what we are doing instead of these boring, turgid things we do day in, day out.
Let me now turn to adult learning.
It is never too late to learn, it says.
This surely is a matter for subsidiarity: it is up to the nation states to decide what their priorities are.
It is surely not for the Brussels Commission, surely not for the European Parliament to decide whether adult learning is imperative or not!
But it also says - does it not? - that it is never too late to learn, and surely one of the things we need to learn very fast is that we cannot divide the people of Europe from their decision-makers.
We must enjoin them on how we want to run the European Union and, therefore, we must have a referendum.
Madam President, I voted against this measure and I did so primarily because, you see, I am a schoolmaster.
This measure without doubt leads directly, by linkage, to the European Qualifications Framework, which is a hijack.
It is going to get people to study at their traditional universities, take their qualifications there, and then overstamp them with a new document with the EU logo, the EU crest, the EU motto, with no reference to the great university or college from which they got their learning.
That is a distinct and very terrible denial of a seat of learning - and I make that remark for all the universities of Europe and not just those famous ones in Britain.
To get back to the question of adult learning, I have a suggestion to make to you.
Let us by all means encourage adult learning.
Give every adult in the EU a copy of the Lisbon Treaty and then ask them to vote on it.
Madam President, yes, I voted against this report.
My explanation is that the UK Independence Party supports the return of the grants system for the UK, and I would like to point out that it is our membership of the EU that caused it to be abolished in England and Wales in the first place.
However, it is up to Member States, and not the EU, to decide on tax incentives and cuts for employers who cooperate with adult learning.
As with most things, we need less interference from the EU, not more.
As I see that I am very well within my time, may I add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate.
Time, but not your subject.
(NL) Madam President, I voted against the Pack report; not, of course, because I oppose lifelong learning.
On the contrary, no one in their right mind would doubt the great importance of adult education in our constantly changing world.
I do think, however, that Europe, and first and foremost the European Commission, should not interfere too much in what is a competence of the Member States.
This is not just a matter of common sense; it is also inherent in the principle of subsidiarity that is always being lauded here but in practice is increasingly proving to be a dead letter.
- (DE) Madam President, I should like to make a verbal declaration regarding the very good Angelilli report on the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
The radical treatment of the issues of child prostitution and sex tourism is particularly important.
The victims of these criminal offences can also be found in our own backyards.
In the border area between Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, for example, prostitution involving women and increasingly children increased enormously after the opening of the borders.
However, no attention was paid to this subject at EU level for a long time.
Problems central to child prostitution, such as the networking of perpetrators through the Internet and the lack of cooperation regarding cross-border surveillance and law enforcement, can only be combated at European level.
The report deals with these areas and incorporates them into a comprehensive strategy.
Even though there is still a great deal to be done to combat child abuse, this is an encouraging sign.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution on the report by my German fellow Member Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf and on the proposal for a regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the Commission in 2008-13 making use of the remote-sensing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy.
I support the proposal that the remote-sensing activities should be financed by a proper budget and not by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF).
Though my fellow members believe the focus should be more on improving the existing website of the EU's Joint Research Centre Agriculture Unit so that all relevant research data can be made freely available to the public, I am very much in favour of the creation of a spatial data infrastructure and a website as the European Commission's objectives propose.
I support the proposals to create an inventory of all spatial data, remote-sensing and agro-meteorological projects, and to consolidate the existing spatial data infrastructure and websites.
in writing. - (PT) The European Commission considers that, in order to provide a response to common agricultural policy management needs, there is considerable need for information on land use, land conditions and crop conditions.
It has therefore presented remote sensing as a research method to gain easier access to the information contained in conventional agricultural statistics and forecasting systems.
The proposal took account of a pilot project on remote-sensing techniques, under the auspices of Council Decision No 1445/2000/EC, initiated in the meantime.
According to the Commission, this project enabled the agro-meteorological system for forecasting yields and monitoring land and crop conditions (MARS) to reach an advanced stage.
Now the Commission is proposing the continued application of remote-sensing techniques in agriculture for the period 2008-2013, in the field of monitoring agricultural markets.
The project will apply from 1 January 2008 for a six-year period.
The remote-sensing applications would thus constitute a tool for the Commission to implement and monitor the common agriculture policy, although the information could be useful to the Member States.
The question is how it will be used and who will be using it, hence our abstention.
in writing. - (PT) While I am in broad agreement with the European Commission's proposal, I am voting in favour of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report since it makes some relevant points.
I understand, for example, the rapporteur's concern over the impossibility of comparing data between different Member States owing to the different frequency of analyses.
I still approve of the creation of an inventory and consolidation of spatial data infrastructure and the relevant websites, and the improvement of the Agriculture Unit's website to make the data public.
in writing. - (SV) We vote against this report because, as usual, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament seeks to introduce amendments aimed at transferring more money from the EU budget to the agricultural policy.
Amendment 4 from the Committee on Agriculture proposes that EUR 9.2 million be set aside in a separate budget instead of being channelled through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.
We can only interpret that as a way of securing budget increases.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report.
I feel that the prolongation of any proposal seeking to contribute to making the Common Agricultural Policy more precise in its distribution can only be a positive step to ensure a fair deal for Scottish farmers.
The ability to more accurately estimate yields and make related information more freely available will allow for the improvement of a policy that so far lacks an image of fairness, transparency and environmental sensitivity.
in writing. - (FR) Based on the excellent report by my German colleague Kurt Lechner, I approve the adoption by the European Parliament, at second reading of the codecision procedure, of a legislative resolution on the Council common position for adopting a directive on the harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning credit for consumers and replacing the 1987 Community framework, amended on two occasions.
I welcome the European Commission's desire to establish the conditions for a genuine internal market in consumer credit, to guarantee a high level of consumer protection and to clarify Community regulations by recasting the three existing directives of 1987, 1990 and 1998 on this type of credit.
I welcome the important work done by my French colleague Jean-Paul GauzÃšs, who by the wisdom and strength of his convictions has made a substantial contribution to this important compromise, which is so valuable for economic growth, consumer protection and credit institutions.
in writing. - (FR) After five years of discussions, European consumers will soon have identical information about consumer credit, enabling them to make better comparisons with foreign offers when buying a car, a dishwasher or a sofa bed.
Although Europeans already have the ability to take out bank loans abroad to buy consumer goods, few use it: less than 1% of the total amount of this type of credit is currently borrowed abroad.
However, rates currently vary by up to 100% (Portugal 12%, Finland 6%)!
The major obstacles identified are the language barrier, distance and the lack of consumer confidence.
The directive, which I support, should help to increase this confidence, keep consumers better informed and facilitate their choices, while enabling them to benefit from uniform rules of protection (early repayment, right of withdrawal, etc.).
Two questions, to conclude:
Are we not in danger of encouraging people to take on too much debt if we do not further strengthen the conditions for lenders to check consumers' creditworthiness?
Do we not urgently need to open the way for cross-border competition in property loans?
This vote relates to the second reading of the proposal initially made by the European Commission in 2002.
These compromises are aimed at reaching agreement with the Council on a text that would repeal the current Directive 87/102/EEC and introduce a common legal framework for consumer credit agreements.
The idea is to facilitate the opening-up of national markets and to promote cross-border consumer credit operations, with the aim of stepping up competition and 'improving' the internal market.
Among other things, it lays down the formula for calculating the annual percentage rate of charge (APR), the conditions in the event of early repayment and information to be given to consumers regarding credit agreements.
We voted in favour of the proposals that are designed to offer better consumer protection, which is especially important in Portugal, where families' indebtedness is constantly on the rise, exceeding 124% of available income, and where the major financial groups are making scandalous profits.
We voted against all the proposals for facilitating the opening-up of financial markets and cross-border credit, designed to remove barriers to the entry of the major financial groups rather than to protect consumers.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report proposing the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on consumer credit.
Although European households already have the ability to take out bank loans abroad to buy consumer goods, few use it.
Problems of language, distance and lack of confidence are the biggest obstacles.
The new directive will increase the transparency of the market for the benefit of consumers for credit of between 200 and 75 000 euros.
Consumers will have the information they need to choose in full knowledge of the facts, if they decide to buy across borders.
In the case of credit offers, the information given to consumers will be contained in a new European credit information form.
Consumers will also eventually benefit from a single annual percentage rate comparable throughout the EU.
The directive will give consumers good quality basic information that is easy to compare.
The right of withdrawal and the right of early repayment without paying excessive costs, as well as the transparent presentation of their rights and obligations, will give them the confidence necessary to compare prices.
in writing. - (FR) The compromise on which Parliament must give its opinion is certainly an improvement on the position of the Council, but it is still deficient on many key points concerning consumer credit contracts.
The lower limit of 200 euros, the amount of credit from which the directive applies, is in my opinion much too low given the standard of living in most Member States.
Similarly, it is not necessary to harmonise the provisions governing compensation for early repayment.
The differences between the Member States are too great.
The 'compromise' negotiated by the Council is merely the addition of various national provisions, and introduces more complications than harmonisation.
In my opinion, the directive is much too bureaucratic, for companies, credit institutions and consumers.
The minimum amount of information it provides for is too great and too indigestible.
It is in danger of spreading confusion among well-informed consumers.
in writing. - (NL) The result of today's vote in the European Parliament means that, after a good five years, an agreement has been reached on the consumer credit directive.
The dialogue between the European Commission, the Council and Parliament was still fruitless at the end of last week, as the rapporteur had prohibitive objections to a compromise proposal concerning early repayment that all the other parties were prepared to accept.
The compromise subsequently reached between negotiators from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which was also acceptable to the European Commission and the Council, has today received broad support from Parliament.
I am pleased that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has now decided to support the compromise, as I am convinced that it represents the best that could be reached for consumers and industry.
I would like to thank everyone concerned, particularly the rapporteur, for their commitment throughout the process.
Consumer and housing loans in Greece have reached 95 billion euros: consumer credit is growing at the highest rate of any country in the Euro area, and is approaching the EU's annual budget total.
This is a sign of increasing poverty.
Two million households are borrowers, of which 3-4% are unable to service their debt.
In most cases the debt exceeds 40% of income, which results in constant repossessions by bailiffs.
The same is also true for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are forced to resort to borrowing.
The banks ruthlessly pocket enormous profits from high interest rates on loans and low interest rates on deposits, unlawful and irregular deductions and charges, misleading advertising, etc., leading to workers going ever further into the red.
The EU supports financial institutions by guaranteeing profits and by alleviating the consequences of its unpopular policy, which restricts the buying power of workers and decreases their quality of life.
The proposed directive safeguards the principle of the freedom to draw up contracts, despite unequal negotiating capacities.
It strengthens financial capital by transferring responsibility to the consumer.
It safeguards against compensation for early repayment, promotes the harmonisation of legislative provisions and the opening up of national markets in the consumer credit sector, and is deliberately complex and unintelligible for borrowers.
The Members from the ÎÎÎ (Communist Party of Greece) are voting against the strengthening of financial credit and campaigning for a genuine people's economy for the benefit of workers.
in writing. - The call for a harmonisation of the laws on consumer credit across Europe is one that I agree with.
The report not only creates an internal market in credit for consumers but also outlines a set of requirements to ensure a fair deal for both the consumer and creditors.
The rules in this area need to be consumer friendly, especially on the subject of early repayment and compensation, and in my opinion the report adequately addresses these concerns.
The harmonisation of advertising will also help ensure that customers across Europe are equally well informed when taking consumer credit related decisions.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the compromise the PSE Group reached with the Council (Amendment 46), because it allows the balances struck during the German Presidency last spring to be maintained.
I am pleased that the consumer credits defined in this draft directive have a minimum of 200 euros and a maximum of 75 000 euros.
However, I would have preferred the upper limit to be set at 50 000 euros.
I am particularly pleased about the qualified majority obtained in plenary to ensure that the interests of consumers are clearly protected in the event of early repayment of the credit.
The compensation banks may demand will be strictly controlled and may be prohibited for credits of less than 10 000 euros.
In any case, the fight against people taking on too much debt should remain a priority and resorting to credit should be done in a reasonable manner.
It is an illusion to think that you can revive consumption through credits to households: this approach leads only to poverty for the most vulnerable consumers.
The revival of growth through consumption is achieved by raising pay and not by increasing available credit!
in writing. - (FR) The report by Mr Lechner on opening up the European consumer loans market was adopted today.
It seems to me that changing a market that until now has been strongly national into a European market, while maintaining a high level of consumer protection, is the first step towards harmonising the rules on consumer credit.
The risk for consumers of getting into debt remains far too high.
Control and transparency by setting up databases of the creditworthiness of every consumer seems essential.
Like most of my colleagues, however, I voted against Amendment 29 on Article 16, and I am pleased it was rejected.
To my mind, this point genuinely penalised consumers who decide to repay their loan early.
Offering consumers the possibility of paying off a loan before its term constitutes a good initiative.
It should not be spoiled by giving the lender the option of claiming compensation for any costs where this is not fair or justified.
It was therefore necessary to set limits.
The lender will not therefore be able to claim compensation of more than 1% of the value of the credit.
in writing. - (PT) A common legal framework for consumer credit must lay down clear, simple and concise rules, so as to offer European added value with the aim of promoting the internal market.
Today, therefore, I would like to congratulate Parliament for the positive agreement reached on this legislation.
I regard the opening up of the national markets to consumer credit as very important since it will step up competition, with very positive consequences for consumers.
With this new proposal the EU is clearly favouring competition between financial institutions and is introducing the necessary transparency for the disclosure of pre-contractual and contractual information on the provision of credit, data which I regard as fundamental for consumer protection, and also possibly enabling interest rates to be reduced on account of the increased supply, especially on smaller markets.
The credit ceilings laid down under this agreement are also a very positive aspect for the Portuguese market.
I am convinced that the new framework will facilitate more credit opportunities, as there is currently a need to ensure proper protection for consumers and their creditworthiness, preventing excessive exposure to debt, in the context of a healthy social policy.
The advantages are to be benefited from and not for solving problems by creating new ones.
in writing. - (FR) It is a highly controversial directive, 'on ice' for almost six years, that the European Parliament passed today.
Yet, it is a text very close to the hearts of Europeans because it provides for the harmonisation of the consumer credit market.
This market is worth 800 billion euros (two out of three Europeans use credit to buy furniture, a television or a car), and interest rates currently vary from 6% (in Finland) to more than 12% (in Portugal), and yet transactions have so far been mainly national; less than 1% of credits are currently cross-border.
The directive opens up European borders to consumers looking for the best credit deals: they can choose the best offer and be guaranteed the same rights and the same standards of information, comparison and, above all, protection against getting into too much debt.
Assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower, free and fast information in the event of refusal and the 14-days right of withdrawal in principle are some of the main objectives of the directive.
However, one regret, and it is a big one, is the lack of clarity surrounding early repayment terms.
Heavily penalising consumers who repay early would make the other advantages of harmonisation completely pointless!
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Lechner report on consumer credit.
I believe that it is vital for the European Union to equip itself with a general reference framework designed to protect citizens in a sector which has grown significantly in recent years.
In Italy, in particular, growth in turnover in consumer credit agreements has been exponential.
Very often consumers, sometimes in the wake of seductive advertising campaigns, have entered into them without being fully aware of their rights and the contractual terms, and have then found themselves bound by a whole set of conditions and obligations.
Within this context I therefore stress the advisability of increasing consumer protection, including through this directive.
I am voting in favour of Kurt Lechner's report on the recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC.
I feel that the compromise reached during successive negotiations is satisfactory.
The solution proposed is aimed at simplifying the procedure for granting credit and making it easier for consumers to gain access to credit throughout the European Union.
Harmonisation and unification of standards will lead to enhanced competitiveness between the institutions that make credit available, will cut costs and will also create a true internal market in the sphere of consumer credit.
in writing. - (FR) The vote on the draft directive on consumer credit denotes significant progress in the eyes of French MPs from the UMP [Union pour un Mouvement Populaire/Union for a Popular Movement].
Indeed, thanks to the contribution made by the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, the final text encourages the opening of borders in an important area of daily life, while preserving the existing rights of consumers, notably French consumers.
The transposition of the directive will therefore make it possible to offer better credit conditions in future, and to limit the risk of people taking on too much debt.
in writing. - (FR) Six years after the arrival of the euro, Europe still did not have a single market in terms of banking that would benefit consumers and give them a more tangible experience of the advantages of the single currency.
Information about interest rates and credit terms and conditions will be standardised to make it easier to compare offers.
Consumers will thus be able to choose in full knowledge of the facts, and obtain the best credit terms.
Lenders will also have to give consumers clear information about the advantages and disadvantages of their credit offers.
The questions of the right of withdrawal in the case of linked credit (immediate delivery of the goods) and of the amount of the penalties imposed if the credit is repaid early are clearly framed.
These penalties must be 'fair and objectively justified'.
They may not exceed 1% of the amount of the credit repaid early and will not be permitted on loans at variable rates.
I am particularly pleased that the Member States can say, as is currently the case in France, that no compensation may be demanded for credits of less than 10 000 euros, and that is why I voted in favour.
in writing. - (SV) The moderates have voted in favour of the proposal for an EU strategy on the rights of the child.
We consider that children's rights must be respected in just the same way as human rights and, of course, we support action to combat such things as child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children.
We must emphasise, however, that many of the points in the report relate to fields which should be regulated on an intergovernmental basis, for example that of adoptions.
Besides, subjects are covered which are already regulated in existing EC legislation, such as TV advertising and product labelling.
in writing. - I voted for this report because I believe it makes a good contribution to the fight against all forms of violence and abuse against children, including poverty, discrimination and access to education.
I particularly welcome EP advocacy of a mechanism whereby suppliers of products manufactured with child labour can be prosecuted in Europe.
I too urge the Commission to urgently bring forward mechanisms that make the main contractor in a supply-chain liable for violations of UN conventions on child labour.
However, I deplore the attempts to remove references in the report to adolescents' right to sexual and reproductive health and family planning education and services.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Roberta Angelilli's report 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child' because it is important to draw attention to the fact that many instruments adopted at EU level directly or indirectly affect children's rights.
I therefore believe that it is essential to establish a legislative framework that recognises the rights of the child so that they can be codified in legal form.
In this context, this report makes an important contribution towards ensuring that the rights of the child are respected, in that it advocates Community legislation prohibiting all forms of violence against children, and stresses the importance of areas such as education, health, adoption, and combating poverty and discrimination.
I would also point out that the new Treaty of Lisbon provides a legal basis for the rights of the child, now included in the objectives of the European Union.
in writing. - (SV) Children's rights are without doubt universal and inviolable rights, and the Junilistan Members are pleased to note that all the EU Member States have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This means that we are already bound by international legislation for the protection of children against child labour, trafficking, violence and many other forms of interference in the lives of children.
Moreover children's rights are an area in Swedish law which uncompromisingly places the child's best interests in the forefront of consideration.
We have chosen to abstain in the vote on the report for the simple reason that the rapporteur seems to have failed in her report to focus attention on the child's best interests.
The report focuses almost exclusively on which specific social model the Member States should adopt in their respective countries in order to give effect to whatever the European Parliament thinks is the best solution.
Everything from banning violence on TV and the sale of violent computer games to forced marriages, illegal adoptions and illegal work is covered in this report.
Clearly we have voted in favour of the amendments which stress the importance of full compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as a guarantee of the legal protection and universal human rights of children.
in writing. - (PT) This report has almost 200 articles and includes some aspects we support and others which we do not.
Our vote should be understood in the light of that statement.
However, we should point out that the report fails to address the causes of situations that it sometimes diagnoses.
The report shirks its responsibilities by failing to criticise the EU's neoliberal policies, which underlie the poverty of millions of people, especially children.
These policies lead to deep and unacceptable social inequalities, caused by capitalist exploitation and concentration.
Policies that foster social strife, with the loss of value of workers' wages; easy dismissals and increasingly insecure contractual arrangements; longer and more flexible working hours and the liberalisation and privatisation of public services.
Policies that have profound adverse consequences on the efficiency and living conditions of workers and their families, and hence of their children.
The respect and full exercise of the rights of the child requires, among other things, a fair distribution of wealth, jobs with rights, decent wages, shorter working hours, development of strong public systems of social security, health and universal and free education.
in writing. - While I voted yes on this, I want to clarify my position on paragraph two of the report.
This states that the IGC decision of 19th October 2007 incorporating children's rights as one of the objectives of the EU in the Treaty of Lisbon provides a new legal basis for children's rights.
According to Commissioner Fratini's response to my question on this during the plenary debate, Lisbon does not bring in a specific legal base and it is important to clarify this.
Regarding paragraph 127 I am not supporting this as I do not support a ban on headscarves and hijabs.
in writing. - (DE) I should like to comment on the Angelilli report on the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
This is a very good report.
The radical treatment of the issues of child prostitution and sex tourism is particularly important.
The victims of these criminal offences can also be found in our own backyards.
In the border area between Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, for example, prostitution involving women and increasingly children increased enormously after the opening of the borders.
However, this subject was not a priority at EU level for a long time.
Problems central to child prostitution can only be combated at European level (the networking of perpetrators through the Internet and the lack of cooperation regarding cross-border surveillance and law enforcement).
The report deals with these areas and incorporates them into a comprehensive strategy.
Even though there is still a great deal to be done to combat child abuse, it is an encouraging sign.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because I believe it to be a comprehensive statement, full of good proposals.
I especially welcome the recognition of a child's right to be involved in decisions that concern them directly and for them to be properly represented in legal or administrative hearings.
The report is strong on the need for a healthy environment and the right to play.
It also recognises that those children with the legal right to work should be paid on a basis of equal pay for equal work: too many young people are used to provide a cheap alternative to other workers when they work as well and as hard in many sectors.
I voted to remove the paragraph referring to encouraging states to outlaw the wearing of the hijab for young girls.
I believe this to be a misplaced proposal of the Women's Committee, assuming the hijab to be an automatic sign of female subjugation, which it is not.
Personally, I am offended by seeing pre-pubescent girls wearing clothes with sexual invitations written on them but I would not seek to ban this via a Parliamentary report.
I am pleased the report passed without that paragraph.
in writing. - I strongly support the idea of a comprehensive and coherent European strategy on the rights of the child.
The fight against all forms of violence, poverty and discrimination suffered by children is something that should not simply be treated on a national level.
The protection of a child's right to education, health and adoption are all rights that Europe as a whole should continue to recognise and protect.
in writing. - (DE) Violence thrives in parallel societies with an ancient Islamic tradition.
Children let out the hatred instilled in them for the decadent Western culture in the school playground and on the street or even turn into potential terrorists.
We have ignored the preliminary warning signs out of a misconceived tolerance and refused to accept what was an explosive momentum.
The growth in child trafficking and pornography is also alarming; sex offenders, as is generally known, display a high reoffending rate.
The cover has also been blown in this regard on dubious adoption procedures for children from developing countries, procedures in which there has been no recoil from child trafficking, trade in human organs or prostitution.
In view of the multitude of orphans waiting for adoption, primarily in the East, and millions of unborn children in Europe, a strict ban on the adoption of non-European children would be a heavy blow against child trafficking, as would the introduction of a Europe-wide sex offenders register and greater penalties for sexual activity with children and for the possession of child pornography.
Last but not least, domestic violence must also be combated in migrant families and the proportion of foreigners in schools limited in order to defuse spiralling violence.
in writing. - While the Treaty of Lisbon sets the promotion of children's rights as a broad EU objective, it does not create new legislative powers for this purpose.
I believe that any movement in this field should be within the existing legal framework.
There are significant areas in this report which step outside these boundaries.
Nor is the report offering feasible solutions to children's problems.
One example is institutionalised care.
We have voted to restrict this to a temporary measure.
Yet hundreds of thousands of children throughout Europe are born with or acquire such significant physical or intellectual handicaps that it is a medical or social necessity for them to have long-term institutional care.
A quadriplegic, spina bifida or hydrocephalus afflicted child can have a life of dignity and happiness with expert staff care and family visits.
Strengthening the system is the priority, and not its abolition.
We in Europe are bound to follow the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This report distorts several important messages contained in the Convention.
With regret, therefore, I found myself unable to support this report, though I share the concern for children's welfare that its supporters expressed.
in writing. - (EL) This lengthy report, full of literary rhetoric, attempts to conceal the responsibility of the EU and its Member States for their barbaric policy, which results in the inhuman conditions experienced by children and parents of ordinary families.
How hypocritical that the EU should show interest in the rights of children while its policy is crushing workers with unemployment, partial employment, a fall in living standards, the privatisation of health and education, and the commercialisation of sport and culture.
The edifying references to combating violence against children, child pornography, etc. cannot conceal the fact that the system, whose overriding value is profit, treats children themselves as a source of profit.
It commercialises adoption and drives people into child labour, prostitution and organ trading.
How dare advocates of the EU talk about the rights of children, when EU/NATO aircraft actually bombed a Belgrade maternity clinic!
Let us remember that the European/NATO armed forces are killing thousands of children in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.
Let us remember that they are condemning hundreds of thousands of children in Africa, Asia, and across the planet to death from hunger and disease - crimes with regard to which the report remains utterly silent.
in writing. - (SK) Children are people with their own rights, from the very moment of conception.
