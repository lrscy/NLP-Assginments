Of course there is more work to be done, of course the European Union stands ready to make those points directly to Israel and to the Palestinian authorities, and of course the European Union stands ready to help in other ways if it can.
However, I would simply reiterate that, ultimately, the responsibility lies primarily with Israel and with the Palestinian authorities.
It is both a great test for them and also a great opportunity, for exactly the reasons the questioner set out.
Â Â  I agree with the last supplementary question and the answer given, and in that spirit note how idiotic it was to demand the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, as some did, or to talk about a boycott of universities in Israel.
This is completely counterproductive.
With reference to the desire to enlarge opportunities for Palestinians, to which the Presidency referred, can the President-in-Office give us any further encouragement about EU support for economic development in Gaza and enlighten us about suggestions that there could be an EU contribution to securing the borders of Gaza, particularly the border with Egypt?
Â Â  . I say to the honourable Member that, firstly, the issue of economic development is inextricably bound up with the issue of security.
The European Union is committed to continuing the enhanced support for the Palestinian civil policing through EU corps, in order to help build the necessary security environment in Gaza following Israeli withdrawal, so as to allow exactly the kind of economic development that is necessary.
We also welcome the agreement between the Governments of Israel and Egypt on basic security arrangements along the Gaza-Egypt border.
A resolution to the issue of the crossing point on the Rafah border is also needed and is essential to the fate of other crossings and issues such as the port and airport.
The European Union continues to be one of the biggest international donors to the Palestinian Authority.
Last year assistance to the Palestinians from the European Community amounted to some EUR 250 million.
That included assistance to refugees, food aid, the health and education sectors, the private sector, municipalities and institution-building.
The Commission has recently announced a larger package of support to the Palestinians and will provide around EUR 280 million in 2005.
That money includes a substantial contribution to help tackle the priorities identified by Mr James Wolfensohn.
The European Unionâs aim is to ensure that disengagement is a success and a step toward implementing the roadmap.
The Commission attaches strict conditionality to the budgetary assistance it has provided to the Palestinian Authority.
The conditions mainly reinforce the need for transparency of the Palestinian Authorityâs public finances, strengthening the prudent management of the budget and encouraging progress on overall financial and administrative reform.
Â Â  .
After the terrorist attacks in London on 7Â July 2005, the Council reiterated the urgent need for an EU instrument on retention of communications data, called for in the wake of the Madrid bombings, and made a commitment to agree to it by October 2005.
The draft framework decision tabled by four Member States in April 2004 does not aim at recording the content of any communication, but rather at the retention of so-called traffic data.
These data, such as the names of the persons connected with a phone call or the time of the communication, are necessary for law enforcement authorities effectively to investigate criminal offences and bring successful prosecutions in an age when criminals exploit the advantages of modern communications facilities.
The proposal for a directive on retention of traffic data, which the Commission adopted on 21Â September 2005, and which the Council considered in October, also concerns traffic data and not the content of communications.
A decision has yet to be made on whether the framework decision or directive is the appropriate legal base for such rules by the Council on data retention.
In the meantime, work will continue on the substance, in consultation, of course, with the Commission and the European Parliament.
At its meeting on 2Â July 2004, the Council stressed the need to give particular consideration to the proportionality of the measure in relation to costs, privacy and efficiency.
The Council aims at an instrument that balances law enforcement requirements with the right to privacy and costs, and which is compatible with Member Statesâ constitutions.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Minister, thank you for your reply, but following the conclusions of the legal service of the Council and bearing in mind the legal problems that will arise if this proposal is adopted within the framework of the third pillar and the information about the commitment of the Dutch Minister not to agree to a proposal within the framework of this pillar, when does the Council intend to withdraw its proposal?
Â Â  . The thinking, as set out by our own Prime Minister earlier in the course of meetings, is to try and secure agreement on the way forward in the course of the UK Presidency.
That suggests December as the opportunity when, under the scenario that we would wish to see, under pillar one, as our Home Secretary Charles Clarke has proposed, we can see progress being made in relation to this instrument.
I hope that directly answers the question because we continue to seek to find a basis under pillar one rather than under pillar three, as the question implied.
Â Â  As the President-in-Office has just said, Charles Clarke made the welcome decision for the European Parliament to now give its views on this proposal.
As the Parliament is now in the process of putting its view, could I ask the President-in-Office to take the safeguard argument seriously?
We accept the need for retention of data and we are looking at the timings now.
We are moving very much in the right direction, but we need concrete and collective safeguards.
Will he give an assurance that that aspect will be taken very seriously, because Parliament wants to see the Council treat that as a priority.
Â Â  . I should like to make a couple of points directly in reply to the points that the honourable Member has raised.
Firstly, the British Presidency is committed to securing agreement on the data-retention measure before the end of the year, as I said, and is taking forward work on substance in consultation with the Commission and European Parliament alike, which have made these points.
We remain committed, however, to the belief that retention of specific communications data for a fixed period is a proportionate reaction to the threat of terrorism and that the associated costs are not excessive.
On the specific point of the pillar under which we should make progress, it is important to add one point to the discussions that have taken place in Parliament today, and that is to say very honestly that I do not believe our citizens will care whether the measure is decided under the first or third pillar.
What we need is a proposal that can be agreed quickly and will allow for effective law enforcement without threatening the fundamental rights of European Union citizens.
On the specific point that the honourable Member raised, we agree that all retained data must be held securely in line with data protection principles and that information exchange must be accompanied by high standards of protection.
Police and other public authorities will not have unrestricted access to the retained data and will have to meet national standards to access private information.
The content of calls or messages â as I sought to suggest earlier â would not be retained.
It is merely a question of providers keeping records of who called whom, where and when.
This is part of striking the balance that we believe is necessary between protecting people from terrorism and serious crime and, on the other hand, respecting civil rights.
We believe, therefore, that our response must be proportionate and respect common democratic values.
We must defend our communities from the threat of attack while upholding human rights in accordance with international law and the ECHR.
For let us be very clear: the terrorists want to attack not only our lives but also our way of life.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Minister for his reply; I certainly share his concerns.
However, recently in Ireland an Irish citizen won an international lottery of some EURÂ 100Â million â I cannot remember the exact figure.
There was immediately something in the region of 60 hits on her private social security file and extra hits on her private taxation file, which the Revenue Commissioners are examining.
It seems to me that we need to take care to ensure that information within the public service is not actually used by terrorists as a source of intelligence, where organisations like the Provisional IRA sometimes have their intelligence officers inÂ situ in the public service.
I would ask the Minister to be very careful to ensure that there are proper checks and balances and that those who abuse for their own purpose intelligence or information gathered in any way in the public interest are dealt with very severely.
I would like to make one other point: I understand that private detectives, for example, have people within the various public services, but they pay ...
Â Â  . I cannot comment on the specific case of the lucky lottery winner, who, as it transpired, was not so lucky when it came to the invasion of privacy described.
Nor, I hope, would you expect me to comment on your allegations and suggestions on public services and data protection in individual Member States.
The Presidency is keen to see progress on data protection and we agree that all retained data must be held securely, in line with data protection principles, and that very high standards of protection should be required for exchanges of information.
The police and other bodies should not have unrestricted access to the retained data and it is essential that national standards for access to private information are met.
If those standards are deemed insufficient in the honourable Memberâs country, then I suggest that that is a matter that should be raised with the Member State, just as it is raised with the Presidency when we are considering data protection at a European level.
Â Â  . The Waste Incineration Directive neither precludes nor discourages the use of waste as a competitive and efficient alternative energy source.
Rather, the aim of the directive is to prevent or to limit, as far as is practical, negative effects on the environment and human health from the incineration and co-incineration of waste.
When adopting legislation, the Community legislator carefully examines possible trade-offs in relation to other Community policy objectives.
Waste tallow is only included in the scope of the directive where it is incinerated or co-incinerated.
Other waste disposal or recovery operations involving waste tallow, such as its processing into bio-diesel, are not subject to the directiveâs requirements but are subject to control under the Waste Framework Directive.
Â Â  Thank you for your response.
The Commission did in fact respond to a similar question yesterday, but it did feel that there were practical problems with the implementation of this directive, especially in three Member States â including the Member State you and I know best, President-in-Office â which had implemented it in the most rigid form.
May I ask whether it would be possible to postpone implementation in those three Member States until the Commission can come up with a much more practical application of this directive?
Surely that would be consistent with our desire for a more sensible form of EU legislation.
It would also benefit our Scottish constituency farmers and our Scottish environment.
Â Â  . Greatly tempting though it would be to answer, both as a Scottish Member of Parliament and as a British Minister, I would respectfully remind myself and this Chamber that I answer today on behalf of the Presidency.
In that context, while I have sympathy with the points made by the Member about the need for these practical difficulties to be addressed, it would seem more appropriate that these matters be brought to the attention of the Commission by the individual Member States acting in their own interests rather than it be, in the first instance, a Presidency matter.
However, on the way forward and on the prospect of action by the European Commission, let me take the opportunity to say that the Commission has indicated an intention to place a consultancy contract, within the next month, for a study of the environmental, regulatory and operational impacts of the inclusion of the burning of waste tallow within the scope of the Waste Incineration Directive.
The study will include recommendations to the Commission concerning whether the application of the Waste Incineration Directiveâs regulatory controls to the burning of waste tallow is appropriate.
These recommendations are expected to be made in the middle of next year.
Â Â  President-in-Office, this might seem in some senses quite an obscure topic, but it is extremely important.
You are right to say that there is a review, but the problem is â the last point you made â the fact that the review will not be completed until next June.
Once companies, farmers and so on stop burning tallow through incinerators, they are unlikely to return to it, so we need a decision before the end of the year.
The Commission has not promised, but indicated, that it would look sympathetically on the idea of excluding tallow from the directive.
Only 3 of the 25 Member States include tallow within the scope of the directive.
A simple solution would be for the Presidency to ask the Commission to consider putting out an advisory note stating that tallow should not be considered as part of the Waste Directive.
I think that would be met with a sympathetic response from the Commission.
Â Â  . Firstly let me place on record my understanding, not least given my own responsibilities back home, of the importance of this issue and the fact that there are a limited number of Member States which have moved much more rapidly than others in implementing this directive.
It has not previously been put to me that the Presidency should approach the Commission to issue the advisory note because, clearly, up until now the position has been clear in relation to this as in relation to other directives.
Whether to invest in any necessary upgrading to comply with the directive when it comes fully into force at the end of this year is a matter for a commercial decision by the rendering companies and biodiesel companies burning tallow as fuel.
However, if the situation is as the honourable Member describes, in that there is now genuine uncertainty as to the merit or demerit of making those investment decisions because of uncertainty as to the status of the directive, I will certainly consider sympathetically the point that has been made to me and perhaps I will be able to write to the honourable Member to confirm the way forward.
Â Â  Thank you for that response, President-In-Office.
It is not only tallow that creates a problem, although it is the most pressing one.
There is a real need to achieve carbon neutrality and to avoid placing unnecessary costs on business.
So, saying Mr Martinâs suggestion is one way forward, I would also ask whether the Council would be prepared to support Members of the European Parliament in asking the Commission to produce a list of materials in relation to which it will refrain from instigating any infringement proceedings under the Waste Incineration Directive until an analysis has been conducted of their overall environmental effect when used as a fuel source.
Â Â  . Given the range of views that have already been expressed as to the right way forward for the Presidency, the sensible approach would be to reflect on both of the suggestions and write to both of the honourable Members in due course, once this debate is concluded.
Â Â  . As the honourable Member will be aware, the Union opened accession negotiations with Turkey on Monday 3 October.
This was a historic moment and another important step in the evolution of the European Union-Turkey relationship.
It marked the beginning of a long and rigorous process that will be guided by the negotiating framework adopted by the Council the same day.
The Commission started screening the science and research chapter on 20Â October.
The European Union will continue to monitor respect for the human and cultural rights of the Kurdish people and the situation in the south east of the country in general.
As stipulated in the negotiating framework, Turkey should consolidate and broaden legislation and implement measures on, , freedom of expression, freedom of religion and minority rights.
Progress in these areas should be irreversible, fully and effectively implemented.
The Commission will therefore continue to monitor it closely and to report regularly to the Council.
The Council can assure Members that the Union attaches great importance to this issue as part of the ongoing reform process in Turkey.
Hence progress will continue to be monitored and evaluated in all the relevant bodies.
Â Â  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President-in-Office on his role in Luxembourg, a negotiation he probably will not forget.
On the very serious question of the Kurdish community, I am in contact with the largest community centre of Kurds anywhere in the United Kingdom.
Whilst they are grateful for the negotiations, they are anxious that you do not let the positive energy that is now flowing in these negotiations negate the very real human rights considerations the Kurdish community still has.
They feel that this should be a major part of any negotiation â it is a symbolic part â and we ask the President-in-Office to continue to take that seriously.
Â Â  . Let me take this opportunity to place on record my respect and admiration for the work that the honourable Member has taken forward over a number of years for communities such as the Kurdish community in London.
In response to his generous tribute to my role in the negotiations and the assertion that I would never forget it, I think I was in some danger of forgetting my own name by the end of 30 hours of serial and continuing negotiations!
But I am delighted to say that, notwithstanding the lack of sleep and the considerable effort on all sides, we managed to reach what I think was a constructive way forward which reflected the long historical association between Turkey and Europe, the prospect of European membership having been held out to Turkey for 42 years.
It was a genuinely historic moment in Luxembourg and one from which I think many of the Members of the European Parliament can take real pride.
However, the emphasis that I place on that moment in history, as I hope I reflected in my initial answer, is that it marks the next step of a journey that Turkey is on.
In many ways, the destination is important but so too is the journey that Turkey is taking to reach that destination.
In that regard, I believe that those of us who have long argued for Turkish accession to the European Union have the best interests of those who have, in the past, been fearful of their human and civil rights within Turkey at heart, because the very process of accession and the rigour which I sought to reflect in my earlier reply in many ways represent one of the best guarantees that can be afforded to such communities that the progress we all wish to see as Turkey makes that journey over the decade or so ahead will actually be made, and that there will be a transparent means by which the scale and pace of that progress can be judged, not just by the communities within Turkey but also by the wider international community within the European Union.
Â Â  . As the honourable Member is aware, the Council is currently examining the Commission proposal of April 2005 for the Seventh Framework Programme for 2007-2013 â or FP7 â which will be decided by this Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure.
The Council has, on several occasions, confirmed the importance it attaches to research and technological development activities in the context of the Lisbon Agenda.
I hope the commitment of our own Prime Minister and the Presidency to that agenda was obvious to all Members of this Parliament from his remarks earlier this afternoon.
The research programme in particular is the main Community instrument.
Further research into respiratory diseases would be timely.
Respiratory diseases are currently the leading cause of death in the European Union and yet these illnesses have a lower profile than many other diseases such as heart disease.
The honourable Member is right to draw attention to the significant economic loss caused by these diseases in particular.
In the European Union, 41Â 300 lost work days per one thousand of the population are due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alone.
Productivity losses resulting from this disease amount to EURÂ 28.5 billion annually.
The Commission proposal for FP7 includes health and environment as priority research topics.
As regards research potentially relevant to respiratory diseases, the following topics are proposed amongst others: innovative therapeutic approaches and intervention with potential applications in many diseases; transnational research into infectious diseases and major diseases including cancer; the quality, efficiency and solidarity of health systems; enhanced disease prevention and better use of medicines; the interaction of environmental factors such as pollution with human health.
The Framework Programme indicates the broad lines of research activity and therefore does not exhaustively list the potential individual research topics.
These will be elaborated on in the specific programme decisions and during the execution of the programme, which is the responsibility of the Commission.
Research projects are selected mainly on the basis of open calls for proposals to the scientific community and take into account various criteria such as scientific excellence and European added value.
Â Â  I thank the Presidency for an encouraging reply and for the commitment shown by Mr Blair earlier to boosting RTD in the European Union budget.
Research is an area where a common programme, rather than 25 separate national programmes, can provide added value and can save money.
Health, important in its own right for the human beings involved, is also important in terms of our economic performance.
The statistics you quoted show that this is an area that can tie in with and be a flagship example of how the Lisbon Agenda can be matched in the field of research.
May I urge the Council to persevere with that line of argument in its internal deliberations.
Â Â  . I can assure you that I will reflect on and bear in mind the remarks the Member has made.
I reiterate the commitment and importance we attach to using the framework directive in the kind of ways that I outlined in my initial answer.
If I can offer a ray of optimism to the Member, it would simply be to say that he is not a lone voice in this Parliament in making this case.
Even while I was sitting at desk No 2 and our Prime Minister was still addressing the Chamber this afternoon, one of your colleagues in the Socialist Group had already passed a note to me saying that they took the strength of commitment to research and development shown by our Prime Minister during his speech as a very clear indication that the Seventh Framework Programme would be fully funded to the extent that she wanted.
I am not able to give such an indication today, given the interrelated issues of financing that such a commitment would involve, but, in its own way, for me, it reflects the strength of feeling, not just amongst the Council â which I believe will be reflected in the Council tomorrow at Hampton Court â but amongst a wide cross-section of Members of this Parliament, that research and development is one of the key priorities for the Union moving ahead in the future.
Â Â  . The European Commission has agreed that the reforms of recent years have strengthened minority rights.
However, there remain a number of outstanding concerns, which the Commission will address in its regular report, due on 9Â November.
The Commission and the Council will continue to monitor these issues closely.
Non-Muslim religious communities continue to experience difficulties with questions of legal personality, property rights, training, residentsâ rights and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clergy, schools and internal management.
A new law on foundations is expected to resolve some of these problems.
The European Commission has acknowledged that the latest draft is a significant improvement on its predecessor.
The Union has urged Turkey to adopt such a law promptly and ensure that it is fully compliant with European standards.
On his visit to Ankara from 6 to 8Â October 2005, Commissioner Rehn urged the Turkish Authorities to take into account the Commissionâs comments on the draft law.
The European Union has also repeated its calls for Turkey to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary.
With regard to the rights of those belonging to ethnic minorities, some progress has been achieved, notably in the field of cultural rights, but further progress is needed.
Furthermore, the situation in the south east of Turkey remains a matter for concern.
The negotiation mandate agreed by the European Union that will guide accession negotiations with Turkey in the months and years ahead stipulates that Turkey should work towards further improvement in respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as consolidate and broaden legislation and implementing measures on, , freedom of religion and minority rights.
The Council can assure the honourable Member that the Union attaches great importance to these issues. Hence monitoring and evaluation of progress, as well as dialogue with the Turkish side, will continue in all the relevant bodies.
Â Â  Mr President, these problems mainly affect the Christian minority groups in Turkey, where Christians face the threat of their disappearance from the scene.
Their numbers are dwindling, and the Ecumenical Patriarch fears that there may well be no Christians left in Turkey by the time the accession negotiations come to an end.
It is for that reason that I have a very specific question to put to you.
The Law on Religion was submitted to the Commission, which had some trenchant criticisms to make of it.
The Turks said that their parliament would make improvements to it.
Do you have any definite indications that such improvements have been made, particularly where the property law and the training of priests is concerned?
Have you received any definite indications, and will you insist on them being reflected in action over the course of the coming weeks, or do you intend to wait until the Turkish Christians have died out before dealing with this?
Â Â  . I think it most appropriate to await the Commission report on exactly these matters, because it is important â rather than to deal on the basis of individual examples, or sometimes even of anecdote â to have evidence on which to base assertions that are being made.
It is certainly the case that the Union continues to urge the Turkish Government to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary, as I said, that closed back in 1971.
The Turkish Government remains committed to this and is searching for a solution that is both compatible with Turkish law and acceptable to the Patriarchate.
On the specific issue of confiscation of Greek Orthodox Church property, Commissioner Rehn wrote to the Turkish Foreign Minister in June on the shortcomings in the draft law on foundations and highlighted the issue of property rights specifically.
The final point I would make â given the very negative construction that was placed in the question as regards the prospects for the Christian community within Turkey â is to place on record the fact that leaders of those Christian communities themselves have been some of those who have recognised the scale of progress that has been made in recent months in anticipation of the opening of accession talks.
So, while I am respectful to the point the honourable Member made, I think we also need to listen to those Christian voices within Turkey who themselves are claiming that the very process and prospect of accession is providing for them and guaranteeing rights which, tragically, have not been available to them in past circumstances.
Â Â  . Under the procedure laid down for Regulation (EC) NoÂ 639/2003, to which the honourable Member refers, the Commission is responsible for submitting to the management committee any proposal for modifying implementing measures relating to conditions governing the payment of export refunds.
The Council is requested to act only when a majority of delegations in the management committee has been unable to give an opinion on such a proposal.
The Commission has made no such proposal.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this is a considerable problem for mountainous regions, which are particularly threatened by decultivation and desertification, and so, with regard not only to this but also to the environmental importance of these cattle breeds for the Alps, which are in any case at ecological risk, I would like to ask whether the Council endorses such a course of action, or whether it is maintaining absolute impartiality and declining to state a position on the subject.
Â Â  . The European Union has a wide variety of instruments aimed at assisting farmers across the spectrum.
None, to my knowledge, directly targets alpine mountain cattle breeds, but many are aimed at farmers that deliver the kind of benefits that many European Union citizens would associate with alpine farming, such as managing sensitive landscapes and habitats and, indeed, maintaining biodiversity.
In response to the subsequent point made by the honourable Member, I would simply reiterate the importance of recognising the relative institutional responsibilities with regard to this Regulation, and I would suggest that, if there are continuing concerns of the type that the honourable Member has raised, then, given the relative responsibilities of the Commission and the Presidency, it might be more appropriate for them to be directed towards the Commission.
Â Â  . The Presidency is fully aware, as the Prime Minister and I have stated on numerous occasions today, of the importance of reaching an agreement on the new Financial Perspective, if we can, by the end of the year.
We will work to achieve that.
It has just completed a series of bilateral meetings with all Member States and the two accession states in order to determine the basis on which such an agreement might be possible.
In the light of these consultations, the Presidency hopes to draw up a proposal, which it intends to submit to the Council.
The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said in his letter to Heads of Government ahead of the informal meeting that will take place tomorrow at Hampton Court, that he believes agreement can and should be reached at the December Council, and that he will make every effort personally to achieve it by then.
All of that having been said, as was reaffirmed very powerfully by the turn of events at the June European Council, the ultimate determinant of whether agreement will be reached on the future Financial Perspective rests not on the will of one country â albeit one country holding the Presidency â but on the commitment of all 25 Member States of the European Union to work to secure that consensus.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in June this issue depended on just a few countries and, to a greater extent, on the country currently holding the presidency, the United Kingdom.
At the time, you effectively torpedoed the solution, which would have allowed us to arrive at a financial framework for the period 2007â2013.
Now that you yourself are drafting it, the question has arisen of whether it should form some sort of package, and I would like to ask this: is it possible that the joint financing of agriculture will be a part of this package, which would mean that Member States would start paying a portion of compulsory agricultural expenditure themselves?
Â Â  . Let me address both of those points in turn.
Firstly, although it might be convenient to the honourable Member's question for the United Kingdom to have been isolated in a minority of one at the June European Council, I am afraid that simply was not what happened.
I know because I was there.
Five Member States were unable to accept the Luxembourg Presidency proposals.
From a British point of view, we were very clear that there were specific reasons why we were unable to accept that.
However, it would be inappropriate for me to narrate or rehearse the arguments that were advanced from the British seat in June, given my responsibilities today to answer on behalf of the Presidency.
In relation to the general issue of agriculture, again, our Prime Minister addressed that in the course of his remarks today, namely that we believe it is necessary to have a pathway forward, in terms of reform, that recognises the kind of future challenges that the European Union will face in the course of the coming Financial Perspective.
Beyond that, I can simply reiterate the point with which I began my answer, which is to say that, as our own Prime Minister has made clear in the course of his remarks to this Parliament today, we are earnest in our endeavour to try and reach agreement on the future Financial Perspective, not simply because it would be somehow judged to be a success for the British Presidency or in the interests of one Member State, but because it would be in the interests of all Member States of the European Union to have a budget that reflects the modern priorities of the Union in an era of globalisation.
There are particular demands on the Presidency from the A10 countries â the new accession countries â which have articulated repeatedly to us their clear desire for certainty in terms of prospective funds being available to them in the future.
We have listened carefully to those points of view, consistent with our responsibilities as President.
Given the difficulties of the June European Council, we did not immediately table proposals but rather sought to listen to the views that have been expressed in other Member States.
We recognise that the political context in which discussions on future financing should take place would be better served by having had a prior conversation about the future direction of Europe, which is why we have organised the informal Heads of Government meeting tomorrow.
After that meeting at Hampton Court tomorrow, we will then seek to make practical and real progress in relation to the challenges that we all recognise.
Â Â  . Draft replies to oral questions at Question Time are drafted by the Council's Secretariat in cooperation with the Presidency and the Member States with the aim of providing the most accurate answers to questions put by honourable Members of this Chamber.
It should be recalled, however, that during Question Time the President-in-Office acts on behalf of the Council; hence he must decline to answer questions which are outside the Council's sphere of competence, for example, where matters of strictly internal politics are concerned.
Â Â  . Thank you, President-in-Office, and thank you for reaching question 17.
On the last two occasions, we unfortunately ran out of time and my question was not answered.
My question is a follow-up.
I believe that at the last Strasbourg part-session the Presidency decided unilaterally to change the system of answering questions so that the whole Council had to be involved.
I understand that President Borrell Fontelles has written formally, asking for a return to the system that has served this House well for 30 years.
I would urge you to do that.
There might not be many of us here, but those who do come very much value this opportunity and would not wish the answers to questions that cannot be answered on this occasion to be further delayed.
Â Â  . I can assure you that, in terms of what is an ongoing dialogue with President Borrell, there is no intention whatsoever of diminishing the capacity of ministers to be answerable and to answer questions directly to Members in the format that we are presently enjoying.
I am not sure we are both enjoying it, but certainly you are!
I can also assure you that there was nothing personal in our failure to reach question 17 in the two previous question times.
I think that ministers have an important responsibility to endeavour to address themselves to the questions that have been put.
On the basis of my accumulating experience of answering questions in this Chamber, there are circumstances in which questions are put directly to us that are matters of national interest rather than being within the remit of the Presidency, and that, inevitably, is reflected in the answers that are given.
Â Â  As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 18 to 46 will be answered in writing(4).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Commission on Afghanistan.
Â Â  . Madam President, last month nearly 7 million Afghans went to the polls to elect a parliament for the first time in 36 years.
This was the culmination of a political transitional process agreed in Bonn four years ago.
I visited Afghanistan at the beginning of September to look at the election preparations and see for myself the practical impact our assistance is having on the ground.
I was also able to discuss all the challenges ahead and the next phase of the stabilisation process with President Karzai and his ministers, as well as with Afghan civil society and the United Nations.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the elections, the preparations for the post-Bonn period and future EU-Afghanistan relations.
The European Union has supported Afghanistanâs recent election in a number of ways.
It is no exaggeration to say that the election could not have taken place without the European Union, including contributions by the Member States.
We funded 40% of the election budget, contributing EUR 159 million.
We have also sought to improve transparency by deploying an EU Election Observation Mission, headed by Mrs Emma Bonino who is present today.
This has followed the process since July.
It also benefited from the cooperation of an observer delegation from Parliament, led by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, who is here today as well.
I think we can say that the EU EOM was the single largest international observer group in the country.
Its presence was extremely important.
In its preliminary statement, the EU EOM reported that the election day itself had been largely peaceful, the process up to that point had been generally well administered and the elections marked a step forward for Afghanistanâs democratic development.
Nevertheless, it also noted a number of concerns, for instance with the whole campaign environment, the choice of voting system and the complaints mechanism.
I understand that in some provinces fraud and irregularities have come to light during the counting phase.
The Election Observation Mission has urged the electoral authorities to deal diligently with these concerns.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Bonino for her teamâs excellent work so far.
I look forward to the final report, which will include an overall assessment of the entire election process, as well as recommendations to improve the conduct of future elections.
Mrs Bonino will be travelling to Kabul again before the end of the year to present the report to election stakeholders.
What comes next, after the Bonn process?
Afghanistan has come a long way since the fall of the Taliban.
I am proud that the European Commissionâs assistance has had a tangible impact.
We have pursued a combination of visible reconstruction, lasting capacity-building and improvements in the day-to-day lives of the Afghan people.
We are on track to deliver the EUR 1 billion we pledged in Tokyo for the period 2002 to 2006.
If we think back to the chaos, devastation and repression in Afghanistan four years ago, it is clear that the country has made progress.
Five million children are back in school, one-third of them girls.
Eighty per cent of children have been vaccinated against measles and polio.
Roads, schools and clinics are being built and many of them are already working.
However, the situation is still fragile and the improvements are not yet fully sustainable.
It is clear that the country still has a long way to go.
More work is needed, particularly on good governance, the rule of law, security, counter-narcotics and development.
I therefore very much welcome the idea floated by the United Nations at the end of August of a major international conference, hopefully early in 2006, to draw up the âpost-Bonn compactâ between Afghanistan and the international community.
The European Union will again be an important participant in the conference.
What should the compact do?
It should focus particularly on Afghan ownership and sustainability.
Lasting stabilisation will not be possible unless the Afghan side is willing and able to take greater responsibility for the transition process and for making it sustainable.
The Bonn Agreement showed the value of clear-cut targets and timetables to ensure momentum.
So we should aim to incorporate clear benchmarks in the post-Bonn compact.
Some form of joint Afghan-international monitoring of progress would also be useful.
The post-Bonn compact should be a two-way street: it should contain clear-cut commitments from the Afghan side and commitments from the international community to stay engaged financially, politically and militarily.
Finally, I turn to the role of the European Union.
The European Union and its Member States have been playing an important role in Afghanistan.
Together we accounted for one-third of the USD 12.5 billion in grants pledged at the Tokyo and Bonn conferences.
EU Member States are currently contributing 80% of the troops in ISAF.
The EU Special Representative in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, has been doing excellent work politically.
Under the auspices of the British Presidency, we are currently discussing with President Karzaiâs Government a joint declaration on an EU-Afghan partnership.
It would be an important political signal of continuing EU commitment to Afghanistan.
It would also make clear our expectations, the kind of further progress we want to support in Afghanistan in fields such as governance, development and human rights.
My hope is that this can be concluded in the weeks ahead so that it would be in place ahead of any post-Bonn conference and could help to shape discussions there.
Finally, I believe that the European Union is both entitled and obliged to play a major part in ensuring the success of the post-Bonn compact.
The Commission will, in any case, remain engaged.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
Firstly, on her positive and active commitment to the cause of democratic consolidation in Afghanistan; secondly, on having rightly sent an election observation mission to that country, which is experiencing very difficult circumstances.
This has ensured the presence of the European Union, which is alive, despite the crisis we are experiencing and the debate we have held this evening, with the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, and clearly demonstrates that we are not entirely wrapped up in our contemplation of our own problems, but that we are showing solidarity with the problems of other countries that are suffering and that have experienced extremely difficult circumstances, as in the case of Afghanistan.
I am glad that the members of the European Parliamentâs delegation are here in this debate.
I can see Mr Evans, Mrs Scheele, my friend Philippe Morillon, MrsÂ Nicholson and Mr SchrÃ¶der.
I would like to take advantage of this debate in the plenum of our Parliament, as we did in the press conference that we held with Emma Bonino in Afghanistan, to pay tribute to the candidates who died in this electoral process, to the electoral agents, and, above all, to the European Union citizens who lost their lives in this noble task of contributing to the cause of democratic consolidation in that country.
I am thinking of the French soldier who lost his life at the very time we were carrying out our mission and also the seventeen brave Spanish soldiers who died in a helicopter accident, in honour of whom we expressed our gratitude and recognition during our visit to Herat, the base where they had their general headquarters, and also our visit to the Governor, the President, the authorities of the United Nations, women candidates and the General Head of the NATO forces in that country.
From a general point of view, I would like to say that our mission of Members of the European Parliament fully agreed with the conclusions resulting from the extraordinary work carried out by Emma Bonino, and also, from a political point of view, we expressed our view of the priorities that the European Union should set for the future.
We believe fundamentally in the democratic consolidation of that country, from an institutional point of view and in terms of respect for human rights and, in particular, the rights of women; because democratic development cannot be achieved in a country without the contribution of its men and women and their right to determine their own future.
Madam President, the European Parliamentâs delegation expressed its opinion that our Parliament should contribute to the post-Bonn Process, hosting and organising a broad conference with the participation of the Commission, of the Member States participating in the joint actions of NATO and, of course, of the new representatives in the Afghan Parliament, so that in this way they can go on defining and marking out their own future.
We also believe that it was important for the European Parliament to give its full support to the joint statement that the Commission is going to sign with the new authorities and with the Afghan Government, and to provide an institutional framework and a channel for the broad and generous cooperation our Parliament has been demonstrating.
Furthermore, we would call upon the Commission to consider whether in the future we should establish a broad association agreement which could provide and guide an institutional format for cooperation in the future.
Madam President, we feel greatly reassured following the statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in which she said that the European Union will continue to contribute to the dividends of peace, understanding, agreement and reconciliation in Afghanistan, which to date has suffered so much agony.
I shall end, Madam President, by thanking Emma Bonino, with whom we have worked in magnificent harmony, for the hospitality and support she offered to the European Parliamentâs delegation.
Â Â  .
Madam President, last monthâs elections in Afghanistan were an important milestone and I echo the tributes paid to Mrs Bonino and her colleagues for all the work they did.
After all, these were the first parliamentary elections to be held there since 1979.
The turnout, greater than 50%, compares favourably with other electoral contests around the world.
There were problems, but those â not necessarily in this House â who want to criticise need to remember the starting point, and the Commissionerâs words âchaosâ and âdevastationâ really summed it up.
Whilst Afghanistan may now still be far from perfect, it has come a long way.
We, as an election observation team, were very proud to witness not just women coming to the polling stations to vote â many choosing not to wear the burkha, as is their choice â but many women election officials and women standing as candidates.
We know now that many women were elected.
So Afghanistan, for all its problems, has come a long way.
On the list, one of the first names to be announced as elected was the womenâs rights activist Malalai Joya.
She will be one of 62 women members in the parliament, a major achievement and unthinkable a little while back.
Some of them were elected in their own right, and some of them by virtue of the â25% womenâ rule.
However, some of the ghosts of Afghanistanâs brutal past have re-emerged as other results have trickled in.
When we were there observing the elections, President Karzai explained to us his choice, or choice, of electoral system â to which the Commissioner has also referred â based on a single non-transferable vote.
This entails no public political party support on the ballot papers but presents the voters with a list of quite literally hundreds of names from which to choose.
Hidden in those lists of names are people who could best be described as having less than satisfactory records, some implicated by human rights groups in war crimes.
Former Taliban governor Mawlawi Mohammadi, who, if not personally responsible, at least oversaw the destruction of the Buddha statues, was elected in one province on less than 10% of the vote, which arguably is a flaw in the system.
Mullah Raketi, commander of a Taliban military unit, was elected in another.
So the task now facing President Karzai is not an easy one.
It is to help those disparate forces form a useful, workable and effective legislative body.
One of the challenges facing them, but a vital one, is to address the countryâs serious drug problem, to which the Commissioner again referred.
The army, the police and the law enforcement agencies need to work together with all the international bodies to look at alternatives for the poppy growers.
Another is to address the frightening availability of weapons, which was very visible to us in Kabul and around Afghanistan.
Last year, the Dutch Presidency made much of its plans for supporting and helping Afghanistan.
These plans must not be forgotten.
The Election Observation Mission of which I was proud to be part must be part of a longer, deeper process of support for Afghanistan.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take this opportunity to thank on behalf of this House the members of my core team, the long-term observers, and the people who spent four months with me in this extraordinary but very difficult country, in conditions sometimes very tense and unusual, and also very emotional and not particularly easy.
You will never see them but they do exist, and they were there under a European flag.
I believe they did a good job in representing the support for democracy that is the common ground between us all and the fundamental value we wish to uphold.
The Mission, in short, will make public, after consulting the Commission, its final report on the elections; we shall also undertake, again after consultation, to draw up for the first time a report on democratisation and its future steps.
Naturally, the whole electoral process had its awkward moments, which, moreover, we had already anticipated in the preliminary statement, but there were also moments of concern, for example the arrest of Mohaqui Nasab â a journalist who edits a weekly publication on womenâs rights â which was declared illegal even by the representative of the Media Commission of the Afghan authorities.
I believe that to be a cause for concern, and I hope that the European institutions will let it be known to our Afghan friends and the authorities of the country, or will remind them of the need to respect both the law and the rule of law.
Moreover, with regard, as you said, to future follow-up to the Bonn Conference, I would like to emphasise two things.
Firstly, we have to be aware that this is at least a medium- to long-term commitment, whichever formula is adopted.
Secondly, I would like to emphasise the regional dimension, which is so important to the whole success of Afghanistan.
Whether one talks about security, or commerce, or economic development, the regional dimension is definitely an element to take into account.
It is also true, though, that Afghanistan is one of the countries to which international commitment, particularly from Europe, can make a difference.
Afghanistan is a country trapped between a possible future and a very outmoded past.
In my opinion, though, it possesses the human resources to look to the future.
When thousands of young girls can be seen coming out of school in black uniforms and white headscarves, with normal books in their pockets, I believe this is the future, even though it may yet be many years before it is fully realised.
It is precisely in areas like this, however, that we can make a difference, though not on our own.
Our American friends must also remain in the country at a time when there are still difficulties on the security front, while hopefully behaving more respectfully towards local traditions, which is something that does not always happen.
I remain convinced, though, that a future is possible.
It depends on the Afghans, of course, but it also depends on us.
I believe that this is the hope and commitment that motivated your visit to us, as well as the visit of the European delegation and our presence there over so many weeks, a presence which, in my opinion, also earned the respect and gratitude of the Afghan people themselves.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague MrsÂ Beer, who is unfortunately unable to take part in this debate and who would have liked to have been here.
As our fellow Members have said, I think that we can be very pleased with the course of the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan on 18Â SeptemberÂ 2005.
Even though there has been some violence in recent months, especially against candidates and tellers, the elections themselves took place in a non-violent atmosphere.
That is a good sign for the journey towards democracy and the rule of law in Afghanistan.
At present, as Europeans, we need to clarify our commitments on the ground.
We support an extension of the ISAFâs mission, because that mission is reconstruction and nation building.
This mission is an important one, Commissioner, because it creates a favourable climate for the development of the country following decades of conflict.
In this regard, one very important point must be stressed: we must not mix up the two missions, that of the ISAF and that of Operation Enduring Freedom.
The latter, which is led by the United States, seeks to combat terrorism, in other words the Taliban.
These are combat operations.
If we mix up the two reconstruction missions, we will lose the trust of the population and tarnish the good reputation of this mission.
Moreover, it will make the situation very difficult for the NGOs, which are currently cooperating with ISAF.
We must also raise the issue, as you did, Commissioner, of drugs in the country.
We need a plan that takes account of all aspects connected with this problem, which equally affects the agricultural and health sectors and the Afghan economy in general.
Of course, this problem also affects neighbouring countries.
I would like to make one final important point.
The current government of President Karzai has signed contracts for US troops to be stationed in Afghanistan indefinitely.
We do not consider this to be a good thing for the stability of the region.
Once the nation building has been completed, Afghanistan will be a sovereign state that will have no need for foreign troops.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret to say that I was unable to participate in the elections in Afghanistan: I would have done so most willingly, but Parliamentâs dâHondt system did not permit me.
I am truly convinced that the changes underway in Afghanistan are concrete, effective and real.
They are, however, slow, difficult and complicated.
An example of the growth of democracy comes, in fact, from a girl, Malalaia Joya, a 26-year-old whom I got to know when she was an 18-year-old in Afghanistan, secretly involved in womenâs education, and who has now been elected into a difficult province in Afghanistan.
It was she who, amongst other things, said two years ago in the Loya Jirga, with great clarity: âThe warlords are still here.â
The fact that a woman like this, with all the hardship and intimidation she must have suffered, can succeed in being elected â and I am sure she will contribute towards the building of democracy in Afghanistan â is an extraordinary fact, and why in my opinion these elections have been positive.
I too would like to thank MrsÂ Bonino â whom I trust, even though we disagree on many issues, such as the Middle East, but in whose democratic nature I have total faith â for her presence in Afghanistan, and I am delighted that the European Union was able to play so positive a role.
If Malalaia Joya is an example of the new Afghanistan, so too is Omar, a boy I got to know when the Taliban were still there, and who said: âI want to live: it is not only for the women that I am fighting against the Taliban, it is also for myself, because I do not want to have a beard and I want to listen to music.â
He too has been elected, which represents, to my mind, another extremely positive fact.
We cannot, however, ignore the complex and difficult choices faced by PresidentÂ Karzai, who has not in fact chosen to punish the warlords, as Human Rights Watch, for example, would have him do, but rather has gone down what is perhaps the only road currently available to him, namely permitting the warlords to be elected as well.
I believe, furthermore, that there is a serious problem with, for example, the International Security Assistance Force, which is undeniably playing an extremely positive role, though I personally am against all war and all military involvement.
The role, however, carried out by the US forces is unhelpful to conflict resolution, reconciliation, and the development of Afghanistan.
I am not just referring to the horror of seeing the two burnt Taliban bodies â or so-called Taliban, because in the end they are all considered such â but am referring to the absence of lawfulness and lack of rules, seen, for example, in the prison at Bagram, where the Taliban are being held with no system of checks.
It is precisely because we need to reason, understand and change together that I believe we should not hide away from truths which, judging by the reactions of the Afghans that we have seen on television, may create conflict.
In that regard, I believe the role played by the EU is very important in this matter.
I wish to thank not only the Commissioner but also the whole European Union, which is working in an alternative way to ensure that Afghanistan is favourable towards democracy.
In order to achieve this objective, however, we need to work very hard to support public institutions, so that both NGOs and civil society may somehow make themselves heard.
Â Â  â So far Afghanistan is the only case where a terrorist organisation has started a war with the world's most powerful democratic state and had a known address.
That address was a backward state, which guarded a specific terrorist organisation, that was the Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban party.
Thus, the democratic alliance was able to target its retaliatory blow at a defined geographical point that removed the tyranny of the Taliban and opened up the prospect of democracy to the Afghan people.
Indeed, one could not fail to be moved by the sight of vast numbers of ordinary people, especially women from the countryside, going for the first time in their lives to vote for the hope of a better system, freedom and respect for all people.
We will see that, although they may have supporters, following the removal of the Taliban, none of the terrorist organisations repeat the mistake of providing visiting cards with a specific address to be hit.
They have forced others into a situation where all they can do is defend themselves and even more confusion is created when terrorists from Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, who are active in Iraq, are called not invaders, but insurgents.
However, Afghanistan, having become the first theatre of the global war on terror, is already creating a true democracy.
Iraq is now the fatal front line of the fanatics' total war against the West, while Afghanistan is now almost behind the front.
Nevertheless, the opportunity for democracy and human rights in Afghanistan is a great test for everybody.
The European Union has made a significant contribution and the whole of Europe must lend a hand in the historic construction of this new state.
I am proud that my country Lithuania is helping to do this by taking responsibility for one whole region.
Lithuanians are helping to build the new Afghanistan.
More European states could do the same.
Success in Afghanistan will represent the first defeat of the front of global terrorists, as well as the hope that this new type of totalitarian aggression can be repelled.
Thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, speaking as one of the members of the delegation that was sent to observe the elections, I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to our chairman Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, for the good work done by the delegation in Afghanistan, and also, of course, to Emma Bonino, who led the EUâs observation mission, and to the European Unionâs long-term observers, who did a splendid job, and are continuing to do so to some extent.
As many of us have already, today, emphasised the importance of these elections as a stage in Afghanistanâs democratic process, I would now like to concentrate on the single issue of Afghan womenâs involvement in political life.
We did of course read a great deal, while the Taliban regime was in power, about the oppression of Afghan women, and it gives great joy to see from the election results that women make up 27% of the future members of parliament.
The 25% quota for women has been very useful in this respect.
Nevertheless, I have no desire to pass over the obvious fact that it will not be enough to have the quota in place and to keep the donor countries quiet if, in future, Afghan women are to participate more in political life and see their social position continue to improve.
It is evident from the social indicators that the situation is still very difficult.
It is significant that the leader of our delegation, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, told a press conference in Afghanistan that the European Union will, in monitoring developments in Afghanistan, take a very close look at human rights, and the rights of women in particular.
Mention must also be made of the conditions under which some non-governmental organisations are obliged to operate in Afghanistan.
The Commission must make it abundantly clear that NGOs will always be our partners, in order that they may not be subject to repression.
Â Â  Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner struck exactly the right note at the beginning of her speech when she said that this was an historic occasion: the first election for decades and the first parliamentary election in which we believe women were ever allowed to take part.
I personally found it a great honour to be a member of the team that was able to witness this momentous event.
I want to thank very warmly our good colleague, MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, who led us so wonderfully well.
This is the second time I have worked closely with him in an election; we were in Lebanon together just before that.
I also want to thank my long-time colleague whom I have always admired, Mrs Bonino, who has been committed to Afghanistan for so long.
She was brave enough to go there while the Taliban were in power.
Very few women would have shown her courage and commitment, and she is continuing her work.
I chose to monitor the women-only polling stations.
I saw thousands of women, most in burkhas with their faces shrouded.
Of course, they rolled them back when they came into the women-only polling booths.
They could not do a great deal once they were there. Some spent half an hour puzzling frantically, trying to understand what the piece of paper in front of them meant, what to do and how to make a mark.
They had no education.
Let us not forget that Afghanistan is one of the two poorest nations in the world.
Its health statistics are comparable only to Somaliaâs.
We will be helping Afghanistan for years to come with education, preventive health care â the basics.
It is right and proper that we should do so.
However, we should also remember those from the European Union who have already given their lives for Afghanistan.
Led by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, we witnessed a wonderful, moving tribute to the deaths of the 17Â Spanish troops, whose names will be enshrined forever where they died.
They sacrificed their lives for the future of the people of Afghanistan.
We cannot give up.
The country is desperately poor.
We shall be there for a very long time, but it is the sort of job to which the European Union is wonderfully suited.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Afghanistan, for decades now, have been paying with blood and tremendous destruction the for continuing interventions of imperialism, because the country is of major geo-strategic importance.
The hypocritical interest of the American and European imperialists in the terrorist attack, human rights and democracy in Afghanistan is an insult and mockery of history, because it was they who supported politically, morally, financially and militarily the blindest and most reactionary of forces, in order to block the path of the Afghan people towards progress and turn the country into an advanced military base.
The war unleashed in 2001 by the United States of America and ÎÎÎ€Î, with the assent of the European Union, has as its objective to achieve military and political control of the country which is today under occupation.
Thus one of the biggest bases of the United States of America has been constructed, threatening neighbouring countries.
The country is prey to the power-crazy servants of the USA and the only development to be seen is the cultivation of and trade in opium.
The efforts by the occupying armies of the USA and the countries of the European Union are directed at stabilising forces and governments over which they will have absolute control.
The precondition for any prospect of a solution for the benefit of the people is for all the occupying forces to leave and for the people themselves, in the midst of really tremendous difficulties, to seek paths to peace and independence.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I should like to pay tribute to the Commissioner and to MrsÂ Bonino for her proactive approach.
I should also like to pay tribute to MrÂ Salafranca, who headed the delegation, for his work.
This issue is one of extreme complexity.
Afghanistan can look back on a proud history during which the Afghan highlanders fought against invaders.
At the same time, however, there can be no question that in some senses the country could be said to export drugs to the rest of the world.
I am glad that the European Union is not turning its back on Afghanistan, and that the European taxpayer, to put it quite bluntly, is funding measures to promote democracy in a country that would appear to have been forgotten by God and the world.
It goes without saying that it would be nothing short of disastrous if the Americans were the only ones to take any interest in Afghanistan.
Regardless of the cost, I am glad that the European Union is funding the arduous and long-winded process of democracy-building in Afghanistan, and that we provided genuine assistance during the recent elections.
I believe that this was a turning point, although it remains to be seen how long the trend will continue.
We should obviously bear in mind the fact that a large number of countries exert an influence over Afghanistan, whether in political or economic terms.
It is worth noting that the country is undoubtedly a focus of Iranian and also Pakistani interests, as well as of American interests.
Mention should also be made of the quite incredible fact that the vast majority of Afghanistanâs revenue comes from the drugs trade, with the state budget only covering one third of civil servantsâ salaries.
Without US and EU aid the country would quite simply not exist.
We should ask ourselves a very straightforward question, namely whether Afghanistan would not export terrorism to the rest of the world to an even greater extent than it does now if we did not provide it with financial aid.
I believe that it is worth lending our support to the process of democratisation in the country.
There is a further point that needs to be made.
It is a well-known fact that Europeans are more highly valued, or perhaps more accepted in Afghanistan than our American friends.
This is a signal of sorts that the EU should concern itself more with Afghanistan, and that we should maintain our presence in the country.
I should like to thank all the Members of the House who flew the European Unionâs flag in Afghanistan, and showed the Afghan people that we want to help them.
I believe that this debate is proof of Parliamentâs interest in this key issue.
Afghanistan is not some far-off land, but a truly European problem.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by warmly thanking Mrs Bonino and Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra for having done such a good job of leading us in Kabul.
I would also like to express my gratitude to all the Members of this House who were with us there.
Perhaps I might be permitted to return to one subject that has cropped up a number of times this evening, namely the criticisms that are levelled at Afghanistan, a country that I think has made a gigantic leap forward and is in the process of making more of them.
We should be very, very judicious in our criticisms; we Europeans have no good cause to point the finger at this country, which has suffered so much, and say who should be punished and what has gone wrong.
To be sure, many things have gone wrong, and many more have yet to do so, but let us consider the history of Europe over the past century, that of my own country for example: even in the old Federal Republic, after the Second World War, many people with links to the old regime were accepted into the civil service and spent their careers in it.
Recently, too, the West â to which we belong â has cosied up to the former Soviet ; being on friendly terms with former KGB bosses has become something to be boasted about, and so on and so forth. I would warn against our constantly telling the Afghans, from a position such as our own, what they have to do.
A lot of very good things are happening; I was most especially impressed by the high degree of open-mindedness and commitment shown by the young people.
There were very many young people helping out in the polling stations, and, when we asked them what they wanted, they said, âWe want education, education, educationâ.
I shall conclude by saying that I would very much like to see this House set up a delegation for relations with Afghanistan, for I believe that to be the best way for us to help the parliamentarians there.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I should like to pay tribute to the Afghan people and to the countryâs authorities, in particular PresidentÂ Karzai, for having succeeded in holding free elections.
These are a crucial step towards the establishment of democracy and peace in Afghanistan.
Five thousand seven hundredÂ candidates stood in the elections held on 18Â September of this year to provincial councils and to the Wolesi Jirga, which is the Lower House of the National Assembly, and this figure included 575Â women.
The scale of the problems faced in holding the elections can be gauged from the fact that 26Â 000Â polling stations were opened throughout the country.
The ballot paper for Kabul, to cite but one example, took up seven pages, and included 617Â candidates standing for the 62Â seats in the constituency.
30% of seats in the Wolesi Jirga and the provincial councils are reserved for women.
While the number of women voting in the presidential elections in 2004 was over three million, over 7000Â new female voters registered for this yearâs elections, representing 44% of newly-registered voters.
This is only the first step towards democracy in Afghanistan.
Parliamentâs pre-election mission, which visited Afghanistan on 14-19Â July of this year under the leadership of MrÂ Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and MrsÂ Morgantini, Chairman of the Committee on Development, held meetings with election candidates, womenâs organisations, human rights groups and NGOs in Kabul, Herat and Bamiyan.
The people we met were hopeful that democracy would be victorious, although they also expressed concerns about threats to this process.
As I see it, the key threats are the state of security in the country, violence against women and corruption.
Many former military leaders accused of human rights violations or even crimes ran for election and gained seats.
There is also a risk that criminal elements, above all drug barons and smugglers, will gain an influence over politics in the country.
The European Union must do everything in its power to stabilise democracy and the re-emerging civil society in Afghanistan.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, when, last month, I accompanied the delegation led by my fellow Member and friend MrÂ Salafranca, it was the fifth time in five years that I was returning to this territory, where I have not only visited the capital, but also travelled through most of the country, from the Panjshir valley in the north, to Kandahar, the capital of the Pashtun south, via Herat, Mazar-e Sharif and Bamiyan, the site of the giant Buddhas that fell victim in 2001 to the barbaric stupidity of the Taliban.
On each occasion, I have been struck by the desire for peace and reconciliation felt by the vast majority of the population, a population that has had enough of violence after 30 years of civil war and international war, a population, moreover, that has been vaccinated against any risk of Islamic fundamentalists returning to power, following their suffering under the regime of Mullah Omar.
At each new contact, I can also see how difficult the task of reconstruction still is and how necessary it therefore is for the European Union to continue to provide aid.
I will only mention here one aspect of this aid, relating to the restoration of security, which is still too frequently under threat in some provinces.
This aid is currently provided by the joint efforts of the national army of Afghanistan and international forces, which are themselves divided into two categories, with different mandates: the coalition, under US command, operating essentially around the border with Pakistan, and the ISAF which, as you said, has a large European majority and is gradually being deployed throughout the rest of the country.
This duality is a source of inefficiency: I welcome the fact that NATO is now planning to bring the mission under a single command, under a new mandate from the United Nations.
When it comes to discussing the terms for this, I would like, Commissioner, to act as an interpreter for the Afghan people themselves: they insist on the urgent need for protection from the interference of their neighbours in Pakistan and Iran, and believe that, once this is achieved, they will be able to solve their own problems between themselves.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to comment on a few points which have arisen from the debate.
One such point is the question of human rights abusers who have been elected to parliament, because this is something that concerns us all.
Unfortunately, Afghanistan has not embarked with any ease on a process to come to terms with its past, and I hope it will take its time.
In such circumstances, it is deeply regrettable, but probably inevitable, that this first post-conflict election will result in some questionable individuals being elected to parliament.
Politically, the key question is how much influence these individuals will have in parliament, and I think it is too early to judge, since the voting system, as many have mentioned, myself included, is very complicated.
There are no clear party blocks.
Parliament will certainly be very fragmented.
I would also like to highlight some positive aspects about some of the people who were elected.
There were courageous people with a record of standing up for justice and human rights in Afghanistan who also managed to get elected, including, as many of you mentioned, quite a significant number of women.
I met some of the women candidates and, admittedly, I was really surprised and I very much appreciated their courage.
When I met them, they said that they had been out working with many women, and I am sure they all said âwe will get electedâ.
Ultimately, that has proved to be the case.
That is a very positive development.
Furthermore, it is also positive to note that, although a few Taliban were elected, many prominent Taliban were not successful in the elections.
The former foreign minister, the former deputy interior minister and the former deputy justice minister were all defeated.
I am sure that the voters knew whom they should not vote for.
I would also like to say a few words about drugs.
We realise that the drug question is still a very important one.
We have also discussed it with President Karzai and are working with the UK Presidency to see what we can do in the future to tackle this problem even more robustly on two fronts â the first of which is alternative plantations, the second being justice and law â which are to be reinforced.
Finally, education is one of the key questions.
I would like to put my finger on that issue for future programmes, not only because it applies to the whole of society, but specifically because, over many decades, women did not have any opportunities and we have to compensate for that in some way.
In 2004 alone, we built 50 schools and childcare institutions.
We also have a specific project for street children.
I visited this project and, again, I must say that I saw how much courage and enthusiasm there is among the young children, the beautiful girls and really handsome boys who have a future.
They want to get off the streets where they are normally selling vegetables and other small things.
I agree that education and healthcare will be the key issues, and we will certainly continue to put our emphasis on those issues.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the November part-session.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Commission on the situation in Azerbaijan before the elections.
Â Â  . Madam President, Azerbaijan is one the European Unionâs key partners in the Southern Caucasus region, principally due to its geostrategic location and energy resources.
Last year we therefore proposed to the Council that Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia, be included in the European Neighbourhood Policy in order to further strengthen our relations, building on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in force since July 1999.
The Commission has been following the preparations for the parliamentary elections of 6Â November 2005 with great attention and some concern.
The events last week, such a short time before the elections, are a source of further concern.
Some Azeri Government ministers were dismissed by President Ilham Aliyev and subsequently arrested on charges ranging from corruption and embezzlement of state funds to an attempt to stage a coup dâÃ©tat.
We cannot make any judgement on these accusations, nor are we willing to interfere with the decisions to be taken by the Azerbaijani judiciary.
However, we wish to point out that it will be crucial for Azerbaijan to carry out, in a very transparent way, fair and thorough investigations and, if necessary, a balanced trial in order to establish the truth.
The arrests are inevitably contributing to a worrying deterioration in the atmosphere of the electoral campaign.
Unfortunately the campaign has already been marked by several episodes of violence and some specific incidents.
As a consequence of this climate, we have learnt of dozens of candidates who have withdrawn in the last hours.
Access to State and public TV is no longer being granted to opposition parties, or it is subject to so many restrictions that it cannot be considered satisfactory.
In all the contacts the Commission has had recently with the Azeri authorities, we have strongly insisted on respect for fundamental freedoms, including, of course, freedom of expression and the possibility for political parties to hold public rallies without undue restrictions and to access mass media.
We have also stressed several times, to opposition representatives as well, the need for such rights to be exercised in a moderate and peaceful way.
We fully concur with the assessment of the electoral campaign by the OSCE-ODIHR in the two interim reports published so far.
It cannot be denied that some progress has been made compared with the parliamentary elections of 2000 and the presidential elections of 2003.
More candidates than ever were registered; state authorities have proved cooperative with international observers; all parties have been granted some access to television.
Finally, we welcome the decision by the Azeri authorities to introduce systems such as finger-inking that could dramatically reduce the possibility of multiple voting, although this came very late.
Whilst on the one hand commending Azerbaijan for this progress, we agree with OSCE-ODIHR that it might not be sufficient.
The worrying deterioration in the climate of the electoral campaign over the last few days threatens to completely overshadow this limited progress.
We will continue to monitor the situation very closely throughout the electoral campaign, on the day of the election and in the aftermath on 6 November.
In accordance with our well-established practice, we will not deploy a separate Election Observation Mission; as with the OSCE countries, support will be given to the OSCE office and the ODIHR office which will take on that task.
As we have stressed several times recently, these elections will be a litmus test for Azerbaijan and its aspirations to come closer to the European Union in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
On the question of the Neighbourhood Policy, I can only say that we will start consulting on the action plans in the near future.
We hope that we might be able to work out satisfactory action plans by next year.
Â Â  . Madam President, last June I spoke in plenary in the human rights debate.
The situation in Azerbaijan at the time was particularly serious, with allegations that the government was holding political prisoners and indeed that torture and ill-treatment in custody was common.
This time I speak as the resolutionâs co-author, as I am being sent to Baku by this Parliament as an official observer for the 6Â November elections.
But I also wear the hat of the European Parliamentâs rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is now being extended to the three Caucasus republics.
I welcome President Aliyevâs decree which, theoretically at least, orders state officials in the Central Electoral Commission to observe and implement free, fair and transparent elections.
I also believe that the recent dismissal of the old guard hard-line ministers resistant to political change, like the former health minister Ali Insanov, suggests that the dominant pro-government YAP party finally realises that the time has come to manage the transition peacefully to multi-party democracy and bring Azerbaijan closer to European democratic practices.
The newly-elected parliament will no doubt be more mixed politically, with so many registered candidates to choose from, and will have new, younger and more independent technocratic MPs as well.
The system of government is still heavily presidential, so the parliamentary election will be more of a test of willingness by the state to commit itself permanently to western-style democracy, rather than a real change in the exercise of power which will only come about in 2008 at the next presidential election.
Nevertheless, there are still grounds for concern in terms of press freedom, balanced political access to the media, and the right of free assembly and protest.
It is also true that Azerbaijan is still affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh unresolved frozen conflict which can only be resolved peacefully by dialogue through the Minsk Group.
I regret the huge rise in military expenditure in the region and threats of escalation and a fresh outbreak of hostilities.
Azerbaijan will shortly enjoy a huge injection of funds, as oil â now at historically high prices â will flow from Baku via Tbilisi to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
It is important that this money be used to enrich the entire country fairly, and there must be transparency and a renewed commitment by the government to fight public corruption.
Lastly, I hope that the action plan negotiations with Azerbaijan will shortly be resumed, once the direct air links to Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus are discontinued, as this matter is clearly of deep concern to the Republic of Cyprus as an EU Member State.
I, as the co-author for my political group, commend this resolution to the House.
It will send a strong message to the Government of Azerbaijan about where this House stands and the European Parliamentâs hopes in particular for that countryâs democratic future.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for painting a picture that is very rich in light and shade.
We can indeed point to some advances, and they are deserving of mention and praise, but there has, recently, been a great deal of renewed nervousness, resulting in a number of measures that are not really compatible with free elections.
It is quite crucial that we should observe elections not only on the day on which people go to the polls â where some of the measures to which you referred could indeed bring improvements â but also in the period leading up to it; we should observe the transparency of the processes, the degree to which access to the media is possible, and what scope there is for the opposition to develop and expand.
Our delegationâs cooperation with the parliament of Azerbaijan gave us the opportunity to discuss a variety of circumstances that gave us a great deal of food for thought.
The countryâs ambassador had a job to explain why opposition rallies kept on being cancelled or rescheduled or had to be held on the outskirts of Baku, which must surely have hindered the opposition in its attempts to present its programme and candidates during the run-up to the election.
I am, therefore, far from surprised to learn from what you said that a number of intending candidates had changed their minds because they felt that neither the campaign nor the elections were fair.
Azerbaijan will have to accept that it needs to make great advances towards democracy and transparency.
There is no doubting that it has a difficult process of transformation ahead of it, but â the smouldering conflict over Nagorno Karabakh notwithstanding â these steps must be taken.
Something that struck us during our visit to Azerbaijan â and it was something of which we had to take note â was that the fact that the country was living in times of great conflict was the standard reason given for the constant obstruction of measures intended to foster modernisation, transparency and democracy.
We realise that it is in Azerbaijanâs interest that the conflict should be resolved, and we do of course hope that it can be, but it must not be allowed to prevent the government from modernising and further developing the countryâs internal structures.
You mentioned media access; the media have great problems to contend with, not least as regards their own safety.
The safety of critically-minded and free-thinking journalists cannot be guaranteed; one who comes to my mind is the late Elmar Huseynov, whose murder has still not yet been satisfactorily investigated.
We would of course welcome a much more determined approach to such things on the part of Azerbaijan.
There is something else I should like to mention in this connection.
Azerbaijan is now, thanks to the rapid increase in its oil revenues, in a position to raise a great deal more additional funds.
We heard it said during the course of our visit that we can no longer, through our European Neighbourhood Policy, exert any real leverage, as the country is no longer dependent on European funds.
It should be obvious to Azerbaijan that its peopleâs own interests demand that social and economic progress be ensured, and that, if this is to be done, then much more investment will be needed, for which, in turn, more transparency, public access and democracy are prerequisites.
Commissioner, you are quite right in the things you say, and I would like to endorse them.
We â by which I mean the Commission and this House â should, together, do everything possible to ensure that, in post-election Azerbaijan, the new parliament can put more important reforms into effect.
It is in the interests of that countryâs people that we should not stint in our efforts to that end.
Â Â  . Madam President, the third parliamentary elections since independence are taking place against a background that is deeply discouraging in this autocratic and corrupt system.
Violence and harassment are being meted out to opposition supporters, journalists and human rights activists.
Prominent opposition leader Rasul Guliyev was allowed to register as a candidate, but the authorities then refused to let him return to Baku and had him arrested in Ukraine.
I recently helped to free a member of his family.
A British citizen and a constituent of mine, she was detained in Baku when customs officials claimed to âdiscoverâ a gun â clearly planted â in her luggage.
She suffered chronic ill health as a result of being detained and is now recovering.
There has been a temptation for the West â Europe and the United States â to stress continuity and so-called stability.
They have an eye on the oil, the new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline having been opened last May by BP Chairman Lord Browne.
Foreign criticism of the 2003 presidential elections and 2004 local elections, which were deeply flawed, was inexcusably muted.
Have we not learnt that there can be no real stability without democracy, the rule of law and an honest economy?
This time the European Union needs to send a very strong signal that there cannot be a partnership with Azerbaijan without democracy and human rights there.
President Aliyev has to decide whether to embrace the democratic process or try to maintain autocratic rule with just a thin veneer of legitimacy.
We need to tell him that, if he wants the European Union as a friend, there is only one choice.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, your proposals do indeed show, Commissioner, that there really is something lacking in Baku.
There really is a need for a delegation from the Commission to follow our policies, in order to help Azerbaijan â because it is true that the situation there is not exactly great â and so that, in a few monthsâ time, we can put this country back on the agenda.
Indeed, now more than ever, Azerbaijan is facing its destiny.
That country must now show the international community that it can be regarded as a democracy, and that it can follow the rules.
Azerbaijan must follow the path of a state under the rule of law.
In joining the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan has not only turned towards Europe, but has signed up to its values of democracy and human rights, which bring us all together here.
Today, the European Union and Azerbaijan, just like the two neighbouring countries in the Southern Caucasus, are truly forging a joint path, because they are taking part in the new Neighbourhood Policy.
As such, they have new rights and obligations.
The message that the European Parliament must send to our Azerbaijani friends is clear: if this country wants to become a true democracy, free and transparent elections are a milestone for this.
These parliamentary elections, which will be held on 6Â November, must take place transparently and according to the rules, with neither pressure nor repression.
During the pre-campaign phase and at the moment, however, we have seen an increase in police repression, which is unacceptable.
The brutality, violence and intimidation observed against the opposition and their lack of access to the media are unacceptable.
In our previous resolution, we called on the two sides, the government majority and the opposition, not to resort to violence, so that the electoral campaign could take place under the best possible conditions.
We all had reason to be optimistic at that time, following the presidential decree last May organising these coming elections.
We were also optimistic to see the number of candidates registering for the 125 constituencies; even dissidents were allowed to participate!
Today, however, as you have said, we cannot fail to notice that, as the elections approach, tensions are mounting and the rules laid down are not being applied at all.
By sending a delegation of MEPs to monitor the smooth running of the ballot, the European Parliament is showing its interest and its desire to support the ongoing democratic process in Azerbaijan.
Today, we must call on all the parties contesting the election, particularly the majority in power, to demonstrate that this country is able to achieve its ambition: to hold free and transparent elections, in which every citizen, using his single ballot paper, can choose the candidates that will run the country in future.
I would remind you â because this is very important, Madam President â that the challenges in Azerbaijan are immense: finding a resolution to the frozen conflict in Nagorny-Karabakh, the increasing power ...
Â Â  .Â Â Â Commissioner, after listening to your introductory remarks, I found it hard to believe that you would go on to talk about Azerbaijan.
Even one hundred years ago, Azerbaijan was an incredibly rich country by reputation alone, although Baku was and continues to be one of the worldâs leading centres of oil production.
It is well known that the Azerbaijani people are extraordinarily poor, in spite of the countryâs abundant natural resources.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees driven from their homes during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are still living in refugee camps in Azerbaijan.
Furthermore, the state of democracy in the country is amply illustrated by the fact that I once heard a famous explorer call it a khanate.
Nevertheless, the short-term goal must be democratic elections.
All of our deliberations on this issue must be guided primarily by the resolutions adopted by Parliament and the interparliamentary delegation since 1999.
It should not be forgotten that the countries of the Caucasus are part of Europe.
It is therefore crucial that relations with Azerbaijan be stepped up, and that this should take place on the basis of the EUâs fundamental democratic values.
In particular, minimum standards should be applied in social and environmental matters.
In the run-up to the democratic elections, it is of fundamental importance that the climate be conducive to opposition parties and politicians.
Access to the media and the freedom of association are equally important, and the safeguarding of these rights must involve more than merely issuing the appropriate legal and regulatory standards.
I find it somewhat surprising that recitalÂ L of the resolution refers to the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, yet makes no mention of the presence of government representatives from Stepanakert.
I should like to conclude by expressing my support for the motion for a resolution.
I am well aware of how complex the situation is in the South Caucasus, and thus understand that it is far from easy to make progress in terms of democratic standards at a time when the threat of extremist attacks is ever-present.
At the same time, however, basic principles and procedures must not be abandoned during electoral campaigns and elections to legislative bodies conducted in accordance with OSCE standards.
Â Â  . Madam President, there are only 11 days left before the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan begin.
What is quite striking in that connection is that the media in Baku are dominated by reports about spectacular dismissals and arrests of members of the government and top officials in the countryâs oil industry.
The official statements and indictments speak of conspiracy with the opposition against the lawful authorities and corruption.
This is not a very uplifting image to take to the ballot boxes.
That is why I am very surprised that the joint draft resolution makes no reference whatever to these recent events.
In this resolution, the opposition is being dismissed, for the sake of public opinion, as a party that is about to carry out a , and, at the same time, President Ilham Aliyev can portray himself as the unimpeachable enforcer of law and order.
No wonder I heard a key expert on Azerbaijan lamenting, last night, that âthose parliamentary elections of 6 November are a waste of time and a waste of money!â
That will definitely not, though, put a stop to his commitment.
He, too, will be travelling to Azerbaijan as an observer.
The same can, this evening, be said of the European institutions, the Commission and this House.
Any electoral improvement is welcome.
Hence my appeal to the Commission and all international organisations involved, in fact, to urgently press for the meticulous registration of all voters (ink marking of the thumb, for example) by the Azerbaijani authorities.
This is a precautionary measure that President Aliyev, in a speech before regional magistrates yesterday, said he would seriously consider.
After all, there has, in the recent past, been no lack of cases of vote rigging, a truly national tradition that is taking on ever more refined forms in Azerbaijan these days.
I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the gagging and marginalising of the democratic opposition in Azerbaijan can, in time, have serious political consequences, not only at national level, but just as much at regional level.
Repressive, authoritarian rule by the regime in power spawns a process of political polarisation and radicalisation among the forces opposing it, which will express themselves in increasing anti-western attitudes.
I would warn the Commission not to underestimate this development.
This radicalisation will manifest itself just as much in growing Islamic aspirations.
This, for example, is evident from an opinion poll held during the winter of 2004-2005, in which 23.2% were in support of the idea of an Islamic state, and another 28.9% welcomed the partial introduction of Islamic law â a vague sign, certainly when set alongside the stricter Islamic regime currently in power in Teheran.
I have to tell the Commission that the wealth of Azerbaijanâs energy resources, or fine talk about such things as democratisation and (geo)political stability, should not temporarily blind us to what Azerbaijan and its people fundamentally lack â the democratic rule of law.
I would urge you and the Council to be clear and forthright in calling the leaders in Baku to account on this matter â never mind the domestic electoral battle â certainly when such heavy charges as planning a and embezzling public funds are brought against prominent citizens.
To sum up, we should, most of all, guard against the murky power game that President Aliyev and his evidently changing are playing today.
That game is about the greedy division among themselves of the richly flowing oil funds and about playing senior party members and reformists off against one other.
European aloofness and a word of caution are really called for here, for the benefit of Azerbaijanâs society.
Â Â  Madam President, the draft resolution presented points out the most pressing problems in Azerbaijan which jeopardise the clean, democratic and pluralistic conduct of the parliamentary elections on 6 November.
It seems that the representatives of the government apparatus state one thing and do another.
In spite of the endeavours made so far by the South Caucasian delegation of the European Parliament, the public law dignitaries, Parliament and the government of Azerbaijan have a strange way of interpreting democracy, the rule of law, state and human rights.
The Head of State and his entourage are ruling autocratically.
As mentioned by the Commissioner, we must note that last week President Aliyev dismissed several highest-ranking government officials or ordered their arrest and detention on remand on charges of attempting to stage a .
Subsequently, at the peak of the campaign, several dozen opposition and civil rights activists were arrested.
All the signs point to the fact that the authority intends to defend its autocracy using its power, and tries to thwart the mass meetings of the opposition.
As Azerbaijan is part of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, it is in our interest to see a fundamental change in the current situation, and the upcoming elections constitute the best opportunity for change.
The European Parliament is interested in the establishment of a multi-party legislation process, ensuring equal opportunities for the opposition.
I believe that the proposal we have tabled is extremely important.
In this proposal, the European Parliament declares that international public opinion only accepts clean, free elections with equal opportunities.
This is not just a warning from the European Parliament to Azerbaijan, but also an important message to the entire South Caucasian region.
And Baku can prove itself on 6 November.
Â Â  Â Â Â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Azerbaijan has strong historical, cultural and economic ties with Europe, and it also has strong European ambitions.
I was able to see this for myself during a recent visit to the country, both from conversations with ordinary people on the street and during talks with political actors.
This was one of the reasons why I welcomed the European Councilâs decision of June last year to include Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia, in the European Neighbourhood Policy.
It is my belief that this policy provides an appropriate framework for the development of mutual and multilateral relations, and for the fulfilment of both Europeâs and Azerbaijanâs ambitions.
If this mutual partnership is to develop and become stronger, certain common values must also be shared, such as respect for human rights, civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law.
Elections are an important measure of respect for these values in any country.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to call on the Azerbaijani authorities to comply with basic electoral principles during the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
These principles include the freedom of association and the freedom of speech, both for government and opposition candidates.
The authorities must also ensure that the elections are conducted in a calm and peaceful atmosphere.
As previous speakers have already mentioned, we are receiving mixed signals in the run-up to these elections.
On the one hand, it is apparent that some progress has been made since the last elections; there are more candidates in general, for example, and also more from independent opposition parties.
On the other hand, however, repressive measures are still being imposed, and the opposition still suffers oppression.
It is my belief that the way in which these elections are conducted will also have an impact on our future actions.
By this I mean that if we are able to ascertain that certain procedures are followed during these elections â and I myself will be a member of the observation mission â then this will have a positive impact on our work on the proposed Action Plan.
If we are left with an overwhelmingly negative impression, then this will have a corresponding effect on our work.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, freedom of speech is one of the key factors in the democracy-building process.
A good indication of the extent to which this freedom has been achieved is the level of freedom enjoyed by the media.
Azerbaijan became a member of the Council of Europe four years ago.
At the time, it undertook to guarantee freedom of speech, the independence of the media and the work of journalists.
We are well aware of such matters, but there is an ongoing need to inform and remind the people of Azerbaijan about the importance of the role played by the media.
We must also remind them about the importance of free and equal access to the media for all citizens and political forces, particularly during electoral campaigns. This includes the campaign conducted in the run-up to the forthcoming November elections.
The fact of the matter is that one of the countryâs best-known journalists, ElmarÂ Huseynov, has been murdered.
NoÂ one took any action to prevent this murder, even though his wife had reported that he was being followed by unknown individuals and many of his friends claimed that he had expected to be murdered.
After the event, PresidentÂ Aliyev announced that it was a serious provocation against the state, and accused the perpetrators of damaging Azerbaijanâs good reputation.
The government even asked other countries for help, but the investigation has yielded no results to date.
Instead, it has resulted in much speculation.
The most widely-read newspapers are still controlled by the government, and the opposition press is only read by a minority.
The newspaper was discontinued after Huseynovâs death, and although his successor has launched a new publication, , he almost immediately came up against enormous problems publishing it.
At present, the publication has a circulation of only 3Â 000.
The editor-in-chief of the newspaper , who is also a member of parliament and head of the Musavat party, is one of the opposition leaders who were imprisoned in OctoberÂ 2003.
Although he has now been pardoned by the President, his editorial team had to stop work due to the enormous pressure exerted by the ruling parties and the excessive fines imposed by the courts.
This is the situation in which the opposition press finds itself in Azerbaijan today, both in general and in the run-up to elections.
Even though state television was privatised several months ago, the main stations still operate in virtually the same way, by which I mean that they exclude the opposition.
Even though new television stations that are in the pipeline are intended to target a wider cross-section of society, there is virtually no chance of them doing so.
In conclusion, there is a chance that free media may one day operate in Azerbaijan.
It is too late, however, to establish a genuinely diverse media landscape before the November elections.
Â Â  â Madam President, mass infringements of democratic freedoms and human rights, the imprisonment of political adversaries and attacks on the free media are undermining the prospects of free and democratic elections being held in Azerbaijan.
We saw during the presidential elections in 2003 that there were serious irregularities.
However, there was no reaction whatsoever from the international community.
How ready is the European Commission today to activate the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement suspension clause for infringements of democratic rights?
The Azeri regime, in breach of the international legal order, is allowing flights to the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus.
The European Commission must be firm and clear in its message to the Azeris.
The same decisive message, about non-participation in European Neighbourhood Policy, must also be sent in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
The release of all political prisoners, respect for the rule of law, the holding of free elections and democratisation of the institutions must be the basic terms for the further development of relations between the European Union and Azerbaijan.
Â Â  . Madam President, I just wish to make a few points about this debate.
The first is that we share the same concerns about this election process.
We have seen that the freedom of the press and freedom of expression are sometimes violated and we must follow this whole process very carefully.
However, I can say that the European Neighbourhood Action Plan â which is not yet ready as we have only just begun negotiations â will provide an opportunity to promote democratic reform.
It will also enable us to make many of our offers conditional upon further democratic reforms and respect for the rule of law.
I agree, however, that with the new oil possibilities, it will not be as easy as we previously thought, because there will be more wealth in the future.
Secondly, I recently held talks with the three countries of the Caucasus in New York during the Millennium Summit and the Ministerial Week.
We also discussed the question of these flights.
We hope that there will be a change.
The situation is very clear and I was very adamant.
We are now waiting for a high-level troika to come back to see how we can start these negotiations on the action plans.
On Nagorno-Karabakh, we are ready to deploy a rehabilitation programme once a settlement is reached on the peace plan.
It seems â and this is what I heard when I spoke to the two ministers â that there are some positive developments.
I hope that this will happen after the Azeri elections, on the one hand, and the Armenian referendum, on the other.
It is a very complicated question.
I myself have often witnessed positive developments, for instance in 2000, when I was chairperson of the OECD.
In the end, a stalemate was reached once again.
However, there are possibilities and we would like to explore them.
Let me also say that we currently have a fully-fledged delegation in Georgia, and a regionalised delegation covering Armenia, while we intend to open a fully-fledged delegation to Azerbaijan in 2007.
We wanted to open a regionalised delegation but the Azeris refused.
They only wanted one of their own.
It is also a financial question regarding funding for the external service.
I hope we will get some funding under heading 4.
Finally, on radical Islamism, our message to President Aliyev was also very clear.
We said that he would really be opening the way for radical Islamism if he did not allow the political opposition any breathing space.
I gather from this debate that we all agree on that.
I hope that the Azeris will hear our message.
Â Â  At the conclusion of the Commissionâs statement, I wish to inform the House that I have received six motions for a resolution(1), which have been submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held on 27 October 2005 at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  Azerbaijan is a strategic partner for Europe in terms of economics, security and foreign policy.
For that reason the EU has welcomed Azerbaijan as a partner in the European Neighbourhood Policy and is following with interest the development of its internal politics.
The upcoming elections are a key moment in the history of Azerbaijan, which will demonstrate the direction in the country wishes to move, and its willingness to follow in the footsteps of other ex-Soviet republics towards greater democratic participation, transparency and freedom of expression.
On the eve of such an event, a certain nervousness is understandable.
I do not, however, consider the attitude the present government has shown up to now to be justifiable.
It seems deliberately to be creating a climate of fear, which is degenerating into violence and unlawful interference in the process of the electoral campaign, as attested to by the withdrawal of various candidates from the list.
Even the decision to use ink to reduce the risk of fraud came late and after too many objections, something that can only cast a bad light over the goodwill of the government to proceed in a clear and transparent way.
The future attitude of the EU, and our receptiveness towards an increasingly fruitful partnership, will depend on how this last electoral week, and above all on how the voting itself, unfold.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0280/2005) by Mrs Anneli JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Barcelona Process revisited (2005/2058(INI)).
Â Â  . Madam President, the area around the Mediterranean is, of the EUâs neighbouring regions, the one which has perhaps had the most influence on the culture and history of the EU countries across the ages.
Our language, our religion, the origin of our words and numbers have their roots in the Mediterranean region.
The region is also strategically important, but most important of all, the countries which lie to the south of the Mediterranean are our neighbours.
But history is history.
1995 marked a turning point in relations between the European Union and its southern neighbours.
It was then that the Barcelona Process began.
Today, 10 years later, Mediterranean policy is one of the main priorities of EU foreign policy.
We might therefore say that in this respect there has been considerable change and development.
Now, 10 years later, however, we should perhaps ask whether we need the Barcelona Process today.
Europe is so different from what it was when the process started.
I believe and am convinced that Parliamentâs unanimous reply will be that we do indeed need this partnership.
Europe needs it, we Europeans need it, and, hopefully, our partners need it, much more than they did when cooperation at this level began.
Nevertheless, we require more effective cooperation, and, indeed, more cooperation.
It pleases me to say that the European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Barcelona Process, and many individual Members of Parliament have done much to take this partnership forward.
Given this situation, I want to mention a few issues which I hope the Barcelona Process will focus on more closely in the future.
One is education.
There is a high level of illiteracy in our partner countries.
We in our own countries stress the importance of education and skills; it is the only way we can succeed.
There the situation is exactly the same.
I would like in particular to emphasise how important it is for young girls and women to have an opportunity to get an education and for the EU to invest in the eventual eradication of illiteracy.
We here in the EU like to stress how important functional democracy is, but before we can expect democracy to work, people have to know how to read.
The ability to read is therefore important for democracy.
Secondly, I would like to raise the matter of economic growth and the reforms relating to it.
The EU has actively supported economic integration and free trade, and is indeed the biggest trading partner with the individual partner countries.
More than 50% of these countriesâ trade is with the EU, while just 13% is with the United States of America.
There is, however, a certain dilemma associated with this.
The brisk trade that exists between the EU and the partner countries is not reflected in any increase in the EUâs political influence.
50% of the trade does not mean that we hold 50% of the influence.
I would also like to emphasise the importance of the work of the Anna Lindh Foundation.
I hope that more time and effort will be invested in this in the years to come, because the dialogue between religions and cultures is important.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that the Barcelona Process has not been entirely successful in this respect, and this needs to be put right.
Migration is one important dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and today it seems that the problems are only increasing, so we also need to invest time and money in this area.
Finally, I would like to say that, as a representative of the Nordic region, it has been an agreeable experience working as rapporteur.
I have learned a lot and I have also observed that that there is a need for dialogue between the cultures of Northern and Southern Europe.
To my surprise, I have realised that at the moment there is not enough of it going on in the European Parliament either.
Â Â  . Madam President, the report that Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki has presented to your House is an outstanding one.
Its title â âThe Barcelona process revisitedâ â may at first sight appear rather surprising, but perhaps I may interpret it as meaning that its concern is with the strengthening and deepening of partnership between Europe and the other Mediterranean states, something that is quite clearly expressed in the motion for a resolution.
The tenth anniversary of the Barcelona process is not just an opportunity to appreciate past successes, which there have been, even though not everything we wanted to achieve has been; it is also particularly necessary that we should look forward, building on the foundations laid by these successes and, with determination and political courage, making full use of the potential of this cooperation for the future.
I agree with Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki when she says that it goes without saying that the Barcelona process will continue to be needed in the future.
It is for that reason that I attach particular importance to the major summit meeting to be held in Barcelona at the end of November, at which Heads of State and Government will, for the first time, be able to have their say on this subject.
The Commission has, at my suggestion, produced a communication of its own, to which I attach particular significance in view of the fact that it takes up the very same points that all of us in this House â for I have heard these same things from you â regard as especially relevant.
There are three main ones, to which I would add culture.
First among these points is political reform, with, above all, the promotion of human rights, democracy and good governance, to which I shall return later.
Second comes education and training; Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki is quite right to say that this is something on which we need to carry on working, an area in which we need to become stronger.
This is a very particular concern of mine and I intend to see that something is done about it.
The third area is that of economic development.
It is in this area that we have achieved perhaps the most successes to date, but it is also one in which we need to make further progress.
I would like to come back to that and discuss it in detail.
There is of course more work for us to do in relation to culture, with the Anna Lindh Foundation, dialogue between civilisations and cultures, and this networkâs potential for extension, being enormously important.
The Commission is of course available to assist in this.
Let me start by considering political reform, democracy and human rights, areas in which we cannot stand aloof, but must endeavour to support reform from outside.
We cannot, of course, impose them; rather, we need to offer firm support and the possibility of supporting measures.
That means that it is very important that the Neighbourhood Policy should build on the Barcelona process in making the right instruments available.
Over recent weeks, I have visited many of these Mediterranean countries â Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon among them â and see with what efficiency we can work with these instruments, even when, as is the case in these countries, human rights issues are addressed under different headings.
We have thought up something special in order to promote human rights, the plan being that we will â we expect from next year onwards, but certainly starting in 2007 â be making available complementary assistance in the form of a âDemocracy Facilityâ.
What that means is that the countries that are making particularly good progress with reform will, by way of support, receive at least an extra 10% on top of the funds that they already receive.
I hope that this will give these countries an incentive to press on with still greater dedication and encourage others, which are currently dragging their heels, to do likewise.
This presupposes the extension and development of the political and security policy aspects of the partnership.
It is because better use needs to be made of the political framework that I regard Parliamentâs meetings in conjunction with Euromed as particularly important, but meetings of the Council of Ministers and meeting in troika format can also help promote further development.
Secondly, it is essential that we consider the vital importance of education, not least in terms of its impact on society.
In the Mediterranean countries, one-third of the population is under 15Â years of age, and that means that we have to focus especially on education.
The UNDP report on human development showed that education, and equal status for women in particular, will help drive development forward.
I have therefore made a special priority of the eradication of illiteracy, bearing in mind the UN millennium statement of intent that this should be done by 2015.
I do hope that we will accomplish that.
I would like to see girls and boys get the same opportunity to be enrolled at the same schools and to receive the same education.
I would also like to see priority given to special support measures for women.
We plan a scholarship programme for this purpose, which will provide, in particular, postgraduate grants for women, with the object of accelerating development in this area.
I also regard the problems surrounding migration as quite central among social issues.
Today, for example, I welcomed Moroccoâs Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Taieb Fassi Fihri, and we did of course discuss current events in Ceuta and Melilla, to which we cannot be indifferent.
We have to work together to arrive at solutions â solutions not only for the European Union as a whole in its relations with the Mediterranean in general, but also for the sub-Saharan states and Africa.
While we must, of course, attempt to cut off people-smuggling, so that people do not become the victims of this terrible trade, we must also create additional development opportunities for these countries so that migratory movements of this kind do not occur.
While refugees must be treated in accordance with the Convention and with absolute respect for their human rights, the flood of illegal refugees must be stemmed, and this is certainly one of the key topics for the Barcelona Summit.
On the economic front, we have done much to ensure normal trade and a free trade zone by 2010, but much more remains to be done about services and agricultural trade, and South-South trade, also known as the Agadir process, must be further developed.
Other vital topics include transport, energy, and the environment.
There will be a conference on transport in December in Marrakesh; on the energy front, more and more sub-regional networks need to be developed.
As regards the environment, the cleanliness of the Mediterranean should be guaranteed as far as possible.
Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteemÃ€ki quite rightly puts particular emphasis on cultural cooperation, to which we, too, want to give greater attention in future.
It is of course a matter of common knowledge that, although the Barcelona process offers the chance to get Israel and Palestine sitting around the same table, that same process is itself constantly overshadowed by the peace process in the Middle East, and so it is essential that we should make headway here.
I have Mr Wolfensohn, the quartet envoy, who has done really good work here and whom we support entirely, in mind when I say that.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating MrsÂ JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki on her report on the Barcelona process revisited.
I would now like to turn to my proposal.
Next month, the European Heads of State or Government will meet their Mediterranean counterparts to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona process.
The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was intended to provide the ambitious prospect of a better, varied future, simultaneously political, economic, social and cultural.
The results, 10 years on, are mixed.
We have created a forum for discussion and cooperation with our Mediterranean neighbours, which I welcome, but we are far from achieving all the objectives set.
The conflict in the Middle East has not been resolved.
The region is still unstable.
Human rights and democratisation are not progressing, or are not progressing enough.
The southern shore of the Mediterranean and its population have not benefited from the expected economic and social well-being.
Unemployment, particularly among young people, is still too high and results in hopeless migration flows.
On the economic front, I will mention just one example: the end of the Multifibre Agreement, which has added to the difficulties experienced by the region.
Although the new rules of cumulative origin, as proposed by Commissioner Mandelson, are moving in the right direction, South-South economic integration is still far from complete.
We are the privileged partner of this region and all its hopes are turned towards us.
Caring about these people primarily means responding to their concerns and their aspirations, in other words our ability to achieve greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development.
The new Neighbourhood Policy proposed to us is a positive element, because it calls for greater democracy, even though the aid will have to be shared more broadly amongst our neighbours to the east and to the south.
I hope that this new policy will pursue the objectives of the Barcelona process and that it will take account of the difficulties specific to this region.
I am also concerned by the absence, in the neighbourhood and partnership instrument as proposed by the Commission, of a specific reference to the Millennium Goals.
In the global environment in which we live, liberalisation cannot be the answer to the problems raised.
That applies to the protection of our environment â given that we are responsible for our planet â but, even more acutely, to the issue of public services that meet the basic needs of the people, namely education, health, culture, and access to water and power, which the Committee on International Trade, of which I am a member, proposed and which the Committee on Foreign Affairs did not adopt.
We agree with the view that our work is not yet done.
Let us be in agreement tomorrow to achieve a common goal.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki on her report and on her willingness to cooperate, which has resulted in a complete motion for a resolution as regards information and political proposals.
The 10-year anniversary of the Barcelona process offers an excellent opportunity for us to take stock and, more importantly, to redefine our political vision and our strategy in the light of the new situation represented by the enlarged European Union, the challenges of globalisation and the increased threat of terrorism.
The Barcelona process deserves our special attention because it is the most integrated expression of the European Union's foreign policy, in that it is a multilateral, global partnership expressed through an integrated strategy.
It is totally connected to the vital interests of the European Union, in that it can contribute towards peace and security in our area and can influence peace and equilibrium in the world.
The results to date are not satisfactory.
Both sides have been guilty of weaknesses and oversights.
There has been a lack of perspicacity, political will, adequate financing and an inability on the part of the partners to promote reforms and cooperation between each other so that they become attractive markets and economies.
What I consider worrying is that this multilateral relationship and procedure has not helped to resolve the chronic problems, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Cyprus question.
It is also worrying that it has not reached the people.
Citizens have not become participants and partners in this process, of which they are ignorant on both sides of the Mediterranean.
They have not become aware of the challenges which require us to live together or of our points in common or even of the substance of our differences.
I trust that the 2005 summit, 10 years after the first summit, will clearly include in its priorities this need to involve civil society in the Barcelona process.
We expect initiatives to be encouraged, such as the Euromed platform mentioned by Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki, and other forms of cooperation at all levels, such as between local authorities, regions and universities.
The mobility of citizens in all social and professional groups must be encouraged.
The role of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference is very important and has already started to prove its worth and we hope that it will contribute to this mutual understanding and forging of a common conscience.
We expect a real dialogue between cultures, in the full meaning of the word, which will not merely be a coming together to exchange business cards, but at which we shall engage in dialogue with a willingness to reveal our differences and find our points in common.
The dialogue between cultures must encompass the full breadth and depth of the word; cultural standards, the interpretation of history, the way of life and the position of women.
I am delighted, Commissioner, that you referred specifically to this, but I would like to point out to you that valuable work has been carried out by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, not only in the opinion attached to the report, but also in a report drafted in 2002, which formed the basis for the first regional women's programme in the Mediterranean which we have today.
What we are calling for is more than just education and jobs. We are calling for a real review of the situation of women and, on the part of the European Commission, for a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results of our policy to date and for the integration of the gender dimension in all three pillars of the Barcelona process.
Â Â  .
Madam President, as rapporteur on the European Neighbourhood Policy, I believe it is clearly in our mutual interests to strengthen ties with our southern Mediterranean partners in North Africa and the Middle East, as formally set up in the Barcelona process 10 years ago on 28Â November.
Along with our US allies, this sends a clear message that we support, in this region, a strengthening of civil society, an open market economy, democratic pluralism and respect for fundamental human rights, including media freedom, independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and, in particular, womenâs rights, as the previous speaker mentioned.
Tunisia is an advanced country in the eyes of the Arab world in this respect.
Environmental cooperation is also one of our priorities.
These countries, and in particular their growing populations, will provide growing markets for our own products.
I believe that it is in the European Unionâs interests to target substantial development aid through the current MEDA Programme, which, I believe, amounts to some EURÂ 3Â billion per year, and eventually through the newly anticipated ENPI â the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument â to assist the Euromed group of countries with enhanced economic growth in order to prevent rising unemployment and rising tensions, which will in turn, from the EU security point of view, provide recruiting grounds for Islamist hardliners.
We have seen that in the recent past during the Moroccan Casablanca bombings, the tragic civil war in recent years in Algeria and the rise of Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in the occupied Palestinian territories.
We must remember, of course, that the tragic Madrid bombings were carried out by Maghribi Salafists.
We must also try to prevent large, uncontrolled migrant flows to the European Union.
Otherwise, this will cause a total breakdown in the good intercommunal relations we enjoy at present.
We all hope for a free trade area by 2010.
The new EuroMed Assembly facilitates dialogue between traditional enemies such as Israel and the Arab world.
This forum uniquely allows them to resolve their problems peacefully.
Israelâs withdrawal from Gaza, in my view, is a good start to putting the roadmap for peace back on the agenda.
This Assembly is also a forum for the exchange of ideas between the Islamic world and the majority-Christian European Union.
I am optimistic about the spread of our democratic values in this region, with the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and Lebanon and now, even, some tentative democratic moves in this direction from Egypt.
On behalf of my political group, I strongly commend the JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki report to the House.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki, who has done so much good work on the drawing up of this report, and who has been so receptive to the amendments that my political group has presented.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner who is here with us so late at night.
It is now ten years since the historic Barcelona Declaration, which led to the first Euro-Mediterranean Summit, which was hosted by Prime Minister Felipe GonzÃ¡lez in his capacity as President-in-Office of the European Union.
The prospect of the Euro-Mediterranean association that was opened up at that time gave us enormous hope.
It is true that the results have been irregular and that there remains much to be done, but it also true that the obstacles and difficulties are and were immense, and it is not reasonable to ignore them.
The Mediterranean, the cradle of European culture, has been and continues to be, in part, a sea of confrontations and conflicts.
The Euro-Mediterranean partnership makes sense if it is the instrument used to remove those obstacles and to promote dialogue and cooperation between North and South, but also to prioritise South-South relations in those regions, which are greatly weakened.
With regard to the Summit in November in Barcelona, Barcelona + 10, the important thing is to establish clear, viable and realistic priorities, which at the same time must be ambitious.
We now have a reference framework, which is the alliance of civilisations, proposed by Prime Minister Zapatero and adopted by the United Nations, by means of the statement by its Secretary-General in July of this year.
A necessary condition for achieving the objectives is a reduction in the tension in the region, in particular the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the real Achilles heel of Euro-Mediterranean relations.
The main objective of this association is to create an area of shared prosperity, making progress on reducing poverty, overcoming the socio-economic gap between North and South, and, as has been said, promoting political reforms, democratisation and the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Many other issues have been arising in this debate: the problem of the management of migratory flows, discrimination against women, the serious environmental problems facing the , dialogue amongst the three monotheistic religions, the need for local and regional cooperation, the fight against terrorism, control of weapons of mass destruction, participation by populations, etc. But above all â and I will end here â the European Union and the Member States are particularly affected by the need for huge amounts of political will and economic commitment and to truly believe that, in relation to Euro-Mediterranean relations, we have a lot at stake.
The Mediterranean is the European Unionâs most vulnerable flank and if we do not take this issue seriously, we will pay the price in the future.
Â Â  Madam President, in the run-up to its tenth anniversary, there is every reason to evaluate the Barcelona Process.
The world today does look very different to the way it did ten years ago.
We have had enlargement involving, for example, Cyprus, and have begun negotiations with Turkey and Croatia.
The Neighbourhood Policy has been developed, and we have seen how, in many of our partnership countries, democratisation has progressed and, in certain others, unfortunately taken a step backwards.
The fight against terrorism has become ever more important.
The war in Iraq and the difficult process that Iraq is now going through on its way to democracy also has an impact on relations with the region as a whole.
We have Iran and the problems surrounding the policy on nuclear fuel in that country.
We have the Palestinian election and the withdrawal from Gaza but, at the same time, stagnation in the peace process.
The exciting events in Lebanon and Syria and the ongoing tragic situation in Africaâs last colony, Western Sahara, show that there is still a very great deal indeed to be done in the region.
In the light of this, it is only natural to review and debate the Barcelona Process.
It has created structures, and extremely important ones at that, and a form of more securely established cooperation between us.
The association agreements with all the countries have led to more interchange, trade, projects and many shared fora, and it has given rise to a long-term commitment for the whole of the EU.
Proof of this lies in the fact that there are Members from the whole of Europe, and not just from the south, debating in the Chamber this evening.
We have a common history and culture and also common problems and solutions to those problems.
The areas concerned, of which there are indeed many, include terrorism, migration, growth, development, trade, the environment and energy.
Above all, however, the issues for the future are those of human rights and democracy.
These are the most important areas of all and, in these, the Barcelona Process has in many ways failed.
Even though the association agreements contain human rights clauses, these are not used because we have no sound mechanisms for dealing with serious human rights violations in the countries with which we cooperate.
There is also sometimes quite limited interest in the issue.
These areas present the big challenge for the Barcelona Process in the future.
We must restructure the whole of our cooperation so that it becomes a framework for a huge push for democratisation throughout the region.
Nothing contributes more to stability than the transition to democracy.
The least free countries in the whole world are concentrated in the Middle East region, and this creates a breeding ground for fanaticism, frustration and perhaps also terrorism.
That is why, within the Barcelona Process, we must form strategies that push for extensive democratisation.
We must support dissidents, civil society, freedom of expression and communities founded on the rule of law, etc. The means for doing all this are, of course, trade, interchange, educational programmes and cultural cooperation.
The Barcelona Process must in that way become a type of alternative for countries that can never become EU Members.
It must provide practical advantages in exchange for our requiring reforms.
If we succeed in bringing this about, we shall have made an historic contribution.
In conclusion, I wish to commend my colleague, MrsÂ JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki, for her very constructive report.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, I think that MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m and yourself, Commissioner, have, like others, put your finger on an issue on which the Barcelona process has not kept all its promises.
I am referring, of course, to the issue of human rights and democracy.
If you are not convinced, you simply have to take stock of the situation regarding freedom of the press in the regionÂ â this was done at the invitation of MrsÂ Patrie this afternoonÂ â or the situation regarding freedom of expression in Tunisia, on the eve of the World Summit on the Information Society.
The proof can be seen in the number of violations of the rights to freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly; a justice system that suffers major deficiencies in many countries; the torture which is commonplace, or even virtually systematic, in some countries, and the defenders of human rights who, all over the world, are the victims of numerous violations of their rights and are subject to a great deal of harassment.
The Barcelona process has therefore not kept all its promises on these issues.
As MrsÂ JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki said, I believe that it has some shortcomings with regard to womenâs rights, economic and social rights and the mechanisms put in place for an effective policy regarding democracy and human rights.
Despite all that, the Barcelona process has made it possible to institute mechanisms and forums for political dialogue on these issues, and has therefore laid the necessary foundations to launch an ambitious policy of promoting human rights and democracy.
You said, Commissioner, that the issue of immigration would be at the heart of the discussions at the Barcelona Summit.
Allow me, in this regard, to draw your attention to one point.
I think that, with regard to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, we are encouraging countries to break international law.
That is pretty clear and it has just been illustrated once again by the incidents at Lampedusa involving Libya, and more recently by the incidents in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila and in Morocco.
By asking these countries to stem the flow of sub-Saharan refugees, we are encouraging and urging them to commit human rights violations.
Before we try to quell the flood of those we call âillegal immigrantsâ, Europe itself has to define its legal immigration policy.
However, you will be aware that we are making hardly any progress on this issue.
I am convinced that civil society and Members of Parliament can help to improve the implementation of our policies on human rights and democracy in this region.
That is why I very much hope that the Commission will be present in Rabat for the next extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for her hard work on this report, and also the Commissioner, for the words of hope she offered on this tormented area of the Mediterranean.
In 1995, an irreversible process was begun in Barcelona, which aimed at closer cooperation between countries in the Mediterranean area.
Pessimists will tell us that the results have been below expectations, that economic progress in southern Mediterranean countries has been insufficient, that political dialogue has been difficult and fragmented, that Europe has not been able to make itself heard properly with regard to human rights and democracy, that South-South economic cooperation is still in its infancy, and that results have not been satisfactory in terms of joint management of immigration.
The international geopolitical landscape of todayâs Mediterranean has certainly changed, and the ambitious project of the Barcelona Process must therefore be modified and adapted to this new international context if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is to meet the current challenges.
Let us begin, however, with what has been done.
We have set up joint inter-ministerial cooperation mechanisms â which will receive no further debate â for the common resolution of problems in that particular area.
We have established a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to supplement governmental cooperation, in which we work together under parliamentary rules.
We have initiated a support programme worth EUR 700 million a year â MEDA â in order to channel resources and development between north and south, which today has achieved some quite attractive rates of implementation.
We have set in motion the democratic process, which has started anyway, in coastal countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and, to a certain extent, Palestine.
Association agreements have been signed between the European Union and all the southern Mediterranean countries, and there have of course been plenty of examples of cooperation, seemingly minor but very effective on a cultural level, which were all initiated within the wider framework of the Barcelona Agreement.
All that has allowed us to understand one another better, whilst opening the door with a certain optimism to a second decade, when we must consolidate the positive aspects of the process, make more concrete our objectives and current planning, and correct any mistakes made, so that stability, peace, democracy and socio-economic progress may be results shared by an ever greater number of countries and citizens in the Mediterranean area.
One final point I wish to raise is the issue of culture, which is not only about education and training, but also about cultural heritage.
If we safeguard our cultural heritage we can understand and respect each another better within the context of our own identities and diversity.
Â Â  Madam President, the Mediterranean region is important for the Member States and for the European Union as a whole.
It is clear that the countries of the southern flank do not enjoy the same level of political development and/or economic prosperity.
Nevertheless, the majority of these countries have to deal with various shortcomings, to a greater or lesser degree: political shortcomings, lack of democratic development and limited pluralism; economic shortcomings, because we are talking about antiquated economies, which do not have the capacity to generate employment for a growing population and are not sufficiently attractive to bring in the necessary foreign investment; and social shortcomings, high poverty and social inequality, illiteracy, discrimination against women â as has been mentioned â the public institutionsâ lack of capacity, with negative consequences in terms of health, education, the economy, border control, and many other things.
The Mediterranean region must therefore be treated as a priority by the Union, not only due to the many historical, political, economic and social ties linking the countries of both flanks, but also for other reasons, such as security, including the terrorist threat, or the challenge of immigration.
Cooperation between both flanks is therefore essential and must cover a very broad range of activities.
Cooperation must operate in both directions â I repeat â in both directions.
The problems of these neighbouring countries affect us, ours is a shared future; it is impossible to create a wall between the north and the south of the Mediterranean, especially in todayâs globalised world.
We must therefore enhance our relations with these countries, stimulate them and help them to overcome the shortcomings that I referred to earlier.
The report that we will approve tomorrow therefore insists on the need for political, economic, social and institutional modernisation and also improvements in relation to human rights.
In this regard, I welcome the Commissionerâs words and the importance she attaches to these issues.
We need impetus for reform â and I believe that we should all agree on this â on the southern flank.
The European Union must not concern itself solely with the stability of those countries; stability cannot ultimately become an excuse for not moving forward.
If we insist on the need for reforms in our countries, how can we not insist on the need for reforms in their countries?
These countries must evolve.
Otherwise, the problems will increase, and political and economic crises â including in the field of immigration and security â will only increase and ultimately it will be a lack of reform that brings instability.
Hence the importance of the Barcelona Process and the European Neighbourhood Policy.
They must be fundamental instruments for the Union with a view, firstly, to demonstrating to those countries that they are priorities within our foreign action and, naturally, to helping them, to demanding that they also cooperate faithfully with us on resolving these problems affecting us and, finally, in order to stimulate them towards reform.
A reform that can bring prosperity, freedom and, ultimately, more stability for these countries and hence for the whole of the Mediterranean basin.
I would like the next Barcelona Summit to be up to the challenge and I would of course like to end by thanking Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki for her efforts.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like quickly to highlight three aspects of this process.
The first is the connection between the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Neighbourhood Policy, which was raised by the Commissioner.
I believe this aspect must not lead us to focus solely on bilateral action plans, but should encourage us to create a geographical and political space that is both European and Mediterranean.
The principal means of all that is the political dimension, which has increased, it must be said, because the European Parliament has contributed to the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the civil societies have set up the civil forum.
What is missing are the governments.
Where are the governments?
I believe that to move forward with this process we need parliaments, societies and governments to engage somewhat more in dialogue, which in turn will enable us to create a more advanced human rights dimension.
Finally, the sociologist Edgard Morin is quite right when he points out that it is not cultures, religions and civilisations that engage in dialogue, but people, individuals, men and women.
I believe that the most serious limitation in all the years of this very generous and intelligent process has been the failure to make our different societies relate to each other, and because of that, terrorism and immigration today threaten to widen the gulf even further.
I agree with our rapporteur when she says we must reinforce all the programmes and instruments that foster dialogue and understanding â and hence education, culture, training and information â between our societies.
In short, we support our rapporteur because her report moves in that direction, and because Euro-Mediterranean politics need less rhetoric and a great deal more substance.
Â Â  Madam President, for the past few years the European Union has been watching the countries of eastern and central Europe carefully.
Most of the Unionâs attention has been focused on enlargement, the new accession process and future enlargement.
Unfortunately, southern Europe and the southern basin of the Mediterranean often only received attention when problems or specific issues arose â as when thousands of immigrants arrived in Ceuta, Melilla or Lampedusa, or when the situation became extremely difficult for the western Saharan refugees in Tindouf.
The human rights situation in the southern and eastern southern basin of the Mediterranean has not improved.
There are no clear improvements in this field, or in democracy, freedom and transparency.
I must point out that economic differences have also increased over the years.
In the European Union, Member States continue to be keenly attached to their bilateral relations with governments south of the Mediterranean.
This clearly makes the partnership less coherent.
This is an old problem of European politics not being able to act with a single voice, even in the relationship with such strategic areas as the area south of the Mediterranean.
There is still the recurring question as to who is going to pick up the phone and speak on behalf of Europe.
I must mention another important deficiency in our intercultural dialogue. Some very important cultures and languages are ostracised and not represented.
I should like to mention the Amazigh language and culture, which is neglected and even banned in several countries in northern Africa, and the Catalan language and culture.
I hope that the next meeting in Barcelona will be an opportunity to achieve more visible and concrete results in a short time.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, the enlargement of the European Union automatically increased the number of countries with a stake in the Barcelona process.
I should like to stress that this process is of importance not only for Malta and Cyprus, but also for the Central and Eastern European countries.
Whereas some of the reasons for this are historical, others are very much more up-to-date and practical.
As recently as 20Â years ago, the average Pole regarded Libya as the only Mediterranean country with which Poland maintained close relations.
At the time, relations between the European Communities and the country were a great deal less friendly.
Thousands of Poles worked in Libya, and a huge number of copies of Gaddafiâs âGreen Bookâ were published in Polish translation.
The situation today is entirely different.
Tens of thousands of Polish tourists visit Tunisia and Egypt every year, and a considerable number of Poles go on pilgrimages to Israel.
Polish scientists are engaged in research in all the countries of the region, from Syria to Morocco.
This is why it is not only politicians and diplomats who take an interest in the broad concept of the Neighbourhood Policy, but also large sections of the populations in the new Member States.
Problems relating to illegal immigration, respect for human rights, equal rights for women, the advancement of democracy and the economic development of the countries around the Mediterranean Basin have become our problems too.
Europe never has been and doubtless never will be an isolated island.
Our relations with our closest neighbours are a measure of our solidarity and responsibility. By this I mean solidarity not only in terms of a duty towards partners within the European Union, but also in terms of a task that goes far beyond the borders of Europe and takes us everywhere that people desire peace, stability, the rule of law, economic growth and freedom.
The European Union will benefit from the genuine implementation of as many of these values as possible in the countries neighbouring us to the south and east.
The new EU Member States very much want to become involved in building a political partnership concerned with security, as well as an economic and financial partnership and a social, cultural and humanitarian partnership.
Â Â  Madam President, the Euro-Mediterranean process is ten years old and the first conclusion to draw is that, had it not existed, it would have to be invented urgently, quite simply because, as the report by our rapporteur Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki states, despite its shortcomings, it has been a success.
It was an unimaginable challenge: to resolve the structural and historical problems of the Mediterranean countries in one decade.
But we have been working hard and we are beginning to find a solution to some of those problems.
I therefore believe that the objective of a free trade area by 2010, rather than being a final objective, must be a stepping stone from which to move forward, and many other things must be added.
We must enhance, at the same time as reforming, the Euro-Mediterranean process; we must stress the fundamental idea that inspired it and, in this case, transform potential achievements into a tangible reality.
Furthermore, the international situation demonstrates that the Euro-Mediterranean process is the best way to promote cooperation.
Other strategies, based on aggression and threats, do not yield results.
Nevertheless, the premium for moving forward, which is at the heart of this Euro-Mediterranean process, is proving to be effective.
For example, I chaired the Delegation of European Parliament Observers at the legislative elections in the Lebanon, a Euro-Mediterranean partner; there have been elections, with problems, it is true, but there have been elections.
And in other States as well, democratic progress has been made, although regrettably, in others, nothing is changing.
Let us move forward in democracy, human rights and equality.
I would naturally like to stress the good aspects of your proposal.
Let us also consider that we need a Euro-Mediterranean area of freedom, security and justice, let us accompany the free trade area with the essential concept of economic, social and territorial cohesion, which is as valid for our partners as it is for us, and let us also promote political participation.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an extraordinary success.
