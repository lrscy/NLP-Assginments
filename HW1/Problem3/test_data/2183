We need good neighbours, cooperating partner states.
The more countries living in peace, stability and prosperity we have in our neighbourhood, the safer we will be ourselves.
The reason I still asked for the floor is that in my opinion, the importance of the good neighbourhood policy far exceeds the interpretation currently given to it by the European Union.
In our current thinking, forced enlargement plays a much more serious part than the neighbourhood policy.
Certain countries can never become members of the European Union, others are given vague promises, and others yet are regarded by some as privileged.
I believe that it would be wiser to develop some sort of special partner status, and deepen the neighbourhood policy.
Rather than accepting some countries and punitively ignoring others, we should be thinking in terms of a good neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  . The EU must not overlook its duty to champion respect for international law and the development of a social market economy.
We therefore need to shape the EUâs image in the world, by giving the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) a central role in maintaining constructive relations with those nearest to us, in order to build an area of peace and prosperity.
I voted in favour of the Tannock report, on account of the importance that it attaches to Article 6 of the Maastricht Treaty as a cornerstone of the ENP, whilst making it clear that this policy is not an alternative to membership of the EU.
Lastly, I welcome the recognition of the contribution made by future partners such as Cape Verde to our common fight against terrorism, illegal arms trafficking, poverty and human slavery.
This recognition arises from the excellent geo-strategic positions adopted by these partners and the fundamental reforms that many of them have undertaken, not to mention the long-standing cultural and historical affinity with mainland Europe and with the outermost regions, including those in the Atlantic, owing to their geographical proximity.
Â Â  Generally speaking, the June List supports the EUâs neighbourhood policy because it is aimed at strengthening democracy and promoting trade and prosperity in countries within the EUâs immediate vicinity.
We are therefore voting in favour of the report in the final vote.
We believe that the instruments for the neighbourhood policy need to be flexible and cost-effective. There must be clear requirements for following up the results.
The neighbourhood policy should be limited to issues concerning cooperation on trade, democracy and human rights.
It must not, as it is at present, be used for extending the EUâs sphere of interest through the common foreign and security policy.
Â Â  . The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is indicative of the high importance that the EU attaches to the construction of future relations with its neighbours, whether or not they are candidate countries for EU accession.
It is certainly in the EUâs interest to promote democratic development in its immediate neighbourhood.

The ENP should draw up a clearer strategy for relations with our neighbours that will contribute towards building and developing a common area of peace, stability, security, respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and prosperity, and will offer partner countries privileged relations and a prominent position in the EUâs external relations with other regions of the world.
I support the rapporteurâs proposals highlighting the need to increase funding for the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) in order to address the problem of access to the internal market, to set out a clear strategy to combat international terrorism and organised crime, to improve legislation on energy networks and transport networks, and to cooperate on environmental issues.
Lastly, special prominence should be given to energy policy, given that the EU is surrounded by the biggest oil and natural gas reserves in the world.
Â Â  . I welcome this report.
The European Neighbourhood Policy is a key strategy for the enlarged EU for establishing structured relations with all its new eastern and southern neighbours, the aim of defending and affirming the common values of democracy, respect for human rights and the development of common policies
Â Â  . The report, which this House has voted on today, by the British Conservative MEP Charles Tannock, reinforces once more the outlines of the EUâs neighbourhood policy, which is intended to pursue the EUâs geopolitical interests while being cloaked in rhetoric about human rights.
1.
The intention is that the EUâs neighbourhood policy should be a means towards creating a geopolitical sphere of influence for the European Union and its Member States, its efforts being aimed at the creation of âprivileged partnershipsâ for the neighbouring countries, including those of the South Caucasus.
2.
The report is quite frank about the geostrategic direction of the neighbourhood policy being towards securing the supply of raw materials for the EU.
âEnergy policyâ is to be an important theme in the EUâs neighbourhood policy, as the EU âis surrounded by the worldâs most important reserves of oil and natural gas (Russia, the Caspian basin, the Middle East and North Africa)â.
It repeatedly emphasises the geostrategic significance of such transit countries as Georgia and Armenia.
4.
The plan is that the EUâs influence should be underpinned by bringing about regime change in Belarus and elsewhere.
All that is needed is to consider the different treatment meted out to Belarus and Uzbekistan, the latter of which tolerates the presence of EU Member Statesâ military bases, such as the German one in Termez, for it to become clear that the primary concern here is with the extension of the EUâs sphere of influence.
5.
In terms of military policy, too, the neighbouring countries are being locked in to the EU, the idea being that they should be able to take part in military interventions and participate in the military structures of the EU.
Â Â  . The EU has everything in place to be an important player on the international stage; not in the way that some would wish, but certainly an important body in international relations.
This idea came from the European Neighbourhood Policy â in both formal and substantive terms â given that, in my view, it is close to home that the EU can and should play its main role on the international stage.
Whilst I am in favour of greater enlargement, I am also aware of the finite nature of the process and of the fact that, come what may, it will always be necessary to develop policy aimed at promoting a vast area of peace, stability and prosperity around us.
This is both a geo-strategic necessity and a moral obligation.
I therefore feel it is vitally important for Parliament to keep a close eye on this policy â and the corresponding financial framework â because this is one area in which it is possible to translate words into action.
The Mediterranean experience may not augur well, but there have been other, more positive, experiences, and we should be drawing on those.
Â Â  . Cape Verde is a perfect example of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and has deep-rooted historical, political, cultural and geographical ties with the EU.
This puts it in a unique and privileged position for developing closer ties between Europe and Africa.
The country is also a stable and secure outpost of the European area.
Although it is Europeâs Southeast Atlantic border, Cape Verde has been included in other programmes that, in themselves, neither reflect the countryâs actual proximity, nor recognise its identification with the values we share, such as the rule of law, the promotion of good neighbourly relations and the principles of the market economy and sustainable development.
It is well known that the first contact has been made by the government and the largest opposition party in Cape Verde, to argue the countryâs case for obtaining special status or establishing a partnership with the EU.
The inclusion of the country in the Neighbourhood Policy could prove an important step in this direction.
Cape Verde could also represent a vital counterweight in the policy, which would be all the poorer were it narrowly centred on the Unionâs southern and eastern borders.
I welcome the adoption of Amendments 36 and 38.
Â Â  . I myself have seen in various countries the EU neighbourhood policy in action, and it is vital that this policy area be maintained so that our area of democracy and freedom can be extended.
The EU is more outward looking than it is often given credit for, and while the past years have seen internal preoccupations claiming the most headlines, most of the achievements have been external, often behind the scenes.
It is vital that these actions are continued and I was pleased to support this resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, the fact that the Estrela report is certainly not the worst report we have approved in the history of this Parliament is of course a consequence of our fundamental agreement on the heart of the matter.
Women have the right to be integrated into the normal working processes as the equals of men in every respect, with, moreover, the right to equal pay for equal work, although it is common knowledge that there is still a need for more progress in this area.
On that, then, we are in agreement.
I do, however, want to point out that, in every European Union Member State, a remarkably large number of women freely choose to work at home among their own family, and that even more women would be willing to take that option if it were financially feasible.
Part-time work and good childcare facilities are partial solutions, but the introduction of full parental pay for those who work at home or have small children would be a very good step to take.
In addition to that, it has to be said that there needs to be a solution to the issue of pensions rights and to the social security arrangements of parents working at home for all or part of the time, whose contribution to society is of incalculable value.
Â Â  We voted in favour of AmendmentÂ 19.
We interpret the concept âguaranteed minimum incomeâ, which appears in the above-mentioned amendment, as involving a guaranteed reasonable standard of living, as we are well-disposed to the idea of a guaranteed reasonable standard of living but opposed to the introduction of state-regulated minimum wages.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues fully support the principle of equal opportunities between men and women.
We strongly believe that women as well as men have an important role to play in achieving the economic goals of the Lisbon strategy which must be to secure long-term economic growth and high employment levels.
However, we have abstained in this report as we believe the measures identified are so prescriptive that they would achieve little in the way of the desirable goals of improving the position of women in the day-to-day economic life of the Member States of the EU.
Men and women require, above all, to work in societies where economic growth leads to more and better career and job opportunities, thus enabling the higher degree of social provision this report states it wishes to see.
Â Â  . The aim of the EUâs economic, social and environmental renewal, as projected in the Lisbon Strategy, was to turn Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
As I wholeheartedly endorse these objectives, my concerns lie principally with the fact that European families still face inequalities in our societies.
These must be fought in order to help people reconcile their work, family and private lives.
This is the only way in which we can build a society geared towards lifelong education and training, at the root of which is ensuring that our citizens are knowledgeable and well-informed.
I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report.
Â Â  . Social inclusion and respect for gender equality are fundamental principles underpinning the Lisbon Strategy.
These principles, however, have yet to be anything more than good intentions.
With regard to gender equality, the situation is most alarming: different levels of employment, salary, access to and progress in the labour market, education, participation in vocational training programmes.
Women also have greater difficulty in reconciling working life and family life.
Equal treatment should be a key principle of Community law, yet we must translate political principles into practical action.
The diagnosis has long been known.
It is always the same problem: the Member States lack the courage and the determination to implement the solutions that have been identified.
The financial perspective, in the form in which it was adopted by the Council, did not augur well, in terms of the swingeing cuts to the funds most closely linked with the Lisbon Strategy.
I sincerely hope that the talks between Parliament, the Commission and the Council succeed in limiting the damage already done.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on disability and development.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, there are more than 600Â million disabled people in the world, and over 400Â million of them live in developing countries.
Many disabled people are kept out of sight, insofar as their fellow citizens refuse to recognise the problem.
In general, the disabled are also poor.
They tend to be denied their fundamental rights such as education and work, and to be prevented from developing self-esteem.
Clearly, however, the disabled do have the potential to be actively involved in developing their countries.
It is often the case that development aid is not directly linked to the problems of the disabled.
This means that the latter are condemned to social exclusion, marginalised, and become caught up in the vicious circle of poverty and disability.
In this connection it is worth bearing in mind that disability and poverty are often related.
The relationship works both ways.
Disability increases the likelihood of poverty, whilst poor living conditions and a life of poverty increase the likelihood of disability emerging.
One of the reasons why disability has not been given the attention it deserves may be a failure to understand and appreciate the potential of what might seem a powerless group, namely the disabled and their families.
Taking the large number of disabled people into account, the short-term cost of their education and integration is bound to lead to economic gain for the disabled in the longer term, and for their families and for society as a whole too.
In addition it should be noted that unfortunately the Millennium Development Goals also fail to take account of the needs of the disabled.
In practice, neither cross-sectoral nor sectoral programmes make adequate provision for the disabled.
Programmes aimed specifically at the disabled tend to be very small, and to have little impact on national or international strategies for combating poverty or for development.
This should be remedied.
We must remember that development also involves integrating individuals who have been excluded, such as the disabled, and making it possible for them to lead full and active lives.
This means enabling them to attend schools, bring up their children, access health services and therapies, and be active members of society.
The disabled have the right to break out of the vicious circle of poverty and disability.
Â Â  The number of disabled people in the world is vast.
I will take the opportunity of Mr Bowisâ question to focus on two categories of preventable disability in the developing world: child blindness and explosive amputation.
As we sit here today, there are approximately one million blind children in the world whose loss of sight could have been prevented; one of the most important causes being easily and cheaply treatable eye infections.
At the cost of a few million euros, probably amounting to only a small fraction of one percentage point of our budget, we could have prevented one million children from living in total darkness for the rest of their lives.
I dare propose that in addition to the WHO campaign VISIONÂ 2020, we attempt to set up and fully finance an EU âStop Child Blindness Nowâ task force with the aim of eradicating preventable paediatric blindness, as soon as possible, and certainly much sooner than 2020.
Equally disturbing is the situation with the catastrophic effect of landmines.
Many thousands of children in developing countries have had their legs and arms traumatically amputated as a result of landmine explosions.
Before this parliamentary debate is finished, the chances are that a few children somewhere in Asia, Africa or South America will have their limbs blown to pieces by these satanic devices.
We know very well which countries manufacture, sell and use landmines, yet we do not do enough to stop them and punish them for their evil doings.
I dare propose that such countries should be blacklisted as soon as possible and drastic measures, such as a total economic embargo, should be imposed on them by our Union and preferably, if possible, by the whole international community.
Child blindness and landmine-related loss of limbs in children are two forms of serious disability in the developing world that can be prevented to a very large degree, if we show willingness and determination so to do.
Commissioner, please make the drastic proposal necessary to reduce these forms of disability and be sure that you will have the full support of our Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank MrÂ Bowis and the various speakers for having truly highlighted an issue which is too often forgotten and which illustrates particularly serious aspects of the human dramas that come with poverty.
The education of disabled children, for example, is an integral part of education strategies in many developing countries, such as Uganda or Ethiopia.
This issue is systematically dealt with within the framework of the programming and implementation dialogue between the Commission and the governments of the partner countries.
I must say that the discussion that we have held today has come just at the right moment.
From next week, and until April, I shall be visiting all of the regions that correspond to the regional organisations.
I shall therefore be debating, discussing and defining and also listening to individual countries and regional organisations in order to tryÂ âÂ as I had promised in the general development policy statement â to help our partners to develop or to propose coherent programmes that are genuinely convergent.
That is not an easy task, because each partner keeps to its own domain.
I must tell you, MrÂ Bowis, that I entirely share your view: so far, in the poor countries where many people are suffering, disabled people have been a category apart.
For example, I have discovered genuine dramas, the extent of which is unimaginable, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is normal for people to indulge in the hunting of âchild-witchdoctorsâ.
These are the children known as âchild-witchdoctorsâ simply because they are street children, who live alone and who are hunted down as if they were animals.
It is horrific!
I have held political dialogue with the DRC and certain local associations on programmes which will be funded with a view to combating this phenomenon.
I have seen and met these children.
It is absolutely horrendous; there is no way to describe it.
Not only do they suffer from physical handicaps, but sometimes also from mental handicaps.
Armed, therefore, with the road map, the guidelines and the motion for a resolution that you will undoubtedly adopt, I promise you that I will make a point of dealing with this issue in all of the seminars and bilateral meetings that I hold in each country.
In the country strategy papers, I shall ask for programmes and projects to be proposed directly involving these children and these disabled people.
I believe that this has come at a really good time and I thank you for drawing my attention to this problem, because in the heat of action, we tend to neglect certain issues, and though it is true that the partner countries must make proposals, we must also make our own suggestions.
Our partners usually focus on the problems which they see as priorities, but they ignore the marginal categories, the rejects, with all the dramatic consequences that that implies.
On my return from these working visits on the country strategy papers, therefore, the objective of which is to produce a proposal on programming common to the Member States and the Commission, with a view to becoming more effective and consistent in the definition of our development programme, I propose that I present you with a report.
I shall produce a report to Parliament at the beginning of April on the proposals or projects to which we have committed ourselves and, together, we shall evaluate the programme and any progress that has been made.
I do not believe I can offer you anything more: I promise that I will use your motion for a resolution as a speaking note, and you will then judge whether any significant progress has been made.
I promise to be systematic in the steps I take and to report to you objectively.
I promise that I will do everything in my power to convince the partner States to make this dramatic issue an essential element of their social policy, of their education policy and of their cultural policy.
I know of certain cultural projects aimed at groups of disabled people which have enabled young people to express themselves through art. There is a whole range of possibilities, and I can assure you that it is in no way a one-off appeal that I am making.
You have made me very much more aware of this problem to which we often do not pay sufficient attention.
I hope that, in April, I will be able to show you that the work of Parliament and the initiatives you have taken have not fallen on deaf ears: your proposal will be given the full place it deserves, since I am convinced that this is a just cause.
Â Â  To end the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1) in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this afternoonâs votes.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Peru: extradition and trial of former President Alberto Fujimori(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Alberto Fujimori, the ex-President of Peru, found refuge in Japan after his government was accused of a number of corruption and human rights abuse charges.
Numerous extradition attempts were turned down by Japan, but unexpectedly Mr Fujimori turned up in Chile recently as part of a strange attempt to return to political life in Peru.
Subsequently the Peruvian Attorney-General requested his extradition from Chile in order to face a total of 12 charges, including using a death squad to kill 25 people in two separate incidents.
We welcome and support the extradition of Mr Fujimori to Peru so that he may face the serious charges against him in a court of law and, if found guilty, be punished accordingly and appropriately.
At the same time, I cannot help querying in my mind why it is that, although we expect extradition from Chile to take place, we were not so demanding on extradition from Japan when it was repeatedly requested in the past.
Â Â  Mr President, as the panel indicates, I am co-author of a motion signed by various groups supporting the extradition from Chile to Peru of the fugitive former dictator, Fujimori.
This is to be done on the grounds of defending human rights, combating impunity and also helping to strengthen democracy in Peru.
The combined evidence and documentation, provided not just by the Peruvian Government and judicial authorities, but also by international human rights organisations, is so overwhelming in relation to the murders, torture, corruption and abuse of power attributable to the former President Fujimori who, over ten years of authoritarian government, many of them under a dictatorial system, oppressed the Peruvian people that I believe that this extradition will take place, particularly in view of the enormous prestige of the Chilean judicial system.

Nevertheless, the fact that an institution like the European Parliament is supporting this process is also undoubtedly going to help create an internationalist climate of cooperation between the two countries, whose relations are not easy, and this would be a step in the right direction.
We have therefore helped support this resolution, and I am doing so now through my words and my vote.
Â Â  Mr President, it is important to understand that the resolution that the European Parliament is going to approve this afternoon is not directed against anybody.
On the contrary, the Chilean Government and judiciary have acted in an exemplary fashion.
The Peruvian Government has complied fully with its obligations by requesting that a fugitive from justice be extradited in order to face the many outstanding charges against him.
Specifically over recent days we have witnessed a good example of democratic maturity in Chile, where the opposition candidate has sportingly acknowledged his defeat and made a point of personally congratulating the President-elect.
We should not therefore be surprised that, following a model transition, Chile has become a benchmark for progress and growth, as well as for stability and democratic normality.
The European Union, and this Parliament in particular, have also expressed their solidarity with the cause of democratic consolidation in Chile.
It was my privilege to head a mission of Members of the European Parliament that attended the presidential election in 2000.
For this reason, and on the basis of a request from the competent Peruvian authorities, I would ask, Commissioner, that the Union send a mission of electoral observers to the coming presidential elections in Peru in order to demonstrate our solidarity with the cause of democratic consolidation in that country.
Mr President, nothing could be more logical in this context than the resolution that the European Parliament is going to approve this afternoon, the only purpose of which is once again to stress as emphatically as possible that, in a democracy, laws are designed specifically to be obeyed and that nobody either can or should be above the law.
Â Â  . Mr President, the last two presidents of Peru, Fujimori and Toledo, presented themselves as miracle-workers and as saviours of the country.
Each of them thereby managed to win the voters over once, only thereafter to leave them disappointed.
Mr Fujimori himself makes no secret of his opposition to parliamentary democracy and ruled with disregard for the wishes of the electorate.
That is in itself a good enough reason to punish him and deny him a second chance of leadership; the attempt to get rid of him by reason of his Japanese background has far less to commend it.
It is reminiscent of the method that was used against the former Zambian President Nkomo, whose ancestry was used as an excuse to deny him the right, having been defeated once, to stand again.
Having committed his misdeeds, Fujimori fled first to Japan and then tried to come back by way of Chile, evidently under the illusion that the great mass of Peruvians wanted to be led by a dictator and that they would return him to power.
Now, throughout Latin America, presidents of a better sort are being elected.
Fujimoriâs miscalculation offers an outstanding opportunity to make it clear that even former presidents can be punished for their abuses of power.
We are justified in insisting that he be put on trial in Peru.
Â Â  Mr President, in Latin America, dictators are gradually falling and democrats coming to power.
I am particularly pleased that the abilities of progressive Latin American women are beginning to be recognised and that they are being democratically elected as Heads of State.
Good luck, President Bachelet.
The challenge is now for these democrats, both men and women, to take up the fight against impunity and courageously to ensure not only that the truth comes to light but, above all, that justice is done in their respective countries.
Like Pinochet's arrest in London, Fujimoriâs arrest in Chile is a clear sign that it is not only necessary, but also possible, to make progress towards such justice.
Everybody knows today that, under the Fujimori regime, there were many violations of human rights, and in fact that regime was an exemplary example â if you will forgive the repetition â of nothing other than institutionalised corruption across the board.
The extradition of Fujimori to Peru, where he must be tried with guarantees, is therefore desirable, though not sufficient.
The European Union, in line with its firm commitment to combating impunity, must recognise the important work of the organisations of victims of the Fujimori dictatorship and of human rights activists and support them in their work.
It is therefore desirable, for example, to support the National Coordinator of Human Rightsâ initiative of 11Â January 2006, urging the presidential candidates to sign up to an agreement on practical measures to support respect for human rights.
These measures include implementing the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee and of the Integral Plan of Reparations for the victims of the internal armed conflict, thereby strengthening the High Level Multisectoral Commission (CMAN).
Â Â  . Mr President, it has been said today, several times over, that this resolution is not directed against anyone, but that the European Parliament rejoices at this turn of events, and welcomes the cooperation between Peru and Chile that has resulted in Fujimori being arrested.
The European Parliament, furthermore, supports Peruâs application for Fujimoriâs extradition, and calls on the Peruvian authorities, as a matter of policy, to make sure that all witnesses receive comprehensive protection.
Both of these are important factors in getting Fujimori to answer â as he must â for the human rights abuses and the corruption that went on in his country.
The struggle against âimpunity, is not just one of the main pillars of the European Unionâs foreign policy, but also one of the foundations underpinning all states governed according to the rule of law.
There are not a few Latin American states in which an excess of impunity has left so many open wounds, and they add up to yet another reason for supporting this cause and advancing it.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for offering me the opportunity to take part in this debate on a possible resolution on the extradition of former President Fujimori to Peru.
Peru has been courageous in analysing the unprecedented situation of political violence that the country suffered between 1980 and 2000.
The âNational Truth and Reconciliation Commissionâ was created during the time of the transitional government led by ValentÃ­n Paniagua and confirmed by President Toledo.
The European Union and its institutions have supported the work of this commission from the outset, and this support takes the form, in particular, of financial support from the Community budget.
The European Union and the European Parliament have demonstrated their support for the work of this commission and the implementation of its recommendations.
The European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights currently supports that implementation through a programme that has just been established with the .
It is within this framework that Peru is currently preparing for the presidential elections of AprilÂ 2006.
The international community sees it as extremely important that these elections take place within a climate of transparency, stability and calm and that they represent progress in the process of democratic consolidation underway.
As you know, the European Union has made the defence of human rights and democracy the cornerstone of its foreign policy in general and of its policy on Latin America in particular.
The fight against impunity is clearly an essential element of this.
The Commission congratulates the Chilean and Peruvian Governments on their cooperation in the arrest of MrÂ Fujimori by the Chilean authorities, and of course we would encourage the two governments to continue to cooperate in this manner.
Within this context, the Commission must express its confidence in the judicial systems of the two countries in question.
The Commission is sure that Peruâs extradition request will be treated by Chile fully in accordance with the applicable legislation and that any solution will respect fundamental rights, entirely in accordance with international laws and standards.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Egypt: violence against Sudanese refugees(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, on 30 December 2005, the Egyptian security forces cleared a camp that had been set up in front of the UNHCRâs main office in Cairo in September of that year as a temporary home for over 2Â 500 Sudanese migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.
In doing this, the security forces acted with great brutality, and the outcome of their actions is a very, very sad one: 30 dead and over 60 injured.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior tried to pin the blame on the Sudanese, claiming that they had panicked and tried to flee, but journalists who were present report that nothing of the sort happened.
If we adopt this resolution, we in this House will be joining a number of leading figures in the United Nations who have already denounced these occurrences.
The UNâs Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was critical of the security forcesâ brutality and said that there could be no justification for this sort of violence and that this loss of human life was indefensible.
It is a good thing that the Egyptian authorities have now decided to investigate what happened.
We call on the Egyptian Government to allow the involvement in these investigations of human rights experts from the United Nations and independent Egyptian human rights organisations.
Since respect for human rights is fundamental to Egyptâs association agreement with the European Union, we urge the Council and the Commission to raise these incidents at the next meeting of the EUâs Association Council with Egypt.
The last thing I want to say is that I would like to move two oral amendments before the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that we welcome the decision of the Egyptian Government to start a full investigation into the incident of 30Â December, in which, after the attack by the Egyptian police on the Sudanese refugee camp in Cairo, many deaths and injuries resulted.
We hope that the investigation will be thorough and objective.
We do not in any way prejudge that the blame for the incident will be placed at the feet of the Egyptian authorities. Nor are we claiming that the UNHCR regional representatives, and certain isolated elements within the refugee protestors, do not necessarily share some of the responsibility for what happened.
That is why we feel that it is imperative that a truly independent investigation should be carried out into the incident in which, we should remember, 27Â people, including children, died.
We are confident that a fair investigation would not only get to the bottom of the problem, but will assist in the prevention of similar incidents occurring in the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak and be one of the authors of this resolution, which aims to highlight a tragic and brutal event that occurred in Cairo, Egypt, on 30Â December 2005.
At least 27Â people died: 9Â women, 7Â men and 11Â children, according to the Egyptian authorities.
However, certain eye witnesses, NGOs and members of the international press, would claim that the death toll was far higher.
This happened when Egyptian security forces evacuated by force about 2500Â Sudanese migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who had settled in front of the UNHCR headquarters, requesting to be relocated to third countries.
In the short time available to me, I want to focus on a few points.
Firstly, this Parliament has a responsibility to highlight and condemn actions taken by authorities that are a blatant and tragic breach of peoplesâ human rights, particularly when these events occur in the EU neighbourhood and with countries that we are working with through cooperation and/or association agreements.
In this case, the EU and Egypt have an association agreement that has been in force since June 2004.
The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, to which the EU and Egypt are parties, is also relevant, as is the Barcelona Process.
So anyone who suggests that this issue is solely an internal issue for Egypt is wrong.
This is our business, in the same way that what happens within the EU is Egyptâs business when it affects the agreements mentioned.
Secondly, I welcome the commitment by the Egyptian authorities to start an investigation into what happened on 30Â December.
I urge the authorities to ensure that this investigation is absolutely open and transparent and involves UN experts and, if possible, Egyptian human rights organisations.
The inquiry or investigation must be credible if we are to learn lessons from what happened.
I hope that the silver lining on this very dark cloud that sits over the event will be a credible assurance from the authorities in Egypt that their security forces will act in compliance with international standards and without a disproportionate use of force in the future.
Finally, this motion supports the UNHCR and calls on the Commission to establish a closer partnership with the UNHCR by offering both political and financial support to assist them in their office in Cairo in order to work more closely with the Egyptian authorities to find lasting solutions to the difficult situation of Sudanese migrants and refugees in Egypt.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the human rights situation in Egypt is highly unusual.
Although not even the European Parliament has been able to protest at the fact that the army prevented voters from entering polling stations in a number of towns during the recent election, political stability must be safeguarded in Egypt in order to secure peace in the Middle East.
Yet we must ask ourselves whether such political stability should be achieved at the expense of citizensâ fundamental democratic rights.
The situation outlined in the motion for a resolution should serve as a stark warning in this respect.
If the Egyptian authorities now not only regard supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat, but are even attempting to adopt regulations banning secular parties, then attention should be drawn to this fact.
This would help to correct the mistaken belief that the approach adopted by the Egyptian courts is not something we view as a major departure from the norm.
A situation in which the perpetrator of a questionable offence can be sentenced to several years in prison can only be interpreted in one of two ways.
Either the countryâs legal system contains highly irregular provisions, or the outcome of the judiciaryâs work suggests the involvement of politics.
In either case, we cannot remain indifferent.
How can we ignore the fact that refugees from Sudan or elsewhere are being turned over to their country of origin, where they face the threat of death?
The fact that a peace deal has now been signed between the parties to the conflict in Sudan does not mean that the Darfur conflict has been resolved.
The problem of the refugees and their possible repatriation needs to be tackled, in cooperation with the Sudanese and Egyptian Governments, although I am aware of the problems this entails.
We should therefore support the work of the UNHCR, and prevent any further incidents that would violate international commitments, and in particular the UN Convention on Refugees.
As I see it, it is utterly intolerable that prisoners should be tortured â even though this is the approach chosen by the United States â or that refugees should die when refugee camps are closed down.
There can be no question that, pursuant to the Association Agreement, such matters must be investigated in an annual report, and I trust that this will happen.
I am therefore in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, the tragic events of 30 December in Cairo led to the deaths of 27 people, according to the Egyptian authorities, but in reality there were many more: dozens, even hundreds, up to 220 dead according to some sources.
These events must be condemned as vigorously as possible, and the people responsible must be clearly identified.
First of all, the responsibility of the Egyptian security forces, whose violence on this occasion must be condemned as vigorously as possible, must be acknowledged.
They unfortunately have a reputation for resorting to systematic and excessive violence.
The HCR must also bear some of the responsibility.
Firstly, because it allowed the situation to become inflamed.
Then, because it used ambiguous, even contradictory, language on the subject of the status of the Sudanese people.
One only has to read the correspondence between the office of the HCR in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities to see this.
Finally, because it directly called upon the Egyptian authorities to intervene, thereby running the risk of things getting out of hand.
Nor must we lose sight of the deadlock in which these players found themselves.
Following the signature of a peace agreement on 26Â MayÂ 2004 in Sudan, all of the resettlement programmes were halted, even though we know that the situation in Sudan is still very unstable, as many reports indicate, including the recent report by Human Rights Watch.
The States refusing to receive these people solely because a peace agreement has been signed should also therefore bear some of the responsibility.
It is not proper to ask Egypt, which already accommodates between two and threeÂ million Sudanese, of whom 27Â 000 are registered with the HCR, to receive all of the refugees from that country.
For all of these reasons, as other Members have said, I believe that it is important that an investigation be carried out.
It is also important, however, for the Egyptian authorities to release all of the people still being detained, to cease all expulsions and to allow the representatives of the HCR free access so that they can look into the refugeesâ demands.
It is also important for this tragedy to be seen within the context of the general asylum and immigration policy.
We cannot refuse asylum to people who are in danger in their country, and this is not just an issue for Egypt and Sudan, just as Ceuta and Melilla was not a Hispano-Moroccan issue.
The Euro-African conference on migration must be held as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to repeat the arguments already expressed by the Members who have drawn up this motion for a resolution, but I really would like to emphasise the importance of this resolution, since it results from an extremely serious incident: the deaths of 27 people â officially, though the real figure is probably much higher, as other speakers have said â who had gathered peacefully outside the Office of the High Commission for Refugees in Cairo.
Those people of Sudanese origin â Sudanese immigrants who were asking for papers and for their status as refugees to be recognised â were subjected to an excessive and savage attack which led to this tragedy and extreme violence.
As a result, we need to carry out an in-depth, serious, exhaustive, transparent and independent investigation, not just in order to call for any appropriate penalties to be imposed and civil, criminal or administrative liabilities to be established, but also in order to eliminate the possibility of any similar situations arising in Egypt in the future.
The fact is that the flow of Sudanese people is going to continue, given the immigration from South to North - which also takes place in the region close to my own country - from countries to the south of Morocco, towards Morocco and towards Spain.
The principle of human rights must be defended everywhere, whether in Morocco, Spain, Egypt or anywhere else.
It must, as other speakers have said, especially be defended in a country that benefits from conditions attendant on its being a neighbour of the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, have not the Sudanese people suffered long enough?
Firstly, they succeeded in surviving and fleeing from a war, and now they are persecuted in Egypt when they try peacefully to contact the UN.
Egypt replaced many of its more senior officials and ministers at the end of last year, and now it is time for them to replace their police chiefs.
We can never accept a state of affairs in which countries with which we cooperate so much should allow police forces to attack civilians in that way.
I hope that we can cooperate very well with the UNHCR in order to obtain clarity about everything that happened in this situation.
I wish finally to remind you that, for example, my own country has, with the help of the CIA, sent so-called terrorist suspects off to Egypt to be tortured.
That is something that we ourselves must stop doing.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the subject of todayâs debate on infringements of human rights and democracy are the tragic events in Cairo, where several hundred police officers attacked a significantly smaller group of Sudanese refugees, who had travelled to Egypt in search of help and shelter.
The refugees were cornered and the Egyptian police then attacked them with water cannon and truncheons.
Several of the refugees died and the fate of the rest of the group, which included women and children, is unfortunately unknown.
Egypt likes to call itself a democracy, yet by this act it has joined ranks with the many other observers of the conflict in the Sudan, not all of them passive.
The fighting has gone on for over 20Â years, and two million people have lost their lives.
Six million were forced to leave their homes and thousands of women and children have been kidnapped or raped.
The United Nations Organisation has done little to support Sudanese refugees.
It has granted refugee status to only a few thousand, most of whom wished to emigrate to the United States, Canada or Europe.
In practice, Sudan has been in a state of war ever since it gained independence.
The darker-skinned African population in the South of the country is protesting against discrimination by the Arab population that is now in power in Khartoum.
Religion also plays a part in this internal conflict, because once in power the mostly Muslim Arabs have been treating the animist and Christian darker-skinned Africans like slaves.
This is why so many attempt to flee to neighbouring countries such as Kenya, Egypt, Uganda or Ethiopia
We wish to register our outrage and protest against the treatment meted out by the Egyptian authorities to people seeking help.
As we debate the issue in this House, we would be wise to consider not only the causes of the conflict but also the sources of the arms used in Sudan.
The rich G8 countries promised to work towards an end to poverty and injustice.
Nonetheless, these same countries are still exporting arms, ammunition and military equipment to poor countries involved in conflicts and helping to support repressive regimes.
By so doing, the G8 countries are party to human rights violations and anti-democratic activities.
The conflict in Sudan is also indicative of a failure on the part of the international community.
The latter has not demonstrated the will to limit or put an end to the series of aggressions and injustices perpetrated over many years.
We support the resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes it to be essential for all of the signatories to the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees to apply its provisions.
For this reason, it shares the concerns expressed by the delegations of the European Parliament in relation to the tragic issue of the forced evacuation of Sudanese migrants and refugees in Cairo and the imprisonment of many of them.
The Commission supports the initiative aimed at calling upon the Egyptian authorities to release all of the asylum seekers still behind bars.
Following the recent release of two hundred and fifty refugees, we do not have any precise information about whether there are still women, children or refugees from the region of Darfur in prisons.
All prisoners not accused of criminal acts should of course be released.
We also agree with the demand that the process of expelling Sudanese asylum seekers be suspended and we insist on strict compliance with the principle of non-refoulement.
The Commission also supports the request presented to the Egyptian authorities that they establish a public institution in accordance with international standards, which will be responsible for dealing with asylum requests.
Within the framework of the action funded by means of the programme in the budget line relating to cooperation with third countries in the field of migration, since 2004 the Commission has been funding a project worth more than EUR 1 million through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, with the aim of enhancing protection for asylum seekers and refugees in Egypt.
One of the objectives of this project is to support the creation of a unit responsible for asylum issues within the Egyptian Government.
In this regard, the Commission has been informed that the negotiations between the HCR and the Egyptian Government have not been successfully completed.
The Commission would like the Egyptian authorities to commit themselves as soon as possible to the actions laid down in the project.
With regard to the responsibility of the HCR, I personally cannot endorse the criticisms expressed by one speaker in this regard.
I know that it is extremely difficult for HCR officials to deal with issues of this nature.
Through my job, I have very frequent contacts with staff of the HCR and I can tell you that the work of these officials is extremely difficult.
They are obliged to respect the rules imposed on them in often extremely sensitive circumstances because, in order to help refugees, they must maintain correct, or at least positive, relations with the different governments.
I therefore find that criticism rather excessive.
I am not going to pass judgment on what has been said, but I believe it to be premature and, above all, these accusations would have to be verified.
Within the context of the neighbourhood policy, the Commission, with the support of the Presidency and of the secretariat of the Council, is in the process of negotiating an action plan containing a proposal aimed at establishing a dialogue on asylum issues.
The negotiations are underway.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Cambodia: political repression(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world.
It also suffers from the lack of an independent judiciary and widespread corruption.
People trafficking, child prostitution, plus persecution and torture of political opponents with impunity are but a few of the features of everyday life in Cambodia.
Repression of this kind, together with the arrest in recent weeks of representatives of humanitarian institutions, trade unions and journalists accused of spreading so-called false information have rightly awakened the concern of the international community.
The Cambodian Government routinely uses the justice system as a means of repressing political opposition.
Cambodia is in permanent breach of international agreements on human rights, notably the 1951Â Geneva Refugee Convention.
It metes out inhuman treatment to people attempting to flee from Vietnam and organises brutal deportations.
The international community must take decisive action to secure the freedom of all humanitarian organisation activists and to have the charges against them dropped.
It must also press for an end to persecution and intimidation.
The 1993Â European Union-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement binds the Union to take specific steps to ensure full respect for all human rights in Cambodia, including economic, social and cultural rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, last month, a court in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, sentenced the opposition leader Sam Rainsy, , to a prison term of eighteen months for slandering the prime minister, Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
Mr Sam was also fined the sum of 20 million riel, which amounts to some EURÂ 4Â 000, allegedly for blackening the good names of his political rivals.

At the beginning of this month, the Cambodian Government arrested two human rights activists: Kem Sokha, chairman of the âCambodian Center for Human Rightsâ and Yeng Virak, director of the âCommunity Legal Education Centerâ, who are being held in connection with the display of a banner marking the International Day of Human Rights on 10 December.
A meeting with the American diplomat Christopher Hill resulted in the prime minister agreeing after all to release Kem Sokha and Pa Nguon Teang on bail, which happened on 17 January, but the charges of defamation against them and a number of others who were freed were not dropped.
The sentence passed on Sam Rainsy and the arrest of the human rights activists are just a couple of examples of a whole series of slurs and accusations levelled at public figures in the last two years, which have seen the suspension of parliamentary immunity and the sentencing of Cheam Channy and, in his absence, of Chea Poch.
This is a return to the days of the one-party state under Hun Sen. These developments are indicative of a new backlash and a slap in the face for the process of democratisation in South-East Asia.
Dissident opinions and comments should be challenged by means of public debate rather than in courts of law, and the arrest of dissidents in Cambodia is a serious threat to freedom of expression and political pluralism in that country.
We have to take action against this new attempt by those in power to neutralise the opposition and complete the process of turning Cambodia into a dictatorship.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Cambodian culture was once known worldwide as a symbol of peace, yet, since then, scarcely any other country has had as much to endure as Cambodia, which was occupied by foreigners during the Second World War, the later Vietnam War and twice over in the war over Indo-China; it then suffered the terrors of the Khmer Rouge, with their policy of exterminating millions of people in ways that defy comparison, followed by another variety of Communism â the Vietnamese one this time â which, too, involved rule by foreigners.
After the country had endured all these horrors, the setting in motion of a peace process there has called for a great deal of political effort on the part of the United Nations, the European Union and, not least, the people who live there; it has been a complicated business and has called for a great deal of dedication and a lot of money.
It can be said that what was accomplished then is, today, in ruins, for we see that another unjust regime is establishing itself in Cambodia, and, as that is something that we cannot accept under any circumstances, I would refer the House to paragraph 5 of our resolution, which states quite clearly that the agreement that we concluded with Cambodia is founded upon democracy and human rights.
That is not an empty diplomatic phrase with which we politely introduce agreeable transactions; on the contrary, it spells out the terms on which business is done at all.
The Council, the Commission, and this House, now have the task of making it plain to our Cambodian partners that if they keep on violating those terms, they will no longer be able to do business with us.
We must, once and for all, get effective pressure put on Cambodia to uphold human rights, and that means more than just sending protest notes.
It is for that reason that I would suggest that we should â and as soon as possible â invite the United Nations special envoy to Cambodia to this House for in-depth discussions with him about the state of affairs in this tormented country.
We can rejoice that our pressure and that exerted by the Americans â for it is good that we are cooperating in this â has resulted in the release of prisoners, but, while certainly acknowledging this, we know that they are still going to be put on trial.
We know that there are many other prisoners, and that many more summonses and arrest warrants have been issued, and we are particularly aware of the repression of minorities.
In contending against these things, we must do so with persistence, for persistence, above all, is what human rights policy is all about.
Â Â  . Mr President, Cambodia was a peaceful neighbour to Vietnam, until foreigners intervened in its affairs at the beginning of the 1970s.
In Vietnam, war raged over the reunification of the Northern and Southern sectors of what had once been a French colony, with America wishing to keep the south as its own sphere of influence.
The suspicion that the Vietnamese guerrilla movement, which fought for the reunion of North and South, was making use of supply routes running through inhospitable parts of Cambodia was reason enough for the Americans to intervene and bring it under the control of a friendly government.
Since then, Cambodia, formerly so peaceful, has been a country at odds with itself.
It appears that state power, having been achieved with so much difficulty, must not be put at risk in any way.
A tradition has developed of parties being no more willing to enter into coalitions with others than they are to tolerate opposition.
First, there was a government friendly to the Americans, which was followed by Pol Potâs pro-Chinese reign of terror and then, with Vietnamese help, the government of Hun Sen. Subsequent elections have produced results that have made it virtually impossible to form governments with widespread support.
Various parties are unwilling to cooperate with each other, wanting instead to rule on their own.
This attitude has now resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of opposition members of parliament.
Journalists, human rights activists and trade unionists are also arrested on charges of defamation.
The consequence of all this is that the police and the judiciary are being turned into instruments of political in-fighting.
For the moment, I do not get the impression that the opposition is much more democratic than the party in government.
All the political forces in Cambodia should abandon this sort of behaviour.
Up to now, the outside world has failed to help Cambodia develop a tolerant democracy.
It is worth recalling that Pol Potâs bloodthirsty regime remained internationally recognised for a long period of time, even after being defeated, the only reason for that being that the new regime under Hun Sen, which had liberated the country from that band of murderers, was suspected of maintaining friendly relations with its Vietnamese neighbour.
In future, Cambodia must get a quite different message.
Europe must not take sides on the basis of considerations that the Cambodians find incomprehensible, but must consistently stand up for human rights and democracy, irrespective of who is in power.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe these urgency debates are important for this House and for the European Union.
I believe they are worthy.
However, as we discuss Cambodia, I am struck by the fact that we have been here before, and that we have heard all this before.
Specifically, we have been here before on 13Â January 2005, 10Â March 2005 and 1Â December 2005.
Will anybody take a bet with me that we will be here again in six monthsâ time?
I am not saying that we should not have these debates.
But I am saying that we should have our concern matched by action from the other EU institutions and the Member States we serve.
I would refer you to paragraphÂ 4 of the resolution in particular.
We are not without arms; we are not without pressure that we can exert.
The Cambodian Government relies on the donor community for 50% of its annual expenditure.
We must use that pressure more forcefully to achieve change, as opposed to just using warm words.
This is not the West dictating to a developing nation how it should run itself; this is the European Union expecting Cambodia to honour the agreements it has already signed up to, and to live up to international standards of decency.
We are willing to play our part in that process.
In paragraphÂ 12, we reiterate our call for an ad hoc delegation from this House to go to Cambodia to see the problems for ourselves.
Let us start there.
This motion for a resolution has the enthusiastic backing of my group and indeed my own backing.
It contains a welter of information and worthy aims, but without more overt economic pressure from us, I fear that it will remain a shopping list never to be fulfilled.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can only echo the statement made by the honourable Member, Mr Smith.
We do seem to be going over the same subject again and again, with no real result.
Is it because Cambodia is too far away?
Human suffering, regardless of where it happens, is always the same when it comes to the individual.
I should cite what Human Rights Watch said about Cambodia in 2005: âThe political opposition was effectively dismantled with the arrest or threat of arrest of opposition parliamentarians and the impunity of perpetrators of human rights abuses continued.
Political trials demonstrated the Governmentâs ongoing control, interference and intimidation in the work of the courts.â
That is the bleak situation in Cambodia.
I should remind you that in 1997 the only opposition politician, Sam Rainsy â who, paradoxically, is protected by this Houseâs Freedom-Passport Initiative â was giving a speech in the capital when several grenades were launched into the crowd in front of him and at least 16Â people died.
That is what happens when an opposition leader makes a speech in the capital of that country.
We cannot continue just paying lip service; we must put our money where our mouth is.
As Mr Smith said, one of the most effective penalties would be to stop giving money to Cambodia as long as the criteria of democracy and human rights are not fulfilled.
Also, a travel visa ban on officials would be very effective, because the elite of that country come to the capitals of Europe to shop and so forth.
In contrast, however, free trade has to be retained.
Trade sanctions will only increase the poverty and misery of the people.
The sympathy of this House is with those people in Cambodia who are fighting for democracy and human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the words of the previous speakers but, in particular, those of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, a member of my group and author of one of these resolutions that we are going to vote on next.
Cambodia does indeed have a recent tragic history of flagrant human rights violations and, in the past, horrendously violent wars.
The discouragement felt by many Members when we see that things are not improving and that we have to deal with this issue over and over again in this Chamber is understandable, but we must not for that reason cease to raise the issue whenever events such as the recent ones take place, involving the repression of human rights activists, radio stations, teachersâ unions, activists, journalists, trade unionists in different fields, former parliamentarians, etc. Only with the help of vigorous and decisive measures on the part of the European Union, the Commission and this Parliament where Cambodia is concerned might actions of this kind be reduced or eliminated.
There are five points that I am not going to mention, but I would like in particular to remind Cambodia of the action that the community of donors can and does take and of the human rights clause in the European Union-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement.
It is also important to send a delegation to Cambodia to assess the situation.
Finally, I would like to demand recognition of the refugee status of Khmers from Vietnam.
I shall not say any more, Mr President, due to lack of time, but I would emphasise that I agree with what previous speakers have said.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, human rights represent a set of ideals.
Even the most democratic of countries only comes close to these ideals in certain spheres.
In any event, until recently Cambodia was still faced with such problems as the remnants of Pol Potâs troops, illiteracy and the lack of an intelligentsia or any industry in the country.
In comparison, the present situation is undoubtedly a clear improvement.
At the same time, however, it is of course intolerable that basic procedures should be disregarded when members of the Cambodian Parliament are sentenced to several years in prison.
There is clearly an urgent need to ensure that conditions are in place that allow representatives of international organisations to do their jobs, as well as to promote the emergence of a free press and respect for trade union rights.
A fact-finding mission would doubtless be a very good idea, and I would recommend that European Parliament representatives be sent to the country as soon as possible, once an agreement has been reached with the Cambodian Government.
I find it particularly alarming that it is possible for the judiciary to be misused in order to deal with cases of alleged defamation.
If we tacitly approve of an approach of this kind, we could be regarded as being complicit in such crimes.
I am therefore very much in favour of the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there were no less than three European Parliament resolutions on Cambodia last year, and I should like the House to bear this in mind as I speak on the matter.
The Cambodian authorities show blatant disregard for the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and for the European Union guidelines on the subject adopted two years ago.
I was very pleased that six days ago the Austrian Presidency lodged such a strong and unequivocal protest against the worsening situation in Cambodia.
The arrest of journalists, independent activists and trade unionists testifies to the increasingly repressive nature of the regime in that country.
I agree with MrÂ Smith and MrÂ Vatanen who said that we must apply economic pressure to the Cambodian authorities.
Fifty per cent of Cambodiaâs budget is overseas aid, and we should use it as a tool.
I am also very much in favour of sending an delegation as suggested in the resolution.
We really need to see for ourselves what the situation is like on the ground.
Â Â  . Mr President, the current political situation in Cambodia remains of serious concern.
Since the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Mr Sam Rainsy, the leader of the Cambodian opposition Sam Rainsy Party, and two other members of the National Assembly in February last year, the political situation has deteriorated considerably.
The recent arrest of Mr Kem Sokha, Director of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, and other human rights defenders constitutes the latest chapter in this depressing story.
It is sadly ironic that these latest arrests relate to events which took place on Human Rights Day, when a number of organisations were peacefully celebrating and trying to uphold the principles of human rights and democracy.
The Commission strongly welcomes the recent release on bail of Mr Sokha and four other individuals but would have wished the Cambodian authorities to have gone a step further and dropped the charges altogether.
The Commission believes that the weakening of the opposition through the politicised use of the judiciary threatens to disrupt the still-developing democratic process in Cambodia.
Moreover, the targeting of human rights organisations through a series of arrests on criminal â not civil â charges which are out of proportion with the alleged crimes is creating a climate of fear for human rights defenders in the country.
The Commission and EU Member States have agreed to a number of measures to respond to the situation.
Following the issuing of a strong EU declaration on the subject, the EU intends to raise these issues directly with the Prime Minister at the first opportunity.
At the same time, the Commission and Member States will work even more closely with the human rights organisations which have been targeted in order to support their work.
As recommended by Parliament in its last resolution on Cambodia, the Commission is currently considering whether to propose the establishment of a working group on cooperation in the areas of institution-building, administrative reform, governance and human rights in order constructively to engage the Cambodian authorities on these issues.
Finally, in the forthcoming donor meeting in Phnom Penh in March, a strong message will be passed to the Cambodian authorities by the EU and the donor community as a whole that freedom of expression and other basic human rights must be upheld in the interest of all Cambodiaâs citizens.
I would like to assure this House that the Commission, through its delegation in Phnom Penh, and together with the missions of EU Member States in Cambodia, will continue to monitor the situation very closely.
The international community, especially the EU which had such a vital role in the establishment of the new Cambodia, should ensure that the political situation does not deteriorate further and should support the strengthening and deepening of Cambodiaâs democracy.
I agree, of course, with the honourable Members of the European Parliament that the events in question are very serious and deserve our full attention.
The Commission, together with the EU Member States, is exploring the possibility of undertaking further measures beyond the ones I have just mentioned.
However, I do not believe that at this point the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement should be suspended. This would put our political dialogue on hold and interrupt our development programmes to the detriment of the poor people in Cambodia.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a few momentsâ time.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish, on behalf of my group, to move a correction to Recital F, which should refer, not to 462 Sudanese nationals, but to 650, that being the number of persons threatened with deportation.
We also wish to move, as part of the same amendment, that this change be made to paragraph 5 as well.
I have checked the French, Spanish and German versions, and the change has already been made in them.
I would ask you to request the services to examine all the language versions with this in view.
Â Â  Mr President, in this amendment the name of one of the members of parliament was omitted by us and I would appreciate it if it could be inserted.
It is the name of Chea Poch.
It would then read: âthe judgment against Sam Rainsy and Chea Pochâ.
Â Â  It is an addition, Mr President.
One of the problems in Cambodia is that it has something in common with Belarus, whereby if you insult the Prime Minister of Cambodia it is deemed to be a criminal offence, which is very unusual in the modern world.
Normally, an insult at worst is a civil offence and results in a fine or a defamation suit.
In Cambodia you go to prison, hence the reason why some of these individuals have been imprisoned.
We wish to add the following text: ââŠ and questions the need for defiling the office of the Prime Minister to be a criminal offenceâ.
Â Â  Mr President, my English is not as good as that of my colleague, Mr Tannock, but I think âdefilingâ is the wrong word.
It is âdefamingâ, is it not?
So can we make sure we have the correct wording in that oral amendment?
Â Â  I am very happy to accept the suggestion to change the word âdefilingâ to âdefamationâ.
That was my original intention.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . I welcome this motion which addresses the important issue of how mainstreaming the needs of the disabled into development policy might be achieved and how issues such as stigma towards disabled people, treatment and care are being dealt with.
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 19 January 2006.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, before beginning our plenary sitting, I believe that, under the circumstances, the Presidency must make a short statement relating to the two tragic events that have taken place in two countries of the European Union.
As you know, the accident on 19 January involving a Slovakian army aircraft led to the deaths of 42 soldiers as they returned from a NATO peace-keeping mission in Kosovo.
This brings to mind other similar tragic events relating to the presence of Spanish soldiers in Afghanistan.
This time they were Slovakian.
On 28 January, in Katowice, the collapse of the roof of an exhibition hall led to the deaths of several dozen people and to some one hundred people being injured. An unknown number of people are missing.
The Polish people have been shaken by this tragedy, as have all of the other peoples of Europe.
I have expressed the European Parliamentâs sincerest condolences and solidarity with the victims and their families.
The Slovakian and Polish flags are flying at half mast in our Parliament as a sign of mourning.
On behalf of all of you, I have sent a letter to both Heads of State to express our condolences.
I would now ask you to observe a minuteâs silence in tribute to these victims.
Â Â  Are there any comments?
Mrs Frassoni has the floor.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech is going to be really simple, very brief and not at all exciting: I should like to say that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to add its signature to the resolution on Cuba.
Â Â  All right, that will be done.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the common foreign and security policy on the following points:
â the Statement by the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy on the common foreign policy perspectives for 2006; and
â the report by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Union â 2004 (2005/2134(INI)) (A6-0389/2005).
Before the speakers take the floor, I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser, chief European Union observer at the Palestinian elections, and Mr McMillan-Scott, who led our delegation of 27 parliamentary observers, for the work they have done.
We will no doubt have the opportunity to hear what they have to say during the debate, but at this point I would like to stress the important role played by our Members in terms of providing an objective view of the vitality of the electoral process in the Palestinian territories.
I also believe that this is a good opportunity to express our hope that the circumstances will not prevent President Mahmud Abbas from accepting the European Parliament's standing invitation for him to come here whenever he likes.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by joining with you in congratulating, in particular, the person who has embodied the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole in the electoral observation mission to the Palestinian elections, Mrs De Keyser, a good friend of all of us and a good friend of mine, on the great work she has done over this very difficult time, during which the mission of observers has been extremely important.
I do not know whether Mrs De Keyser is in the Chamber, but, in any event, I would like to acknowledge her and express my admiration for her and once again tell her that I think of her as a friend.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you quite honestly that I find it very difficult to begin this sitting of 1Â February 2006.
If we cast our minds back just one month, to 1 January of this year, and look at what has happened in the world over the intervening thirty days, it is clear that it may be genuinely useful for us to reflect here in this Parliament; we should reflect on the European Unionâs capacity for politics, the European Unionâs capacity for international politics and the obligation facing all of us.
If we look carefully at what has happened over these thirty days that I am about to discuss, we should draw certain conclusions with regard to how we cannot continue to act and how we should actually begin to act.
So please allow me, therefore, to remind you very briefly of what has happened over the last thirty days.
Many of us stayed awake the whole of the night of 1 January 2006, trying to resolve an extremely serious problem that was affecting us: Ukraine and Russia had a problem that was very difficult to resolve because of the lack of an energy agreement between the two countries.
If, rather than an energy agreement, disagreement had remained, that would have had extremely serious repercussions for the energy supply of many European Union countries.
That was the first night of the year.
On the third night of 2006, the Iranian Government took an extremely important decision: to commence enriching uranium.
And less than a week later, it began to break the seals that had been affixed by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and of the Board Governors of that Agency.
A few days later, Prime Minister Sharon was taken into a hospital in Jerusalem, and unfortunately he has yet to recover fully.
If you will allow me, I would like to say to the family of Prime Minister Sharon, on behalf of all of us, that we wish him a speedy recovery.
Regardless of the differences that may have arisen between us in the past, regardless of the difficulties and misunderstandings that we may have had, men who have fought, people who have worked with us, must be acknowledged in their times of difficulty.
A few days later, serious problems arose with the beginning of the elections in Palestine, and once again Mrs De Keyser was there to try to solve them.
The Palestinian elections took place at the end of the month, and the result caused a commotion.
Some days later, within the context of another issue which is absolutely fundamental to the European Union, President Rugova, President of Kosovo, died suddenly.
Also in the final days of the month, there was a crucial meeting of the African Union, with which we are cooperating extremely closely in an attempt to resolve a serious problem: the problem of Darfur.
Finally, just a very few days ago, also during this month, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called upon us to be ready to take a decision on the possibility of the European Union becoming involved in security and protection at the elections that are going to take place in a few monthsâ time in Congo.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we think for just a few moments about these last thirty days, we will see that there are immense lessons to be learnt.
And many of them relate to the European Unionâs influence in todayâs world, because in relation to all of these issues that I have mentioned, all of them, the European Union has had to play a fundamental role: on the issue of energy security, which is fundamental and which will remain with us throughout 2006; on the issue of Iran, which will continue to occupy us over the coming days and no doubt beyond, and I will discuss this in a moment; on the Palestinian elections and their consequences; on the death of President Rugova and the consequences that it will have in 2006, and let us hope that it is only 2006; on the final agreements on the status of Kosovo; and on issues relating to the changes that have taken place in the African Union, our relations with which are marked by profound friendship, affection and cooperation.
If the President will allow me, I shall comment very briefly on these issues that I have mentioned, the most important issues to have arisen over the last month, and which are unquestionably going to make up this Parliamentâs and the European Unionâs fundamental agenda for 2006, but not without firstly saying once again to the Presidency of Parliament and to its Members that there is no question that the European Union is an essential player in international politics, that this must continue to be the case, that experience has shown us that, whether we like it or not, it must be the case, and that over just thirty days we have had to deal with so many issues, and at times this has stopped us being able to think; such has been the activity in which we have been immersed throughout this month.

This morning, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs received two personalities from Ukraine: the Foreign Affairs Minister, MrÂ Tarasyuk, and Yulia Timoshenko, a very distinguished parliamentarian.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs has seen â I hope that many of you have been able to say this â the extremely difficult situation being faced by Ukraine, a country that is a friend of ours and that is fundamental to the stability and security of Europe.
About a year ago now, all of us, the European Parliament and myself, were trying to resolve an extremely serious problem in Ukraine.
Today, a year later, many of the problems that existed at that time are not as serious, but they are unfortunately still sufficiently serious for us to have to continue working, essentially in order to ensure that that country does not lose its way, that this great country continues to move along the path of economic and political development, security and increasing closeness to Europe that we all want to see.
Those of you who have listened this morning to both the Foreign Affairs Minister and Mrs Yulia Timoshenko will have realised that the problem is unfortunately very serious and that we must attach particular importance to it.
In the few minutes I am allowed for this first speech, I shall not go into any more detail, but I would like to say that the elections that are going to take place in Ukraine, not in a yearâs time, but in two monthsâ time, will be absolutely fundamental to all of us, not just for the European Union, but also for Ukraine, undoubtedly, and for all of the countries of the eastern part of our continent, which will be affected by their results.
It would be extremely sad for all of us if what a year ago we called the Orange Revolution were to stop being an orange revolution and turn into a revolution of a different kind or a step backwards after the series of steps forward that that country took a year ago.
I would like, Mr President, to move on to the second point on which I wished to comment: the situation with Iran.
I believe that the honourable Members are well informed about what has happened in Iran since 3Â January of this year, just a little while ago, and in particular about what has happened since the 13th, when, in Berlin, the European Union took the decision to call for an extraordinary meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and subsequently to call upon the Board of Governors to pass the dossier on Iran to the United Nations Security Council.
Many things have happened since then, because the days pass as if they were seconds and months as if they were hours.
I can tell you that, at this very moment, the Chinese and Russian representatives are in Tehran, with a mandate from the five permanent members of the Security Council plus the European Union, to try to make the final effort to reach an agreement at the meeting that is going to take place on the 2nd, that is to say tomorrow.
I can tell you that, the night before last, the members of the European Union and the United States held a meeting until the early hours of the morning, which I believe was very important, with Russia and China, with a view to reaching a possible agreement on a draft resolution.
And I can tell you that we reached that agreement, and that this very afternoon it will be presented in Vienna for debate tomorrow.
It is a draft resolution, ladies and gentlemen, that makes the following appeals: firstly it calls upon Iran to return to the previous situation, that is to say, not to persist in its aspirations to enrich uranium, but to return to a negotiating position; and secondly, it calls for the resolution that is going to be presented this afternoon, with the support of Russia and China, to be approved and for that resolution and all of the related resolutions adopted over recent months to be passed on to the Security Council and for that Council not to adopt any resolution until the ordinary meeting of the Board of Governors in March.
Our intention here is to send a clear message to the Iranian authorities and, at the same time, to create the greatest possible degree of consensus within the international community.
The issue we are dealing with is fundamental, linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it therefore seems to us to be essential to achieve the greatest possible agreement amongst the members of the international community and, specifically, amongst the members of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
I do not wish to say that I am optimistic, because I believe that it is difficult to be optimistic on these issues, but I believe that we have worked extremely hard over recent hours amongst all of the members of the international community, led, without any doubt whatsoever, by the positions that the European Union has held for several months and years.
We therefore hope that the debate that will begin tomorrow, and will no doubt last more than one day, will enable us to make progress in terms of rationalising Iranâs position on nuclear issues.
The third point that I wished to mention very briefly, Mr President, since time is pressing, is the Palestinian elections.
I have already mentioned the good work that the European Union has done in terms of observation; I would like to make two or three observations about the results.
Ladies and gentlemen, the results have surprised everybody: they have surprised Hamas, they have surprised Fatah, they have surprised Israel and they have surprised the international community.
Hamas were certainly expected to achieve better results than they have done before, but nobody â either in Hamas, in Fatah, or in the international community â expected Hamas to be so successful.
What positions do I believe we should take at this time?
And these are not personal positions, they are positions that have been agreed by the General Affairs Council, by the Foreign Affairs Ministers on Monday morning â that is to say, very recently â and in the afternoon, in the Quartet, with our friends from Russia and the United States and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, we believe â quite rightly I believe â that we must continue to help President Abu Mazen.
He stood in the elections on the platform that we supported: one of progressing towards peace; recognising the need to negotiate with Israel; of ending the Intifada; and of implementing the roadmap.
Those were the positions of President Abu Mazen, and they had the mass support of his Palestinian fellow citizens.
There have subsequently been elections which Hamas has won by a very substantial majority, by an absolute majority, on a platform that to a certain extent is different to that of President Abbas.
There is therefore no doubt that in the future â when the government is formed following the negotiation that will take place, very probably within several weeks, and we will therefore probably not have a government for two or three months at least â there may well be a clash of positions amongst the different parties, between what President Abu Mazen has represented and what Hamas represents.
In Mondayâs statement by the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, which was then also recognised in the meeting of the Quartet, we said what I believe are some important things which should be known and, above all, explained.
We stated clearly that, according to the report by the observers and in particular by their chief observer, the elections took place in an open, clean and fair manner.
We then went on to say in this statement that Europe is entirely prepared to carry on working with our Palestinian friends, with whom we have cooperated for many years, since the Oslo process, during which we have invested European economic resources and also political and psychological resources, to a large extent, and that we are prepared to carry on doing so; and there is absolutely no doubt that we are prepared to carry on doing so in the time between now and the formation of the new government.
But when the new government is formed, on the assumption that it is led by Hamas, this House will have to reflect and set certain conditions.
It would be difficult for the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole not to say various things very clearly to our Palestinian friends; specifically, three things: the first is that violence is not compatible with election results in a democracy.
In a democracy, parties that have been elected must abandon violence and must play by the democratic rules.
The second thing we should say with the same affection and friendship we have always felt for our Palestinian friends is that, if they want the European Unionâs assistance, it is essential that their policy is compatible with the position that this Parliament and the European Union have maintained since the Oslo agreements in 1993.
We want to see two States living together in peace and prosperity; we want negotiations to take place via the peaceful route â not by any other route â and we would therefore call upon the two parties â if that is what we want â to recognise each other.
This Parliament could not possibly support anything that does not involve an explicit recognition on the part of all of the Palestinian authorities, whoever they may be, that Israel is a reality with which they must hold dialogue and reach agreement.
Thirdly, we would like to say to our Palestinian friends â I have said this personally on several occasions since the elections, and I am able to speak to the President practically every day â that it would be a very good thing for the new government which emerges following these elections, in three months, also to recognise all of the agreements that the Palestinian Authority has signed over recent years.
It would be absurd to go right back to zero after all the work we have done over such a long time and after the work many of you have also done over such a long time.
This is what we want to say very simply, therefore, ladies and gentlemen, and I believe that everybody must understand it; and I believe and I hope that our Palestinian friends, regardless of the party they are from, regardless of the party or formation they represented in these elections, understand that this does not mean imposing anything on anybody, or trying to force anybodyâs will, but that it is a question of affirming in a clear and simple manner what the European Unionâs position has been; not since yesterday, but since 1993, when the Oslo agreements were signed.
And I believe that we should all be united here in this task; I believe that, as we have done in the General Affairs Council and as the Quartet did on the night following the General Affairs Council, we must stand firm in this area.
This does not mean that at this difficult time, at this time when President Abu Mazen has the enormous responsibility of forming a government and of making contact with all of the different political factions, we should not help, or we should not help President Abu Mazen as much as possible at this time when he still has control of the situation, so that over these three months that he surely still has before there is a new government, the Palestinians do not face economic bankruptcy.
In my view, it would be an extremely serious mistake for us now to abandon President Abu Mazen, in an economic sense, and for those resources not to be used, or not arrive, and for us to run the risk of the Palestinian Authority finding itself in a very difficult situation at this point in time.
This is an appeal to all of us and the European Parliament â if at some point the Commission presents a request or a recommendation to the European Parliament in this regard, and I hope that it will â to have the generosity to support President Abu Mazen over the months remaining before a new government is in place, so that he can establish himself and find a place for himself and what he signifies.
I believe that we should say âyesâ, a resounding âyesâ, so that that is what happens in the future.
I would like to say that what we have before us is going to be a new situation, it is going to be difficult, it is not going to be easy, but I believe that we must remain determined to ensure that this peace process moves forward under the conditions to which I referred before.
They are not absurd conditions, as I have said; they are not conditions that have just been plucked from the air, but they come from many years of work, of working together, of work with our Palestinian friends to ensure that the process can move forward.
Mr President, I will now say a couple of very brief words about the situation in Kosovo, following the death of President Rugova.
It was my sad duty â though I was delighted to go â to attend the funeral of President Rugova.
The family asked me to speak on that occasion on behalf of the European Union, and I did so.
I did so thinking of all of you, I did so thinking of all of the citizens of Europe, whose thoughts I am sure were with President Rugova at that time.
But let there be no mistake; it is going to be a difficult process. Because if the process was difficult enough when President Rugova was alive and acting as a sort of 'umbrellaâ for the whole political operation that we are facing, imagine what it is going to be like without him.
In my speech, I called upon the Kosovan political leaders and people in general to show generosity, unity and responsibility at this time so that progress can be made, and I believe that to a certain extent those words, spoken by myself and by others, have been heard: we now have somebody to replace President Rugova, something that I feared was going to take much longer, and who is also going to head the team which, under the direction of Mr Ahtisaari, former President of Finland, will jointly lead the negotiation with our Serbian friends.
Let us hope therefore that we can move in that direction and that we can move relatively quickly, but I would emphasise once again that great energies are going to be required in order to progress along this path towards a definitive solution to the situation in Kosovo, which would unquestionably represent an essential step towards stability throughout the Balkan region, stability for the countries to which we have offered a future in Europe, at the Thessaloniki Summit and on numerous occasions.
Mr President, I believe that my time is running out, and it would be a great shame not to discuss some of the other issues that I wished to raise with you, given the enormous amount of activity that has taken place over the last twenty days.
I would like to tell you that we are continuing to work very hard with the African Union to try to resolve the problem of peace in Darfur.
We have made a lot of progress on the North-South negotiation, and we have reached an agreement, but we unfortunately have the Abuja process, which has not made any progress.
We are working as hard as we possibly can in that regard.
Fortunately, the meeting of the African Union has found a compromise formula whereby, rather than making the President of Sudan the President of the African Union, which would have been a great problem for the future negotiations, it has chosen President Brazzaville of Congo.
We will therefore be very happy to do everything we can to ensure that the Abuja process moves forward and at the same time will begin to plan â because we are going to have to take on many responsibilities â the transition from a force that is present on the ground, led by the African Union, to a force which, sooner or later, but within a few months, will be United Nations blue helmets and with which we will undoubtedly have to continue cooperating.
The last thing I would like to say, Mr President, is that, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, we have received a request â or at least the Presidency and myself have received a request â from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, asking us whether we could assist in the elections that are going to be held in the Democratic Republic of Congo and which will provide the final impetus for the process of democratic transition in Congo; if it goes well, it will bring stability to a significant part of Africaâs backbone; this issue is therefore fundamental for all of us.
We are being asked to help, and today there is a fact-finding mission in Kinshasa, and I hope that in a few days time, on the 7th, it will be able to give us its results, so that we can see whether, in the end, the Member States of the European Union can take the decision to support the United Nations in response to this offer, or request.
To do so would be a good decision.
I shall end here, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
There are endless things I would like to share with you on this first day of February 2006, a year which has begun with some truly frenetic activity, which is going to make us all frenetic and which must make us work with an energy, a capacity and a dedication that we have rarely seen in the European Union.
Through the will of the Members of this Parliament, through the will of the citizens of Europe and through the will of the governments of Europe, the European Union must be a fundamental player on the international scene.
And as you have just heard, ladies and gentlemen, given the things that have happened during this last month alone, we have no choice but to play that role, whether we like it or not: we cannot close our eyes to the worldâs problems, and I would like to say to you that the world wants Europe to act.
Wherever we go, we come across people, political leaders, knocking on Europeâs door and saying, âAct.
Act; we like the way you act; your way of acting suits us; the way you act is better for the world, the multilateral world in which the citizens of the European Union believeâ.
The Eurobarometer, Mr President, tells us every day, every month, or every two months, or every time we ask it, what the Members of this Parliament want.
Let us therefore continue along that path, let us ensure that Parliament and all of the institutions can work together, because we are necessary if we are to create a better world.
Mr President, I would like to say much more, but I know that that is not possible.
So I will stop and I will await any question the honourable Members wish to ask me; I shall do my best to answer as best I can, with the same respect and affection that I have always shown to this Parliament.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, considering where European foreign and security policy started off from several years ago, we cannot do other than observe that those involved in it can point to some extraordinary achievements, that hitherto impossible things are being achieved in the Balkans, through the EU troika and in many other areas, and that the European Union, through its enlargement policy, its neighbourhood policy, its Mediterranean policy and much else, has made a major contribution to global stability.
Parliament has been constantly supportive of this work and is well aware of its own inability to actively engage in foreign policy, that being a task for the executive.
While it must, however, be open to Parliament to monitor it, the position we are in prevents us from doing so to an adequate degree, since we are mainly informed after the event and no priority is given to our being included in the discussion process.
There is room for improvement here; we need to move things on in line with this interpretation of Article 21, and I hope that we will be able to use peaceful means in getting the Council and the Commission to agree to this.
It must also be clear to us, though, that this House has so far been able to bring forward little other than budgetary arguments in its attempts to get its way, and we have to move on from this if this House is to be better enabled to monitor and be consulted.
One might ask, by way of an example, what is going on in the Congo?
We have all read in the newspapers about the plans that are being considered for military intervention there, but at no stage of the proceedings has anyone thought to give this House or the relevant committee within it prior notice of this.
I do not think that we can go on like this.
Although I did say that a lot of good things had been achieved, it is possible to regard a glass as either half full or half empty.
We are in a much more difficult situation than we were a year ago; far from being something that can be blamed on European policy, this is a matter of the way things are, and Mr Solana gave a few examples at the beginning of the year.
Consider, if you will, the state of affairs in Iran, where we are laboriously endeavouring to get talks underway, and where nobody has any real idea of how to prevent matters escalating now there is the possibility of Iraq ending up with a Shiite government that could ally itself with Iran, in view of the Palestinian elections having been won by Hamas, which is linked with and funded by Iran, not to mention Hezbollah and all the rest of it.
If you consider what this scenario means in terms of world peace, and might also mean in terms of the security of our energy supply, bearing in mind at the same time the way in which a politically resurrected Russia uses energy as a political instrument, causing countries in our neighbourhood to fear for the maintenance of their independence and freedom to make decisions for themselves, then it can be a depressing one.
And that is just a small sample.
The whole scenario shows that we, in the European Union, are in a worse position in terms of foreign policy than we were a year ago, and that we therefore need to come up with a strategy for dealing with the situation.
We must become much more pro-active and, whether dealing with the Ukraine situation or energy policy in general, establish connections in such a way that no single country is penalised, but that, rather, we join together in defending our interests.
Our Member States and our neighbours must come to understand that we have no chance of defending our interests unless we do so together rather than each looking after his own.
None of us can save ourselves; it is only together that we can defend our own interests, and this is something that has to be spelled out with greater clarity.
We have something to contribute, and one place in which we can do so is the Balkans, where, this year, there is to be a referendum in Montenegro and negotiations on the status of Kosovo, and so important decisions are in the offing.
The question of how we involve Serbia in all this is one of the really big and difficult issues with which we have to deal.
There must also be a marked improvement in trans-Atlantic relations, so that, through the values we share, order may be brought into the scenario I described earlier.
That also means that we have to be strong enough to have an influence on American policy, which means reinforcing the preventive dimension of policy and its character as a dialogue, in order to ensure greater security in a multilateral world.
It means that we have to sharpen up some of our instruments.
We would like to see Mr Solana become Europeâs Foreign Minister on 1 January 2007; while the failure of the Constitution means that he will not, another consequence of that is that the instruments need to be improved in order to maximise the effectiveness of all the institutions rather than have them working against each other.
As Mr Solana said, this multilateral approach is one reason why the world wants European foreign policy.
The public want it too; nothing matters so much to them as that we should take joint action in this area, and that imposes on us the obligation to join with our counterparts at the national level in putting the half measures of the past behind us and agreeing on ways to secure our citizensâ right to life.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in introducing his statement, the High Representative referred to the first 31 days of this year â and hence also of the Austrian Presidency of the Council â as having been a turbulent time, and that they indeed were.
Evidence of that could be found on the order of business for the first meeting of the Council under Austrian Presidency two days ago.
It was important that we in the Council should consider the issues, to many of which Mr Solana has alluded, and come to decisions that carried a clear message, for it is indeed important that the European Union should, where todayâs important issues are concerned, speak to the world clearly, unmistakeably, and with one voice, and this we are doing, of course, together with the Commission, while also seeking dialogue with you in the European Parliament.
I would point out that, in the 31 days of the Austrian Presidency so far, the foreign minister, many other Council chairmen and I myself have had many opportunities to come here and debate many issues of concern to your House, and that I yesterday had the opportunity â for which I am very grateful â to report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the foreign policy aspects of the first meeting of the Council under Austrian Chairmanship.
The Austrian Presidency wants to continue offering this willingness to engage in discussion on behalf of the Council and wishes to maintain dialogue with your House.
In this brief statement, I would like, in essence, to focus on two points: firstly, the Councilâs annual report to the European Parliament on the main aspects of, and fundamental options for the common foreign and security policy â which is what this item on the order of business is all about â and, secondly, relations between your House and the Council as regards the budget for it.
Firstly, the 1999 interinstitutional agreement on budget discipline and improvement of the budget procedure specifies that the Council shall draw up a report setting out the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, along with its financial implications for the overall Budget, and so it was that the Council, in April 2005, forwarded to Parliament the report for 2004, which is on our order of business today, and in which it endeavours to do as Parliament has asked it to do and reflect on Europeâs security strategy.
As a result, the report gives particular attention to important issues in connection with this, notably such aspects of the common foreign and security policy as, for example, crisis management and conflict prevention, combating terrorism, disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and small arms, external relations in different geographical areas, and so on.
The Council endeavoured to make the report a comprehensive one that would give a full account of the outcomes and activities in connection with the common foreign and security policy.
Its production of these reports is a matter of obligation, and they help to make visible and transparent the work that is done in connection with the CFSP.
Efforts have also been made to accommodate the views of the European Parliament, one consequence of which is that the report includes a special chapter with an overview of future activities and suggestions for activities in the coming year and for possible responses to any crises that may occur.
If I might move on to my second subject, the Budget for the common foreign and security policy, I would like to point out that the coming into being of the CFSP, as also of the European Security and Defence Policy, is without doubt one of the European Unionâs success stories; the crisis management operations in the Balkans, in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have helped to make the European Union more visible on the international stage.
The continuation of this in accordance with the European Security Strategy is a matter of priority, but that can be done in an effective manner only with the appropriate funding.
In the conclusions to the agreement on the next financial perspective, the European Council requests âthe budgetary authority to significantly increase the funding under the Budget for the common foreign and security policy for the period beginning in 2007 in order to cover the foreseeable need for resources as estimated on the basis of prognoses produced annually by the Council, with a reasonable margin being left for unforeseen activitiesâ.
One outcome of the trialogue was an agreement to add EURÂ 40 million to the CFSP Budget, bringing it to a total of EURÂ 102.6 million for the current year of 2006, and, although that is a step in the right direction, there are great challenges lying in store for us.
If the European Union becomes active in Kosovo, that will probably require substantial funds that the current CFSP Budget for 2006 will be incapable of providing.
Work is in progress on the question of how a situation of this kind can be dealt with.
The Presidencyâs report to the European Council on the ESDP invited the Austrian Presidency to continue working towards securing adequate funding for civilian ESDP missions from the CFSP Budget.
The presidency looks forward to working constructively with the European Parliament on this issue and will shortly provide it with relevant information in accordance with the agreement reached during the trialogue on the 2006 Budget.
It is expected that the Political and Security Committee will, through its representative, report on the subject in March of this year.
Let me conclude by emphasising once again that the Presidency looks forward to working constructively with your House towards the end of an increased and more efficient CFSP Budget in the negotiations on the future inter-institutional agreement and in the 2007 Budget procedure.
Â Â  . Mr President, while in 2004 and 2005 we saw the terrible scenario of the tsunami, I agree with Mr Solana that this year, particular political challenges lie ahead.
I would like to start with Ukraine and Russia, because that brings me to a very important point.
As you know, the Commission â President Barroso, Commissioner Piebalgs and I â have been working both in the background and at the forefront in order to facilitate the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia.
The important thing is, firstly, that we â as well as they â have come to a solution.
Secondly, we also have learned a very important lesson from this, namely that the question of energy is of great importance and has to be placed much higher on our political agenda.
The issue of energy covers energy security, the question of diversification and the ways of dealing with this question in the future.
The Commission will therefore prepare a communication on this matter, which will take all these issues into account.
The second point I would like to make concerns the Palestinian elections.
I wish to pay tribute to MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser.
We met in Gaza two weeks ago under difficult circumstances, when the security situation was still unclear.
We thought that Hamas would have 30-40% of the votes.
Like everybody else, we were taken by surprise.
However, let me say that the most important thing is that the elections were held freely, fairly and in relative security.
This is already an achievement.
It leads me to believe that election observation missions are becoming more and more important.
We see it in Sri Lanka, Palestine, Gaza and Afghanistan, to name just a few.
In the future, we will see it in Congo and in Haiti.
This is a very important tool that we will certainly want to use in favour of all our European friends in Parliament and Council and in favour of the European public.
To come back to Palestine, we had a very important Council meeting on Monday and a Quartet meeting on Monday evening.
Mr Solana has already reported on the main thrust of the three important principles: there has to be a commitment to non-violence, the new Palestinian Government has to recognise the State of Israel, and it also has to stand by its existing obligations, i.e. Oslo and the roadmap.
However, we are also faced with a challenge.
The caretaker government could stay in place for two to three months.
What do we do, in particular with regard to financial support?
We in the Commission have to find solutions.
I have already said that we would try to release EUR 10Â million from our infrastructure facility â there is some money there to be disbursed.
We also said we would help with the utilities, paying these directly to the Israelis in order to help that government too.
However, we also have to see what can be done with the money in our World Bank Trust Fund.
It was blocked and has not been disbursed because the benchmarks had not yet been met.
A World Bank mission will be going there and we will have to see what can be done.
This means that we will try to work in a coherent way, together with the President, the Council, the Council secretariat and Mr Solana to see which are the best instruments to use in order to make the foreign policy coherent, speedy and effective as quickly as possible.
Whilst on the subject of foreign policy issues, the Ukrainian elections are forthcoming.
Within the last hour I met Boris Tarasyuk.
We know how important these elections will be.
Again, an election observation team from the OECD, perhaps with your support, will be important.
We could also say that a lot was done in 2005, for example, on the market economy status, where we were working with the Ukrainians.
We could work on quite a number of issues that are important, such as visa facilitation and readmission.
We hope that after free and fair elections we can offer them an enhanced agreement, perhaps a free trade agreement.
That would give them an even better stance and approach towards us.
All of that brings me to the more general questions.
Both MrÂ Brok and MrÂ Winkler, the President-in-Office, have stressed the importance of the coherence between the different instruments at the disposal of the European Union under the first and second pillars.
I could not agree more.
In our view, it is a very important task to ensure that all EU foreign policy instruments â development aid, diplomacy, trade policy, civilian and military crisis management, institution-building, humanitarian assistance â work as part of a coherent whole, like interlinked cogs in a well-oiled machine.
After all, this is the rationale behind the Commission being âfully associatedâ with common foreign and security policy.
It also reflects the direction in which the Constitutional Treaty was taking us.
As Mr Brokâs report highlights, the security challenges we face span the fields covered by all three EU pillars.
Security is not only about defence and military deployment, it is also about civilian crisis management and the wise management of bilateral relationships â and we have a lot of those.
It is also about public health: think of avian flu.
It is about the environment: think of the Kyoto Protocol.
It is about the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
Yesterday we had the Afghanistan conference.
It is also about working together for institution-building, or fighting the scourge of drugs.
We have so many instruments that we can use and apply together.
It is not only about energy supplies and prices, but also about the fight against poverty in the world, and our ability to integrate our immigrant populations.
The European Union is increasingly called upon to face these global responsibilities in the field of peace and security.
We now have an impressive toolbox with which to do so.
But a smart toolbox is no good if the tools do not work very closely together.
This, therefore, has to be our aim.
An effective crisis response requires instruments that complement one another.
We need strong Community instruments working alongside the instruments of the CFSP.
It is a recipe that can work.
For example, our contribution to the Aceh peace process is a mix of CFSP and Community instruments.
The Commission also financed, for instance, President Ahtisaariâs peace negotiations using the rapid reaction mechanism.
We have therefore tried to be flexible.
The CFSP launched the Aceh Monitoring Mission to monitor compliance with the peace agreement.
At the same time, for instance, the Commission and Member States, working with the international community, put in place a package of long-term measures to support the peace process.
Another example is the border assistance mission in Moldova and Ukraine, where the Commission is funding the deployment of mobile teams to provide advice and on-the-job training to Moldovan and Ukrainian border and customs officials.
The long-term objective of facilitating a resolution of the Transnistria conflict matches that of the EUâs Special Representative.
The Border Assistance Mission and the EU Special Representative therefore work closely together.
Our head of mission also acts as his senior political adviser, and one of his team is based at our missionâs premises.
Early results are highly positive.
Community assistance enhances the impact of the CFSP assistance, and vice versa.
In neither case would the European Unionâs contribution have been comprehensive or meaningful without utilising both Community and CFSP instruments.
And most importantly, its impact on the ground â on peoplesâ lives â would be significantly reduced.
We also need to enhance the EUâs existing instruments in support of our security objectives.
Diplomacy requires carrots and sticks, whether we are talking about weapons of mass destruction or promoting stability and prosperity in our neighbourhood.
Access to the worldâs biggest internal market or our sizeable assistance programmes is a considerable carrot.
This complementary use of Community and CFSP instruments needs to become the rule, not the exception.
In 2006 the task for us all â Parliament, the Council and the Commission â is to work to improve the coherence of our different pillars and policies.
The issue will also be dealt with in the concept paper on the EUâs external project which President Barroso announced at Hampton Court, now planned for the June European Council.
The Commission will focus in particular on building up its crisis response capacities.
Within DG External Relations a âcrisis platformâ will improve both internal and external policy coordination and will also ensure a more efficient implementation of projects and operations.
It will complement our existing instruments such as the civil protection mechanism, humanitarian assistance and the rapid reaction mechanism.
We also want to build on our strategy for disaster alert and preparedness.
Under the new financial perspectives, the stability instrument will also help ensure continuity between short- and long-term interventions.
Our aim is to develop flexible and responsive solutions to crisis situations and thus be a better partner for the military component of crisis response.
Finally, we will also cooperate very closely with the two arms of the budgetary authority to ensure adequate resources for CFSP.
The Commission welcomes the substantial increase of the CFSP budget in 2006 in order to meet concrete new demands.
We know there will be new demands.
We also understood the conclusions of the European Council with regard to the future financial perspectives.
Our common aim must be to have sufficient resources to cover all external relations priorities, bearing in mind the 20% cut in the Commissionâs proposal for Heading 4.
In the light of past experience, one particular issue will be to ensure sufficient flexibility to respond to unforeseen needs.
I also hope there will be continued support for our stability instrument to enable us to make real progress in crisis response and coherence.
This is the main thrust of how we would like to face 2006 and its political challenges.
Â Â  . â None of this is new to me, because I have for many years been in agreement with what my friends Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have been saying.
The only point on which I disagree is the idea that resources are sufficient for the EU to be a player on the world stage, as Mr Solana put it, which is what our partners and the citizens are demanding.
This is not the case.
It is not the case either in terms of resources or in terms of organisation, and the right thing would be to think about how best to use the instruments provided for in the Treaty of Nice, in such a way that we can coordinate internal actions and organisation more effectively.
In order to address the lack of resources, we must establish priorities, and in this regard the support of the institutions is crucial.
Furthermore, Parliamentâs support, following prior consultation rather than notification after the fact, is crucial if consensus is to be reached.
There is therefore no major difference between what we are hearing from the Council and the Commission regarding the guidelines.
Yet not even great chefs, not even the very best chefs like Bocuse or Alain Ducas, are capable of making decent omelettes if they do not have enough eggs.
On the other hand, in addition to unity between the European institutions, it is nowadays crucial to guarantee strategic partnerships with the main partners, the most important of which is a transatlantic partnership, followed by strategic partnerships with Russia and China, and on the next level with India, Brazil, Indonesia and Pakistan.
This aspect is vital in view of the international issues at stake, such as money laundering and drug-trafficking, but in order for it to become a reality, the resources must be there via the various strands.
Another question, Mr President, that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner briefly touched upon is that of immigration.
The ageing population in the EU means that in the coming decades there will have to be a significant amount of immigration, from both the South and the East.
We will have to monitor this situation, both actively and proactively, and will need domestic policies enabling us to host and integrate these immigrants in a suitable way, and to control our external borders more effectively, given that the enlargement altered the borders that were there until recently.
As for the most contentious issues in this debate, I wish to say that we see eye to eye on both Palestine and Iran.
We must be cautious and prudent, but must also stick resolutely to our principles.
Under no circumstances must we waver on the principles that have always guided us, and, specifically on this issue, the principles that have been in place since the beginning of the 1990s.
We must also engineer some room for manoeuvre on the other side.
âFirmnessâ and âcautionâ should be the watchwords in this debate on Iran and the Middle East.
As regards Kosovo, a key element for many years when it comes to the Balkans, we continue to emphasise that territorial integrity must be maintained and that minorities must be respected.
Unless these two principles are upheld in Kosovo, we will have great difficulty in achieving any kind of stability in the region.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy security is of course a technical question, but it has also become a political question, because, while demand continues to rise, the trend in the coming years will be for supply to level off.
Consequently, tension will rise and I would suggest that as the major countries do with their vital supplies, we could carry out a thorough, inclusive study on the possible scenarios and the strategies for addressing those scenarios.
If we do not do this, a number of surprises lie in wait.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the account that MrÂ Solana has given us of the way 2006 has started is a sobering one.
In essence, what Mr Winkler had to say stressed the current presidencyâs view that there are hard times ahead of us this year, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for her part, said much the same thing.
There are, then, challenges for us to face.
Europeans must be aware that what Mr Solana, MrÂ Winkler and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have set out is none other than the neighbourhood policy of the European Union, on whose doorstep lie the crisis regions that they have described.
They are at a critical stage in their development, and there are risks inherent in that which threaten every single citizen of this Union of ours; there is no other way of putting it.
If one turns from that to consider Mr Brokâs description, in his report on the current state of European foreign policy in the hands of the executive institutions, of the instruments available to the institutions themselves and to us in this House, one finds that an equally sobering account.
More than ever before, the European Unionâs foreign policy is a core element in European policymaking, and it is worth noting, as Mr Brok rightly points out, that it is one that the people want and support.
Let us, though, be honest with ourselves: we do not have enough of the instruments that a European policy requires in order to be effective and faithful to its task, and so we in this House must insist on improvements being made in this area.
Let us take Ukraine as an example: a year ago, we all saw how effectively we can act when we are present on the ground with all our capacities bundled together in the persons of Javier Solana, the High Representative of our Union, empowered to speak and act on behalf of all of us; the Polish President, Mr Kwasniewski, as the head of an immediately adjoining state, with good opportunities for exercising influence in the country and with constant backup from other Heads of Government, who can in turn influence other stakeholders â the Russian Government, for example â through the European Union â these men helped to bring the Orange Revolution to a peaceful conclusion.
A year has now gone by, and today we hear, from Ukrainian visitors to this House, that many of the things achieved over the past year are again at risk and are being rolled back.
I do not need to add to the description of the threat presented by the energy situation, by which, of course, Ukraine is also seriously affected.
How, actually, is it possible that what we celebrated with such enthusiasm a year ago should now â within the space of a year â be rolled back in such a way?
This is something we have to think about, and Mr Winkler is right to say that we have to do so in the context of the financial perspective, for it is quite unacceptable that the Council should, every time it meets, broadcast to the world our need to undertake international commitments, and then make cuts in the funding that such commitments require.
One thing that is perfectly clear, then, not least in terms of the financial situation, is that we have to commit ourselves to what is needed to bring what stability we can to the Middle East.
Hamas must indeed renounce violence, but the EU must also keep its word, and we have to talk to Hamas if we are not to make the mistake that was made in Algeria of not recognising a legitimate election.
We have to be clear in our own minds about that, for our keeping our word is another contribution to peace.
If we do that, we can also demand that the others â Hamas in particular â move towards democracy, and in that I hope that we will succeed.
Â Â  Mr President, a common foreign and security policy that promotes Europeâs values in the world and brings peace and security to our neighbours is what Liberals and Democrats strive for.
But it is what Europeâs leaders are manifestly failing to provide.
Acting together, our Union could have used its leverage to promote democracy and stability.
Instead, its policies have given tacit support to tyrannies like Tunisia, Egypt and Syria.
We never demanded that diplomacy depend on releasing democrats like Egyptâs Ayman Nour; or, in Asia, on the right to a free return to his country for opposition leader Sam Rainsy, now in exile while we fund the dictatorship of Hun Sen.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, why are you surprised at the Palestinian poll?
The European Union has peddled promises of democracy, peace and human rights in Palestine while our development aid has fed Al-Fatah, whose members now burn images of one of our prime ministers and peace negotiations have got nowhere.
Far from being a key player, Mr Solana, the consequences of Europeâs failure are plain for all to see.
Israel, undeterred, builds a wall around East Jerusalem in violation of its roadmap obligations and international law.
The Palestinians, tired of slow progress and shameful social services, turn to Hamas at the ballot box.
And now the prognosis is worse than ever.
After demanding democracy, some EU leaders talk of shunning one of the only democratically elected governments in the Arab world!
Of course, Hamas must renounce violence and commit to a two-state solution.
But so must Israel.
As Leila Shahid, the General Delegate for the Palestinian Authority said today: âIt takes two to tangoâ.
The Commissioner has spoken of policies based on human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles, but where is the emphasis on those fine things when pragmatism devoid of principles is so often the order of the day?
A global drive for peaceful conflict resolution would be a major counterweight to the heavy-handed US approach; it would assure Europeâs security, prosperity and global repute; and it would also give us far greater leverage over micro-states like the Maldives or the Seychelles, whose governments abuse human rights despite being almost totally dependent on our aid and trade.
That is why Liberals and Democrats believe that the time has come for an accountable, properly funded and values-driven European foreign policy.
According to Eurobarometer, it is a desire shared by 70% of our citizens.
Mr Solana, Liberals and Democrats object to Parliamentâs views being ignored or disregarded on matters of global importance.
We want to see less of you on television and more of you here in this Chamber.
And we are tired of Council secrecy and its disregard for Parliamentâs right to prior consultation on policy priorities.
Those rights are enshrined in ArticleÂ 21 of the Treaty and in the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement.
We are facing many grave challenges: to democratise our Near Neighbourhood, especially former Soviet republics currently at the mercy of Russiaâs energy politics; to ensure that the elections in Belarus are free and fair; and to ensure that the referendums in Kosovo and Montenegro do not end in violence.
The role of foreign policy must not end there.
I understand that selling arms to China is back on the Councilâs agenda, yet China has still not recanted the Tiananmen Square killings, nor released, after 16Â years, all those jailed.
So we demand an assurance from you, Mr Winkler, that the Austrian Presidency will not lift the Unionâs arms embargo.
Most pressing is the question of Iran.
The IAEA board of governors meets tomorrow to decide whether to report Iran to the Security Council.
Stopping Iran building nuclear weapons must be our aim.
That is why Europe must commit to respect the IAEAâs findings due in March.
But making progress towards the disarmament of the current nuclear powers, in line with the commitments we have made, is the strongest and most convincing message we could possibly send.
A Europe which learns to use its muscle as a force for good is truly a force to be reckoned with.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, MrÂ Solana, MrÂ Winkler, ladies and gentlemen,
â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, the present situations in Palestine and Iran are indeed difficult, and I envy nobody who tries to intervene in them.
The only chance that the European Union has, I believe, is to spell out the facts and avoid all ambiguity; we must be unambiguous.
Hamasâ 1988 charter is indeed appalling, and those who read it can do no other than shudder, but Hamas is now in elected office, and, in dealing with it, we must make it clear that foreign policy and relations with Israel are not in Hamasâ hands, but in those of President Abbas.
He is the one to whom we must at last give a chance; we must, once and for all, tell Israel to give him a chance to prove that there is a policy other than that espoused by Hamas.
If we fail in that, then we will lose.
There must be no ambiguity in our attitude towards Hamas, not only as regards the peace issue, but also as regards fundamentalism.
There is the risk of a fundamentalist society coming into being.
The only way we can have any credibility, though, is if we do not mince our words when talking to Israel either.
There is no future for the Palestinians in being conquered and occupied; that is something that Israel must come to understand; this is a policy area in which it needs a change of approach.
A wall that stands as a symbol of conquest is not the sort of wall that makes for safety.
When one considers our history â your own history for example â from the moment when you demonstrated against NATO right up to the moment when you were its Secretary-General; when one considers my own history, when one considers MrÂ Fischerâs history, one says to oneself that it is important never to give up hope that people can change, and that applies to Hamas.
â But we cannot simply wait and see what happens.
This change is necessary to our own security, and we must compel Hamas to make it.
We can do that only if the Israelis and the Palestinians really grasp the fact that, where the European Union is concerned, there is no debate: the right of Israel to exist is no longer a matter for discussion, and we no longer regard discussion of it as acceptable.
The right of the Palestinians to a state is no longer a matter for discussion, and we no longer regard discussion of it as acceptable.
The two are inseparable, and if we can get that accepted as a fact, we will be able to do something even in this problematic situation.
The position as regards Iran is no different; it, too, has a right to the secure supply of energy.
As a Green, I am not in favour of nuclear power, but we cannot have a situation in which some states will use nothing else, while, at the same time, telling the Iranians that they may not use it; that is immoral, nothing but immoral.
By all means, let us say ânoâ to the atom bomb, but then we must offer Iran, too, security for its territory, for that has been its great fear ever since it was attacked by Iraq.
That is our task â clarity and security will see us through.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Solana, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, MrÂ Winkler, I should like to seize the opportunity, rare as it is, of MrÂ Solanaâs being present in this Chamber to touch on one or two aspects of the common foreign and security policy that are particularly problematic for my group.
I will base my remarks in particular on the Operational Programme of the Council for 2006, since that is the most recent background paper.
What can be observed?
Firstly, the disproportionate importance accorded to the military dimension of the CFSP.
It is with outright greed that the Programme lists one by one the catalogues of forces, the rapid response operations, the battle groups, the European Defence Agency and the strategic partnership between the European Union and NATO.
The 25 thus have the impression that they are playing with the big boys, but their self-importance is illusory and misplaced.
On the other hand â and this is my second observation â the large open wounds in some of the most sensitive regions in the world, wounds that specifically require some political creativity from Europe in the face of the irresponsible approach of the US leaders and their allies are, for their part, sidelined in the CFSP agenda.
Thus, in the Operational Programme for 2006, it is the case that, in 14 pages of text, the Near East is disposed of in less than two and a half lines used to reveal to us, and I quote, that: âThe European Union will continue its efforts to implement the road mapâ.
There is not a single word on the Israeli leadersâ choice of a unilateral strategy, which clearly runs counter to the spirit of the road map and to any peace process.
Iraq, for its part, warrants three lines, but there is no mention whatsoever of the war nor of the catastrophic Bush strategy, which lands us all into a tragic deadlock.
This brings me to our main criticism, which I already had the opportunity to voice in this very Chamber in June 2003 at the time of the publication of your report on the European security strategy â which is still in force, MrÂ Solana.
The report gives an apocalyptic description of the new threats without once analysing their root causes, and it is with sheer disbelief that one reads - I quote - that âby working together, the European Union and the United States can be a major force for good in the worldâ.
So what is your assessment, MrÂ Solana, of two years of implementation of this strategy?
Has the world become a safer and fairer place?
To my mind, a good yardstick against which to judge this is the case of the Near East, to which I am now going to turn my attention.
While we are on this subject, allow me to point out to our fellow Members the presence, in our galleries, of MrsÂ LeÃ¯la Shahid, Palestineâs new delegate-general to the European Union, whom I should like warmly to welcome.
Even before the Palestinian elections, I had called for Parliamentâs agenda to include the issue of the European diplomatsâ harsh but accurate report on Jerusalem, which the Council kept secret so as not to affect its relations with the Israeli authorities.
Where are we with this matter today?
Like a number of my fellow Members, I have just returned from Palestine, where we were observing the legislative elections.
We were all pleased and moved to observe the exemplary way in which the ballot was held there, the festive atmosphere in the streets, despite the occupation, and the way in which we, as foreigners, were welcomed.
This pride in being able to show the world the Palestinian peopleâs ability to build its democracy is a major asset for the future that the election result must not have us forget.
The same is true of the Palestiniansâ desire to make peace with neighbouring Israel and to have two peoples and two States, which were subjects that featured in all of the conversations we were able to have.
Anyone who took the risk of starving these women, men and children, or indeed of radicalising them, by cutting off their vital aid, would therefore be shouldering a heavy responsibility.
Instead, let us count on the aspirations for democracy and for a just peace, which very much have the upper hand in todayâs Palestinian society and which any Palestinian authority will have to take into account.
It is the very future of the partnership between the two regions that is at stake.
As for the election result, let us be careful not to analyse it purely from an internal Palestinian perspective.
Certainly, the popular rejection of Fatah is genuine.
Any hegemonic power tends to become divorced from society.
Yet, how can one fail to see that the Palestinian Authority has above all lost its credibility with the citizens because it has not succeeded in improving their lot or in offering them new prospects due to the blocked peace process?
After the high hopes of ten years ago, the feeling is now one of extreme exasperation in the face of the continuing occupation, the development of settlements, the construction of the wall, the âtargetedâ assassinations, the arrests, the detention of prisoners, the daily violence and the worsening living conditions as a result of the territories being sealed off.
As for the Palestinian State and as for Jerusalem, the Palestinian Authority is seen as having accepted a great deal and as having obtained very little.
What should be done, then?
There is no doubt that, as you said, MrÂ Solana, we should put pressure on Hamas to stop the violence and assassination attempts.
What are you saying to the Israeli authorities, though?
I have heard nothing on this matter.
We also need clearly to show that, as far as we are concerned, there is no âvariable geometryâ version of international law.
Like any State, Israel has a duty to comply with the Security Council resolutions.
It also has to follow the recommendations of the International Court of Justice. It has to implement its obligations under the road map.
In that context, MrÂ President, it stands to reason that, now more than ever, the attitude to be adopted with regard to our diplomatsâ report on Jerusalem is this: we must publish it straightaway, implement its recommendations and, more generally, finally choose a real alternative to PresidentÂ Bushâs strategy, which has failed in the Near East and, beyond, in the Middle East.
Let us be alert to the cries of alarm rising up from societies on the verge of despair.
Â Â  I imagine that all of the speakers are aware that there is an item coming up on our agenda specifically relating to the analysis of the situation in the Middle East, the result of the Palestinian elections and whether or not this report to which Mr Wurtz has referred should be published.
You have chosen to organise the debate by dividing it up in this way.
I imagine that you are aware that you are effectively changing the agenda and discussing points which we are due to discuss later.
Â Â  . Mr President, when, exactly one week ago, I was observing the Palestinian elections on behalf of this House, one giant banner, in particular, caught my eye.
It was in Ramallah, and it depicted Ayatollah Khomeini together with Hamas leaders Yassin and Rantisi.
The political message is crystal-clear.
Rather than striving towards settlement or peace with the Jewish state, we should tear out its page from history, for that is what Khomeini called for, and, according to the present Iranian President Ahmadinejad, those are words of wisdom.
Combined with the nuclear aspirations of the Mullahsâ regime in Teheran â the peaceful nature of which is very much a matter of doubt â this makes for a particularly touch challenge for the Western world, the EU, and the US.
The historian Dan Dinerâs comment on the Palestinian parliamentary elections was that âwith Hamas in Ramallah, Iran has moved much closer towards Israelâ, and he was right.
According to recent reports from Teheran, many pro-Western Iranians consider this development to be the gradual victory of barbarism over civilisation.
I sincerely hope that the European institutions, far from sharing this sense of resignation, will make a firm stand for Israelâs right of existence and consequently for our own civilisation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to four issues where rapid and consistent action is necessary within the framework of the common foreign and security policy.
The first priority is the Neighbourhood Policy.
Firstly, the way forward for Russia and Ukraine.
We ought to take into account the fact that at the moment Russia does not have good relations with any one of its neighbouring states, since relations are formed not on the basis of mutual respect and advantage, but by making itself felt through economic or energy sanctions, and by refusing to sign the agreements that have been prepared concerning borders.
At the moment Russia is blocking the export of Ukraineâs food products.
I therefore urge MrÂ Solana and the Commission to take immediate action to encourage the lifting of this blockade, and at the same time to remind Russia that such action is in clear conflict with the requirements of the World Trade Organisation, which it has declared a wish to join.
Secondly, the gas supply crisis in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia was like a wake-up call for Europe, showing that these supplies are not secure, that supply diversification is necessary, as is coordination between the European Unionâs energy and security policies and the Member States.
Thirdly, in this context we should mention the agreement concerning the North European Gas Pipeline, in the construction of which the former German Chancellor has obtained a post, giving rise to concerns about political corruption.
By not evaluating this event from their own viewpoints with sufficient consistency, the European institutions are diminishing the confidence of EU citizens, and, incidentally, preventing us from speaking about combating corruption elsewhere in the world.
Now, I would like to mention another region â China.
At the moment China is in a phase of rapid development and it is ready to give high priority to entering into cooperation with the European Union.
If our dialogue with China does not become more earnest and constructive, it may turn to closer relations in another direction.
Finally, in relations between the Council and Parliament we would like to see not just consultation, but that the European Parliamentâs opinion is actually taken into account, especially in relation to so-called âspeaking with one voiceâ.
Â Â  Mr President, the fight against terrorism must be one of the priorities of the common foreign and defence policy.
The report is quite right to draw attention to the importance of respect for human rights and civil liberties.
I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my total and unconditional solidarity with the Danish Prime Minister, who is currently under enormous pressure to take action against the cartoonists who had the temerity to depict none other than the prophet Mohammed.
Islamic countries, including Turkey â which is an EU candidate country â demand apologies and sanctions, and even insist on a boycott of Danish products.
Prime Minister Rasmussen is more than right when he claims that there is no democracy without free expression of opinion.
The Council, Commission and Parliament should stand united in the defence of our liberties.
If they fail to do so, then it is hardly worth our while even talking about a security and defence policy, for there will be nothing whatever left to defend.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, earlier today MrÂ Solana stated that the European Union needs to be a global actor.
Consolidation of the common foreign and security policy is therefore required and the constitutional crisis is certainly not helping matters.
Cohesion cannot, however, be achieved entirely through common institutions.
It is achieved mainly through common political will.
A great deal will therefore depend on the personal actions, good judgment and creativity shown by MrÂ Solana and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner in the course of this year.
MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner has also promised a special communication the European Unionâs energy security energy.
In addition, MrÂ Brokâs report refers to the need to draft a strategy for energy security.
In fact, these are only half-hearted solutions/stop-gap solutions.
What the European Union actually needs is for us to set ourselves the goal of creating a genuinely common policy on energy security.
Only then will it be possible to prevent situations like the one that arose two years ago, when Russian suppliers held Belarus to ransom or the one at the beginning of this month when Russia was blackmailing Ukraine.
Central European Member States were also affected.
Do we really want to be subjected to blackmail of this kind in the future and do we really want to freeze like people are freezing in Georgia right now?
The only alternative is a common European Union energy policy.
Another point I would like to make is that our policy towards Russia should be modified.
There is scope for criticism of the lack of progress in certain areas.
Two of the latter are referred to in MrÂ Brokâs report, namely problems concerning human rights and arms reduction in the Kaliningrad region.
The list should actually be much longer, and include a common solution to regional conflicts, notably in Transnistria and the Southern Caucasus, along with the whole Kaliningrad package.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as Europeans we have to respect the outcome of the free vote in Palestine and encourage those elected to form a government that chooses the path of negotiation, recognises Israel and renounces violence, as President Abu Mazen himself has indicated.
The outcome of the vote also reflects the suffering and humiliation of daily life under occupation, squeezed between checkpoints, wall and settlements, and at the same time it rings out as a severe criticism of Palestinian politicians.
The unilateral withdrawal from Gaza has itself weakened the position of President Abu Mazen, for obvious reasons.
That therefore gives rise to two compelling needs: not to abandon the prospect of a negotiated peace, and to call on both parties to renounce any actions that might jeopardise peace.
I therefore agree with the clear conditions that you, MrÂ Solana, have set the Palestinians.
In the same spirit, however, I ask you: do you have no objections to make to Israel, which has never accepted the idea of operating within the roadmap?
This debate has started in Israeli society.
In addition, Hamas itself has shown its ability to respect a negotiated truce for an entire year.
I believe that Israel should put a stop to the settlements and avoid taking any steps to annex East Jerusalem.
On the subject of financial aid, I agree with you absolutely: it is essential to prevent collapse and to assess the situation as it unfolds.
In the same spirit, I should like to put a question to you, MrÂ Solana, as well as to the Council and the Commission: do you not think we should put pressure on the Israeli authorities to stop blocking the transfer of tax revenues to the Palestinians?
Since it is Palestinian money, I feel that in the current situation the Israelis are adding fuel to the fire.
Â Â  Mr President, I thought my speaking time had been extended by one minute, but you many want to check this out while I am talking.
Mr High Representative, Commissioner, Mr President, at the beginning of this debate, we were given a breathtaking overview of the events of the past 30 days.
I should like to congratulate Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, as well as the presidency, for their unrelenting commitment to dealing with the disasters that have struck and all those painful events.
I should also like to join in congratulating the EUâs election observation missions in general and those who have been active in the Palestinian regions in particular, for their job must have been particularly difficult.
I think that we could draw two lessons from the summary which Mr Solana presented to us.
The first lesson is that the European Union can only be effective when united.
I was therefore delighted to hear the day before yesterday that the General Affairs Council had reached a unanimous decision in connection with the conditions under which further financial support could be granted to the Palestinian Authority.
I was also very pleased to hear that the four parties had held an emergency meeting that very evening.
Imagine the implications if one Head of Government had stated one thing, another Minister had said something else and a third Prime Minister had brought a different message altogether.
It is obvious that this would have been very pernicious, but that did not happen, and I hope that things are going to stay that way.
Needless to say, we need unanimity across all the dossiers.
Sufficient funds must also be made available.
I am not as confident as the Commissioner that provision will be made for this in the financial perspectives 2007-2013.
Like her, I would like to stress that sufficient flexibility must be displayed.
Finally, I agree that, insofar as the High Representative, the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council involve Parliament in their activities on a regular basis, they will be able to count on our continued support.
Â Â  Mr President, further to Mr Solanaâs reference to the Balkans, I would just like to take the opportunity of saying that we give our wholehearted backing to his efforts in a place where we bear direct responsibility for peace in Europe; this is something that nobody else can shoulder for us, and we must credibly and undeviatingly develop the regionâs European perspective.
I would like to congratulate you on the decision you took on Monday evening, in which you successfully brought together the very diverse things that are being said in Europe about Iran.
I would appeal to all, while going down the road thus set out, to leave plenty of room for diplomatic manoeuvre and negotiation.
The prospect of the Iraniansâ meeting with China and Russia now going ahead is good news, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the decision as to whether the red line has been crossed and world peace put in jeopardy is for neither Mr SchÃŒssel nor Mr Steinmeier to take, but for the United Nations and nobody else.
We cannot control the situation on our own, and it is difficult, when dealing with a hate preacher such as Ahmadinejad, to keep looking for new ways to make him see reason â the reason that is part of the European security strategy that you have set out, which is founded upon non-proliferation.
We know that, if the situation in Iran were to escalate, it would be an enormous threat to the things that it is in our interests to defend â the prevention of nuclear weapons ending up in Iranian hands, the reduction of the threat to Israel and more security for it.
I therefore hope that we will find a peaceful way forward, difficult though that task may be.
Let me say, in my capacity as chair of the delegation, that there is another voice in Iran.
I will not let diplomatic relations âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday marked the death of the 100th British serviceman killed in Iraq.
These brave men made the ultimate sacrifice of giving their lives for their country.
But they were betrayed.
They were sent to war on the basis of the lies and fantasies of Prime Minister Tony Blair.
This happened for one simple reason: Mr Blair and the Labour government have no conception of what constitutes the British national interest.
Now Mr Blair wants to embroil the British nation in yet another lie and fantasy.
That lie is that Britainâs national interest lies in something called a European common foreign policy.
Yesterday also marked another significant event.
In London, Mr Javier Solana spoke on the Palestinian issue on behalf of the European Union.
He did so in the de facto role of the European Foreign Minister. This is despite the fact that the European common foreign policy should be dead and buried because of the rejection of the European constitution.
This is a clear signal that the Labour government is surrendering control of foreign policy to the European Union.
Chancellor Bismarck once famously remarked that the whole of the Balkans were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.
Well, the whole of the European common foreign policy and the planned European army is not worth the bones of one single British serviceman or woman.
Â Â  MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, MrÂ Solana, ladies and gentlemen, todayâs debate concerns the need for a more open, more effective and more responsible European Union common foreign and security policy.
We can be satisfied that, in recent years, much positive work has been achieved in the advancement of Europeâs civil military force.
Unfortunately, however, the report by MrÂ Brok shows up too many still unresolved deficiencies and problems with the CFSP.
There are serious difficulties inherent in adopting decisive positions regarding Europeâs Common Security and Defence Policy (ECSDP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP).
These policies suffer from a serious lack of resources, and emphasis is also placed on the need for democratic parliamentary control.
These are only a few of the current issues relevant to the subject of todayâs debate.
So we, the European Parliament, ought to be able to change things for the better, and this includes demanding appropriate policy coordination in order to ensure intensive dialogue between the European Parliament and the Council on these issues.
We know that this is not easy, but it is a question of the European Parliamentâs institutional influence and development.
The clear backing from Europeâs citizens for joint European security actions imposes a duty on the European Parliament to expand its institutional influence and participation in decision-making.
Security will only increase if the messages from MrÂ Chirac, MrÂ Solana or MrsÂ Merkel or decisions taken in the spheres of weapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism or energy are predictable, and do not take an unprepared European Parliament unawares.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a common foreign policy might have prevented the energy crisis in Eastern Europe.
It might also have meant that Polandâs concerns about the construction of the Russo-German gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea were taken into account, and Polandâs interests recognised as being the interests of the whole of Europe.
The citizens of the European Union and indeed of the world expect us to have a common foreign policy and to defend the weak, with or without a European Constitution.
Israel cannot therefore be permitted to monopolise foreign policy in its part of the world.
Hamas will happily renounce terror and violence when a Palestinian State is created, thus reducing the terrorist threat in the world.
Like MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, I am against nuclear weapons, but I cannot understand why Israel is allowed to possess an atom bomb whereas Iran is not.
Â Â  Mr President, when I hear the litany of crises and problems that confront us, I am alarmed that so many think that the answer to these problems is more European Union.
The EUâs foreign policy ambitions and pretensions now reach into every area, from defence to immigration to energy supply, and we see few positive results from this.
I would prefer a more modest approach, with the European Union focusing only on those areas were it can genuinely add practical value through humanitarian and development assistance, electoral observation and the like.
I would also say that in these dangerous times when new forces have emerged that threaten the very nature of our free societies, we need more solidarity among the democracies and less EU self promotion.
The lessons of recent years show that where the Western democracies are divided, their interests are damaged.
The enemies of democracy will exploit these divisions for their own purposes.
I have just returned from participating in the electoral observation mission in the Palestine Authority areas and East Jerusalem.
The election results were a cry from the streets.
You rightly say that the precise makeup of the new government of the Palestine Authority areas will not be clear for some time, but it will undoubtedly reflect the new-found power of Hamas.
It is indeed vital that we do not provide support to that government unless it forsakes violence, recognises the right of Israel to exist and positively engages in the peace process.
In the past I have expressed concern about the nature of EU financing and the adequacy of safeguards to prevent misuse of our funds.
These concerns will now multiply.
Not only must we ensure that financial assistance is transparent and cannot be used to support terrorism and extremism: there is also a crying need to ensure that our money is used more effectively so that it is of direct benefit to the Palestinian people.
Finally, let us put more effort into ensuring that there is no difference in approach between the Europeans and the United States.
We have a common interest in peace and stability in the Middle East.
Â Â  Mr President, we have listened with great interest to Mr Solanaâs speech, particularly the first part in which he listed what had happened over the course of January.
I hope that this will not set a trend for the rest of the year and hope that, each month, we will see new elements constantly being added to the foreign agenda.
What stood out for me were the observations he made, particularly at the beginning, about the situation that has come about in Europe following the problems involving the gas supply to Ukraine and other countries.
I think that one effect of what happened at the beginning of January has been to push energy policy up our list of priorities.
I have drawn a few conclusions from those recent events.
First of all, I have to conclude that we may not have organised ourselves very well as consumers, because our energy supply is so vulnerable, too vulnerable, if you ask me, since the effects of an unexpected energy shortage can be nothing short of devastating.
Secondly, I have noticed that some Member States are more vulnerable than others, which somewhat contradicts the notion of solidarity that we nurture in the European Union.
There are certainly countries in our immediate vicinity that are vulnerable â that much has become apparent â and the question of mutual solidarity, not least among our neighbours, is clearly an issue.
This is also a technical matter, of course.
We can invest in better and more diversified means of providing ourselves with energy.
The third point I would like to make, which is actually the most important one, is that energy supplies and access to them are being deployed as political weapons, in this case against Ukraine, but also against Moldova and, in some respects, against Georgia as well.
We have issued warnings about this in the past.
The Russians have threatened to do this before and I think that, in this respect, we have to come down hard on them, for that is unacceptable.
We too must ensure that we do not become dependent on Russia to an extent that we no longer dare say anything to Russia and keep quiet because we have become too dependent.
