That is why we cannot accept any disfigurement of the existing institutional package.
Strengthening our common foreign and security policy by appointing a foreign minister, having a stable Council Presidency, extending qualified majority voting, overturning the three-pillar structure, and providing the Union with a legal personality are all, for us, essential points that need to be safeguarded.
I should like here to warn against certain appeals for 'realism', which are typical on the eve of a major European Council and unfailingly seek to achieve a watered-down compromise.
I would point out, however, that if the major global challenges can only be addressed at a European level, then the people who want a Europe that is equal to such challenges are the ones who are being genuinely realistic, and not the people who do not want that.
Internally, I would mention upholding the European social model and creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.
How can anyone fail to see that this is a vital complement for a European citizenship that identifies with more than just the economic dimension?
Externally, I would mention wars, the fight against international terrorism, and the global challenges of energy and climate change (hydrogen).
How can anyone deny that the only way to make our choices and our values prevail on the international stage is by being able to express a foreign policy worthy of the name and communicating it to the world with one voice?
As regards the structure of the European Union, you must not believe that it is merely a theoretical issue.
The complexity of the Union is one of the main reasons for the gap between it and the people.
How can anyone not see the advantages, then, of overturning the pillar structure, especially in terms of clarity and understanding on the part of the people?
The 2004 Constitutional Treaty provides convincing solutions for these points.
Do we really want to sacrifice them for the sake of a watered-down approach that resorts to the lowest common denominator?
Do we really want to risk making the system even more complex by refusing to make in-depth changes and confining ourselves to merely touching it up here and there?
Do we really want to continue proceeding 'with our face masked', to use Jacques Delors' expression, for fear of revealing the real Europe to our citizens?
Therefore, my dear Members of this Parliament, representatives of Europe's citizens, let us try not to lend support to the negative rhetoric on Europe.
Let us not go on concealing it from our fellow citizens.
Let us show them this Europe, instead, and show it proudly.
Let everyone see what it has done for us in terms of peace and prosperity; let us explain how vital it is for our lives.
Let us tell our fellow citizens once and for all that in a world that is now a system of continents it makes no sense for a country and its citizens to live outside a political and economic aggregation that is internally strong and externally respected.
Italy will therefore make every effort in these negotiations to secure a worthy compromise.
I am convinced that we can succeed and that, all together, we must succeed.
Of course, if it proves impossible for all 27 countries to agree, then there will be the problem of how to proceed.
That dilemma can only be resolved if we go back to that fundamental principle that I mentioned at the beginning of my address: the very ethics of the Union require that nobody should block other people's aspirations too much or for too long.
That is why Italy, a country that has always believed deeply in Europe, realises that it now has a further duty: it must imagine - or start imagining - how to enable countries that are willing to do so to make real progress in furthering European unity.
I do not think that all countries necessarily have to proceed together at the same speed.
I hope they will, and I shall try to make that happen.
I realise, however, that it is not always possible.
Even now, though, some of Europe's most significant political decisions, such as the euro and the creation of the Schengen area, have been put into practice by just some of the Member States.
They have not been aimed against any State; they have not excluded the others; instead, the door has been left open.
Furthermore, these decisions have been respected by those that at the time did not feel ready to move in a certain direction right away.
I therefore hope that this same constructive approach will also hold good in future and that it will prevail over any attempt to use a veto.
Italy, as you well know, has always thought that being pro-European is the best way to be far-sighted.
Today, however, being far-sighted does not only mean drawing up ambitious plans for the future of European integration.
It also means addressing the issue of allowing those peoples who want to do so to realise their ambitions of union at the pace and in the manner that are best suited to them.
If nobody ever takes the trouble to consider such an eventuality, we run the risk that the European project will run aground and that the ideals of all those who over the years have believed passionately in it will be frustrated.
Even countries like mine, which have invested unreservedly in the integration of Europe for 50 years, might eventually run out of enthusiasm.
I therefore want to conclude with a two-fold message.
Italy will give the German and, later, the Portuguese Presidency the utmost support to ensure that the European Council of 21 and 22 June and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference are a success with which all the Member States can identify.
At the same time, Italy is well aware that a compromise is not an end in itself, and that therefore, if we are not convinced by such a compromise, we will not subscribe to it.
A fast-track group of countries might then prove to be the best way to advance along the road to an ever closer Union, on condition that the door is always left open to any country that might want to join them at a later date.
Allow me finally to make a strong appeal to the members of our parliaments, the direct representatives of the citizens.
Above all, I address the Members of this Parliament, who represent the people of Europe.
You have an irreplaceable role in making the citizens understand what is at stake.
We will only be able to create the conditions for successful constitutional talks if the work of our governments is supported by your work.
We have to realise that we must not fail, or the result will be decline: the decline of an advanced idea of Europe, of a Europe that is able to be a leading player in the world thanks to its underlying values.
In short, we would risk once again becoming a little western appendage of Asia, a fate to which we would be consigned not only by geography, but also by future history.
Thank you.
Mr Prodi, we thank you warmly for this persuasive European intervention, which I hope everyone has been able to hear.
Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing a speeding-up of the process of European integration, whether in terms of the relaunch of the institutions, of the new dynamic inspired by Mrs Merkel on climate change and energy or of the implementation of a common immigration policy.
Europe is making progress.
Europe is demonstrating that it represents a level of decision making that is not just necessary and effective, but also legitimate.
Mr Prodi, you have shared with us your vision, your notion of European affairs.
Through you, I should like to pay tribute to the historic, and more prevailing than ever, commitment of the Italian people towards European integration.
After a long period of uncertainty, the relaunch of the institutions is taking shape.
The German Presidency is right to make this one of its priorities.
If Europe is in a position to make effective and democratic decisions, we will be able usefully to decide on common policies.
To move quickly and to enable Europe to make progress were the commitments made by the UMP candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, and such is the mandate given to the new President of the French Republic by the people of France.
This dynamic, which is driven by a Member State that rejected the draft Treaty, already has the support of several other EU Member States and must be turned to good account if progress is to be made.
The time for asking questions has passed.
What we need now is action and flexibility.
We are only four weeks away from the crucial European Council of 21 and 22 June, which must result in a new Treaty being drafted by the end of the year.
The ratification of the Treaty by the 27 will be able to take place before the 2009 European elections.
Action goes hand in hand with flexibility because, as you have said, bridges must be built between the 18 countries that said 'Yes', the two that said 'No' and those that have not yet given their opinion.
Each country will have to make an effort to form links with the others and to educate its public.
Success will only come if we stop relying on semantic issues and concentrate on what is truly important: double majority voting, the extension of qualified majority voting, the principle of subsidiarity and the sharing out of powers between the Union and the Member States, a stable presidency, common representation on the international stage and also the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
As far as the MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are concerned, what Europe needs is to form a political force and to become an autonomous actor on the international stage.
Europe needs an economic and commercial identity so as to ensure that our partners comply with the same rules as us, in the fiscal, environmental and social spheres.
Europe must ensure that, even within Europe itself, there is no unfair competition among the Member States, particularly in the area of taxation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the right track; what must prevail is the idea of responsibility and of the general interest on the part of political leaders and of public opinion.
While we remain firm in terms of our ideals and principles, they will be well served only if pragmatism prevails over dogmatism and if the good faith is stronger than the bad faith and the lax attitudes.
Mr President, I should like briefly to mention the recent EU-Russia Summit in Samara.
Many commentators regarded the Summit as a failure for Europe.
As far as my group is concerned, the opposite is true, and Europe emerged the winner of this Summit.
It was the winner, not against Russia - which is a partner whom we respect - but in terms of affirming our convictions and ideals.
We are satisfied because, on the Kosovo Status process, on energy and also on the issue of Estonia's sovereignty, our leaders hoisted the European flag and expressed themselves strongly and intelligibly.
Mr Prodi, I shall conclude by saying how essential the Euro-Mediterranean dimension is to our parliamentary group.
It is in the Mediterranean that our European adventure will succeed or fail.
Nothing is so strategic to us, as Europeans, as investing in our relations with the Mediterranean basin, focusing on the development of a region that is endowed with such considerable human resources, and working towards the establishment of peace and stability in the Middle East.
Thank you, Mr Daul, not least for keeping to your speaking time so excessively strictly.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, Prime Minister Prodi, for that encouraging speech, to which I, as chairman of my group, have nothing further to add, for you have expressed what my group thinks, and we thank you for speaking in such plain terms.
We have no fear of you bringing the same clarity to the negotiations.
The reason why we do not fear that prospect is that there will then be at least one strong head of government at the Intergovernmental Conference, one who is not prepared to agree to a compromise at any price, for a compromise that would surrender the substance of what we put into the Constitution would be no compromise at all, but rather a setback for the work of European integration, and so thank you for your clear affirmation.
(Applause)
My colleague Mr Nyrup Rasmussen had the opportunity to sit at the table in Nice, at which he helped negotiate the Treaty of Nice, and I have had frequent occasion to discuss this with him.
When the fifteen Heads of Government who were at Nice left the chamber, they all described the result as inadequate, on the grounds that it was one of those minimal compromises that get reached in order to prevent even more Heads of Government nodding off.
That was why the Convention was summoned; it was summoned because those who had sat at the table in Nice said that this was not enough for the purpose of the enlargement that would come about, but it is coming, and, if we want to make a success of it, a new basis will be needed.
So it was that they, reluctantly, agreed to our demand for a convention, knowing as they did that what the 15 had hammered out would not be enough for 27.
At the Convention, a constitution was adopted, with people saying that the text was OK, and so they would vote for it.
It was a good constitution, but it then got thrown out and we were thrown back on the Treaty of Nice.
I would ask, though, whether what was true in the year 2000 - namely that Nice would not be enough for enlargement - has become false in 2007.
Nice is indeed not enough for the purposes of enlargement, but enlargement has already happened, and on the basis of an inadequate treaty.
It is those who seek its destruction who want to leave the European Union in this state, those who want, whatever the cost, to prevent a new Treaty, and there must be no quarter given to them.
(Applause)
There are those who say that, while Nice may not be enough, it is still too much for them.
Today I have heard a Head of Government say that there can be no compromise with people such as they.
Those who want to go back to the days before Nice would be best advised to stay away from the Intergovernmental Conference.
Now is the time for some straight talking.
Eighteen of the Member States of the European Union have already ratified this constitutional treaty, two of them - Spain and Luxembourg - by means of a referendum.
Why, in fact, do we put up with a state of affairs in which the only ones that get talked about are France and the Netherlands?
Why is it not being said that this Treaty has received the support of two peoples, with, it might be added, more Europeans having cast a 'yes' vote for the Constitution than cast a 'no' vote against it?
That is another truth about European democracy that should be spoken out loud now.
The European Union exemplifies peace at home, social stability, the combination of economic growth and social stability and of the export of values as a basis for policy in the international sphere.
There is much in the existing foundational treaties that needs to be changed if this model of success is to survive.
In his novel, 'The Leopard' the Italian author Tomasi di Lampedusa has Tancredi, the nephew of the Prince of Salina, tell his uncle, in splendid words, that 'everything must change if everything is to stay as it is'.
If Europe wants to remain as successful as it is, it must change the treaties that underpin it, and if you fight like a leopard, then you will find us fighting alongside you.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to welcome Mr Prodi back to Parliament.
Prime Minister, 50 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed, you have returned Italy to its rightful place at the heart of Europe, and at the heart of the European project.
With President Napolitano you have turned the osservato speciale into a partner speciale.
Your cabinet, with names like Bonino, Amato and Padoa-Schioppa, fills my colleagues and me with confidence.
We hear some criticisms of your first year in government, but we recall the faint hearts who made similarly dismissive remarks about your first year at the Commission.
They were proven wrong.
Enlargement, the euro: these are the jewels in Europe's crown, so we will judge a government on its results, not on first appearances.
It was Italy which, while others hesitated, led the European Union force into Lebanon, and Italy which pressed for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.
You showed the world that Europe can have the vision and the capacity to act in unison for the good of all.
We must seize that vision, for Europe's future strength lies not in insulating itself against injustices, but in confronting the forces of pain and misery and destruction in the world beyond our borders.
On our own continent we have healed the hurts of nations.
Our interest now, indeed perhaps our survival, depends on exporting in the next 50 years the domestic achievements of the last.
Global challenges like climate change, population growth and nuclear proliferation highlight what you have called 'the inadequacy of unilateralism'.
The world needs global mechanisms to create consensus on these matters.
And the model?
None is better than our Community method, tried and tested over 50 years.
And yet, even as Europe comes of age on the international stage, some are seeking to divide us from within.
What should we say to the eurosceptics who say that the European Union is no longer fit for service, or that the European dream is menaced by globalisation, or that integration threatens national identity?
They listen, but they do not hear.
Mr Prodi, you wisely followed the advice of Cavour, who told us that he had discovered how to deceive diplomats. He said, 'I tell them the truth, and they never believe me'.
As you told us in Berlin, marking Europe's 50th birthday:
(IT) 'To create we need common sense, patience, faith, and also a grain of folly.'
A grain of folly, of self-belief, as well as grit and determination are indeed needed to face the future.
For now is not the time for apathy or egocentrism.
Our leaders must be bold: more Europe, not less, is the key to competitiveness; more Europe, not less, is the key to security; more Europe, not less Europe, is the key to a just world.
That is why it is vital to reach an institutional settlement at next month's intergovernmental conference.
Only stronger institutions can build a stronger Europe.
Mr Prodi, it was Leonardo da Vinci, your compatriot, who taught us:
(IT) 'He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind'.
Thank you for holding true to your vision.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need to adopt the new treaty.
This urgency goes hand in hand with the need to simplify the Union and make it easier for its citizens to understand.
To belittle the difficulties that exist and which are the cause of the doubts which have until now prevented us from reaching agreement, however, is certainly not the way forward.
The Italian Prime Minister, formerly the President of the Commission, must be aware that vague and imprecise proposals lead to vague and inconclusive answers, which is precisely the opposite of what citizens want.
This is the philosophy of the possible, that starts out along a thousand paths but does not complete any of them, especially when the paths are the same ones that for over ten years we have seen put forward and then abandoned.
The crisis is clear and is not a trivial matter, and we therefore need appropriate solutions ever more quickly.
The German Chancellor's efforts and the statements made by President Sarkozy have therefore given us Europhiles hope once more.
We seek to achieve what is feasible, not what is impossible!
We believe that compromise, when it is lofty and honourable, forms the foundation of politics.
When people say 'no compromises' it is because compromises have already been made that are of little importance and little moral value.
If there is a clear crisis, then projects that cannot be achieved rapidly should be abandoned and, instead, what can be immediately agreed upon should be consolidated: greater practicality from our institutions; more use made of subsidiarity; a common policy for our borders; terrorism; giving a boost to the economy and competitiveness through completing the infrastructure needed without further indecision, particularly with regard to mobility; a common energy policy; defence of the social contract; clear rules that prevent unfair competition with a stronger position adopted by the Union within the WTO; and harmonisation of criminal legislation on violent crimes against children.
Citizens cannot have faith in heads of government who in Strasbourg describe Europe in simple terms and in their own countries do not carry out the projects that Europe has adopted.
Strasbourg is calling for a common foreign policy, instead of us all acting solo, as happened in Afghanistan.
A lack of security at the borders due to a confused and contradictory policy on immigration lessens the trust of citizens.
The first ones to feel the effects of this are legal immigrants.
High-speed rail links, which have been approved in all the Community bodies, have been blocked by differences within the Italian Government and likewise growth is at a standstill.
Mr President, I believe that when people say to us 'the important role of the MEPs' we should also try to remember in all countries, including our own, that up until now the members of the European Convention, the Italian members, have never been asked to have an exchange of ideas and to make their contributions.
This is also significant.
Fewer words and more action!
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to welcome you, Prime Minister Prodi, to this Chamber, partly because, recently, there have unfortunately not been so many speeches of resolute commitment to a top-level solution to the constitutional crisis.
We fear, for example, that tomorrow the Dutch Prime Minister will be here singing from a completely different song-book.
Understanding the arguments of others is all well and good, but experience teaches us that it is nearly always the arguments of the opposition that win.
We know that in the end even the most pro-European governments such as yours gradually yield to the arguments of those who see the true shape of a European Government in the intergovernmental aspect and in the power relations between states.
This is what happened in Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice.
You said that your government would not accept lowest common denominator compromises, and we hope this is true, because very often past examples have not been very edifying.
The Greens do not like blackmail, conflict or splits.
We would be delighted with a harmonious, innovative and truly sustainable and united Europe, and the 27-member Europe is a major achievement.
Let us be clear, however: the blackmail so far has come solely from those wishing to stand in the way of a solution to the constitutional crisis, and this is a fact that we cannot let pass unremarked.
Even the majority within this Parliament has in recent months and years refrained from making any proposals of a slightly daring nature, preferring to wait for an initiative from the governments.
We believe that there are two or three conditions that could permit us, Mr Prodi, to escape from this stalemate and we truly hope that the Italian Government will resolutely agree with us on this issue.
There needs to be a strong alliance among the 18 countries that have ratified the Constitution, as well as this Parliament, the Commission and some national parliaments, to resist the trend to dismantle the Constitutional Treaty.
You made a list of some issues and I would like to add at least two more: firstly, the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and secondly, the issue of recasting the revision clause.
We can no longer go forward like this, with a treaty that has been adopted unanimously and leaving the European Parliament out.
The second condition is that you governments must have the courage to speak to the general public about the choices that must be made and the divisions that exist among you on the future of Europe, and to seek their support.
Do not hide yourselves in mysterious secret negotiations.
Do not exclude this Parliament from the reform of the European Constitution during the intergovernmental conference that is currently being prepared, not least because experience shows that the winners in secret intergovernmental negotiations are the others.
We, and I am finishing now, Mr President, are not afraid of debate on the central issue, even if we do not like it.
Indeed, we think that it is only if we face certain governments and certain peoples with a choice of staying in or leaving that they will in the end decide to stand with us.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to make three brief comments.
The first does not concern Mr Prodi directly, but rather the famous twelve questions put by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the Heads of State or Government.
One of them is worded as follows, and I quote: 'What do you think of the proposal (...) to change the terminology without changing the legal substance, for example, regarding the name of the Treaty?'
How do you expect any citizen, upon reading that, not to say to himself that the European leaders are taking him for a complete fool, to put it mildly?
More fundamentally, Mr Prodi emphasised just now that European electors have to know what the role of the European Parliament will be, if there will or will not be a stable Presidency of the European Council and a European foreign minister, and how the Commission will be constituted.
All of these issues are indeed important.
But do you not hear other, much stronger and more significant questions being asked around you, questions to which none of you ever reply?
For example, even neo-liberal economists are asking where, in the current world context, a policy of unbridled free trade associated with free movement of capital and total freedom to relocate production facilities as well as total freedom of movement for foreign investors, including the most predatory ones, is in danger of leading us to.
What changes do you propose to the Community acquis in this regard?
Other voices, and not the least important ones, are being raised against the tax wars that the Member States are waging, or in favour of a change to the statutes of the European Central Bank or yet again in favour of a controlled industrial policy in key sectors of the modern economy, outside the rules of free competition.
What kind of break with the status quo do you consider desirable or acceptable from this point of view?
Does Europe have to be about the marketplace or about politics in relation to the market?
To what extent does democracy end where the reign of the open market economy or free competition begins?
These questions are on the table.
What do you think about them?
One last word to Mr Barroso, who is not here today, but who expressed his delight at what he considers the victory of the 'yes' vote during the French elections.
This is a delusion.
There is no doubt that the new French President supports the 'yes' vote.
That is why he, like you, feared a new referendum.
But the commitments he had to make on Europe in order to make acceptable his refusal to re-consult the citizens say a lot about the persisting depth of anti-liberal ambitions in that country.
We will be able to remind him in particular of the keynote speech he made on this issue on 21 February right here in Strasbourg, entitled 'I want Europe to change'.
The real question is this: other than institutional innovations, what changes are you ready for?
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, once again back in this Chamber and in his usual rousing style, Mr Prodi has confirmed his belief in a United States of Europe and the fact that we should speak with one voice on the world stage.
Mr Prodi, whilst I may disagree with those views, I have at least to compliment your honesty in saying things in the way that you do.
I am surprised you had to time to come, given that in Italy you have had 38 Prime Ministers in the last 60 years and it looks as though you may well be on the verge of the 39th.
We are indeed very privileged that you have come along today.
When you tell us that security is so important - this 'drive towards closer cooperation' as you call it - particularly on the day when the British police announced that charges are to be laid in the case of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was recently murdered in London, I wonder whether we really want your style of justice, given that Mario Scaramella, who tried to warn Mr Litvinenko of what was going to happen to him, has now languished in an Italian jail for six months.
The charges against him keep changing and he has not actually faced a court.
If you are suggesting we give up common law and habeas corpus for that sort of European system, my answer to you is no, thank you very much indeed.
Let us have a real debate, Mr President.
Mr Schulz: 16 countries have approved the European Constitution, not 18, so please can we have some truth, some honesty and some openness and please can we not push on and totally ignore the French and Dutch referendum results.
Mr Prodi did not even refer to that in his speech.
People have said no.
Tens of millions of Europeans are saying 'Give us, the people, a say in our future'.
Stop behaving like a bulldozer, stop sweeping aside public opinion.
By all means have your Treaty, but let the people decide on their future.
Do not impose it upon them.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, Prime Minister, the Eurocrats of the Commission and of the Council must have breathed a huge sigh of relief on the evening of 22 April: for them, either Royal or Sarkozy, the UMP or the Socialist Party, were a guarantee that the European Constitution, which had been rejected en masse by two countries in 2005, was going to be put back on track, flying in the face of democracy.
Both of them were ideal candidates, and potential Presidents.
So was Mr Bayrou.
Sarkozy and Royal both gave the impression of believing, like yourselves, that the French only rejected the policies of Brussels, when they also rejected the institutional elements, which are now intended to be reintroduced via the backdoor, namely the single Foreign Minister - the single minister who, had he existed, would have taken us all into the Iraq war - the pseudo-elected President, the Commission reduced to civil servants from certain countries, and the communitisation of all policies, which denies the States any right to veto - in short, the bureaucratic and omnipotent European Superstate.
For you, it was better that Sarkozy should have been elected, rather than Royal, since the former wants the Constitution to be ratified by Parliament, while the latter intended to take some account of the popular will.
Following the appointment of a socialist Minister and a socialist Secretary of State for European affairs, and before there had hardly been time to transfer power from the old to the new President of the Republic, Mr Sarkozy rushed to Berlin to confirm that ratification would be by Parliament, that he was committed to a European Superstate and that he wished to be nothing more than the governor of a European province.
The German Chancellor may rest assured: thanks to Mr Sarkozy, her Presidency of Europe will be a success!
In June she will be able to present a roadmap relaunching the constitutional process and signing the death warrant for the nations and the sovereignty of the peoples.
Elected as he was by 53% of the French people, Mr Sarkozy is already betraying the aspirations of many of them, namely the 55% of citizens, from the right and from the left, who voted 'no' in May 2005.
(Having been interrupted, the speaker addressed Mr Schulz, 'What is the matter, Mr Schulz, are you ill?', then corrected himself, 'Ah yes, it is you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, go ahead and teach the little children!')
Mr Le Pen, the thing about votes is that sometimes they go one way and sometimes they go the other, as you, of course, are best qualified to relate.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution was supposed to strengthen the Union as a player on the world stage, but what has actually happened?
What appeared was an incomprehensible document, the adoption of which was not an issue for the social engineers who created it.
The citizens of two countries have given a resounding 'no'.
The document is also iniquitous, and has for a number of years been diverting the attention of politicians from more pressing problems.
It introduces unnecessary conflict within the Union and confirms the suspicion that the Union is a petty concern; not geographically speaking, but in terms of the outlook of its leaders, who are incapable of accepting the failure of this project and of proposing a different one to the public.
Heads of State prefer to tiptoe around the subject rather than to admit openly that in Rome three years ago they signed a document which public opinion has since rejected.
This is a blind alley and we must find a different way forward.
It is not the future of Europe as a global player that will be put in jeopardy by the failure to adopt the Constitution.
What does jeopardise it is the remoteness of politicians from real life and the pointless discussions over a dead text.
The citizens of the Member States understand less and less the language of the European institutions and their representatives.
Our global partners, moreover, will seek to exploit the EU's lack of unity and the vanity of its leaders.
I firmly believe that the EU needs to reform its institutions and that it needs a new unifying document that would clearly demarcate the scope of authority of the Union and the Member States.
We need a Treaty that is concise, comprehensible and fair, and thus acceptable to our citizens, as well as being, most importantly, a Treaty that is something other that just an amended or trimmed down version of the rejected Constitution.
I believe that policies on pensions, tax, health, social matters, culture, justice and nuclear energy should remain in the hands of the Member States.
Other policy areas must be subject to discussion.
Some of us, in both political and normal life, have experienced failure, and this has now happened to the champions of the European Constitution.
They should overcome their stubbornness and admit defeat.
They should also begin negotiations over a new Treaty at the earliest opportunity.
I expect a realistic approach of this kind from the June summit and from the German and Portuguese Presidencies.
Only this way will we increase trust in the European project, both among EU citizens and on the wider global economic and political stage.
Prime Minister of Italy. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for this debate, which like all debates in this Parliament has been concise, constructive and frank.
It has highlighted a huge range of positions regarding the future of the European Union.
If we listen to some of the final speakers, some positions are irreconcilable.
This problem certainly needs to be tackled, debated and taken forward in an open and democratic way, as always happens and always has happened within this Parliament.
It is precisely this fact that prompted me to make my initial speech; it is precisely in order to regulate this great diversity and breadth of opinions that we have to have rules that allow us to run the European Union, as we have all had.
We are forgetting the long road travelled in organising the Constitutional Treaty; we are forgetting the 18 months of the Convention, the debates, the involvement of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament.
We are forgetting that it was not a closed debate.
We arrived, however, at a result; I quote the words of Cristiana Muscardini: 'but we need to pay attention to the fact that in politics it is necessary to reach a compromise, a lofty compromise'.
Well, the draft Constitution was already a compromise!
As President of the European Commission, I regretted the fact that some great advances were missing from that treaty.
We wanted that compromise, because we realised, with the pragmatism of politics, that one cannot have everything!
We realised that our idea of Europe was even stronger, but that, at that time, this was what was permitted by historical circumstances.
It was signed by all the countries in the Union, including the UK, on the responsibility of the governments of the Union.
Now people are saying that the treaty was created in a small room far from the wishes of the people.
It was created by the representatives of the people!
It was signed by the governments elected by the people!
That is what happened!
Clearly we can still search for compromise, because throughout our lives we have always sought compromise, but we cannot allow compromise to frustrate and nullify the European project.
That is the ultimate limit that we gave ourselves and it is for that reason that I made a speech in which I sketched out the fundamental points which we cannot abandon: they are the will of the people, the issue of the pillars and the issue of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
How can it be that we are ashamed of calling the person who represents us the Minister of Foreign Affairs?
Call this person the Secretary of State, if you wish, using the English terminology.
What are we afraid of?
Do we not realise how much not having a Minister of Foreign Affairs has cost us over the years?
Do we not realise what we have been unable to do in the Middle East and all the neighbouring areas, and how we have let the political situation deteriorate, through our own divisions?
Is this the sort of irresponsibility with which we are going to face history?
Look, what is going to be at stake in the next few days is this final aspect of our political unity, the ultimate aspect of our ability to represent Europe in the world.
If we cannot understand that now, when will we be able to?
It is only a couple of years or so ago since I left that seat in the Commission!
So, in view of the power relations in the world - China, India, Asia - the problem has been that Europe has not been able to speak to these great peoples and has not been able to speak as an equal to the United States, or to convince it!
Is that not enough of a burden on our future?
Do we want to continue to count for nothing for another whole generation?
That is the question that I put to you ahead of the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Council.
I ask no other questions.
I put forward Europe's sense of responsibility to history, to our lives and to those of our children.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi; the mind of this House is expressed in its applause.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of difficulty the initiative by Chancellor Merkel and the election of Nicolas Sarkozy to the presidency of the French Republic have offered Europe new hope.
Despite further resistance, there is now a real possibility of coming up with a new treaty that enshrines the rules of an institution as totally unique as the European Union.
It is clear, unfortunately, that the text resulting from the work that was so well directed by the Italian Presidency under Silvio Berlusconi and which was signed in Rome, can no longer enter into force.
If, however, we want Europe to carry out the role it deserves on the international stage, we must save the substance of the treaty.
I am thinking of the principle of decisions taken by a majority on certain important issues, of a single voice on foreign policy, and of the duration of the Presidency.
Adopting a reduced text would only be a first step forwards.
Certainly, in striving for perfection we may lose the opportunity to achieve something that is within our grasp, but it is important to continue along the road we have embarked on and to make a decision before the European elections in 2009.
I hope, thinking about tomorrow, that in its new term this Parliament may also have a constitutional role, as suggested by many, among them Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and Mr Brunetta.
The 27-member Europe, however, does not only need institutional rules in order to function better. It needs to identify with the values which make up its true basis, the foundation on which to construct a Union that in the future will not dissolve when faced with difficulties.
It would be a mistake not to ensure that freedom, solidarity, subsidiarity and the central role of the individual are the cornerstones of the Community institutions.
It would be a serious error to renounce our identity, our Judaeo-Christian roots and a social model based on a family composed of father, mother and children.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tajani is putting forward arguments that have nothing to do with today's discussion, while we have on the other hand heard clear, strong and determined words from Prime Minister Prodi, which put Italy at the head of European integration and give more strength to the European Parliament, which is always in the forefront of the battle for constitutional reform of the Union.
These words were very clear on a crucial point: we must start again from the draft Constitution ratified by the 18 countries, and not from Nice.
We need to give a fixed mandate, not an open-ended one, to the Intergovernmental Conference.
We cannot dismiss a draft Constitution that has been accepted by the vast majority of citizens and that gives precise answers, not vagueness, Mrs Muscardini!
Mr Prodi listed these precise answers in his introduction and in his reply.
Without a Constitution, my dear Mr Wurtz, the European Union is weaker and the risk of it deteriorating into a mere free trade area is greater.
That is why sometimes I do not understand certain very radical positions taken by the left!
The speech given by Prime Minister Prodi has given Parliament and all of us more courage and strength, and we will go through the next stage with greater determination and tenacity.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
I should like to begin by saying how delighted I am that Prime Minister Prodi is someone who is not tired of Europe.
A philosopher once said that tiredness was the most serious threat to Europe.
I should like to recall that when Mr Prodi was President of the European Commission he undertook the difficult task of enlarging the European Union.
He saw enlargement through despite the negative views expressed frequently by the media and public opinion or at least by certain sectors of the latter.
Mr Prodi succeeded because he believed in the future of Europe.
I would like this same conviction to underpin current reflection on the future of Europe.
There are many in this Chamber who share my view that the European Union is now in need of wise institutional reform.
The question arises, however, as to the extent to which the Community method, referred to by Mr Prodi as the mechanism driving Europe forward, is invoked in the activities of the European Council.
That is to say, what role does it play in the activities of the government representatives?
Mr Prodi was wearing a certain hat at the European Commission, but he has donned a very different one at the European Council.
To the outside observer it sometimes appears that national egotism is the one and only criterion used by the Council, not reflection on the basis of categories of common interest.
I believe this is a particularly important matter.
Parliament understands what it means to be a community, and that spirit is also present in the European Commission.
What can be done to ensure that the European Council will also be guided by it?
(IT) Mr Prodi, I am making my speech on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group which, I would like to remind Mr Prodi, represents the fourth-largest political group in the European Parliament.
I would like to re-emphasise something: Europe is very close to our hearts!
Mr Fini, the chairman of the party that I represent, was one of those in the Convention who contributed enthusiastically to the current draft Constitution.
More generally, we Italians have a long and uninterrupted European tradition, and therefore cannot but support the appeal made a few months ago in this very Chamber by Mr Napolitano, President of the Italian Republic, who called for the Constitution to be adopted as soon as possible.
One of the reasons why this Constitution is necessary is so that we can have a common foreign policy.
Mr Prodi, you were right in pointing to the common foreign policy that we so sorely miss, especially at this time of international crisis.
I would like to take the opportunity, on this point, to thank all those throughout the world who are working on peace-keeping missions, particularly in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Palestine, starting with the approximately 8 000 Italians.
These are important missions, strongly supported by all the Italian political parties, even though, to be truthful, Mr Prodi, there are some embarrassing exceptions in your governing majority.
I would like to go back to the Constitution, to express a regret and a wish.
The regret is that it has not been possible to mention Europe's Christian roots in the text; the wish is that the goal of swift adoption of the Constitution will be achieved.
I am convinced that Italy, as usual, will play its part well.
(DE) Mr President, how often, over recent months, have I asked myself, 'where is Romano Prodi?
Where are the governments who will defend the Constitution?'
Today, Prime Minister, I have found you once more; I have found Romano Prodi on the barricades.
I may have found him late in the day, but I have found him all the same.
I found him speaking up for consensus, stepping out from the ranks of the governments who, day in and day out, exchange their historic responsibility for Europe for petty cash.
Since you, Prime Minister, said that we have to respect the arguments of others, I would like to ask you which others you mean.
If you mean the members of the public, including those who voted 'no', then I am unperturbed.
We know what they want; they want more democracy, more transparency, more social responsibility, a better Europe, a more convincing constitution.
Or do you, by 'others', mean the governments who misuse the crisis around the ratification process to abuse us with their old demands, their old claims to power, with all the things we, in the Convention, extracted from those who deliberately deflect public dissatisfaction onto Europe in order to retain their power over a Europe without European democracy, without a social dimension, and without a shared role in the world - those whose interest is in the struggles of reactionaries for power, pitting the Europe of the corridors of power against the Europe of citizens?
You spoke of our need for compromises, and that, too, throws up a very pertinent question.
The compromise that shines out of the twelve questions is compromise as a historic lie about Europe, for what also needs to be done, Prime Minister - and I am particularly grateful to you for making it visible - is to retain not only the substance, but also the spirit of the Constitution.
If we decide that laws are no longer to be called laws, but rather regulations, we are denying people the historic legitimacy to which they have a claim, for these things remain, as far as their substance is concerned, laws.
Denial of the primacy of European law is false, for it continues to have a subterranean existence and the foreign minister is still what we wanted him to be.
No, indeed, the compromise can be neither a bluff nor a lie.
It is for the spirit of the Constitution, too, that we have to fight.
(Applause)
(IT) My dear Mr Prodi, precisely because I have the same passion as you for Europe, I am convinced that in order to relaunch the constitutional process we need a new impulse of energy based on democracy and rights.
I am increasingly convinced that the intergovernmental approach is not the solution to the problems, but is a part of them and is liable to lead us into a mini-Treaty or even a two-speed Europe.
It is the citizens and MEPs that must now take the lead, with a new constitutional mandate entrusted to a European Parliament that has these functions, with the aims of a new text and a European referendum; we need to change the text and the context.
We need to have, at the centre, clear enforceable rights that define European citizenship.
These are the right to work and rights at work that confirm that, for Europe, stable, high-quality jobs are the norm, and not the highly precarious jobs that are being developed with 'flexicurity'!
We need a guaranteed right to the environment, which requires innovative policies, based on cooperation, and multi-faceted visions such as those that should lead to ratification of a post-Kyoto agreement, instead of merely the philosophy of commercial competition.
We need a right to peace, born of the rejection of war, and an EU policy actively based on these values and practices, as its own foreign policy.
We need a new Europe, the only one possible, which is becoming increasingly necessary.
We can build it based on the people, together with the MEPs.
(FR) Mr President, almost two years ago to the day, the French 'no' vote sentenced the European Constitution to death.
This was then confirmed by the Netherlands, and by the United Kingdom, and then by the Czech Republic and Poland.
There was also the scant enthusiasm of the only two countries to have said 'yes' by referendum, Luxembourg and Spain.
In Spain, just 32% of the registered voters supported the text.
In short, the constitutional process broke down and then came to a standstill, and we owe that breakdown mainly to France.
From that point on, everything became clear to us, the French sovereigntists, on behalf of whom I am speaking in this House: it was France that needed to be circumvented, it was the French who needed to be tricked!
And that was done by means of an immense ruse.
When it came to the presidential elections, two candidates were pre-selected at the outset, so that, when one of them was elected and newly legitimised, they would say yes where the French wanted to say no.
That explains Mr Sarkozy's outrageous gesture of rushing to see Mrs Merkel on the very day of his inauguration.
There must be no doubt about the illegitimacy of this 'yes' dragged out of France by means of this presidential manoeuvring.
I am well aware that everyone in the silent, bustling little aquarium of the Brussels oligarchies will get together in order to concoct a new text, and that it will certainly not be called a constitution, but an institutional reform, which amounts to the same thing.
The 'no' supporters are not dead, however.
Mr Barroso should be under no illusions, and nor should you, Mr Prodi: sooner or later, France will speak out again, because France, despite all opposition, is attached to its freedoms.
And those freedoms - national freedoms - will triumph in the end, despite all your feeble machinations.
(NL) Mr President, Mr Prodi, you more than anyone are familiar with how the European institutions work.
As a former President of the Commission, you are therefore well placed to fathom why the European citizens are increasingly turning their backs on present-day Europe.
Bureaucracy, overregulation, no ounce of respect for the principle of subsidiarity, political correctness, no respect for Europe's Christian heritage, and the obsessive desire to admit Islamic Turkey to the EU have meant that these days, most Europeans equate the European ideal of the founding fathers with an intrusive super state that no longer listens to what the people want.
In recent years, we have seen some striking examples of the deliberate deafness of official Europe.
In France and the Netherlands, in democratic referendums, the people said 'no' to the European super state.
Despite this, the German Presidency simply carries on down the path already chosen.
For Angela Merkel, and I am afraid for you as a Member of the European Council, the will of the people does not count.
All opinion polls show that whilst the Europeans want to be on friendly terms with the Turks, they do not want a non-European and Islamic country to join our Union.
Again, the pre-determined path is simply followed.
Do not harbour any illusions, though.
This refusal to listen to the needs and complaints of Europeans will backfire at the next opportunity, and official Europe should not come and complain to us if the citizens again vote 'incorrectly' at some stage in the future.
I should like to finish off by saying to Mr Prodi that the government of my country brought itself into disrepute last week by refusing, for commercial reasons, to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Belgium.
Nobody wants to offend China.
It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral.
I therefore hope that, within the European Council, you will speak up to focus on the attitude of your government which, although it likes to wax lyrical about human rights, when the chips are down, lets its own economic interests prevail, and also to denounce Belgium in this matter.
If Europe is serious about defending human rights, it should also have the courage to denounce the hypocrisy of some Member States.
Since you have referred to me personally, Mr Dillen, I would remind you that I stated my position to the plenary yesterday.
I will not allow anyone to prevent talks between the Dalai Lama and the President of the European Parliament.
A letter has been sent; I expect it to be answered and will have more to say on the subject at an appropriate moment.
(SK) Prime Minister Prodi, allow me to welcome you here.
You are a politician with a wealth of experience when it comes to both running a country and running the European Commission, where you served as president.
I would like to emphasise that for the European Union to succeed in the future, it is essential to adopt a Constitutional Treaty.
Recently, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome.
This anniversary reminds us that much has changed in the intervening years and that there are treaties still in force that need to be amended.
The European Community at that time consisted of six countries, and it was primarily an economic grouping.
Today, the European Union is made up of 27 Member States, of which 12 are post-communist countries.
The shape of the present-day European Union is substantially different from the one it had in 1957.
The Treaties, dating back 50 years, are non-transparent, written in complicated language and could even be described as obsolete.
It appears essential to adopt a new Constitutional Treaty and new clear rules of the game.
It is necessary to realise that the reforms proposed in the Constitutional Treaty, such as legal personality, fundamental human rights embodied in binding provisions, the office of General Prosecutor, reforms of institutions and the legislative process represent changes which can move the European Union forward.
It is high time to end the reflection period and inaugurate a period of action.
Prime Minister Prodi, I would like to thank you for the trust you placed in Slovakia at a time when she was embarking on what you described as a long journey.
Slovakia is a young new Member State of the European Union, and she trusts you in the same manner as she trusts Italy and the EU to amend the rules of game.
Mr President, Prime Minister, today we are once again debating constitutions and institutions when the citizens of Europe are really more interested in jobs, prosperity, the environment and global poverty.
It is a myth that the European Union is in a crisis or paralysed and incapable of taking decisions, and this is the pretext that some governments are using to demand that the Constitution should be back on the table.
I know that you, Prime Minister, believe this as well.
It is not a constitutional crisis.
Even the British Government has said that the EU is able to take decisions based on current treaties, and the period of reflection following the French and Dutch 'no' votes should, in my view, have been used to take a long, hard look at the reasons for the rejection of the constitution.
Instead, the discussions now seem solely focused on what parts of it can be kept at all costs.
As someone who believes in my nation's membership of the European Union and the potential for good that Europe possesses, I am saddened by this debate.
I have always believed there was a need to simplify and make more transparent the decision-making processes and institutions of Europe, as the Laeken Declaration envisaged.
The enlargement of the EU may indeed require some amendments to existing treaties or new treaties from time to time, but I cannot accept that this Constitution is required, nor is it desirable at this moment.
There is no doubt that the British people will demand a referendum on any new treaty that might propose additional powers for the EU, and my party would support that.
We will watch with great interest the actions of the British Government in the weeks to come.
Mr Blair will attend the Brussels Summit on the very eve of his retirement and he must not commit his successor in his absence.
Gordon Brown should insist that he attend the summit alongside Tony Blair and take full responsibility for whatever his Government signs up to.
I hope that this kind of realism will guide Mr Brown's actions in the difficult times that lie immediately ahead.
Thank you, Mr Kirkhope.
My information is that the British Prime Minister has close contact with Gordon Brown!
(DE) Mr President, it is very good to see you, Prime Minister Prodi, in this House, not only, of course, because of your Prime Ministerial position, but also because you are someone who has done a great deal for Europe.
Mr Prodi, you spoke about foreign policy, and I am very grateful to you for that.
There are many in this House who are currently saying that we need to present a united front in our dealings with Russia.
There are others - and there are many of them - who say that we must not be dominated by America.
We need a strong Europe.
We all agree that India, China and Brazil are getting stronger and stronger, and wonder whether we can secure our interests there.
There is the Middle East problem, which we are about to debate, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is already in her seat.
How, then, is there to be European input in all these areas when we do not have a common foreign and security policy, and how are we supposed to have one of those if there is not, in future, one person who can, beyond all doubt, deal with all these foreign issues and be responsible for them?
It is on this issue in particular, Prime Minister, that I urge you to stand firm.
I agree with you entirely that not every treaty is a good one.
What we need is one that goes beyond the minimum required and really moves Europe forward.
Prime Minister, I wish you all the best.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was a slogan in 1968: 'Be realistic. Demand the impossible.'
Today we would have to say, 'Be realistic. Demand what is necessary in order not to sink this European project of which you are all the temporary custodians.'
If in 2009 the European Parliament were to present itself for re-election without a convincing institutional reply, Europe as a whole would be faced with an irreparable crisis of legitimacy, while, in fact, citizens ought to be able today to choose on the basis of a clear model such as you have set out.
Parliament has given its views on this issue on many occasions and it is now the Council's turn to speak.
Prime Minister Prodi knows that today he represents not only his own country but all those Europhiles who have not given up on greater integration.
In conclusion, I would like to remind you of one thing: those who do not agree today should withdraw; the others can go forward freely.
Let us remember that Europe was created by a leading group of countries but it is not necessarily true that tomorrow it can be relaunched using the same method.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister Prodi comes before us as a former President of the European Commission with an entirely negative balance sheet: enlargement, the euro, China, reform; it looks like the balance sheet of the Industrial Reconstruction Institute!
Today, for instance, seeing that you are so enthusiastic about the super-federalist European Constitution, you did not have the courage to talk about the institutional changes in our country.
When is there going to be a decision to allow the federalism that the North has been asking for for so long?
This is a question of freedom, and also of political consistency!
Mr Schulz compared you to the Leopard.
That sounds like a gaffe but actually his aim was perfect.
Only a great Leopard like you could govern with political parties that have the symbol of the hammer and sickle when you have presided over enlargement involving countries which have freed themselves from communism, and you actually manage to govern while representing only a third of our country.
Look: from up above, Luigi Sturzo and Alcide De Gasperi are watching us and perhaps feeling ashamed of those representatives in our country who have forgotten the founding fathers' commitment to a Europe of the people and of the regions, not of lobby groups.
Your spiritual horizons, Mr Prodi, are those of Goldman Sachs, not of bell towers and cathedrals, as ours are.
(FR) Mr President, Mr Prodi, our ambition is to continue with European integration.
True, we have misfired.
By voting 'no' to the Constitutional Treaty, many French people believed that they were resisting a liberal Europe and thus hoped that that would help us to move towards a social and ecological Europe.
Well, now we know that quite the opposite has happened.
The 'no's have condemned our institutions to deadlock, and I share Prime Minister Prodi's view that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water.
Europe needs a constitution, and the compromise achieved by the Convention must be adopted and improved.
So if, by a mini-treaty, as presented by the new French President, we mean the constitutional compromise and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it will be a yes, a yes to a Foreign Minister.
What weight will that Minister carry, however, Mr Prodi, without a genuine European foreign policy?
Yes, Mr Prodi, the treaty still needs to be improved.
If it had to be a third-rate treaty that is ratified on the sly, that would be unacceptable.
The future of Europe is a matter for the people of Europe.
I therefore say 'yes' to a European referendum being held simultaneously in the 27 countries, and why not during the next European elections?
I say 'yes', so that Europe can tackle the present-day challenges - I am thinking in particular of climate change - that will radically transform our lives.
I am convinced that our fellow citizens understand these challenges and will be able to move this tremendous European project forward.
(IT) Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the process of adopting the European Constitution cannot be reduced to a set of amendments to the existing treaties but must contain important social aspects that are at the moment not present.
Europe must be able to meet the great challenges which pose a threat to the rights of citizens, the quality of life, health and the very future of its people.
Faced with phenomena such as relocations, the scarcity of water resources, the world's hunger for energy and climate change, individual states are helpless and unable to formulate winning strategies.
It is only through action agreed at continental level, or better still at planetary level, that we can hope for success where we cannot afford failure.
It is important for Europe to be at the forefront in the world, both from the political point of view, as a benchmark for socially inclusive policies and a policy of acceptance that can be a model for other parts of the world, and in terms of technological choices and future planning, particularly in the sustainable energy sector.
Five members of the main political groups present in the European Parliament have signed a written statement on the need for Europe to take a new approach to the economy, based on hydrogen: a real industrial, technological and social revolution that can be sustainable in the long term.
You referred to this and I believe that this is one of the examples where Europe can and must play the principal role on the world stage.
To conclude, there is no need for a compromise at all costs, but we need to tackle the real problems affecting millions of citizens.
Only in this way will the dream of a united Europe be able to speak to the hearts of Europeans.
(EL) Mr President, it is high time we stopped writing obituaries for the European Constitution; it is dead and buried.
We need to get out into society and see what Europe needs:
one hundred million Europeans are living below the poverty line;
crime is rife in all the capitals of Europe;
illegal immigration is the order of the day.
Of course, human rights are being seriously tried with visible and hidden cameras.
Mr Prodi, you were President of the Commission for five years.
Tell me, where are the eastern borders of Europe?
Just yesterday, two fully armed submarines were west of the island of Samos close to Mykonos.
What will happen tomorrow morning?
The spark of war from Turkey is clearly visible.
You must therefore take initiatives for the future of Europe, because otherwise the same fate will befall this unified Europe as befell the Holy Alliance two centuries ago.
We do not want to set up a super state.
What we want to do is to be able to safeguard democracy and to safeguard the prosperity of the people, with which capital and the Central Bank play fast and loose.
This must be Europe's objective: the citizen, not capital must increase its power.
(HU) The critics of the European Union very often charge the European Union with being too strong and with intervening in too many things.
It is my conviction that exactly the opposite is true.
We, who recently joined the European Union, see that a stronger, more effective Europe is needed, a Europe which has at its disposal the tools for fulfilling its tasks.
For this purpose we need a common energy policy, a common migration policy, a common struggle against terrorism and harmonisation of environmental protection.
We need all this in order to defend the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union as well as to gain citizens' support for all of these goals.
Many look upon this constitution as if it were the end in itself.
In reality we need to sort things out, and the Constitutional Treaty is in fact nothing but an instrument for realising these objectives.
We will be able to regain the support of the citizens of Europe for the constitutional project if Europe is able to achieve these common goals.
In order to do so, of course, it is also very important for us openly to recognise Europe's common roots based on Christianity, and for this to be mentioned in the European constitution.
It is important for us to acknowledge Europe's common values in terms of rights and freedoms, in terms of the defence of minority rights.
We need to gain the support of Europe's citizens for this constitutional treaty, albeit not as a final goal but as an instrument with which we, together, can reach the goals set out fifty years ago.
Mr President, Prime Minister, anyone who heard the American President saying at the press conference after the summit with the European Union that 'we have had a nice meeting with these people from the European Union' would wonder whether he was thinking about Mr Barroso, Chancellor Angela Merkel, or who?
Anyone who saw or heard the American President could be in no doubt that we need one voice for the European Union, and that is why we thank you for your clarity in your speech today.
Anyone who has been to the Middle East is also in no doubt that we need one voice for the European Union.
That is why, Prime Minister Prodi, it is one thing to speak in the European Parliament - we all know that, as this is not the most difficult place to argue for a better treaty - but it is another to speak in the IGC, when the hard stuff comes and it is face to face.
I know you are a strong and firm Prime Minister.
We respect you.
Stand firm, Prime Minister, and we will stand firm with you, on behalf of the European Socialists and progressives all around Europe.
I think you will have a strong majority behind you standing firm together with you for the benefit of European people in the future.
And that was the experience of a former prime minister who is now an MEP.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of Europe is in its roots, and for us radicals these are represented by the Ventotene manifesto, which set out the need to achieve peace, democracy and prosperity by going beyond the dimensions of the nation state.
Reforming Europe today means offering this project also to the peoples on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean, and affirming, for them too, the individual right to democracy through the accession of democratic states, starting with Turkey, but also with the prospect of Israel, Morocco and others.
You spoke of being in the forefront, but for us only a refusal to close the doors of Europe will constitute being in the forefront.
To make another point: we propose that whatever reform is to be made be subject to a referendum of the people of Europe as such.
I am not speaking of national referendums, but a single referendum placed before the citizens of the European motherland, as against the neo-Gaullist Europe of national motherlands.
To conclude, let us welcome an example of how we can, as a Union, be strong when we have faith in ourselves: the tabling of the resolution on the moratorium on capital punishment before the General Assembly taking place at the United Nations.
Mr President, beware of the sabotage that some people are still attempting to wreak now.
For example, look at the official communication by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and the Council's departments.
After the last General Affairs and External Relations Council this means that sabotage is being attempted, Mr President, and we should try to prevent it.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President. Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, we clearly do need an efficient and well-ordered European Union that is democratic and close to its citizens.
The Union must also be imbued with a spirit of solidarity and based on a Constitutional Treaty.
It should be the kind of Union Mr Prodi has described to us today, and I am grateful to him for that.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the solidarity the European Union recently displayed towards my country, Poland, through the implementation of its Eastern policy.
The people of Poland are aware of this and value it.
The people of Poland understand that they must of course reciprocate, and display the same solidarity over issues of importance to Europe as a whole.
This is because 68% of my fellow-countrymen are pleased with membership of the Union and want more Europe.
Over 60% of Poles are in favour of a Constitutional Treaty.
I therefore call on you, Mr Prodi, to ensure that the European Council also listens to the views of European Union citizens at the forthcoming summit.
After all, this splendid edifice known as the European Union is being created for those very citizens, not for the governments.
Our thanks go to the Prime Minister of Italy, whose convictions, it is evident, are shared by the great majority in this House.
Over the coming weeks, we will need to put those convictions into practice, and we wish you, Prime Minister, much success, especially at the summit meeting in Brussels on 21 and 22 June, a month to the day from now.
The debate is closed.
(Applause)
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - As elected politicians, we must listen to the people - all the people.
Some, such as Mr Farage, want to listen only to some of the people, those who voted 'No' in France and the Netherlands.
Others want to listen only to those who said 'Yes' in the 18 countries which have ratified the Constitutional Treaty.
Fortunately, a majority in this House and of the governments of the Member States want to listen to all, to bridge the divergence of views and find a solution capable of being ratified by all 27 Member States.
Of course, the European Parliament, which approved the constitutional treaty by a large majority, wants to salvage as many as possible of the reforms contained in the constitutional treaty.
It is perfectly natural that Parliament should want to sacrifice as little of the treaty as possible, but it must also be as much as is necessary to secure agreement by every country.
in writing. - (HU) What does Europe mean to us?
A community without borders, which rests upon peace, freedom and democracy, strives to promote the prosperity of its citizens and brings about solidarity among the Member States.
We are facing great challenges!
We must delineate an appropriate plan of action for Europe that will determine the framework and policy in which it will operate, and will shape the Europe in which we would like to live and thrive in the future.
It is important for us to preserve and pass on to future generations the unity which we have succeeded through sustained effort in achieving over the decades.
I consider it important to preserve the uniqueness and diverse heritage of all 27 members of the European Union, but I must emphasise that there are countless goals which we cannot achieve individually, but only together.
In light of this, it is our duty to set aside our historical injuries and to place our Union on a renewed foundation.
Our interest is in a strong European Union, which takes effective action in face of the many challenges which we must meet today, such as terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, climate change and energy policy.
For this reason, it is indispensable to have an institutional system that works effectively.
To this end we must reach a consensus, so that we can advance the pursuit of our common cause, since in the absence of a new fundamental treaty (Constitution), the EU can be no more than a declining western extension of the Asian continent.
We have the opportunity for a solution, and I hope that we will be able to take advantage of it.
We cannot stop the constitutional process, because this might lead to serious crisis in the European Union, to the devaluation of European values and to Europe falling behind in a global perspective.
The person of Romano Prodi and the recent past we have spent together stand as guarantees that the preservation of these values, and cooperation in an enlarged, 27-member Europe are indeed possible.
For the moment, the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe find it impossible to imagine a European future in which national identity might dissolve into a common European statehood.
These countries have only just regained their national identities, through historic steps, from the Soviet Union's great red melting pot, and thus their citizens want to be Europeans in a way that does not endanger their national identity or their newly created democratic institutions.
Moreover, for this very reason the Central and Eastern European countries need a strong Europe, since they consider that their further development and the protection of their national interests are most likely to be guaranteed if they are together, within a flexible Europe.
This is why we cannot accept the Constitutional Treaty becoming a political and legal zombie.
At the same time, in order to move forward, we are perfectly open to making the necessary modifications.

Situation in Palestine (debate)
The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the minutes)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Palestine.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, recent days have seen a disturbing increase in violence in the Middle East, where conflict between Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip has cost over 50 people their lives.
It is also from the Gaza Strip that over 150 Kassam missiles have been fired at Israeli towns over the past week, killing one Israeli woman yesterday evening.
Israeli military action has already cost the lives of over 30 Palestinians, and the situation threatens to escalate still further.
The cease fire in the Gaza Strip, agreed by the Palestinians and the Israelis in November is becoming visibly more fragile, and the inter-Palestinian reconciliation achieved in Mecca with Saudi help is at risk.
The Mecca agreement had its part to play in bringing rule by Hamas alone to an end.
Since 18 March, Palestine has been ruled by a new government of national unity, enjoying the support and confidence of 83 out of 86 members of parliament - an overwhelming majority including all those belonging to Hamas and Fatah.
There is still, however, broad consensus in the international community to the effect that the Palestinian Government has not yet quite passed its decisive test, in that it, too, does not completely meet the Quartet's three criteria.
Despite this, the European Union has maintained its humanitarian aid for the Palestinians.
I want to press home the point that the EUR 300 million given by the European Union amounts to more than that given in all previous years.
The Quartet's criteria do however, remain the basis on which a decision on any complete normalisation of our relations with the Palestinians will be taken: they require recognition of the State of Israel's right to exist and of the existing agreements between Israel and the PLO, as well as a general renunciation of violence, which, in particular, has to date been significantly lacking.
Particularly at the present time, we expect the Palestinian Government to take effective action to end the bombardment and to release the captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
The European Union has also seized the opportunity presented by the end of sole Hamas rule to make a fresh start in Middle East policy, and the foreign ministers have resumed contact with the Cabinet members who accept the Quartet criteria.
It follows that President Abbas deserves our full support.
The EU is in close contact with Mr Fayyad, the minister of finance, and is helping him establish transparent institutions and machinery in the financial sphere, for we all want to see the country's financial and economic position improve, and the release by Israel of the customs and tax repayments it has retained - which the European Union has called for on repeated occasions - would help to achieve that.
For some months now, the Presidency has been pushing for the revival of the Middle East Quartet and for greater involvement of the Arab partners who take a constructive line.
Having enjoyed initial successes, our particular concern is now that the momentum achieved be maintained, and what this means for us is that we have to apply ourselves with still greater dedication to helping to get all interested parties to make a determined contribution to the Middle Eastern peace process.
The bilateral meetings between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have as yet yielded no tangible successes, and something must be done about this.
There must be marked improvements in access and mobility for the Palestinians, and the Israelis must at last get round to doing what they have undertaken to do.
I note a failure on the part of the Palestinians to actually make the renunciation of violence happen, and also a lack of commitment to the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
The Arab League has reinforced the peace initiative of March 2002, and this has been due primarily to the commitment by the Saudis.
The last Council meeting on 14 May saw an initial, and successful, meeting of the Arab League with the European Union, which occurred at our invitation; the League has also had further talks with the Quartet and with Israel as well, and, while this involvement cannot be a substitute for bilateral negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace initiative can create a favourable environment for them, although this will require further support by the European Union in particular, and our Presidency is working to bring about another meeting of the Quartet within the next few days.
However sceptical we may be, we must not, despite the slowness of the progress made, sink into a state of resignation.
Over recent months, the European Union has become more aware of the role into which it has grown.
We are willing to do justice to the greater responsibility which consequently devolves upon us.
Madam President, unfortunately this debate today comes at a very tense moment when the situation in the whole region is deteriorating both in Lebanon and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as in Israel.
The events of the last three days in Lebanon, with significant loss of life in such a short time - almost 100 dead - are a startling reminder of the need to work on a regional solution to this conflict.
As you know, Javier Solana is in Beirut today at this very difficult moment and we hope that a better situation can be brought about.
I urge our friends in Lebanon, from all the parties and political factions, to act as they have done so far, to call for calm and to refrain from actions which could provoke a major internal conflict.
Once again national unity is also at stake.
The Commission noted that all the factions, the majority and the opposition as well as Palestinian organisations, condemned Fatah al-Islam and I hope that all political leaders will continue to give proof of their maturity, that ability to envisage a better future, and will prevent the conflict from again evolving into an intra-Lebanese fight.
What is most important now is to find a solution to de-escalate the situation in Tripoli and to avoid the eruption of other hot spots in the rest of the country.
The population in the camps also has to be helped.
Ambulances and humanitarian convoys must gain access to the camps.
In the end we all know that there has to be a regional solution.
In the context of this whole situation we can only call on all sides - in Lebanon and in the Palestinian Territory - to refrain from violence and prevent further escalation.
I turn now in particular to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
Like the President-in-Office, I too am deeply concerned about last week's interfactional clashes in Gaza which resulted in 55 dead and 280 injured.
Regrettably it seems that Gaza is at risk of sliding into civil war.
Factions should stop hostilities immediately and reconcile their differences within the national unity government.
I also deplore the resumption of the Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza on the Israeli city of Sderot, which yesterday caused the death of an Israeli woman.
Israeli-led air strikes in retaliation then caused the death of 35 Palestinians, so this vicious cycle has started again.
Therefore it is important that the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians be restored and extended to the West Bank.
During my recent meeting with the Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister, Ziad Abu Amr, we discussed the fragile situation of the national unity government, especially as concerns security, but also the budget.
The first decisions taken by the government seem to point in the right direction.
Mr Abu Amr mentioned that his government considers itself the cabinet of President Abbas.
This government has a different programme from its predecessor and I felt encouraged after this meeting.
I think that it deserves our clear support.
President Abbas has requested all our backing, as his political survival may depend on its success.
I hope that this very difficult violent situation can be contained.
In the meantime, Finance Minister Salam Fayad, whom I met after the formation of the government, faces the incredible challenge of repairing the Palestinian public finances after one year of institutional decay and a sharp decrease in revenues.
Against all odds he has made considerable progress and the technical conditions for receiving direct funding have almost been put in place.
As you know, the Palestinian Authority has three main sources of funding: internal taxes, taxes and customs revenues on imported products, and foreign aid.
Internal taxes have dwindled as a result of the economic slowdown.
Since last year's election, Israel has also withheld the taxes and customs revenues on imported products.
This is the major cause of the Palestinian Authority's financial difficulties.
Furthermore, foreign aid cannot flow easily as a result of the US-imposed restrictions on financial transactions with the Palestinian Authority Government
We are helping to solve these financial problems in three ways.
First, our Temporary International Mechanism has become a core source for funding for allowances, fuel costs and core supplies.
Since the formation of the national unity government we manage this TIM in close cooperation with Salam Fayad's Ministry of Finance.
Since the establishment of the TIM last June, we have already transferred over EUR 300 million through this mechanism.
I would like to thank Parliament for its support in making more budgetary resources available so that the TIM can continue to deliver.
A second way in which we are helping is to work with our US partners to facilitate the transfer of foreign aid to the Palestinians, in particular the Arab funds pledged in Riyadh at the recent Arab summit.
Last but not least, we have urged Israel on multiple occasions to resume the transfer of Palestinian tax and customs revenues.
We are using all the instruments we have, whether economic or political, but the survival of this government does not depend only on us.
Only the resumption of all financial flows to the Palestinian Authority can deliver a durable solution to their financial crisis.
And the Palestinians have to play their role and decide once and for all to end their fighting and focus on peace.
We still think that, despite the distress we are witnessing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Lebanon, we should profit from an important window of opportunity in the peace process in case it shuts down again, so it is very important that the German initiative is successful.
It is crucial that the Arab League relaunches its Peace Initiative.
As you know, there has been a determined diplomatic follow-up at the highest level in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
I myself have had several meetings with the Follow-Up Committee in Sharm el Sheikh, in Riyadh, and also more recently at the GAERC meeting in Brussels.
Secretary-General Amr Moussa and others have underlined the urgency which is more evident than ever today and he has asked for our help in bringing the parties to the table.
On the Israeli side, I am encouraged that Foreign Minister Livni has been to Cairo and is now expecting a follow-up visit by her Jordanian and Egyptian counterparts in the coming weeks.
She has also shown willingness to engage more than in the past and she will also be invited by the German Presidency to the next GAERC meeting.
At the same time I also endorse the efforts of Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to bring the parties together and start discussing the political horizon for the Palestinians.
I hope that will be possible even though events are not going well at this moment.
The energy and efforts invested by Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others must also be recognised.
Next week the Quartet will meet.
I hope that this meeting will respond to the efforts of the Arab League, which could relaunch the progress on all tracks of the peace process, but I am also realistic and I understand what the German Presidency has said, that we should at least uphold the situation.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, we are facing an extremely difficult situation.
As the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner have stressed, this is a serious political crisis, with internal confrontations and battles between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity, in which so many hopes had been placed; an extremely serious economic, social and humanitarian crisis, and the figures are devastating: more than 66% of the Palestinian population below the poverty line; more than 50% with no food safety; more than one million people unable to receive a stable income for the last year; a hundred dead over the last three days in Lebanon; huge numbers of dead in the Gaza Strip.
I believe that, faced with this situation, the European Union must emerge from its lethargy and take a step in the right direction.
If one thing is being done right, then credit for that must be given to the European Commission, which, amidst countless difficulties, is making its contribution to the humanitarian and social disaster befalling the region, but I believe we must go further.
The Commissioner has reminded us that the High Representative, Javier Solana, is currently in the region.
We must have the courage and strength to try to move beyond fine words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and the European Union must try to bring a little common sense to this barbaric situation in the region.
There is a vicious circle of violence; Kassam missiles are fired, there are Israeli reprisals and suicide attacks are announced ...
We are facing a totally suicidal spiral of violence.
We must try to impose a little order, we must put faith in the efforts of the High Representative, mobilise the European Union's diplomatic forces as much as possible, and the Commission must back all of the economic and humanitarian assistance that is being provided.
I would like to draw the attention of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to an issue that I believe to be crucial; that in order to restore direct aid to the Palestinian National Authority, the Quartet stated that not only was the composition of the government decisive, but also the actions that the government was carrying out.
Could the Presidency-in-Office of the Council explain its views in this regard and tell us how we can escape from this vicious circle of hate, violence and destruction?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, death and violence have returned to Gaza, Lebanon and Israel.
As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we stress the urgent need for a substantive change in the European Union's policy in the Middle East, with full restoration of financial aid to the Palestinian institutions and people.
The conflicts of recent days are the product of exasperation and the stalemate in the political situation, as well as demonstrating and confirming the fact that Israel will not build its own security on the death of Palestine and Palestinians.
European democracy's double standards towards the government of national unity must cease, as the political continuity of that government is the only hope for regaining control of the situation.
The decision, however, to suspend financial aid to the institutions seems even more absurd since the formation of the government of national unity.
The fact that the Council and the Commission have decided not to meet ministerial representatives of Hamas and the independents does nothing for the stability of that executive body, which is currently the only form of political expression open to the Palestinian people.
The Mecca agreement, even if it is not an uncritical repetition of the Quartet's four points, is obviously a step in the right direction, in the sense of mutual recognition and the cessation of violence.
On this basis we must work to ensure that the situation develops in a positive direction.
Another reason is, as the Commissioner pointed out, that Abu Amr, the Foreign Affairs Minister, who last week was here with us in Brussels, gave us an enormous amount of reassurance on this aspect.
We join with the grief and condemnation over the launch of missiles on Sderot and also the fact that people were killed and injured there, but at the same time we wish to call upon the Palestinian and Israeli authorities to cease disproportionate, excessive and illegal retaliation against Palestinian political and civilian figures.
A perverse dynamic has been set back in motion and we Europeans must try to help stop it.
I would like to remind you that the 78 people who died within a few days in Lebanon speak volumes about another poisoned fruit of the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict, and that is the fact that in Lebanon open conflict may break out again with the 400 000 Palestinian refugees present in that country.
We have already experienced that nightmare, so let us seek to prevent it, just as last July we put a stop to the war and Israel's aggression towards Lebanon.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the President-in-Office said that the new unity government in Palestine had not quite passed the litmus test.
Well, the Israelis have not quite stopped building their security wall, stealing Palestinian land and water.
The Israelis have not quite released the 10 000 prisoners, many of them held without charge or trial.
The Israelis have not quite stopped holding checkpoints - 589 according to the Commission's latest figures - which impose an economic embargo upon the Palestinians.
The Israelis have not quite paid back the money - which may amount to about one thousand million euros now - that they have withheld from the Palestinians' own revenue over the past year.
They have not quite stopped the partition and separation by way of identity cards, which my own party leader, Paddy Ashdown - our former representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina - described just last Saturday as racism dressed up as administration.
I say these things to the President-in-Office because we are seen as a European Union that practises double standards: we are seen to ignore every Israeli illegality, but to expect Palestinians to behave like saints.
When the Commissioner says that we are using all the instruments at our disposal to get the Israelis to observe international agreements and obey the law, I do not think that can possibly be the case.
There are many tools at our disposal that we are not even trying to exercise.
Therefore, what does the Palestinian unity government have to do now?
Just two weeks ago our delegation heard Prime Minister Haniyeh not only convince us in a way that satisfied us all that the unity government was determined to meet the Quartet's three principles, and believed it was doing so, but also that it would meet with members of the Quartet without reservation or precondition at any time to try to sort out these differences.
I urge the President-in-Office to take up that offer.
Note also the comments just yesterday of the Norwegian Foreign Minister when he asked what would happen if we do not support this government. There would be only chaos and crisis if we do not give it our support.
Therefore, President-in-Office, the good news in your speech is that you are seeking an urgent meeting to review the situation yet again.
That is a positive step forward.
All I can say is that we have often accused the Palestinians of missing opportunities; we have often accused the Israelis of missing opportunities.
This is an opportunity that we ourselves must not miss.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East poses a significant and ongoing challenge not only for the countries of the region, but also for the wider world.
We warn against a partisan emotional approach to this decades-old conflict. Despite all the simplification and the temptation to make facile assessments on the basis of television news clips, this is not a black or white situation.
It may be fashionable in certain circles to label Israel as the aggressor and the oppressor, but this belief is untrue and unsound.
The spread of radical attitudes and the votes cast for radical Hamas-style groups indicate the almost non-existent possibilities for dialogue in this area.
Another major difficulty that is not often mentioned is the deep divisions and bitter infighting leading to armed conflict within the Palestinian political class and Palestinian society.
Certain experts have drawn attention to the Palestinian Authority's education system.
As stated by those who attended the conference organised last week by Mr Van Orden at the European Parliament, the system reinforces negative and antagonistic stereotypes relating the Jihad Holy War and structural opposition to Israel and actual hatred of that country.
In the interests of objectivity, it has to be said also that since Hamas' victory in the elections held in the Palestinian Authority, Israel has been implementing a rather controversial plan whereby it is refusing to transfer Palestinian tax revenue to the Authority.
This must have a serious impact on relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
The European Union should react in a realistic and rational fashion.
It must not behave like a short sighted benevolent uncle handing out large amounts of pocket money but failing to ascertain the use to which it is being put.
The Union must not become a hostage to any of the parties to the conflict either.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I have to say I am still in a bit of a state of shock over the words of the representative of the Council.
I do not understand how he can say that the new unity government does not fulfil the criteria of the Quartet.
Our delegation has just come back from the region and all of us unanimously agreed that they had.
Yes, there are still some Qassam rockets which of course are to be condemned.
But do you really think that, by refusing to fully engage with the government, the EU is helping bring that back under control?
Do you really think it has got nothing to do with the economic and political stranglehold in which Israel holds Gaza?
You mention the detention of soldier Shalit - and of course he should be released - but you did not even mention the 41 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who are still detained by Israel; you did not even mention the detention of 10 000 Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel, many without trial.
So, let us have some balance in this debate.
By refusing to fully recognise the new unity government and by channelling aid via a temporary international mechanism rather than through the Palestinian Authority, the EU is actively undermining the authority and the apparatus of Palestine's democratic institutions.
And, even worse than that, our position is actually encouraging those elements both inside and outside Palestine which want this government to fail.
Every day that goes by when we refuse to engage fully with this government is another day for the extremists to say, 'Look: democracy is not working.
We did everything the international community demanded - democratic elections, a new unity government, fulfilling the Quartet demands, and still we face a political and economic boycott.
So, why on earth are we helping to bring about a democratically-elected government which is doing its best to keep the peace?'
Is that really what we want?
Do not imagine that the alternative will be a slightly different government whose colours we like slightly better.
The alternative will be chaos and violence on an unimaginable scale, the whole region will become destabilised and there will be even more rapid growth of extremism across the Middle East.
Because, while the Council adopts a wait-and-see policy to review how the new government performs, each day it waits it puts the very outcome it wants to see in ever greater jeopardy.
There is a very real danger that in a few years' time we will look back at this moment and think, 'Why on earth did we not support democracy in Palestine when we had the chance?'
So to the Council I say please tell us again what the Palestinian Government has to do, and to the Commission I ask, when will you suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement?
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the European Union is not uninvolved in the unspeakable events taking place in Palestine today.
That is because it failed to act decisively at the appropriate time and in the right direction.
Twenty days ago, Parliament's delegation for our relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council made an official visit to Palestine.
Our visit was made at an historic moment in Palestine, following the swearing in of a new government that was the product of free and democratic elections, a government which, even though it had the support of 60% of the electoral body, when it was challenged by the United States and the European Union, did not hesitate to share power with other political forces in order to form a national unity government under the unquestioned leader of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, in faithful obedience to the calls of the Arab League Council.
It was to this government, therefore, that represents the entire Palestinian people, that Parliament's delegation clearly tabled vital issues relating to the question of peace in the Middle East and, as my honourable friends have said, we received clear answers:
They told us that they recognise the right of Israel to exist within the 1967 borders. All it has to do is to recognise our right to create our own state next to Israel.
They reject violence.
They acknowledge all the agreements made between Israel and the PLO.
Their immediate priorities include the release of Mr Johnston.
They are working to get Saleet released within the framework of an exchange of prisoners.
They told us, however, that in order to be able to achieve their goals, they need our help.
The political and economic embargo needs to be lifted immediately.
That is why I conclude with one call to Israel and one call to the Palestinians:
Israel should stop targeting missiles at its enemies and free all the elected representatives of the Palestinians;
the Palestinians should stop making rocket attacks on Israeli territory.
I also call on the Council and the Commission to immediately recognise President Abbas's new democratically elected national unity government and to put an immediate end to its policy of selectively approaching certain members of that government.
Stop the political and economic embargo immediately.
Get dynamically involved in a creative dialogue with the entire national unity government.
Support this government so that it can negotiate for peace.
Otherwise chaos will ensue and the European Union will bear its share of the responsibility for it.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Madam President, sadly, the situation in Palestine confirms what the sovereigntists have been saying on the subject of the Middle East conflict for a very long time now, namely that it would be wrong to believe that this conflict can be summed up as a straightforward confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis, and even less between Muslims and Jews.
The true division, which is becoming increasingly wide, is between, on the one side, the advocates of conciliation, which not only several Israeli statesmen - and I cannot omit to mention the glorious name of Yitzhak Rabin - but also Palestinian statesmen, such as Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, have shown themselves to be, and, on the other side, the fanatics, both Muslim fanatics and fanatics of the Greater Israel, whose connivances are, moreover, perfectly clear, since we know that Palestinian extremist movements have been backed, and even funded, by certain Israeli radicals.
There are therefore two camps: on the one hand, the camp that wishes to seek a political solution and, ultimately, peace, and on the other, the camp that seeks confrontation, hate and endless war.
Regrettably, despite the fine words, the United States is playing along with the hawks, the Israeli extremists and the Muslim fundamentalists, while Europe, by which I mean the main European States, have remained silent throughout this time.
The only European voice that showed any unity was that of the Venice declaration, in June 1980, in which the Europeans stated that they were in favour of the creation of a Palestinian State.
Our divisions have increased, however, and Europe can now once again speak with one voice only when it has nothing to say.
The time has come to restore the sovereignty of the States of Europe, so that they can once again play their role freely in that part of the world, where much of their future is at stake.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, anyone who has followed the events in the Middle East in recent days can do no other than be dispirited.
Last Wednesday in the Conference of Presidents of our Parliament, I had the honour of attending a meeting with Amr Moussa, Secretary-General of the Arab League, and the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority.
What this made evident to me was their genuine will to work on a peace plan for the region, but a number of things - how shall I put it - structural problems are left pending.
Hamas, the most important Palestinian government party, remains unyielding in its explicit refusal to recognise Israel and still refuses to renounce and condemn terrorism and violence.
It is anybody's guess how the peace talks, in those circumstances, can lead to success.
In fact, in the last few days, the violence between the different Palestinian camps has also flared up, with even a foiled bomb attack on President Mahmoud Abbas.
There is no doubt in my mind that Israel has the right to defend itself against violence and terror, by military means if necessary.
Israel should be warned, though, against actions directed at Palestinian members of parliament and a fortiori at the Palestinian Prime Minister, although some have voiced an interest in choosing this path, for, were they to do so, they would be crossing a dangerous line, and making a subsequent, and even greater escalation of violence, inevitable.
- Madam President, the misery and suffering in Palestine is truly awful and, while the fact that it is largely self-inflicted does not lessen its impact, it undermines those who always want to blame Israel for every tragedy in the region.
Today, of course, the usual suspects in this debate, like Mr Davies and Ms Lucas, on their habitual hobbyhorses, have done their biased best to unreasonably shift all the blame onto Israel.
What we are witnessing is a veritable civil war in Palestine between Fatah and Hamas, and the particularly aggressive actions of Hamas show us that the pursuit of democracy and a democratic mandate has done nothing to tame or to temper their adherence to terror.
It is this undiluted attachment to terror that makes Hamas so unfit to govern.
Likewise, their continuing aggression towards Israel, with their sustained rocket campaign, wholly justifies the defensive response of Tel Aviv.
I fear that, as long as Fatah and Hamas can tout both gun and ballot, democracy and the peace that it can bring will not prevail in this troubled and failed entity that is Gaza.
Any international initiative that fails to address the removal of the gun from both sides in Palestine will flounder and fail.
Madam President, once again we are discussing this tragic situation in Palestine.
Let me say at the outset that all of us condemn terrorism wherever it occurs.
I should say that the suicide bombers who attacked London a couple of years ago all came from my constituency.
However, they were motivated by events in the Middle East - by Iraq and by Palestine - and therefore it is proper that we should not only consider the events in the Middle East as they affect the people there but also people in our own territories.
I used to say that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East.
But two years ago I chaired our delegation for the elections of President Abbas, which were much welcomed by the international community.
However, when he came here a few months ago he said that if we, the international community, would not support him, there would be chaos and civil war in his country.
Last year I chaired the Election Observation Mission for the elections to the parliament in Palestine, and then the European Union turned its back on those results.
We seem to be paralysed by the roadmap.
However, in my view the situation has now got to the point where the EU simply has to change its approach.
Palestine is collapsing economically, politically and socially.
We are risking another Algeria, where, when the West turned its back on the results of the elections in 1992, the result was 200 000 dead.
I believe the time has now come for the EU, if it cannot recognise the government of national unity, at least under the terms of a draft resolution some of us discussed last week, it should cooperate comprehensively with that government.
Secondly, it is surely high time that the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs had a working party - not just on the United Nations or the Balkans or the five external financing instruments: let us have a working party on the Middle East.
(FR) Madam President, let us imagine a city that is regularly plunged into darkness.
Let us imagine a city with no police.
Let us imagine a situation in which State employees have not been paid for a year and a half.
Let us imagine hospitals with no drugs and schools with no educational supplies.
Let us imagine a sealed-off city, left to its own devices, with no administration in operation.
And let us imagine that money is circulating there, and weapons.
Remember that one night of power cuts in New York led to looting and crime, in the world's largest democracy.
So what can we expect today in Palestine?
Our irresponsible policy has led to the collapse of the administrations that we had set up, to the weakening of the power in place, to increased poverty, to the re-emergence of diseases that had disappeared - even the World Bank agrees on this - and this, despite the laudable efforts of the Commission.
We have now just climbed a step further into misery: the Palestinians are killing each other!
This situation was predictable though, ladies and gentlemen.
Rather than seeking unity between the two great Palestinian factions, whose legitimacy was based on fair elections, rather than backing their unity from the outset, we decided to play the game of sanctions, thus dividing them.
While President Abbas risked his life and staked everything on ensuring the creation of a government of national unity, based on a political platform inspired by the principles of the Quartet and respecting the peace commitments that had previously been made, we stood by and waited.
We have not been able to take advantage of this glint of light and of the hopes raised in Mecca.
Today, Javier Solana, who is on a visit to the region, has quite rightly stated: 'We must support Palestinian unity'.
But we will not support that unity by sending money and weapons to one of the parties!
There is only one way to do that, as you all know: politics.
That is why, together with some of my colleagues, I shall say this to you: we must urgently recognise the government of national unity!
Its authority must be established, and we must help it to establish that authority and to ensure the subsistence of its population.
He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind: I am not the first person to say that.
If we refuse to work with moderate Islamists, however, we will just be stuck with the radicals and the extremists, and it is not just in Palestine that they will make their voices heard!
(DE) Madam President, the situation is indeed a tragic one.
Groups of Hamas radicals are day by day bombarding Sderot with Qassam rockets, and these attacks, far from being random, are the fifth breach of the cease-fire so far.
What is evident is that the attempt is again being made to distract attention from the in-fighting between the Palestinians themselves, that is to say between Hamas and Fatah, with fighting in which 55 Palestinians have died, killed by Palestinian hands.
It seemed to them that the time was ripe for attention to be diverted to their common foe, Israel, and how did Israel respond?
It responded with the mailed fist.
This Israeli Government, whose approval ratings lie around the 3% mark, is doing Hamas a favour by trying to wipe out the source of the attacks by military means, leading to more Palestinian victims, whose deaths we lament.
Hamas has again won itself time and can put off to another day the political concessions that have to be made.
Yet again, we appear to be paralysed.
Concessions were, after all, made in Mecca; they may not, to be sure, have been sufficient, but, despite the weaknesses of Mecca, these concessions amounted to a major step in the direction of peace.
That agreement has now been stricken to the heart by this resumption of violence.
I do believe, then, that it is for the time being right and proper that the European Union should insist on compliance with all the Quartet's conditions and with what was agreed at Mecca before it resumes making payments to the unity government.
This does not run counter to Mr McMillan-Scott's call for pragmatic and all-round cooperation to be sought where it really is for the people's benefit.
We should not, nevertheless, abandon this vital tool before it is time to do so.
I would encourage the Council, the Commission and the Arab League to make the effort to press ahead, and would very much like to see them achieve success as soon as possible.
(PL) Madam President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the European Union managed to retain its credibility at the recent summit in Samara.
Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and Mrs Merkel, the President of the Council, had no hesitation in making pertinent and forthright comments on the unfair treatment meted out to Poland, a Member State of the European Union, over the meat issue.
Mr Barroso and Mrs Merkel also commented in the same vein about human rights in Russia.
The question arises as to why the Union does not go further and highlight the fate of Palestinians in Israel, or that of Cyprus, which has been under Turkish occupation since 1974.
Major injustices are being still perpetrated on the Union's doorstep in the 21st century, and we continue to do too little to help overcome them.
Did people not die in Palestine before the creation of the state of Israel?
How much longer will the Israeli army of occupation remain in the Palestinian Territories?
Do the Palestinians not have a right to their own state?
The Jewish people were denied their own state for so long - how can they deprive others of that right?
The Palestinians' response to the ongoing occupation is to launch attacks on Israel.
In comparison to the actions of the Israeli forces, those perpetrated by the Palestinians are amateur efforts.
It should be for Israel to make the initial move towards facilitating the creation of a Palestinian State.
That would be the first step towards reducing violence in the region and promoting coexistence.
It is the European Union's duty to be the guardian of freedom in the world, especially now that the United States has relinquished that role and sided with Israel.
Perhaps the events of September 11 would not have taken place if the United States had persevered in its previous role of impartial guardian of law and justice the world over.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having said, in our last debate, which followed the Hamas victory, that Europe must never again allow the existence of Israel to be jeopardised, it is with all the greater anguish and sadness that I return from travelling through Palestine.
What I mean by that is that, though I wanted to visit Palestine, it was nowhere to be found; what I found instead was a military hinterland, dismembered, divided, a land in which members of families are cut off from one another and from their places of work, in which towns are deprived of water and settlements of fertile land.
All I can say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, is that nobody can live under such circumstances.
The Israeli Government's occupation regime is not making the country more secure; it is putting it in jeopardy by turning Palestine into a seedbed of despair, hatred and violence.
I can tell you, Commissioner, that the situation has got worse; it will, indeed, get worse still, and nobody can or should be surprised at that.
Politicians always find the analysis of military measures difficult, but one fundamental conviction derived from my trip that I would like to share with you is that this occupation regime also serves other purposes: quite obviously, and undeniably, the protection of illegal settlements and the links between them.
It also serves to keep the country's water resources in Israeli hands, to put in place a system of land acquisition whereby Israel's borders may be set still wider.
That cannot be a means to peace.

As I said earlier, no longer must anybody put at risk Israel's right to exist, and so, critical as one may be of it, and whatever demands we might make for the sake of peace in Israel, what I want to say today is that we need to demand that this regime of occupation be abandoned and that help be given in establishing a viable Palestinian state.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Palestinians are continuing to die and so many have already died; again they are being collectively punished.
The army's response is to a group of terrorists, who should indeed be confronted, but once again it is the Palestinian people that is paying.
It is our duty and our responsibility to recognise our failure as international communities, political parties and movements: after forty years the Israeli military occupation continues and the wall is stealing water and land from the future Palestinian State.
The tragedy that is unfolding has been predicted many times.
Since 1980 we have been talking about two peoples and two States: one State exists, but the other does not.
The Palestinian people is deprived of freedom, humiliated, expropriated, and hostage to extremist groups that have taken the people and also the leadership hostage.
It is not enough!
It is really not enough to promise that we will give more economic aid.
The solution is a political one: stop the military occupation and the expansion of settlements, recognise the Palestinian Government of national unity, and work to achieve Palestinian unity and not division.
We must show that the European Union believes in international legality and says so to Israel, which is continually infringing it.
The country is in fact, day by day, as David Grossman says, losing its very morality.
We must act quickly!
Act quickly, because the Palestinians and Israelis and Lebanese are paying the price of our incapacity and of our double standards.
We should recognise the government and also perhaps place an international United Nations force in Gaza and the West Bank. In my view this is vital.
(EL) Madam President, we are still living with the consequences of a mistake made in 1947.
If there had been no unilateral recognition of Israel and the state of Palestine had been recognised back then, we would have saved a great deal of bloodshed.
One statistics office has concluded that all the blood shed in the area could have saved one million children with blood transfusions.
All these tragedies which happened with the twin towers, in London, in Madrid and elsewhere are the result of this policy in 1947, which we are continuing today.
Why go into interminable details?
Will we have the strength tomorrow to recognise the state of Palestine?
That would be some sort of progress.
We are blowing the final whistle when the score is 90 - 10.
When the umpire blows his final whistle when the score is 50 - 50, he leaves the pitch with his head held high.
When he blows his final whistle when the score is 60 - 40, the game is over, but when he blows his final whistle when the score is 90 - 10, all hell breaks out both on the terraces and on the pitch.
We therefore are responsible for this hell, because we blew our final whistle when the score was 90 - 10.
The world is going to the dogs and we hear references in Parliament to Iran's nuclear weapons every day.
No one has ever spoken about Israel's nuclear weapons and that is wrong.
If we want to be fair, if we want to believe our citizens and for them to trust us, we must administer justice and there will only be justice with the recognition of the state of Palestine.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Berlin Wall may have fallen, the Soviet Empire may belong in the past, the world has become globalised, but there is at least one thing that is unchanging, a place where history has come to a standstill, which is Palestine, the Palestine that is becoming mankind's black hole: Gaza, the camps, rockets, intifadas, attacks, one land for two peoples, a long war that has been going on for sixty years now.
It is also a great jungle of myths, with esplanades, tombs, patriarchs, temples, mosques, monotheism and cynicism, a cynicism shared, moreover, by the hardliners on both sides. On the Israeli side, there is technology, force, the elimination of Arafat, of Fatah, economic strangulation, the prisoners, in short, everything, but most definitely not negotiations, Iran over Iraq, Shi'ism over Baathism, and, on the Palestinian side, the hardliners clearly have demographics on their side in the long term.
In the meantime, three generations have already been sacrificed, and what do we do?
Well, we make statements, visits, humanitarian missions - do we not, Mr Solana?
That is all!
The fact is, this conflict is the descendant of the European conflicts of 1914-1918 and 1939-45, and we are not doing what we should be doing, we are indulging in Pharisaism.
We know, however, that we should go further than emergency meetings, that we should stop the embargos, that we should invest, that we need a European Camp David, with all of the parties - not only Israel, Palestine and its government of unity, but also Syria, Iran and Lebanon - and we know that we must state the two rights, the right of the Israeli State to exist in perpetuity, of course, but also the right of the Palestinian State to exist, to be recognised.
Madam President, the recent downward spiral of internecine violence between armed secular Fatah and Islamist Hamas militias in Gaza is of grave concern, as we now see the consequences of a weakened Israeli leadership post-Lebanese war and a weakened Palestinian President Abbas having to deal with the religious fundamentalists within Hamas, who won the elections last year.
The Hamas members of the unity government are clearly not able to break away from their intransigent positions based on theocratic obscurantist views that the State of Israel can never be explicitly recognised, that terrorist violence is justified and that they are not bound by previous agreements signed by the late Chairman Arafat.
So clearly this Palestinian Authority unity government does not fulfil the Quartet criteria and the EU cannot lift the ban on Hamas as a terrorist organisation or directly fund the Palestinian Authority at present, relying instead on the TIM for delivery of humanitarian aid which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen during the last three years.
There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs, as evidenced by the recent proposals from the Arab League, of the desirability of a negotiated solution.
The Israelis all recognise the damage to Israel's economy and society of the continuing violence after the recent spate of over 100 Qassam missiles launched by Hamas at civilian areas.
In fact there was one fatality last week which constitutes, in my view, a war crime under international law.
Only the extremists, it seems, are afraid of peace.
Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict, there is increasing recognition amongst Arab States that Israel is here to stay, whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel's long-term security is best served by recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own secure state also.
But the Palestinian Authority must first be able to secure law and order on its territory, which it is failing signally to do right now.
Securing the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston and the kidnapped soldier, Corporal Shalit, would be a great start and create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for the fact I have to leave as soon as I have finished speaking, as I have to go and chair something.
I know that is impolite, but I would ask you to understand and bear with me.
It is not, of course, a matter of doubt that Israel is entitled to defend itself against the Kassam missiles, for firing them at civilian facilities and persons is a crime.
It is a provocation to Israel, but also to the government currently in power in Palestine.
One might even say that that is the main object of the exercise - and what is the European Union doing about it?
I regret to have to tell Mr Gloser that the answer he has given - on behalf of the Council presidency, of course - is quite utterly unsatisfactory, no less so than the one given at the last debate.
We are doing nothing to strengthen the hand of those forces that alone are capable of taking action against these terrorists.
Our statements will change nothing, nor, alas, will Israel's retaliatory military actions, justified though they may be in individual cases, if the European Union does not give this government a chance.
I say 'government', for it is cynical to decide which individual ministers one will meet with and which one to avoid; I did mention last time round that the President of the Council was having meetings with the Israeli foreign minister, but, when it came to meeting his Palestinian counterpart, claimed that she was not in the habit of meeting foreign ministers.
That way of going about things is not really going to produce results.
While I have no desire to make life difficult for the Commissioner for Foreign Relations, she did in fact talk in terms of supporting the government rather than individual ministers, and while the pair of them say we have to support Abbas, they are not actually doing so by denying their backing to his government and failing to enable it to take action against terrorism and those who engage in it.

That is the problem; if Europe does not commit itself to doing that all these talks will avail us nothing, since peace can be established only from within, and there will be peace only if there are, in Palestine, strong forces that can enforce their will by reason of their getting support - be it political, moral or financial - from the European Union in their fight against the terrorists.
That will help both Palestine and Israel.
Let me say once again that, if you want to help Israel, you have to give this government a chance.
Nothing else is worthy of being taken seriously.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Presidency and the Commission for being present.
Clearly, the time available permits me to make just a few observations.
Palestine is a serious and urgent issue, and we must seek to correct the current downward spiral of events.
The government of national unity is our sole interlocutor, and we must take note of this in a realistic way and seek to gain time with a gesture of hope towards Palestine.
We could also put in a peacekeeping force and have the courage, as the European Union, to be joint guarantor of the security of Israel and Palestine. This must be based on a policy of opening up to the Arab world, starting with the whole of the Mediterranean, and thus not isolating this conflict from the general problem of the relationship between Islam and the West.
I have a dream: that a reformed United Nations Organisation will have its headquarters in Jerusalem, so that this kind of hope can actually be created.
We can work at this; I believe that we will be able to achieve it!
Madam President, the Hamas Charter is a sacred text with three Islamic seals.
Unlike the secular PLO, Hamas does not recognise the concept of peace.
The PLO may want a two-state solution, but Hamas wants to eliminate Israel.
What does the Hamas Charter say?
In Article 7 it mentions an Islamic world order and the destruction of all Jews.
Articles 22 and 28 say that the Jewish people created the French and Russian Revolutions, the First and Second World Wars, but also the United Nations, drugs and alcohol abuse, and control of the mass media.
Stopping the conflict with Israel is high treason and perpetrators will be cursed, according to Article 32.
Cooperation with Hamas would make the EU morally responsible for a peace process leading to the elimination of Israel.
We must help the Palestinians, but not by facilitating the Hamas agenda.
(NL) Madam President, in early February, the German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, featured an extremely gloomy report on the EU's police mission in the Palestinian regions.
Its outgoing leader, a Briton by the name of MacGyver, did not mince his words when he said 'We are working here in a quagmire of deceit and corruption'.
Months later, an escalation of rivalry between Fatah and Hamas only made matters worse.
The necessary question arises as to how meaningful the Council and Commission deem the continuation of the EU mission to set up a civil police force on the West Bank and in Gaza.
You will hardly want to shoulder some of the responsibility for the far-reaching lawlessness in that area.
Meanwhile, the news agency Reuters announced yesterday that the European Union will be extending its border mission in Rafah by a year under the revealing, unchanged motto 'The Palestinians are responsible for the border'.
Their police are sure to put something in the way of the smugglers of arms, drugs, money and people, according to Palestinian insiders, such as the one who spoke to me.
I would ask the Council and Commission the same question: are you prepared to face up to your responsibility in this, and do so in a spirit of humility?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I ask your understanding for the fact that I am able, at the moment, to make only a few brief comments, as I have a meeting with your Committee on Foreign Affairs at 6.00 p.m., when I will be reviewing and evaluating the last meeting of the General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council.
While I can understand all the things you have said, not least that which has been said on the basis of your own travels and discussions, I would ask you also to take note of the fact that it was the European Union, notably the previous and current presidencies, that actually did something about reviving the Middle East Quartet and getting some sort of process in motion, without which process the Saudi Arabian initiative would not have happened, and so I would ask you to take a nuanced view and bear in mind that certain things cannot be attributed to the immobility of certain funds.
This is, after all, an intra-Palestinian conflict.
We have of course - as I made clear in the statement on behalf of the presidency - spelled out in our talks with Israel that the funds rightly due to the Palestinians, in the shape of customs duties and taxes, must be returned to them if various infrastructure measures are to be guaranteed.
The Commissioner has, on repeated occasions, and not least to the Council, commented on how the European Union has been providing support over recent months.
The public may occasionally have got the impression that we are paying too little or nothing at all, but the opposite is in fact the case, for the European Union has, and during a very critical period, transferred more funds than it had done under other conditions previously.
To Mr Davis, I would like to say that we do not want the Palestinians, on the grounds of their expecting everything, to have to be seen as some sort of saints, but one thing that did become clear from the Mecca conference when attempts were being made to put together a government of national unity, was that the conditions on which the Middle East quartet has always insisted must be met, those being the right of Israel to exist, the renunciation of violence and also the discharge of the obligations entered into by the previous government.
Certain things are moving, but there is as yet no clarity as to whether the government is committed to those things.
There is absolutely no reason for us to put up some sort of wall; the government of national unity could well take this step, and the conditions could be established.
We are not, after all, treating this as a marginal issue; every time it meets, the Council considers how progress can be made.
As I have already said, the presidency is trying to arrange, in the immediate future, a meeting of the Middle East quartet, since we know just how much depends on that.
The High Representative, who is currently in Beirut, many kilometres to the north, knows that this is not just about Palestine and Israel, but also about the issue of Lebanon's security and its right to self-determination.
I would like to urge that we should go beyond just talking and try to get some initiatives off the ground to the end not only that there may be a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians, but also that financial aid be given and that we may - as I have just again looked up - ask Israel to facilitate freedom of movement for the Palestinians, so that they may no longer be penned in in the way that they currently are, in a situation with which nobody can be satisfied.
I crave the House's indulgence, but I really must now leave your debate.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for staying here with us today.
Unlike many MEPs, I have been to Palestine more than once.
In line with what everyone here wished, Israel has left Gaza, and handed it over to a free, democratically elected government.
Gaza is therefore not some military outpost, it is a country devastated by the extremism, fundamentalism, terrorism, corruption and cynicism of the Palestinian warlords themselves.
Ladies and gentlemen, are we naÃ¯ve enough to think that throwing more hundreds of millions of euros without clear guidelines will stop Jund Al-Islam or Mohamed Dahlan from further acts of violence?
Do we honestly believe that legalising warlords and terrorists like Khaled Mashal or Dahlan will bring peace to the region?
Fortunately, the Council and the Commission have taken a firm, clear stance, and I wish to thank them for that.
I am grateful that on this tricky matter, they have adopted the right position.
We should reject violence and pay tribute to the victims of Gaza and the West Bank.
We must state clearly our opposition to Hamas using its power in the Palestinian Government to attack Israel to further its appallingly extremist interests.
I wish to warn against working with Hamas, including Members of the government, as this is clearly proscribed, or with new Al-Qaeda organisations such as Fatah Al-Islam and Jund Al-Islam.
We call on the Palestinian Government not only to recognise the exchange of letters between Rabin and Arafat but also to stop lying about fulfilling the key condition of recognising Israel.
We call on the Palestinian Government and on all Arab politicians, in particular the Saudis and Egyptians, to acknowledge all of their political and human responsibilities and to take part immediately in peace negotiations involving full recognition of the State of Israel within duly recognised international borders.
We call on Fatah to begin negotiations with Hamas without delay on the sharing of power within the President's Office.
It is only by adopting the right position and having a clearly-stated standpoint that we will be able genuinely to provide humanitarian aid and, most importantly, to support the emergence of a viable, democratic Palestinian state.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, as previous speakers have mentioned, Parliament was in Palestine at the beginning of the month.
That was a very tense time, but now, two weeks on, that tension has increased and unfortunately the citizens of the region are expecting less and less of the EU.
In spite of the various sources of tension, Parliament sought to be there on the ground.
It was indeed there, and today, despite the increased tension, Mr Solana is also in the region.
We saw human tragedy, which you described, Commissioner, and which you of course acknowledge.
We also saw a wall 852 km in length, which, with a view to combating violence and to keeping Israelis safe from Arab attacks, has invaded 25% of West Bank territory and has annexed territory that is central to any peace agreement based on the 1967 plan.
It is a wall that imprisons people in their own homes, that stops children from getting to school and that stops farmers from cultivating their land.
It is a wall that has turned Gaza into the best-known open prison in the world.
It is a prison which, according to a decision by the Israeli police at the beginning of 2006, no one - or should that be nothing - is to enter or leave.
In this context, we all look on bemused and deny any involvement.
Today we hope that Mr Solana's eyes and heart can convey some hope to these people on our behalf.
When we were there we passed on the message and recognised the government called for by the Quartet, and we are effectively calling today for that to continue to be the case.
Let us hope that the Council and the Commission honour this commitment, that they meet their obligations and that they are ready to work with everyone.
What the EU is actually ready to do must be spelled out in the clearest terms.
Let us show the world once again that peace can only be achieved by extending our hand to those who need it and by eliminating their despair.
(FI) Madam President, first I wish to say that, hearing this debate, I have felt that the overall picture is somewhat limited.
Any educated member of the public following it might think that very many Members of the European Parliament had very limited knowledge about the history of the Palestinian and Israeli region.
How did the state of Israel come about?
What was the Balfour Declaration and so on?
What was the UN resolution at the time?
What was the basis for the partition?
It is shameful of us parliamentarians if we do not first do our homework but instead come and speak very emotionally about things we do not necessarily know about.
That is why it is fitting to stop and consider what the issue actually is in this region, and take an overall view of it instead of just hinting at it momentarily.
We Europeans must support democracy and not terrorism.
Our values are human rights, freedom of thought and the rule of law.
We have to keep to them.
Moreover, if they are our values we cannot recognise the 'national unity government', which is a terrorist organisation led by Hamas.
We cannot acknowledge them: as Europeans we have to adhere to our democratic values.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following our visit to the West Bank and Gaza in early May, I can do no more than conclude that we are further away from a structural solution than ever, despite the agreement that was struck 40 years ago.
A huge number of illegal settlements are being set up on the West Bank.
We can only watch as the number of check points increases rather than decreases.
In Gaza, 87% of the people are living below the poverty line.
There are still 41 Palestinian members of parliament behind bars and the subject of refugees returning is not being touched upon at all.
The wall is indeed growing into the world's largest, something in which Israel can surely take pride.
Despite this, the Palestinians are also entitled to self-determination and a dignified existence, and they are prepared to bring sacrifices and compromise.
They have shown explicitly and on several occasions that they want peace and prosperity for their people.
Do the international community and the European Union still actually want this, though?
I wonder about this sometimes, not least when I hear the Commissioner say today that, following talks with the minister, she heard the request made of the government of national unity to give its support and that Abbas has made the same request.
So why do you not recognise the government?
What are you really waiting for?
When will you finally give the Palestinian Authority direct support?
I heard the presidency talk about the Quartet requirements, but we should not wait for a new Quartet meeting.
The European Union could take the lead in this.
We need to talk to the government as a whole.
Finally, Commissioner, you claim that all instruments are being used to force Israel to redirect those taxes to the Palestinians.
I cannot think what the instruments were to which you were referring and I should like to hear more about them, for I believe there is no time to lose now.
(FR) Mr President, today we once again have to deal with the dreadful situation in the Middle East.
Since 6 May, thirty-six Palestinians, including eleven civilians, have died in Israeli raids on Gaza.
On the other side, 146 rockets have been fired at the Israeli town of Sderot, wounding six people.
The Palestinians are fighting amongst themselves.
In Lebanon, the 3 000 refugees in the Nahr Al-Bared camp are paying the price for the fighting between the Lebanese army and the extremists of Fatah-al-Islam.
In this regard, let us state clearly that there is never any justification for killing civilian populations.
More generally, we must call for a radical change to Europe's policy on the Middle East.
It is no longer acceptable to refuse to support politically and financially, and with no exclusions, a Palestinian Government of national unity that we have advocated passionately and that, if we are to believe the Palestinian Foreign Minister, whom we received recently, firstly, respects political pluralism, secondly, does not question the existence of the Israeli State, thirdly, calls for the recognition of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, and fourthly, renews its commitment to the UN and Arab resolutions, particularly on the refugee issue.
Let us think clearly, the peace initiative drawn up at the Riyadh Summit has no chance of succeeding unless we Europeans work towards lifting the political and economic siege being suffered by the Palestinian Government.
Fifteen months of blockade, 70% of the population living below the poverty line and 50% unemployment provide an ideal breeding ground for fundamentalism and terrorism but do not provide a government with the best conditions for restoring law and order.
Since we are calling upon the Palestinian Government to fulfil its responsibilities, we must fulfil ours.
Mr President, as a child I was happy to believe that all people were equal.
Growing into a young man I was very upset to realise how wrong I was: that there were in fact two kinds of people - those whose lives matter and those whose lives do not matter.
Then, I became involved in politics and I was taught that what was really important was not what is right but what brings in votes.
Today, as an MEP, I have finally formed the opinion - simplistic and cynical as it may sound to some - that there are indeed two kinds of people: those liked by the American Government and those who are not.
Based on this view, the Palestinian people can be humiliated, starved, imprisoned without trial, tortured, executed, etc. and it does not really matter, because the Bush Administration and their obedient servants, e.g. the 'Blairinos' of this world, consider Palestinians to be subhuman.
Therefore, why waste our time debating Palestine when we know that nothing significant will come of it?
If we really care about the issue, then we should address our efforts towards the planet's Grand Master, Mr Bush, and try to convince him that Palestinians are in fact human.
If we succeed, which I very much doubt, then perhaps we can contribute constructively towards solving the Palestinian problem.
(PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all long for peace in the Middle East.
