Â Â  Mr Van Orden, the representation of the Council is decided by the Council and you can see it here.
It is perhaps not very extensive, but it is what the Council has decided and Parliament cannot therefore tell the Council how it should be represented in the Houseâs sittings, although your comment is undoubtedly very valid.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the fourth resolution that I have tabled on Burma in the last 18 months, but the situation continues to deteriorate and the Council's reaction is pusillanimous.
The Burmese military dictatorship is now in its 43rd year of illegitimate rule.
It is 15 years since Aung San Suu Kyi was first put under house arrest and 14 years since the SPDC decided to disregard the will of the Burmese people as expressed in the 1990 elections.
In spite of this, the Council's message that is now being sent to the Burmese dictatorship is that it is an acceptable and welcome member of the international community, irrespective of its oppressive activities.
In 1997 Burma's entry into ASEAN was heralded as a means to exert pressure on the regime.
All we have heard from ASEAN is mild rebuke.
The Burmese dictatorship ignored this and nothing more has happened.
Six years after Burma joined ASEAN, oppression in the country has intensified and any return to democratic rule remains a distant prospect.
This October ASEAN intends to include Burma at the ASEM V summit in Hanoi.
I am the first to understand that Europe's relationship with ASEAN is widely based and most important.
It should not be hostage to Burma, but that is what the ASEAN states are allowing to happen.
The Asian governments must realise that they may be sacrificing a rewarding partnership with the European Union for the sake of a morally bankrupt regime in Burma.
We must demand Burma's exclusion from ASEM until it complies with the demands of the international community.
I am sorry to say that there are some similarities with the situation concerning Zimbabwe.
There again we have an atrocious regime, which in many respects is even more abusive to its people than the Burma dictatorship.
There again we have had half-hearted sanctions by the EU going through the motions of taking action, but in effect allowing the regime off the hook because of the self-interested agenda of one or two of our Member States.
There again neighbouring states have the key to change, but for their own misguided reasons refused to turn it.
The EU does not put pressure on them.
We need the ASEAN states to insist on the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and on freedom for the NLD opposition.
The EU Foreign Ministers must demand that they do this before Burma is allowed to sit down with them in Hanoi.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Myanmar, a country that lives under a repressive, violent and enormously cruel regime, is known to us all.
Even so, whereas incidents concerning the incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi and the impossibility for the LND, the party which won the elections, to exert its political power are well known, less well known are other extremely serious facts concerning the conscription of child soldiers, the forced labour of a large part of the population and, something which the women in our Parliament, and I believe all civilised people, appreciate as particularly sensitive, the abuse inflicted upon women from ethnic minorities.
There is substantial documentation at the United Nations which I think should also be examined more thoroughly by this Parliament.
In this situation, we feel that the EU should accept the request of the ASEAN countries, which have already admitted Myanmar to their forum, to have it attend the next ASEM summit, which sees the European Union engaged in a dialogue of cooperation and political exchange with Asian countries.
I think that the Foreign Ministers, at an informal meeting, have unexpectedly â if I may say so â already gestured their agreement that it should attend.
I think that the European Council must adopt a different stance to resolve a situation whereby European citizens cannot see their Heads of State or Government sitting side by side with the representatives of such a bloodthirsty country, with such a violent and repressive regime.
We therefore ask the European Council to adopt a different position which, through the ASEAN countries, can convince Myanmar to bring about change.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Burmese peopleâs struggle for democracy has been a long one; there was a ray of hope in 1990, when the National League of Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work for non-violent change, won the elections with 82% of the votes, but, since then, the country has been ruled by a savage military dictatorship, which has placed her under house arrest and harassed her; there are over 1Â 000 political prisoners.
Organisations tell us that, for example, the armed forces have also started using systematic rape as a weapon against ethnic minorities.
There is widespread violation of human rights.
From that time onwards, the military dictatorship has been repeatedly denounced by international institutions, the European Parliament and the Council among them, and their constant demands have been threefold: freedom for the NLD to engage in political activity, freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi and the initiation of political dialogue aimed at advancing the countryâs democratisation process.
It was a major breakthrough when, at the 2004 ASEM Summit in Kildare, the Asian states supported these demands as the minimum requirement before Burma would be able to take part in future ASEM summits.
We can see, then, that there is a broad consensus in the international community that these conditions must be fulfilled, and it is one that this House has repeatedly underlined.
It is therefore quite incomprehensible and utterly deplorable that the foreign ministers of the European Union have now taken the decision simply to abandon the criteria and political conditions that they themselves imposed and agree to Burmaâs participation in ASEM summits without their being complied with.
Nor is there any reason to suppose that conditions in Burma have changed for the better, or anything like that, in recent months â quite the contrary is the case.
Such an about-turn is quite incomprehensible and threatens to damage the credibility of European policy, for why, now, should anyone take our resolutions seriously?
Who is going to take the resolutions of the Council of Foreign Ministers seriously when they have spent ten years saying, âthis is the condition that must be met before you can take partâ, and then, when the situation presents itself, say, âwe didnât mean it like that, weâll let it goâ.
We all know, of course, that there has been discussion behind the scenes about the business interests involved.
We all know that it is argued in business circles that we must now take a more cautious approach to Burma, that China wants to grab the Burmese market for itself, and that the European Unionâs competitiveness is at risk if we do not take a softer line on Burma.
Such is the background music to a decision like this, and I believe that we in this House must say, loud and clear, that what is at stake here is the credibility of European foreign policyâs values.
We have to make it clear that it is by these values that European foreign policy continues to be guided, and that we stand by our own resolutions.
We have to make it clear that the foreign ministers have taken the wrong decision and that this House continues to take a critical line on the Burmese Government.
Â Â  Mr President, I consider it an affront to democracy and humanity that Burma will be represented at the ASEM Meeting in Hanoi in October.
As the previous speaker, Mr Schmidt, has said, the three necessary conditions for Burma's attendance at the meeting have not been met: the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other National League for Democracy leaders, their freedom to participate freely in the National Convention, and the modification of procedure of the National Convention.
Meanwhile, according to Amnesty International, there have been thousands of reported cases of rape being used as a political weapon to subdue ethnic minorities.
As recently as last week, it was reported that the Women's League of Burma maintains that such rape is prevalent in many areas and that victims are frequently under the age of 18 and even under the age of 12 in at least one case.
It is well known that the Burmese military is also believed to have a higher percentage of child soldiers than any other military in the world.
I strongly oppose Burma's participation in the forthcoming meeting and I hope that the invitation to Burma will be withdrawn until democracy is restored and Aung San Suu Kyi set free.
Â Â  Â Mr President, the summit in Hanoi will be taking place on 8 and 9Â October, and it is, of course, good to see that it is being held, because the dialogue between Asia and Europe is of major importance.
There are, however, a few observations to be made in respect of the summit.
Burma has already been mentioned, and I will return to it presently.
First of all, I have to say that, although holding the summit in Vietnam is naturally a showcase for the reforms achieved in that country, it nevertheless has to be noted that there is still a yawning chasm between the dream of an effective and honest trading environment and reality.
I have taken a stand in this House before â in October 2001 and also a year ago â for Mr Bin Vinh Trinh in Vietnam, for example.
After a long-term stay abroad, he had made investments in his home country, and these were taken away from him under false pretences.
His possessions were confiscated and he was imprisoned.
Tragic though this was for him and his family, above all, it sent a negative message to potential investors in Vietnam.
In my view, it is time the Vietnamese Government made a gesture in this respect.
Secondly, human rights are a topic of discussion also in other countries in the region, and remain so.
Thailand is a case in point.
It is true that the Dutch and the Thai Governments have just signed an extradition agreement for the exchange of the Dutch prisoners who have been behind bars for a long time.
This is a welcome step forward, but in the case of the prisoner, Machiel Kuijt, with which I am particularly concerned, it was agreed that he would appear before the court of cassation before 1 July.
That still has not happened, and I hope that the Thai Government will deliver on its promise.
Incidentally, the Commission has made a positive contribution in this area.
It would be good if the Council could do the same.
Finally, Burma has been mentioned.
No other Asian country is struggling with human rights and democracy as much as Burma.
Moreover, its problems are historical.
Naturally, the liberals propose a dialogue in principle, provided it is a dialogue in which both parties participate seriously. If not, there is no point whatsoever in sitting around the negotiating table.
In my view, the other Asian countries, particularly the ASEAN countries, which are so insistent that Burma should take part in those talks, also have a responsibility to ensure finally that Burma is taking this kind of dialogue seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, at the end of 2002 I was travelling in Burma and saw that Burma was a police state.
The Burmese authorities have not cooperated with the UN special envoys, and the latest attack on Aung San Su Kyi and the NDL is a further setback.
The world must not forget about the rest of the country, which is suffering from serious oppression.
Discrimination against different ethnic groups, the confiscation of property, and the existence of political prisoners, forced labour, political rape and child soldiers have been well documented, as well as the burning down of villages.
Fifty per cent of the national budget goes to the military.
Money comes from foreign business and investment.
The brutal military dictatorship is the root cause of the problems ravaging Burma.
Sanctions that would bite have never been strictly applied.
Burma has not met any of the three criteria set by the EU in April.
All members of the Committee on Development who have spoken in the debate feel strongly that the EU should not participate in the ASEM Summit in Hanoi with Burma.
Instead, the EU should increase and toughen sanctions against the regime leaders and should impose sanctions on the European corporations that do business with the Burmese regime, and specifically the French oil company Total.
The EU should urge countries such as the USA, Australia and Japan to do likewise.
EU members should ask the United Nations Security Council to impose marked targeted sanctions against the Burmese military regime, since it massively violates human rights, sends refugees into neighbouring countries, and sponsors the production of drugs and crime.
It would be a shame if at the ASEM Summit the EU allowed Burma to be dismissed as a minor issue in its overall relations with Asia.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is gravely concerned about the situation in Burma and, since 2001, has been using the Asia-Europe meetings of the ASEM process to reiterate this concern to Heads of State and Government, ministers and senior officials from the ten South-East and North-East Asian countries which participate in the ASEM meetings.
I do not have to impress on the honourable Members of the European Parliament how important the ASEM summits are in the EU political dialogue with Asia, being the only occasions when EU Heads of State meet South-East and North-East Asian Heads of State in a group-to-group dialogue.
It is absolutely clear that all members of the European Union remain highly critical of the military regime in Rangoon and the European Union will continue to repeat our demand for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy.
Unfortunately, so far the Burmese Government has shown no sign of fulfilling this, or the other two conditions of the Tullamore Gymnich.
Great efforts have recently been made to find a solution which would allow the ASEM summits to take place.
The Commission is of the opinion that we have been able to find a compromise which is acceptable to all.
We have been able to reach this agreement, because we value EU relations with Asia too much to allow our ASEM dialogue to be taken hostage by the behaviour of the regime in Rangoon.
The EU has reached an agreement on the participation of Burma in the ASEM summit, together with the 10 new EU members, Cambodia and Laos, but the European Union expects Burma to participate at a level lower than Head of State and Government.
At the same time, in order to send a strong signal to the Burmese regime that we do not agree with its policies, the European Union has decided to strengthen the targeted measures against the Burmese regime if it has not fulfilled the Tullamore conditions by the time of the ASEM summit.
Ministers have agreed to expand the visa ban list to include serving members of the military of the rank of brigadier-general and above, and members of their families, and prohibit EU-registered companies or organisations from making any finance, such as loans or equity, available to named Burmese state-owned enterprises.
In addition, EU Member States will vote against extending loans to Burma from international financial institutions.
The Commission is also looking at ways and means to take concrete action against illegal logging, while extending assistance to the Burmese population, especially on health and education, via international organisations.
Since the solution to the political situation in Burma will have to be generated within Burma and within the region, I am convinced that our dialogues in ASEM contribute positively towards future reform in Burma.
The Commission therefore looks forward to the ASEM V summit in Hanoi on 8 and 9 October, which in the context of wider discussions will allow a discussion with Asian leaders on human rights and prospects for reform in Burma and allow us to communicate our concerns to the Burmese representatives there.
Working closely with the EU Member States and especially the successive EU Council presidencies, the Commission is committed to all the appropriate efforts, whether they are diplomatic, political, or developmental, that might facilitate and accelerate the democratic and human rights reforms within Burma.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions presented by:
â VÃ©ronique De Keyser, Johannes (Hannes) Swoboda, Csaba SÃ¡ndor Tabajdi and Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the harassment of minorities in Vojvodina (B6-0045/2004);
â Roberto Musacchio, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) (B6-0049/2004);
â Kinga GÃ¡l, Doris Pack and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Vojvodina in Serbia and Montenegro (B6-0055/2004);
â Adriana Poli Bortone, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the harassment of minorities in Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) (B6-0057/2004);
â Jelko Kacin and IstvÃ¡n Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, on behalf of the ALDE/ADLE Group, on the continuing atrocities against minorities in the province of Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) (B6-0060/2004);
â Angelika Beer, Gisela Kallenbach, Joost Lagendijk, RaÃŒl Romeva Rueda and Tatjana Åœdanoka, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the violence against minorities in Serbia (B6-0062/2004);
â Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group, on Vojvodina in Serbia and Montenegro (B6-0064/2004).
Â Â  In the name of the European Socialist faction and the Hungarian Socialist delegation, I welcome todayâs resolution proposal by the European Parliament.
The European Parliament is doing itself proud by resolutely defending the rights of minorities.
We call upon the Serb Government to take immediate steps to halt anti-Hungarian acts of violence.
The day before yesterday, when the President of the Hungarian Republic held discussions with President Tadic in a good atmosphere, 15 kilometres from the borders of the European Union, in Szabadka-Subotica, the word âdeathâ was painted on the front door of the house of the man who first dared to complain publicly about the physical injuries he had sustained.
Todayâs resolution of the European Parliament is an important reinforcement of the fact that the rule of law and observing the rights of the minorities are preconditions of a partnership between the European Union and Serbia.
This is a fundamental political question.
Serbia and Montenegro is an important strategic partner of the Union.
The stability of the Federation and the maintenance of security are in the interests of the whole of Europe.
Todayâs resolution is not meant to punish but to encourage the Serbian democratic forces to uncompromisingly confront nationalism and xenophobia.
This is also in the interests of the Serb majority, the national minorities and the European Union.
It is important, and positive initial signals have reached us from Belgrade, mostly for President Tadic and Prime Minister Kostunica, to confront the gravity of the situation and investigate the anti-Hungarian actions.
I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my budgetary amendment proposal to increase the Unionâs support by EUR 5 million for the process of democratisation in Serbia.
Todayâs European Parliamentâs resolution will encourage the Vojvodina minorities, amongst whom live 300 000 Hungarians, and they will not feel abandoned by Europe.
Â Â  Â Mr President,after a string of violent conflicts in the states of former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2001, everyone hoped that the survivors would co-exist peacefully.
Unfortunately in Vojvodina, where citizens were subjected to bombing in what fell short of an ethnic war, non-Serbs are once again being tormented by those around them.
Today, we will once again express our horror at the situation and call for peace and reconciliation.
However, we will not solve this problem merely by committing our condemnations and moral indignation to paper.
If that is the only thing we do, then I fear that we will have to repeat pertinent resolutions of this kind again and again, because they are not being heard by the people who matter.
Violence and intimidation by ordinary citizens are evident wherever there is a predominant feeling that many of their own people are shut out by state borders, while many others who used to be considered to be the occupiers, are left behind in the peopleâs own country.
In Serbian public opinion, the prevalent view is that, in terms of government, the Serbian inhabitants of the north and east of Bosnia and of the north of Kosovo are wrongfully cut off from the home country, and that for that reason, the areas that are recognised as Serbian territory should be made completely Serbian.
Anyone who opposes this view is considered an enemy and is tarred with the same brush as the former Turkish and German occupiers.
Political parties identifying with this feeling, shared by many members of the public, can count on a lot of votes, because they have the nerve to do what the public want.
On the map of 1856, which is displayed on the second floor of this building, anyone can see how ethnically divided Vojvodina was between Hungarians, Croats, Germans, Slovaks, Romanians and Serbs at the time.
Since the 1918 division, when it became part of Serbia, it has continually become more Serbian and other groups have moved away or have been driven out.
Since 1989, the autonomy for the large Hungarian-speaking minority has also been driven back considerably.
The recent riots are part and parcel of this long-term development.
Without clear and broadly based agreements on linguistic rights, autonomy and administrative borders, it is difficult to avoid future outbursts of ethnic hatred in and around Serbia.
We should therefore do more than merely adopt this resolution, although it is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  â We are pleased that our proposal found agreement and has enjoyed the support of every Parliamentary group.
The proposal draws attention to a series of violent acts committed, in the first place, against members of a Hungarian minority population and minority groups in Vojdovina.
Thus, we are sending signals to the Serb authorities that they should take seriously these oft-neglected breaches of rights, which are considered local, in order to prevent graver ethnic conflicts that would necessitate serious efforts of intervention.
The frequency and increasing severity of violent acts show that the perpetrators and agitators will perceive the absence of legal consequences and the silent tolerance as tacit encouragement.
I would like to emphasise that it is not our intention to stigmatise Serbia, even less so as the country has European-standard minority legislation.
Despite all this, these events have been occurring up until today.
Because of this, the central and local authorities carry enormous responsibility for putting the principles into effective practice.
Naturally, one must appreciate that the Serbs have finally promised in the last two days that they will do everything to stop these incidents.
No doubt this is being done as a result of the strong international response.
At the same time if the European Union does not call them to account, their promises will only remain promises.
Yesterday for instance there was a new threat, this time a death threat, that drove a young man and his family, who had already previously experienced such incidents, to say that they wished to leave Serbia and seek political asylum.
It is in our mutual interests to reinstate the tradition of living harmoniously side-by-side in Vojvodina.
On a simple level this means that youngsters should not be afraid of speaking another language in the street and that if someone goes out at night to have a good time, he should not be slapped in the face because he speaks Hungarian and immediately think of emigrating.
This is why I ask all my representative colleagues to support the motion.
Thank you.
Â Â  â The process of democratisation in Serbia has faltered over the last year and a half.
One of the many worrying signs is that assaults against minorities have become commonplace.
What is even more worrying is the indifference and inaction of the Serb authorities.
Serbiaâs leaders must know that what is at stake is the European future of the country.
Serbia can achieve closer connections to Europe only if fundamental human rights can be assured and if it can guarantee the rights of minorities as well as their personal safety.
We do not want words from the Serb leadership but action.
It is not enough to make reassuring statements on the issue.
The perpetrators must be apprehended and brought before the courts.
We can rest assured only when we will see the consequences of these issues.
If we are not to see any positive change we must keep the issues high on the agenda.
Â Â  Â Mr President, just imagine, as a Member of this House, finding a large kitchen knife pushed under your front door one day, with the accompanying message: âWe will butcher youâ.
Is there anything more shocking or terrifying than this?
Such was the death threat, in Serbian, that BÃ©la Csorba, Vice-President of the Hungarian Democratic Party of Vojvodina, received on 9 April of this year.
This offence against a Member of the Hungarian minority in the Serbian province is by no means an isolated incident.
Not for nothing does this draft resolution list the specific expressions of physical and mental violence, to which particularly Serbian citizens of Hungarian origin have been exposed for some time.
Of how many incidents of hostility is the outside world unaware?
After all, typical of the climate of fear and intimidation in Vojvodina is the desire of various victims of ethnic violence to remain anonymous.
Extensive documentation, currently available, about the present position of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina is conjuring up a simply alarming image.
If a teenager speaks Hungarian on the streets or in a public place, then they run the risk of being beaten up by a gang of their Serbian contemporaries.
There is every chance that the police will look the other way or dismiss the incident soon enough as ânot ethnically motivatedâ.
Equally shocking are the texts of anti-Hungarian graffiti.
At the crack of dawn on 15 July 2004, a wall in the city of Novi Sad was covered in big letters which read: âOK, OK Hungarians, a deep mass grave awaits youâ.
Shortly before that, in early May, many buildings in this capital of Vojvodina were covered with graffiti asserting that âSerbia belongs to the Serbs; Hungarians: get lost!â
Against the background of an unmistakable radicalisation of the political climate in Vojvodina, I would underline Paragraph 5 of the draft resolution.
This paragraph asks for an in-depth inquiry to be mounted on the ground by the EP delegation for south-eastern Europe.
I would already like to give this fact-finding mission a number of urgent questions to take with them, questions that I would also like to address to the Council and Commission.
What is the situation with regard to language teaching and other cultural provision for the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, including newspapers, magazines and other media?
How much money does the Serbian Government set aside in total for public provision for this specific ethnic group?
In short, what exactly are the minority rights of the Hungarians in Vojvodina?
Encouraging was this weekâs pledge by the Council, through its Dutch Presidency, that it intends to examine the position of the minorities in Vojvodina.
This House and the Commission will have no choice but to follow suit.
What is decisive, however, is the attitude of the competent Serbian authorities.
In the first and last instance, we would urge them to commit to human tolerance in Vojvodina.
Â Â  â Mr President, following the wars against the Turks, something one could describe as Europe in miniature came into being in Vojvodina and flourished.
For centuries, it has been home to a good dozen peoples, who have lived together, sometimes relatively peacefully, sometimes very much so.
It was not only Poles, Ruthenes, Germans, Hungarians, and Czechs, but also Croats and Slovenes, who established themselves there a long time ago and have co-existed well with each other.
I might add that it was the Serbs of Vojvodina who contributed much to the tolerance in this region.
The problem is something quite different: it is that Milosevic deprived Vojvodina of its autonomy by force in order to secure himself a majority in Yugoslaviaâs collective state presidency, and that wave after wave of people uprooted and expelled from other parts of Serbia were settled there, thus upsetting the complex ethnic balance, and have to date been socially and politically marginalised, unable to put down real roots.
It is for that reason that a clear distinction must be drawn between cause and effect.
We will not solve the problem without building up democracy and the rule of law, autonomy and co-existence in Vojvodina.
We must support the Hungarians, but also all the other minorities too.
We also have to tell the old-established Serbs in Vojvodina that we know of the good they have done for this multinational region, that this policy of ours is not anti-Serb, but that it is our concern, in the world of many and varied cultures that is Vojvodina, to re-establish the sort of co-existence that prevailed for centuries.
That can be done only if we stand firm against the extremist elements and also tell the government in Belgrade that it is by the way they handle this that we will judge their readiness for Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, a very sad part of this story is the fact that most of the victims of ethnic harassment are young Hungarians.
Traditionally, Vojvodina has been a region in which many cultures and languages have existed together, and its youngsters have learned each other's culture and language.
I am very happy to hear that our Dutch and German colleagues from different political groups understand this, which means that this is also well known to Europe as a whole.
This issue, as has already been mentioned, is not only a Hungarian one.
During Tito's decades in power, many nationalities lived together in the autonomous region of Vojvodina: Croatians, Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, Poles, Germans, Jews and other minorities lived together with Hungarians and Serbs.
Now this peaceful coexistence is endangered by some extreme nationalists: Serbian politicians, policemen and other wrongdoers.
The Hungarian youth of Vojvodina has a very rich, special and progressive culture, which is different from the culture in the Hungarian motherland.
These young people were born into the spirit of a multiethnic culture and they understand both the Hungarian and Serbian cultures and traditions.
The young should be the future of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina.
If they leave their homeland, not only the Hungarian community but also Serbia in its entirety will lose a valuable part of its culture and its democratic future.
Young Hungarians in Serbia want to be good Hungarians, good citizens of a democratic Serbia, but, above all, good Europeans.
They want to remain in the land where they were born.
Let us help them to stay in their homeland.
The western community reacted too late in many cases to the use of ethnic harassment in the Balkans.
We have all seen the tragic consequences.
This time we have to answer without delay and send an encouraging message to the Hungarians, emphasising that they can stay in their homeland in a would-be democratic Vojvodina, in a would-be democratic Serbia of the future.
Â Â  . â As the atrocities against the Vojvodina Hungarian minorities have continued these past few weeks and politicians of Hungarian origin are being insulted and threatened and people are beaten up purely because they are not members of the majority group, it is our duty to raise our voices against these violations of law.
Our emphatic intervention is also required because, in the last year and a half, neither the Serb Government nor the local authorities have done anything to restore law and order and failed to protect fundamental human rights.
We do not know of a single incident where a person in breach of the law has been called to account.
I find it particularly serious that the local police force is not only turning a cynical blind eye to the beatings of Hungarians, but also actively takes part in these atrocities.
As a mayor, I would like to express my particular solidarity with the Mayor of Padej, Laszlo KomÃ¡rom who was twice slapped in the face by a police superintendent.
In a situation like this it is our duty to condemn the apathy and complicity of the Serb authorities.
At the same time we must warn the government of Serbia and Montenegro that by tolerating, and even encouraging the atrocities, they will make it impossible for the country to draw near to the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, like the other speakers I have heard in this House, I believe that the unique situation which exists at least in the remaining part of Yugoslavia, where it has been possible to maintain the peaceful co-existence of a number of nations, nearly 20 nations in fact, should be preserved.
Of course the question is to what extent this resolution, which I have studied carefully, is conducive to this.
I believe that by adopting such a resolution we would merely signal that we support one side only, and that we are not concerned with Yugoslavia or Serbia remaining a unified state, but only with a biased viewpoint.
According to the latest reports, the matters to which my Hungarian colleagues have referred also affect a number of other nationalities.
This is not merely a one-sided attack on the Hungarian minority, it is an attempt to disrupt the peaceful coexistence of the nations which live together in this country.
We should be aware of the kind of signal we would send out by means of such a resolution, and to whom we would send it.
Those of my fellow citizens from the former Czechoslovakia who are older than I am heard something similar in the early 1930s, and it resulted in the liquidation of our state.
I am therefore firmly opposed to this resolution.
Â Â  Â Mr President, in the province of Vojvodina, harassment and physical aggression against non-Serbs, including children, are once again the order of the day.
Members of the Hungarian minority are pestered on a daily basis, tombstones are damaged and violated, vandalism and anti-Semitic propaganda have become everyday fare.
Everything seems to suggest that within this province with its different minorities, the Serbs are once again turning more insolent and more radical.
Since the autumn of last year, we have been inundated with alarming reports about ever worsening violent incidents.
A recent report by the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation gives a 19-page long, humiliating chronology of the ethnic violence in the province of Vojvodina.
With this renewed violence, everything seems to suggest that the Serbs want to displace the frustrations that the loss of the province of Kosovo has caused them.
Fellow Members, I do not only want to point the finger at the Serbs here.
The sad experiences from the recent past should have taught us that conflicts in so-called multi-cultural or multi-ethnic societies are rooted in recent history, and that we should therefore look for a balanced political solution, whereby consideration is given to the complaints of all those involved, as well as to the conflictâs historical background.
We should therefore firmly condemn all violence, but we should be careful not to lay the blame on one party alone.
Â Â  â Vojvodina is the last multicultural region of the former Yugoslavia that, so far, has largely been free of public violent atrocities.
The brutality of the organised atrocities and ethnic cleansing by the central authorities in the other parts of the former Yugoslavia, for instance Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, serves as a warning.
In the last decade Vojdovina has become the strife-ridden hinterland of Serbia and the former Hungarian national community of half a million has decreased to half its population today.
Why?
Because its members have been chased away by political and economic forces, its youth has been recruited forcibly into the Serb-Bosnian-Croatian-Kosovo conflict and their homes occupied by several hundred thousand Serbs.
More and more politicians and experts who know the area are convinced that the stirring up of inter-ethnic tension, the beatings of Hungarians, the harassment and the robberies, the public burning of the Hungarian flag, and the desecration of graves in cemeteries are largely perpetrated by the Serbian and Montenegrin Government.
The Serb central authoritiesâ attitude to this serious situation fundamentally contradicts general human rights and clashes with the standards of the European minority protection.
The European Union bears a great responsibility for solving the situation. The solution to the Vojvodina question must be based on long-term acceptance and tolerance.
Â Â  The incidents against the native Hungarians living in Serbia and Montenegro, or more precisely in Vojdovina, are such that if left to fester, they could turn the region into an uncontrollable tinderbox.
The guarantee of and respect for human and minority rights are the touchstones of democracy.
Serbia and Montenegroâs long-term objective is to join the European Union.
For this, they must establish a lasting and solid democratic value system the basic principles of which constitute a vital element of the Copenhagen criteria.
A country that refuses to accept this has no place in the European Union.
As representative of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, I can prove through experience that a minority community is very sensitive to any measures and events that also endanger its existence beyond its identity.
The political leaders of Serbia make light of and play down the tense situation that has developed.
Such a development could easily become a chain reaction.
I support the resolution proposal.
We have to express our warnings and suggestions in a strict tone.
It is in a resolute manner that we have to call upon Serbiaâs public law dignitaries and state organs to halt the assaults against Hungarian and other national minorities.
Serbia and Montenegro can join the European Union only if a balanced situation on its territory will safeguard the rights of the minorities living in the region.
Finally, one cannot agree with the opinions of delegate KohliÄek.
The parallel he has drawn is faulty and deceptive.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is continuing to monitor the situation of minorities in Serbia and Montenegro as part of our general insistence on respect for the political criteria which form a crucial part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.
As regards Vojvodina, we strongly condemn the reported violent acts against members of the Hungarian minority.
The recent visit of the Serbian Prime Minister Kostunica to Vojvodina, as well as the letter sent by the Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro to the President-in-Office of the EU Council of Ministers, were concrete expressions of the declared commitment of authorities in Belgrade to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and more generally to ensure the protection of minorities.
We have taken note of these commitments and we will continue to keep the situation under close review, notably through the diplomatic representations in Belgrade, so as to ensure that the authorities deliver on their commitments.
In the run-up to the provincial elections in Vojvodina on 19Â September, it is important that political leaders show a sense of responsibility and promote a continuation of good inter-ethnic relations.
The visit of the Hungarian President Mr Madl to Belgrade on 14Â September was an excellent opportunity to discuss this issue in a constructive way and to confirm the good relations between Budapest and Belgrade.
For its part, the Commission is committed to contributing to the promotion of good inter-ethnic relations in Vojvodina as well as in other areas through a number of EU-funded projects.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions presented by:
â Pasqualina Napoletano, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human rights situation in the Maldives (B6-0044/2004);
â Giusto Catania and Jonas SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in the Maldives (B6-0047/2004);
â Nirj Deva, Thomas Mann, Charles Tannock and Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Maldives (B6-0054/2004);
â Graham R. Watson, on behalf of the ALDE/ADLE Group, on the political situation in the Maldives (B6-0058/2004);
â Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Maldives (B6-0063/2004).
Â Â  In the paradise islands of the Maldives, where more than 300Â 000 European tourists enjoy unforgettable holidays, thousands of local citizens have to endure appalling oppression by a regime that has been in power for 26 years.
The European Union, for its part, has a moral and political duty not to forget these people who live under a state of emergency, subject to arbitrary mass imprisonment â pro-democracy leaders have been tortured, detained and forbidden from communicating with the outside world â and still have to live under a regime that denies them an independent judiciary.
The situation is so serious that an EU delegation was denied access to those detainees.
The EU must demand an immediate end to the state of emergency and the release of all detainees.
Parliament calls on the Commission and on the Member States to halt non-humanitarian aid to the Maldives immediately and to impose an immediate travel ban to stop members of the Maldives Government and other Maldives officials from entering EU Member States.
The EU must, in turn, ask Member States to notify tourists planning to go to the Maldives that paradise is not paradise after all, and that there are human beings suffering tremendous oppression in that country.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is inconceivable that we are discussing the Maldives when this name evokes for us all holidays and a scene of paradise.
In reality, there is systematic violation of human rights on these islands.
We are faced with a situation in which women and children are denied their fundamental freedoms and, most importantly, a process of arbitrary mass detention of many citizens is under way.
I think that the European Union must promote a widespread initiative to support an awareness campaign for European citizens in our countries, so that they do not go on holiday to the Maldives until light has been shed on the tragic human rights situation and on the systematic violation of democracy in that land.
I think that a firm resolution is needed, aiming at ensuring, , that the Maldives really are a paradise, but a paradise in which democracy and the respect of human rights prevail.
Â Â  Mr President, why are we talking about the Maldives today?
We are talking about the Maldives because we have ignored it for 23 years.
We have let it be.
We have not looked at the living conditions or quality of life of the people in that country.
They have been living under a dictatorship.
There have been no elections.
The President runs the country as his private property.
Though it is classified under the GNP criteria as having a living standard in excess of $3Â 000 per capita, 50% of the people live for less than a dollar a day.
But if you were to go there, Mr President, you would have to pay $300 a night to stay in one of those rooms!
Where does the money go?
Who collects it and where is it banked?
Certainly not for the benefit of the people of the Maldives.
Moreover, recently, on 16 August, 200 people were detained without charge or arrest.
Eight MPs were detained, MPs who had been tasked with drafting constitutional amendments for increased representation in parliament, including a former candidate for the role of Speaker, former Secretary-General of SAARC Mr Ibrahim Zaki, who has been nominated by some of us for the Sakharov Prize.
Others have been held in prison without charge. Habeas corpus has been suspended and human rights have been abused.
If the government of the Maldives wants to engage with the European Union, it should first restore the fundamental rights of those people it has imprisoned.
Then we can talk.
We do not want to hurt a small archipelago of 1Â 200 islands.
We want to help them. The only way to help them is to ensure that European travellers visiting the Maldives also have access to fair travel so that they do not feel compelled to live in a country which is abusing its own citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to echo other speakers in saying that the Maldives is not the paradise it appears, and tourists must be made aware of that fact.
I should also like to join with colleagues in expressing my deep concern about the mass detentions that took place in August, including that of Fathimath Nisreen, a 23-year-old woman who was originally arrested without warrant in February 2002.
Later, while under house arrest, she joined the demonstration and was arrested again.
I call on the President of the Maldives to make sure that she, along with the rest of the detainees, is treated humanely and not subjected to torture.
I gather that some of the detainees have been tortured, although we do not have the precise details.
The detainees should also have immediate access to their families and to lawyers of their choice â and I specify 'of their choice' â along with medical attention for those who need it.
Again, I gather that there are some detainees who are in desperate need of such attention.
I am concerned because they appear to have been detained solely because of the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of speech and assembly, and for no other reason.
I call on the authorities to release those detainees immediately, unless they are charged with a recognisable criminal offence.
Â Â  â Mr President, against the image of the Maldives as a holiday paradise of oneâs dreams, we must set the political reality of uprisings, arbitrary arrests, solitary confinement and restrictions on the freedom of speech, of the press, of the right to assembly and of religion.
For over 26 years, the President has ruled over the archipelago as a dictator; only his own party is allowed to contest elections, he himself is the supreme judge, appoints one-sixth of the members of parliament, and controls the media, while economic life as a whole is in the hands of his family, something to which Mr Deva referred.
Two years ago, in response to international protests, he promised democratic reforms, but, as the Commissionâs report testifies, the announcement was not followed up by actions.
There have been expensive PR campaigns aimed at conveying the impression of effective changes, but let us not be taken in by them.
In August, in order to reinforce his power, the President declared a state of emergency, and had supporters of the pro-democracy movement arrested.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on him to release opposition elements from jail and at last initiate democratic reforms, failing which financial aid from the European Union and its Member States will have to be stopped.
As Members have pointed out, 300Â 000 tourists from the European Union visit the Maldives every year.
It is incumbent upon us to open their eyes to the conditions there, which are not those of a paradise.
If the President wants to avoid them being warned against travelling to the Maldives on the one hand, and a ban on his government and officials entering the EU on the other, then all he needs to do is to create the conditions for democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, you would be hard pressed to discover from the Commission website that there was a problem in the Maldives.
It says that the political situation in the Maldives has remained remarkably stable over the past two decades, providing a conducive environment for development.
I suppose you could call 26 years of unbroken dictatorship stability of a sort, but it is hardly conducive to development.
The Country Strategy Paper states that political developments have progressed over the past two decades, with enhanced democratic practices and increased respect for human rights; but this judgment is unbelievable since the paper subsequently notes problems of arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, lack of an independent judiciary and restrictions on free speech, protest and freedom of religion.
It is incredible that the Commission can, in these circumstances, record President Gayoom's commitment to democratisation.
The Maldives ambassador was on the phone to me this morning.
He advised me that the troublesome elements were Islamic fundamentalists.
That is not my information.
However, the more the legitimate opposition, such as the Maldivian Democratic Party, and fundamental rights are suppressed, the more people will be driven into the arms of extremists.
Â Â  Â Mr President, Mr Deva made us in the Committee on Development aware a few weeks ago of the tyranny â for there are no other words to describe the situation â which is governing the heavenly Maldives and where in August, a corrupt ruler, motivated by sharia law, once again imprisoned without trial a number of members of the opposition.
The Maldives are also those islands situated in the Indian Ocean where the many dollars which rich western tourists leave behind in the luxurious temples of five-star tourism only end up in the pockets of a small , while the majority of the population, a proportion of whom work as slaves in order to be at the beck and call of those western tourists, have to survive on less than USD 1 per month.
This corrupt regime of President Gayoom has survived for many years and continues to vegetate thanks to our travel agents and thanks to glossy magazines extolling to newly-weds the virtues of the palm trees and the white sandy beaches of the archipelago.
Wisely, these brochures keep silent about the rest.
They do not mention the poverty, the tortures or the political prisoners.
This is an outright disgrace.
This is why this Parliament must bring pressure to bear on the tourism industry, and the European Union should, if necessary, consider a tourism embargo against the Maldives should it transpire that the man who, as an unenlightened potentate, treats his subjects as slaves, cannot be brought to reason in any other way.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is as concerned as you are about the state of emergency in the Maldives and the continued detention of members of the constitutional Assembly, opposition leaders and journalists.
The measures imposed under the âstate of emergencyâ are draconian.
President Gayoom has clearly overreacted to what amounted to a peaceful protest.
The EU has already reacted strongly.
OnÂ 17 August, the United Kingdom Foreign Office issued a strong statement calling for the state of emergency to be lifted.
On 22-24 August, the EU Presidency led a fact-finding mission that met with various ministers, some of the detainees and several eyewitnesses.
The mission led to an official EU dÃ©marche on 6Â September, which was not well received by the Maldives Government, and to a strong public statement calling on the President to release prisoners, lift the state of emergency and continue with constitutional reforms.
The President was clearly stung by these statements.
He sent the Minister for Tourism to the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy to explain the situation.
He reassured the European Union that he intends to continue with his promised constitutional reforms.
He agreed that Amnesty International and the Red Cross should visit the prisons.
In shaping our response for the future, we should also recognise that the President undertook some reforms before the summer â discussions in the Majlis Assembly and the establishment of the Human Rights Commission â but that he was clearly moving too slowly for the citizens of the Maldives.
Building on this, a resolution from the European Parliament that would underline the main messages already passed by the EU would be very valuable.
It should also push the President to move on his offer for the RedÂ Cross to monitor the prisons, stress that the European Union will continue to monitor the situation closely and, if warranted, take up the Presidentâs offer for the EU Representatives to return to the country for further dialogue.
However, it would, in our view, be premature to consider travel restrictions, suspension of aid and other more punitive actions at this stage.
If the situation worsens and the state of emergency is not lifted, such measures should be considered.
But let us first see if the President will respect his promises to return to normal rule and resume the reform process as soon as possible.
I appreciate the information provided by the honourable Member, Baroness Ludford, concerning the Commission's website.
I was not aware of it, but I have already given instructions for it to be checked.
Obviously, there is a need to update the website and that will happen immediately.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote on:
(1)
(2)
(3)
Â Â  Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.(1)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 September (1).
Â Â  The next item is the speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank you personally for your efforts and assistance in trying to secure the release of my constituent from Liverpool, Ken Bigley, who was taken hostage in Iraq.
On Friday we received the very tragic news that he had been executed.
I should be grateful, Mr President, if you would send our sympathy and condolences to his family on behalf of the Members of this Parliament.
This request is also being made on behalf of the other Members of the European Parliamentary Labour Party.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs McCarthy.
I must tell you that that letter has been sent, and that I have previously sent my condolences to the family and to the British people.
The letter of condolence that I have sent to the Bigley family says that we all feel affected by this brutal murder.
We had previously called on the kidnappers to free Mr Bigley, but that call â like so many from every part of the world â was in vain.
Now all we can do is mourn his death and express our condolences to his family.
So, that letter has been sent.
I thank you for suggesting we should do so.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on the issue of human rights abuses in Colombia.
I have been approached by the FrontLine organisation, which is an international foundation for the protection of human rights defenders.
It concentrates on defending human rights defenders who engage in peaceful actions in relation to human rights in their country.
In February this year a number of trade unionists â members of a peasant farmers' association â were arrested.
They have not yet been charged and there is no evidence of any possible serious charges against them.
Up to 30 trade unionists have been assassinated in Colombia this year alone.
It is a situation which the European Union has addressed from time to time, but there is serious concern amongst human rights defenders, both in Colombia and in Europe, that the European Union is allowing this issue to slide off the agenda.
I shall forward to you the letter from the FrontLine organisation urging you to demand that the Colombian authorities release immediately the members of Fensuagro in the absence of any valid legal charges, and ensure that lawful trade union organisations can operate free from intimidation.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr De Rossa.
That will be done, in response to the issue you have raised.
Â Â  Mr President, the UK Environment Agency has revealed that in five months of this year 12 million cubic metres of raw sewage were discharged into the river Thames flowing through London.
This situation can only worsen with an increase in the violent storms caused by global warming.
These discharges have not only killed thousands of fish but also resulted in dangerous levels of E. coli and other harmful bacteria.
This is a European issue because such readings are far above EU bathing water limits and, incidentally, also a cross-border issue since Thames Water is German owned.
The British Government refuses to provide the GBP 1.5m needed to build an interceptor tunnel to stop these overflows.
As my colleague on the London Assembly has said, these figures are an absolute disgrace.
This situation is bad for the environment, prejudicial to human health and damaging to the image of the Thames.
I would ask colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to pursue this breach of EU law by the British Government and request that the Commission investigate it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe it is only right and proper that this Parliament should formally express its shock and outrage at the number of victims of the terrorist attack in Taba last week.
I believe we should send a message of solidarity and profound condolence to the families of the victims, amongst whom I should like to remember especially the two young Italian women, Jessica and Sabrina, whose only crime was to allow themselves a holiday that they had been really looking forward to after a yearâs work.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to remind the House that next week, from 17 to 24 October, is One World Week.
This is an opportunity for us all to take action and to do something about poverty and injustice in the world.
One practical way in which we can help is by buying Fair Trade products.
Parliament has started to buy Fair Trade products.
In Strasbourg we now receive Fair Trade tea, though in Brussels we still get Liptons tea.
Perhaps the Quaestors could take up this issue of why we are getting Fair Trade tea in one case but not in another, and consider what more we can do in this House with regard to buying Fair Trade produce.
It would set a good example to other public administrations.
I hope that you will support this initiative.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs McAvan, for your very pertinent reminder.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to mention a case in which the Treaties have been violated by several Member States.
The House must surely be aware that in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on Accession, one of the signatories to which was the European Union, Polish entrepreneurs have the right to provide services freely in all Member States.
This is one of the EUâs fundamental freedoms, which was not waived due to accession negotiations and which all Polish citizens could enjoy from day one of membership of the European Union.
The transitional periods imposed apply only to persons wishing to take up employment on the basis of a contract of employment, and not to persons providing services or taking up activities on a self-employed basis.
Yet in many Member States Polish service providers fulfilling orders placed by local customers, as well as persons wishing to open their own service establishments, have met with additional administrative requirements which make it difficult to take up such activities.
If necessary, I can give details of the countries where this is the case.
I therefore believe that the European Commission should be asked what measures it intends to take in order to examine these practices and to prevent actions such as these that violate the Treaties currently in force.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to bring an extremely serious event to Parliamentâs attention.
On Thursday, 7 October, the FBI, acting on federal orders, asked Rack Space, a US service provider, to hand over to them the hardware of two servers hosting all of Indymediaâs material, in other words the material from dozens of locations in this international network, which works with non-profit-making groups and associations.
All the material was handed over without Indymedia even being able to find out the reasons for this action, which was a real act of censorship.
I believe the European Parliament should always stand up for anyoneâs area of freedom of expression and debate.
I therefore call for the clampdown on Indymedia to be lifted and for the reasons behind it to be queried, at least.
Â Â  Mr President, my comments relate to the remarks made earlier on fair trade.
The European Union is about to introduce a reform of the sugar regime, which will have serious implications for European farmers and sugar workers if it goes ahead as planned.
However, there are wider issues here.
I have learned that in Brazil the handful of sugar barons who control the sugar industry are licking their lips in anticipation at our proposed reforms, whereas those who service that industry â the workers and the landless â are living in fear and trepidation of their situation worsening.
We must not facilitate that process.
I would urge that when we enter into the detailed negotiations on sugar we not only consider the economic and trade issues but also take on board the social and moral dimensions of our decisions.
Â Â  That concludes the speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the stocktaking of the Prodi Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not without some emotion that I stand before you for the last time as President of the European Commission.
In a few days, in fact, the road we have been travelling together for five years will come to an end.
These five years have been marked by major political and institutional changes and momentous events in Europe and around the world.
I should like to begin this meeting of ours by reminding you where the European Union stood in 1999.
On the institutional front, there were many who wanted to limit reform to the so-called âleftoversâ from Amsterdam and who proposed an institutional agenda that was limited in scope and certainly not up to the new challenges facing the Union.
In the unfavourable economic climate of the time, there was very strong concern, doubt and scepticism about the actual chances of bringing in the euro.
Just as strong were the uncertainties about when to carry out enlargement and the number of countries to include.
Many were pressing to limit enlargement to six countries at most.
No definite time frame or clear rules had been set out, and the press and public opinion voiced deep-seated fears.
Then there were the even greater threats of the Balkan situation looming over the whole continent, in the absence of a clear and convincing EU strategy in the region.
Lastly, the Commission itself was in crisis, shaken by the events of 1998 and 1999.
Its credibility and authority had fallen to their lowest ebb, and therefore it needed to restore its image by carrying out the first serious, comprehensive overhaul of its administrative structure.
Ladies and gentlemen, faced with this situation, we took up the challenge.
Working together with you, we put forward an ambitious agenda for Europe.
The kingpin of this agenda, the unifying element that drove our actions and gave them coherence, was enlargement.
The unification of Europe â involving the inclusion of ten new countries, a clear timetable for the other candidate countries and real prospects for the full integration of all the Balkan countries â is the greatest contribution that the European Union could make to the stabilisation and the political, economic and cultural growth of the continent as a whole.
To meet the challenge of enlargement, we had to strike the right balance.
We could not move too slowly and run the risk of losing the momentum for joining Europe that was very strong in the candidate countries.
We could not rush the process either, without ensuring that we had the support of the people in the Union.
We therefore watched over the reform processes under way in central and eastern Europe and gave them our firm support, and at the same time we took on board the concerns voiced by Europeans about the costs of enlargement, population movements, environmental risks, nuclear safety and corruption.
Public support in the new Member States exceeded all expectations, as shown by the success of the various referendums.
We have demonstrated that negotiation and dialogue, though at times difficult, complicated and painstaking, are the only democratic way to export democracy and stability.
At the same time, the ambitious enlargement of the Union to meet half the continentâs aspirations for freedom, security and democracy meant that we had to be equally ambitious in dealing with the overhaul of our institutional set-up.
Therefore, at first alone but later with the support of an ever-growing consensus, we pressed for reforms that would be equal to the demands of running a Europe of 25 or more Member States.
Thus we have been constantly involved in negotiations on institutional reform for the last five years, with the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Nice Conference, the initial rejection by the Irish of the new treaty and its consequences, the European Convention and the Constitutional Treaty.
Thanks to the joint efforts of Parliament and the Commission, the convention method has finally established itself, raising the levels of democracy and transparency in Europe.
Nonetheless, the scepticism surrounding this proposal, which I have supported ever since that night in Nice, was very deep.
Never have two views on Europe clashed so much as they did then.
On the one side a strong, political Europe, equal to the global challenges facing us, and on the other a weak Europe, seen merely as an area of prosperity, stability and regulation and not as a real political entity.
For the rest, Europe has changed considerably compared with the 1980s and 1990s, as have the various governmentsâ attitudes and policies on Europe, as well.
Over these years, alliances between governments have very often been pragmatic, one-off affairs, linked to specific proposals or the current domestic or international political situation; there have been no groupings of countries consistently pressing for closer integration.
We, for our part, have always fought to make our Union stronger, more democratic and more effective.
We put forward highly innovative proposals â for the EU Foreign Minister, for instance â both at the European Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference that followed.
Now we have reached the end of the story.
In a few daysâ time, the Constitutional Treaty will be signed in Rome. This will, without a doubt, be a highly significant event for Europe, bringing greater democracy, greater simplicity and greater transparency, although it does have other, less satisfactory aspects â the situations where unanimity is still needed, for instance.
This is a story to which we, and especially you, the Members of the European Parliament, have made a fundamental contribution.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken about enlargement, institutional reform and policies for growth and peace: none of that would have been possible if, while we were working on all those areas, we had not restored order, strength, prestige and pride to our own institution, the European Commission.
Indeed, there can be no change without comprehensive reform of the structures and apparatus of administration.
The first positive effects are now starting to be felt in several sectors, such as decentralised financial control or external aid programmes.
Above all, however, the reforms contained strong political messages and were designed to restore the Commissionâs legitimacy, independence and efficiency.
I need only mention the system for the rotation of the directors-general, after long years when certain directorates-general had regularly been allocated to officials of the same nationality; or the nationality rules for Commissioners and their staff; or, lastly, the decision to move the Commissioners closer to the departments they control.
More than anything else, however, there is one element that has characterised my Commission and of which I am particularly proud: its collegiality.
I have been able to rely on a close-knit, highly professional team, which has worked together in great harmony.
Some members of this Commission today hold top positions in their national governments and parliaments.
These too, I feel, are clear, tangible signs of the renewal and growth of the institution over which I have had the honour of presiding for more than five years.
I am also sure that the Commission will become even stronger under the presidency of JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, and I wish him every success.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of unifying our continent gives us a great opportunity to extend the stability and prosperity of the Union throughout the region surrounding it.
Therefore, we have not confined ourselves to pushing the divide, the âWallâ, a few hundred kilometres further east or south.
For years there was talk about the borders of Europe, but no working proposal was ever put forward.
We have now proposed a new vision for the Unionâs borders through our neighbourhood policy, which aims at setting up a genuine special relationship with the whole arc of countries from Russia to Morocco.
The European Constitution itself recognises the need â which we highlighted â to establish a new relationship between the Union and our neighbouring countries.
At a time when everybody is talking about a âclash of civilisationsâ â although I am convinced that it is mostly a âclash of ignoranceâ â we have given a great boost to intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding, particularly in the Euro-Mediterranean area.
On the subject of the Mediterranean, I remember well the fierce criticism I received when I wanted to open up to Colonel Gaddafiâs Libya.
Now, two days after the sanctions against Libya were lifted, that moment really seems a long time ago.
It has been just four years, but four years of discreet, constant, intense work that have enabled us to set important changes in motion in that country and have paved the way for Libya to be readmitted into the international community.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout these years we have always come out strongly and clearly in favour of multilateralism.
More world and regional governance, a closer partnership with the United Nations, and less disparity between North and South have been the goals inspiring our actions.
We have not merely âtalkedâ of multilateralism: we have put it into practice in order to achieve our goals and political options.
I shall mention just a few examples.
We have linked the objective of liberalising trade to the need to take greater account of the legitimate demands of civil society and developing countries. We have played a central role in enlarging the World Trade Organisation in order to encourage more effective world governance.
We have geared our cooperation and development and our humanitarian programmes above all towards the reduction of poverty. We have strengthened our links with other regions of the world, such as Latin America or Asia, and have assisted in new regional integration processes, such as the African Union.
Lastly, we have made a real contribution to strengthening the transatlantic relationship.
After the war in Iraq, many claimed that the gap between the two continents could no longer be bridged.
I have never believed that kind of idea, since I am certain that, in those areas where Europe has its own identity and is not paralysed by national vetoes, it can achieve significant results when working alongside Washington â and on equal terms.
We have therefore worked hard and effectively with our US partners on practical issues of great importance, both in the area of security and the fight against terrorism, and in certain parts of the world such as the Balkans.
I have said this before and I say it again: in this difficult, often tragic world, Europe â and Europe alone â has been able to export democracy.
In the economic field, the euro has without doubt been the star of our mandate.
From the outset, the euro was to be the cornerstone of the new Europe.
From the outset, therefore, we regarded the euro as a great political project and not just an economic one; a project for political leaders and not just central bankers; a project requiring vision, authority and coordination.
Throughout our mandate we have stressed the need for stronger economic governance, because the cost to Europe of not standing united in this area is still too high.
To this end, we have drawn up several proposals to adapt the Stability and Growth Pact to Europeâs new requirements and new economic reality, and we have finally opened up a debate that several players had called for but none had had the courage to begin.
I must admit I smiled when, after all the criticism about my stand, a well-known French daily wrote that the Commissionâs recent proposals had made the pact âsmarterâ.
Then we have consistently made our contributions to the Lisbon Strategy and put forward the various proposals needed to achieve our goal of making the Union the worldâs most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010.
To mention just a few examples, just think of the European Research Area, the emphasis placed on innovation in enterprises and on the information society, the new lifelong learning programmes in education and training, and the opening-up of our universities to the world.
The reform of the competition policy itself is one of our most significant contributions to improving our competitiveness.
In the social field, the Social Policy Agenda has been the frame of reference for a whole series of measures in the field of employment, social security, health and safety in the workplace, equal opportunities and social inclusion.
We have to be honest, however, and admit that many objectives in this field have not been met.
Above all, we have not achieved those objectives where we could not resort to the Community method and were held back by the need for unanimity.
One of the most telling examples is perhaps the difficulties we encountered with the Community patent, which was repeatedly blocked on linguistic grounds.
If the Member States do not learn to behave otherwise, the Lisbon strategy is at risk.
Then there are all the results we have achieved and the proposals we have put forward to set up the area of freedom, security and justice, to improve environmental protection, for the energy and transport sectors, and to strengthen health and consumer protection.
For example, there is the implementation of the Tampere agenda and the efforts made to respond to the new challenges of international terrorism after the attacks of 11 September 2001.
There is the Gothenburg sustainable development strategy, the Johannesburg Summit and Europeâs action to further the Kyoto Protocol, which now seems capable of producing its final results.
In these areas we have truly led the world and demonstrated in practical terms how Europeâs intervention can produce added value in a multilateral context.
We have combined strategic decisions of enormous significance for the future of Europe â such as the European satellite navigation system Galileo, or the global strategy for the âsingle European skyâ â with prompt reactions in emergency situations, such as the shipwrecks of the in 1999 and the in 2002.
At the beginning of our mandate there was another sector where it was essential to restore consumer confidence in the wake of the âmad cowâ crisis: the food sector.
We responded with the integrated âfarm-to-forkâ strategy, alongside measures such as the European Food Safety Agency.
The reform of the common agricultural policy itself is designed to respond to the new challenges on the domestic and world fronts, aiming at a more sustainable strategy that is more mindful of rural development.
Finally, we have put forward our political project â our vision â for post-enlargement Europe, with our proposals for the new Financial Perspective.
This is a political project designed to bring a genuine European citizenship into being, a project for a Union now continental in extent which must take on new responsibilities towards its people and shoulder its own responsibilities on the international stage.
This, too, has been our ambition: to make Europe a leading player on the world stage, to enable Europe to make its voice heard and work towards creating a world of peace, security and balanced development.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by mentioning one final point which, I believe, should be laid to the credit of this Commission and the European Parliament.
It is the drawing-up of the framework agreement between our two institutions for the whole duration of our terms of office.
The agreement has enhanced our shared initiatives, such as the practice of making it a priority to formally notify Parliament of the Commissionâs major initiatives.
These agreements have strengthened the political role between the Commission and the basis of its democratic legitimacy, which to a great extent lies in the European Parliament.
This is undeniably an advance in democracy which I value highly and for which I am grateful to you.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the deep understanding between Parliament and the Commission on legislative matters.
Conflicts between us can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
We should be delighted at that: it is one of the great merits of the codecision procedure and shows how well the three institutions involved have applied it.
At the end of these five years, then, I am pleased with the way constructive relations have developed between the Commission and Parliament.
I hope and believe that they will remain like that in future.
If that is the case, it will mean that the outgoing Commission has not only developed good relations with Parliament but has also laid the groundwork for democracy to grow even stronger in Europe.
Indeed, I am firmly convinced of the need to have even more Europe and even more âUnionâ in Europe.
We must commit fully to the European political project and take it forwards with strength, conviction and courage.
That is what we have done over these years, and I am truly grateful to you for the help and support that you have never failed to give us.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
Before giving the floor to the spokespeople of the political groups, I would like â on behalf of Parliament and on my own behalf â to thank you for your work at the head of the Commission, and point out that you took up your post at a particularly difficult time in the history of Europe, and that five years later â at the end of your mandate â Europe has undergone certain historic transformations.
Yes, they have been truly historic.
This is not rhetoric but is truly the right word to describe what has happened in Europe during your mandate.
The effective implementation of the euro, the effective implementation of Monetary Union â which has been dreamt of for so long and which has taken so much work to achieve â will bear the name of the âProdi Commissionâ.
The greatest enlargement of the European Union â which will surely never be repeated â has also been carried out under your Presidency.
This is one of the structural transformations of Europe that history will associate with your name and the Commission you have presided over, and also with your valuable and intense participation in the work on the Constitution, which will be subject to a referendum.
On the basis of these three issues alone, Mr Prodi, you are leaving the Presidency of the Commission with a fine record, with many achievements, political achievements, which have profoundly transformed the reality of Europe and enhanced its unity.
My predecessors have told me that you have always taken notice of the European Parliament, which has always found you to be a good listener.
Although we have perhaps not always followed your advice, the Members of this House have always at least valued your friendliness and your constant accessibility.
And, first and foremost, your commitment to Europe.
It was because of that commitment to Europe â which is widely recognised â that you became President of the Commission.
You can feel satisfied above all because, on leaving the Presidency, that commitment to Europe is even more widely recognised than before.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate, one that merits the presence of the Presidency of the Council, and one that also deserves to be attended by the entire Commission.
What I would like to see in future is the Commission as a whole being present in the plenary not only when it seeks our vote of confidence, but also when assessing results on which our future, too, depends.
So I would have liked today, to see both the Commission, and also the Council, fully represented.
This Commission, under Romano Prodiâs presidency, had â as is usual in human and political life â its light as well as its shadows.
In communication terms, we have a dual role; on the one hand, we are the Commissionâs allies, in that we defend the Community model, but we are also there to keep tabs on it, and we are determined to carry on doing so in future.
I agree with the outgoing President of the Commission when he says that the Interinstitutional Agreement has strengthened democracy and the parliamentary approach, and we see the new Commission, too, as being bound by what we have agreed with the Commission under Mr Prodi.
In one historic area â that of enlargement â we achieved great things together.
Our group was always a driving force behind membership for the countries of Central Europe, as well as Malta and Cyprus, and the fact that, as a result of the last elections to the European Parliament in June, Members from the ten new countries are able to take part in this debate in our House is something in which we can all take pride.
The outgoing President of the Commission used the term âintelligentâ with reference to something he once described as stupid, that being the Maastricht criteria.
This utterance, this comment, by Romano Prodi is something that we still do not regard as his finest hour.
We do, though, very much appreciate the work of the departing Commissioner who had responsibility for monetary matters â I do not want to name names, for if I did, I would be forced to do so in many other instances â and the way in which the former Commissioner defended the stability of Europeâs currency.
I hope that the new member of the Commission with responsibility for this, and indeed the new Commission as a whole, will defend the Stability Pact and Europeâs monetary stability.
We were not exactly satisfied with the proposals on chemicals policy, with which we will have to deal over the coming months and quite possibly for years to come.
Without wanting to go into detail, I would say that it is important that we enable this Europe of ours to compete rather than pursuing a policy that will end up with a de-industrialised Europe and the loss of jobs.
We need a sensible balance between ecology and economics, and the best social policy is about creating jobs and keeping the ones we have.
So it was perhaps a failing on the part both of this House and also, and in particular, of the Commission, that the targets we set as part of the Lisbon strategy were insufficiently ambitious and too diffuse.
When completing the internal market, we had definite goals and fixed dates, and what we should all learn from that for the future is that we, if we want to make Europe more competitive, have to set strategic goals, and also firm dates, so that Europe is better able to compete.
Farewells, of course, always involve some regrets, and so let me say to you, Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, that you know what high regard I have for you as a person, and it would be less than honest of me if I were not to mention today how I found it regrettable that you have, in recent months â one might say, in the last eighteen months or the last two years â given priority to domestic politics in Italy.
I would have preferred you to have focussed all your efforts on European politics and on your work as President of the Commission.
All in all, though, I would like us to take our leave of each other on a positive note.
I would like to thank you all, and if I were to single out one of you, it would be Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who, as Vice-President of the Commission, was responsible for relations with the European Parliament.
I would, however, like to thank all the members of the Commission for their commitment and wish them all the best.
In saying that, I am not directly referring to the personal political commitments of all of them, but, personally, I wish you all the best, and I shall take it as read that the Commission as a whole wanted to do its best for this Europe of ours as a community, and that is what we, Commission and Parliament together, must continue to do, so warm thanks and best wishes to you all.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of my group, I want to thank you for the work you, together with your whole Commission, have done for the European Union over the past five years.
Both the President of this House and Mr Poettering have already listed a number of milestones of your term of office.
You took office at a difficult time; relations between Parliament and the Commission were strained in the aftermath of the fall of the Commission headed by Jacques Santer.
You achieved , and did it by meeting Parliament halfway, by the way in which you in your personal conduct as President of the Commission, and also that of all your Commission, made apparent the respect that you, within the interinstitutional framework, had for this House as the representative body for Europeâs peoples.
For that we are grateful to you, for you have thereby set down a milestone in the history of the European Union.
Your successor will be measured by the standard you have set in your dealings with this House.
Anyone who wants, as President of the Commission, to enjoy the confidence of this House, cannot do less than Romano Prodi has done.
There is something else, Mr President of the Commission, of which you can be proud and for which we are grateful to you.
In a very difficult period for Europeâs European and international policy, you took up a position to which I want again to make reference.
Here, in this House, President Prodi declared that the use of arms must always and only be the policy of last resort, that recourse may be had to arms only when all the alternatives and all the policy instruments have been exhausted, and that the United Nations is the only forum in which such decisions may legitimately be taken.
He affirmed that the consequences of warfare would be disastrous and incalculable.
That was a visionary speech that you made that day.
As far as the âwrong warâ against Iraq is concerned, you, as President of the European Commission, came to the right conclusions, and that I say with gratitude on behalf of our group as a whole.
Reference has been made to the introduction of the euro.
Your campaign, and that by your Commissioners, for the Constitution â a campaign that is still going on, for it may be signed in Rome on 29 October, but this will not mean that it has been ratified â this campaign was a cause you stood up for.
When it came to enlargement, too, you and Commissioner Verheugen, whom I want to mention, worked in an exemplary manner.
I believe that, when things are weighed in the balance, Romano Prodi can look back with pride on a term of office, in which, as always, there were high and low points that we do not wish to gloss over.
We Socialists, too, have from time to time had cause to voice criticisms, and when I compare Mr Poetteringâs speech at the beginning of your term of office with the one he delivered today, the euphoria has ebbed away a bit over the five years, but that is a fact of political life.
Mr Prodi, you are now going back to Italy, and you have as yet taken no final decisions as to what you want to do there and actually will do there.
Let me tell you, though, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that, whatever you decide â and I hope you will make the right decision â the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is alongside you in that decision, not only in mind and heart, but also with political will.
Many, many thanks for the cooperation over the past five years.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prodi, five years and one month ago you addressed this house as President-designate of an untested Commission.
You told us that you wanted to put Europe at the service of the people of Europe.
Liberals and Democrats backed you then, and five exhausting years later, we back you now.
Liberals and Democrats believe that in the long view of the Prodi Commission certain things will stand out.
Your Commission launched the Lisbon Agenda and inaugurated the euro.
Your Commission began the work of internal reform.
It was the steward of Europe's enlargement from 15 to 25 states.
Your Commission moved Europe into the world of common European security against terror.
You inherited a Commission badly scarred by scandal.
You promised this House that you would put the Commission's house in order.
That work is not finished, but it has been courageously championed by Commissioner Kinnock and you leave behind you a Commission in which reform has a firm foothold.
As part of that process you have worked to make the Commission's relationship with this House open, productive and respectful.
Your successor will do well to do the same.
Your Commission inherited a Europe searching for the road to economic reform.
It leaves behind a Europe which found that road at Lisbon, however hesitantly we have stepped down it.
In the service of the Lisbon Agenda your Commission has been an engine of intelligent, inventive, reformist single market legislation.
Liberals and Democrats recognise and honour the exceptional personal stamp that Commissioner Bolkestein has placed on that work.
In particular, the launch of the euro â the single largest logistical operation in Europe in 60 years â was a practical and political triumph.
Liberals and Democrats believe that we have not gone far enough on the road to economic reform or achieved what we could have.
But if Europe is unlikely to achieve the Lisbon goals, the fault lies not with a Commission that failed to set the rules, but with Member States that too often failed to keep them.
The Lisbon Agenda has too often been subordinated to the Paris Agenda or the Berlin Agenda or the London Agenda.
Your Commission inherited the battered but hopeful Europe of 1989, still divided by a line from Trieste to Gdansk.
Today that line is gone, wiped away by an historic enlargement that this Commission has every right to take credit for.
We recognise your work, and the work of Commissioner Verheugen and the work of the hundreds of dedicated Commission staff who made the climb.
Mr Prodi, in my country politicians most often get into trouble in their brushes with the other sex!
I can think of two in your case: Penelope and Marta.
You quickly dropped the first, and I am delighted to see today that you have finally ditched the second.
It is the conviction of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the Prodi Commission has honoured the commitments it made to this House five years ago.
Some will use today the tired claim that you have been more interested in Italian politics than the stewardship of the European Commission.
But how can one review the achievements of this Commission and then insist that you had only one foot in Brussels.
It was said of the Emperor Augustus of Rome â another Italian with a European destiny â that he inherited a city of brick and left behind a city of marble.
Liberals and Democrats believe that handed a city of brick, your Commission leaves behind a bigger, better, wiser Europe.
I can sum it all up in one Italian word, Mr Prodi: !
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Prodi, over the past five years your relations with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been through good times and difficult times, as is normal, but allow me to say that, in the light of these weeksâ hearings, I am sure â or rather, I should say I fear â that many of us are going to miss your Commission, particularly some of its members, and this is certainly not good news for Europe or for us.
We acknowledge the fact that during the reform of the European Union and the work of the Convention, you and your Commission have been able to steer a straight course towards the strengthening and democratisation of the European Union, even amidst attacks not only on you personally, but also on the very existence of an autonomous and truly European institution such as yours.
I must say â and here I am in agreement with MrÂ Schultz â that your position on Iraq was also clear and that we agreed with it.
This, however, did not help to avoid the war because the European Union as a whole refused once again to speak with one voice and to organise itself in such a way as to be able to speak with one voice on issues of war and peace.
We also acknowledge the fact that your Commission was able to resist the pressures of those governments â which I can only describe as miserly and short-sighted â who think that they can make Europe progress while keeping its budget under 1%.
Let us hope, indeed, that your successor will be able to hold a firm line on this point.
Your Commission, as has already been said, is the Commission of the enlargement and in this connection we too recognise the enormous amount of work that has also been done in preparation for the next, future enlargements, particularly with regard to Turkey.
I will not, however, hide from you our disappointment at the failure to solve the Cyprus issue, regarding which we had long been asking for a firmer initiative from the Commission, which unfortunately was not forthcoming.
We have certainly welcomed your leadership and that of the majority of your Commission â not all, alas, and here I refer particularly to Commissioner de Palacio â on the issue of the Kyoto protocol and on climate change in general.
Naturally, we would very much have liked the Commission to have proposed a Stability Pact on climate change too, an honest-to-goodness plan, with clear figures and sanctions. This did not happen, but we hope to succeed in bringing this about in the future.
With regard to the Stability Pact, as you know and as you remember, we very strongly supported your description of it as stupid.
But there was no immediate initiative.
We agree and are fairly satisfied with the proposal which your Commission has put forward in this regard, but it has come too late, following a serious crisis within the European Union.
On at least three issues, however, we have found ourselves on opposing sides.
We regret this, and hope to convince not only you but also your successor.
The first issue on which there was serious conflict with our group was undoubtedly genetically modified organisms: it was an error to lift the moratorium and I believe that EU citizens are aware of this.
Then, in relation to the issue of energy and the environment, very little has been done with regard to stepping up the role of renewable energies, which over these last five years have remained a little like the Cinderella of the debate.
Finally, Mr President, the PNR affair.
In our view it was a grave error on the Commissionâs part to concentrate on a procedure which definitively and very clearly excluded Parliament from participation in an issue which affects citizensâ rights very closely.
Let us hope that we no longer have to deal with a Commission that believes that Parliament should not have a say on such matters.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President of the Commission, to evaluate in three minutes the work done over five years by the Commission is rather like trying to square the circle.
That is why I shall content myself with identifying a few salient features that, in our view, illustrate broad trends that have characterised, and still characterise, the action of the EUâs executive and the EU in general.
Let me be clear that I am not putting a question mark over individuals.
I am calling a policy into question.
Over and above the political and national divisions, the present Commission embraces some brilliant personalities, from MrÂ Lamy to MrÂ Patten.
It is the direction followed that is problematic.
The first example of this is the Lisbon agenda.
Four years after the adoption of what the European Council called a new strategic objective for the decade, where are we?
One of the proclaimed ambitions, I would point out, was to achieve full employment, whereas the figures of the Commission itself now indicate that, for the first time in ten years, we are destroying more jobs than we are creating.
The other ambition was to construct the worldâs most dynamic knowledge economy, whereas the Commission acknowledges a general decline in investment in key areas such as research, education and training.
One figure, quoted by the Commission, really makes one shudder: more than 17% of Europeâs 15 year-olds lack the minimum reading, writing and arithmetical skills required.
One might therefore have expected, at the very least, to see some initial questions asked and some tentative doubt raised as to the relevance of the headlong flight into liberalism of recent years, of which these failures might be the price.
No, the question is never asked.
During the crisis, the liberal wave rolls on and grows larger.
The second example is the 1999 Tampere programme, in particular European policy on asylum and migration.
Has what human rights militants called Fortress Europe led to satisfactory results in terms of the much-touted control of migration flows?
No, the repeated dramas along the Sicilian coast are testimony to the fact.
Is there, therefore, a resolve to tackle the problems from the other end, that is to say by bringing about a shift in the pitiless rules of the world economy in an attempt to curb, at source, these migrations motivated by the need to survive?
Emphatically, no.
Heedless of the ethical, humanitarian and legal problems, the Commission is launching pilot projects aimed at establishing detention centres on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, intended for refugees intercepted at sea.
What will be the next stage?
The last example is transatlantic relations.
In the wake of 9/11, the idea had taken root that our expression of solidarity with the American people did not have to mean a docile acceptance of its leadersâ ideas on international security.
âAllied but not alignedâ was the message.
That did not prevent the Commission from declaring to President Bush at the transatlantic summit of June 2003 â in other words, after the start of the war in Iraq â that when Europe and the United States are united, no enemy can stand up to us. The fact is, history has not since borne out that bold synopsis.
What public lesson has, however, been drawn from this turn of events?
Thereâs the rub, Mr President.
Alternative options are never discussed.
It is, as they say, business as usual.
It is time to breathe some spirit of criticism into our institutions, contradiction being an engine of progress.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, there is no getting away from the fact that the way in which the outgoing European Commission acted towards the EUâs new members was exceptionally unjust.
All of the previous EU enlargements were carried out in accordance with the principle that the same conditions which applied to the countries that were already part of the EU should apply to the new members.
This was the case not only for countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which had national incomes as low as that of Poland, but which had market economies and were thus in a position to take rapid advantage of EU mechanisms.
It was also the case for East Germany, which, like Poland, had to undergo political transformation.
From the day of its entry to the EU, the German Democratic Republic received agricultural subsidies equivalent to 100% of those paid to farmers in West Germany, as well as production limits that equalled consumption.
The conditions upon which Poland and the other Eastern Bloc countries were accepted were much worse, as well as being unjust.
This injustice will continue to serve as a calling card for the work of your Commission, MrÂ Prodi.
The EU monitors democracy in various countries outside the EU which do not have the slightest chance of ever joining it, and yet it lacked the courage to examine whether the referendums on EU accession were carried out in a democratic manner, and whether equal media time was available to both supporters and opponents of accession.
Unfortunately neither equality nor democracy were in evidence, and yet the EU preferred to ignore this fact.
This is another injustice that characterises the outgoing Commissionâs term of office, and there are further causes for dissatisfaction with the work carried out by the Commission under your presidency.
The draft Constitution was presented during this time, and the Commissionâs support for this draft means that the EU is fast heading towards becoming a single state.
There is talk of the principle of subsidiarity, but at the same time Member States are being deprived of competences in matters they could perfectly well regulate themselves.
Little by little, plans are being drawn up for the creation of an EU army, a single foreign policy, a common currency, common legislation and a common jurisdiction.
The Commission is gradually becoming a European government, and yet there is no consensus that this should happen.
Â Â  Mr President, at the start of your mandate we voted in favour in the hope that certain crucial knotty issues would be resolved.
Unfortunately, to date many of these are yet to be untangled.
The Commission, together with the Council, did not succeed in making the changeover to the euro less costly for citizens and until the other day the Generalised System of Preferences criteria had not yet been laid down, leaving open for years to come the problem of proper development and cooperation between Europe and poorer countries.
The Food Safety Authority of which we spoke at the start of your mandate has remained partially on paper, and the Council also has some responsibility for this: that is, it is not operational as we had promised.
Furthermore, measures to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings have been tackled in, let us say, a marginal way; the fight against terrorism has not been a real priority, despite the signs which even before 11 September were making it obvious that there was a need for stronger political and organisational action.
For instance, we were ignored every time we highlighted the need for regulation of information technology, at least for EU countries, with the result that today international terrorism has also become mass media terrorism.
In fact, it has learnt how to use the new technologies against us, whereas these should be used not only to pursue economic goals but also to disseminate the principles of freedom, democracy and human rights.
There are rules for the press, for television, for the print media, but not for the Internet, and this is an unresolved problem.
These are only a few of the deficiencies which have gone unremedied over these past years.
They have, of course, been years of great and positive innovation: from the euro to European reunification and the Constitutional Treaty, and we thank the Commission as a whole and you, Mr President, for having worked to achieve these goals.
Unfortunately, though, you have not been successful in giving Europe the change the citizens asked for, and that is more subsidiarity, less bureaucracy and more policy.
Moreover, as Italians we regret the fact, Mr President, that in recent times you have no longer remained above party politics while carrying out your duties, and have thus laid yourself open to criticism on many sides.
As the proceedings of this Chamber testify, we have on many occasions tried to support and defend the Commission against the criticism it received at the start of the mandate.
Now, however, we have been left high and dry because of your dual role, that of President of the Commission in Brussels and leader of the centre left in Italy.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I still remember my first meeting with MrÂ Prodi, the then Prime Minister of Italy, in Rome six years ago.
This meeting took place during an official visit by MrÂ Buzek, who was Prime Minister of Poland at the time and is now a Member of the European Parliament.
I accompanied MrÂ Buzek as Minister for European Affairs.
Even after so many years, I still have warm memories of your friendliness and openness towards my country, MrÂ Prodi, and would like to thank you for this.
You have presided over the European Commission during a historic period, which included the fifth and largest enlargement in the history of the EU.
You have made history and will go down in history.
Since enlargement the EU has become more European and more representative of our continent, and we hope that given time we will also be able to compete more effectively with America and Asia.
Yet your term of office was not only one of great change, but also one that raised a great many questions which your Portuguese successor will have to deal with.
You have left us with high levels of unemployment in the EU and the idea of a two-speed Europe, that is to say, of a superior and an inferior Europe.
Following in the footsteps of Jacques Delors is not an easy task, although following in those of JacquesÂ Santer is much easier, as his strides were not and are not giant ones.
In conclusion, however, today we are sitting in a Parliament that represents 25Â countries and not 15, and the credit for this is yours, MrÂ Prodi.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President of the Commission, it is almost an event to see you in this House, given the extent to which your repeated absences in 2004 have been noticed and have been felt as a sign of your lack of interest in our Parliament.
I fear that, when it comes to taking stock, the role you have played has not come up to our expectations.
Admittedly, a lot of Commissioners have done some excellent work, and we are sorry to see them go.
There have been many instances of progress in the field of security in all its forms.
We thank MrsÂ deÂ Palacio, whose courage we have appreciated; MrÂ Liikanen, who has succeeded in carrying a number of important issues forward; MrÂ Busquin, for his efforts on research; and MrÂ Barnier, who has offered us a new vision of the regional funds.
I must also mention the difficulties overcome by MrÂ Byrne in confronting the problems of food safety, and MrsÂ Reding and MrÂ Vitorino, whose skills we have appreciated.
That being said, MrÂ Prodi, where was the inspiration so eagerly awaited by MEPs?
Although you have successfully carried enlargement through, you have never clearly launched the debate on Europeâs borders and on migration flows.
You have lacked ambition in implementing the Lisbon strategy, in improving economic governance and in promoting policies in favour of young people.
Why, MrÂ Prodi, is the image of the European Commission deteriorating to such an extent in the eyes of our fellow citizens?
Here is one practical example: this morning, I learn that, in connection with the Geneva-Lyon-Bordeaux axis, your Commission, urged on by MrÂ Bolkestein, is being extremely and incomprehensibly rigid in requiring a second European call for tenders for completion of the remaining 50 kilometres at a time when a tender has already been accepted for the Lyon-Bordeaux axis.
Issuing a second European call for tenders, for the sake of 50 kilometres, is a waste of time and money. It is a technocratic decision that goes against common sense.
How am I to explain to my fellow citizens that this decision will be more expensive and that it will cause delay?
I know what they will say to me on the subject of Europe.
MrÂ Prodi, if the Commission acts in this way, no amount of communication strategies will prevent your and our efforts on the ground from being in vain.
If people are to believe in a strong Europe that is closer to the people, there is still everything to be done in this area.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, rather than being offended, you should be amazed â as I am â that there are those â like Mrs GrossetÃªte, who spoke before me â who, being unable to muster courage and a capacity for objectivity at this time, are obliged to be politically partisan.
I speak on behalf of my group and of many Members of this House when I confirm that you have indeed worked very closely and very well with this House.
The same can be said of the Vice-Presidents, Mrs de Palacio and MrÂ Kinnock and of all the members of this Commission.
A milestone has been reached, standards have been set, and so it shall remain.
I wonder, Mrs GrossetÃªte, whether the Barroso Commission will adhere to these standards.
Mr Barroso has not so far demonstrated that, whereas Mr Prodi has.
Secondly, and contrary to what some Members have said, enlargement and the Mediterranean policy prove you right, and in these areas too, we will have demands to make of Mr Barroso; we will be asking whether he can pursue these to the same extent and with the same care as did the Commission under Mr Prodi.
This leads me to mention dialogue with Islam.
As President of the Commission, Mr Prodi pointed out that, if we want greater security, it is not more weapons that we need, but willingness to engage in dialogue with our neighbours as part of the neighbourhood policy, and where did that originate?
It came from the Prodi Commission.
It was a major achievement, and we must not merely say thank you for it, but also follow it through in the future.
I would have liked more in the field of employment policy and also in many other areas, but here it was not the Commission, but the Council that was, regrettably, very cautious and hesitant, as President Prodi has already pointed out.
He it was who was the first to have the courage to say, in language that was perhaps rather provocative, that the Stability Pact as it had been applied was not very intelligent.
Proposals have now been made, and I am convinced that most of us will back them, as will most of the finance ministers.
As an economist, I say that every economic rule must be applied intelligently rather than dogmatically and bureaucratically.
I am sure that Professor Prodi was also the first to recognise that.
Let me say one thing in conclusion with reference to the subject currently under debate, something of which Mr Bourlanges, who is sitting here beside me, can speak with experience.
Contrary to what journalists would have us believe, what matters is not that a man or anyone should be shot down in flames for belonging to a particular government or following a particular political line.
What we Social Democrats and the majority in this House are doing is seeking to uphold the standards that this Commission has set in fundamental rights and freedoms and in non-discrimination.
To these we want a clear response.
The question will be, in the days to come, whether the Barroso Commission is able, particularly where fundamental rights and freedoms are concerned â the catalogue of which you were very actively involved in drawing up â to uphold these standards.
The role of women needs to be promoted more, and there must be no discrimination on the grounds of gender or of sexual orientation.
These standards, set by the Prodi Commission, are what it is all about.
Mr Barroso must demonstrate his ability to maintain them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President of the Commission, you are coming to the end of a term of office upon which you will have left the mark of your humane values and your high view of European integration, which we share.
I wish, in this House, to emphasise the quality of your track record.
You were given responsibility for launching the euro in coin of the realm.
It was an onerous responsibility, and you managed to carry it out successfully.
We were promised a shambles but, ever since the first day of January 2002, and thanks to skilful preparation, our fellow citizens have had no trouble making the single European currency their own.
Where the environment is concerned, it has been possible to accomplish major progress thanks to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, the Water Framework Directive and the directive on waste reduction and recycling.By preparing a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration and stepping up the fight against crime at Community level, progress has been made in promoting freedom of movement and establishment within the EU.
Measures have also been taken to promote the mobility of students, researchers and workers. All these advances show the degree to which you have been able to place European citizens at the heart of your concerns in order to assure them of a better environment.
You had to lead the difficult negotiations for enlargement of the EU, this great reunification of the European family.
In spite of pressure from the European Council, you managed to stay the course without flinching, so that welcoming the ten new states did not lead to the EU becoming paralysed.
At the institutional level, we cannot but be satisfied with the preparation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the necessary and courageous reform of the Commission.
Moreover, the positions you defended during the IGC have been taken into account in the draft European Constitution, which will, I hope, enable us in future to help this enlarged EU to thrive all the more.
In this regard, your budget proposals for the future constitute, moreover, a clear-sighted vision of our needs.
Mr President of the Commission, the principal objectives you presented to Parliament on 15Â February 2000 have been achieved.
Your actions have been fair and inspired.
On behalf of the European people that we represent in this House, I wish quite simply to thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, your Commission is rightly proud of its role in the enlargement of the European Union.
The European Free Alliance parties welcome our new neighbours and look forward to the day when our own countries â Scotland, Wales and Catalonia for example â can take their place at the top table as independent Member States.
Five years ago, Mr Prodi, you spoke at some length about the need for the European Union to reconnect with its citizens.
Until five years ago opinion polls showed there to be higher levels of public support for the EU in Scotland than in other parts of the UK.
However, that support differential has now been eroded.
One of the principal reasons for that is a policy that has been one of the European Unionâs biggest failures â the common fisheries policy.
Your Commission had the task of reforming the CFP.
You had an opportunity to give hope to Scotlandâs fishing communities, but instead you gave despair.
You could have taken up proposals from this Parliament to establish meaningful, devolved, regional management of fisheries, but instead you promoted toothless advisory councils.
The blame cannot be laid solely on the European Commission, as successive UK governments have repeatedly sacrificed Scotlandâs interests, but the final straw for my party â a pro-European party â was the illogical decision taken this year to include the CFP as one of only a handful of exclusive competences in the draft Constitution.
With that clause remaining, we will be voting against the Constitution in any referendum.
The Commission's end-of-term report, fisheries section, must therefore read 'failed'!
Â Â  Mr President, you know how over all these years we have kept up a constant and also radical criticism of the way in which this Europe of ours is being forged.
I say âoursâ because we are pro-Europe, like you.
For this reason, rather than just reiterating our criticisms, which are harsh, of the way in which your Commission has acted â criticism of which you are already aware â I will put to you a question on which we can reflect together: where does the European project stand in relation to globalisation?
Can we cherish the fond illusion of the excellence of a gradualistic process subordinate to this globalisation, without realising that globalisation is consuming the rights which matured in the welfare states of the twentieth century and is creating new global dynamics of injustice and disenfranchisement?
We are, in fact, seeing the return of war, spiralling terrorism, and workers being set against one another â attempts to do this are happening right now in the car industry.
In this picture, where is Europe?
Is not its very Constitution a step backwards when compared with a constitution like Italyâs, which is founded on work and the repudiation of war; is it not almost an acquiescence to the dictates of globalisation?
That is why for us Europe can hold out hopes for a different future only if it can be a real alternative, in contrast to what it has been up until now.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, as is right at a time of stocktaking, as well as being pleased with the progress made it is also worth highlighting those goals which have not been achieved, or have not been properly achieved, provided this is done in a way that will be constructive as far as the future is concerned.
First: the introduction of the euro has of course been an important achievement.
The Commission, however, could have done more to support the Member States in combating the resulting rise in prices and in helping businesses forced to square accounts with a euro that was too strong.
Secondly: the problems relating to enlargement are very far from solved.
The new countries complain of still being thought of as second-class, while the old ones will have to deal with a situation where there is less funding available and a workforce in the enlargement countries that is much cheaper than their own.
Finally, we must lament the fact that the reform of the Stability Pact, which has been considered an urgent matter since 2001, is still incomplete, particularly after the crisis following 11Â September.
As other Members have done, I would also like to remind you that in this Chamber, or rather in the Chamber of Strasbourg, it was Mr Prodi himself who correctly described the pact as stupid.
From the future Commission, we expect concrete and rapid answers to these problems, and we expect it to speed up Euro-bureaucracy as much as possible.
To conclude, it has truly saddened us, Mr Prodi, perhaps because in 1999 we too gave you our trust, to have seen you all too often playing a leading party role in Italian national politics.
I believe that on this point the only assessment that can be given is a negative one.
Â Â  Mr President, in actual fact, it is not really necessary to take stock of the activities of the current Prodi Commission, although much could be said about it. I think that we could easily fill a whole sitting with the Eurostat issue alone, for example.
However, that will be unnecessary because last week, the Prodi Commission pronounced what I regard as a damning final verdict about itself with its own advice about Turkeyâs possible accession to the European Union.
Indeed, in doing so, the Commission performed the ultimate anti-European act.
The EUâs previous enlargement to include countries of former eastern Europe is open to criticism as regards its timescale or some of the modalities involved, but nobody challenges the principle that those eastern European countries belong to the common European civilisation.
This favourable response to Turkey, however, a country that is not European, whether in geographical, political, cultural, historical or religious terms, is worse than a mistake. It is a crime against the true European idea.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I have re-read the President of the Commissionâs speech of February 2000 about the strategic objectives and the legislative programme, and right at the very end, Mr President of the Commission, you yourself gave a parameter against which you wanted to be measured at the end of your mandate.
You said that if the turnout at the 2004 European elections were to be higher than in 1999, you would have completed your task successfully.
Unfortunately, you yourself are aware of the outcome of those elections; you, too, know that 45.7% of the people voted.
That is not only exceptionally low, but, above all, is also 4% lower than in 1999.
Obviously, we do not wish to pass judgment in the old way, using one single criterion â certainly as an advocate of the Community method, I would definitely not venture to do anything like that â so I admit that many positive things have happened in each of the four areas for which you set strategic objectives, and for that I am indebted to you.
I would also like to thank all the Members of the Commission who have probably worked very hard for five years running.
If, however, I ask myself whether the Unionâs benefits are felt and understood by its citizens, if I see how people react to enlargement, if I see how the Commission and all other European institutions are, time and again, associated with fraud, if I conclude that the image of the European institutions has not improved â it is enough to look at the latest Eurobarometer surveys â then I have to say that the policy has certainly failed in one area, and that is building bridges with the public.
Is this something to do with the substance of the policy, or with the lack of contact and consultation with the representative civil society?
Is this attributable to a lack of professionalism in communicating, or is it a combination of the three?
I would like to find out from the President of the Commission how he himself deals with this, and whether he has any recommendations to make to his successor as to how to make a better job of it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prodi, after five difficult years during which headwinds and stormy seas have not been rare occurrences, the Prodi Commissionâs record has been marked by great progress and undeniably positive results.
I would like to begin with the historic transformation represented by the reunification of Europe, or a major part of Europe, after the Cold War years. A great triumph for democracy and stability.
Over and above individual achievements, which it would be all too easy to enumerate, I believe that the most politically significant aspect of the Prodi Commissionâs record is actually in the conception of the Commissionâs role: it has been seen not as a bureaucratic body, but as a political body, which has given impetus and vigour to the entire European process.
The dialogue and cooperation between Commission and Parliament have reinforced that political core itself, that driving force of the Union which, if one adopts a European and federalist vision, as I do, is the only approach which can truly turn Europe into a great supranational political power.
At times this may have annoyed certain national governments, but there is no doubt that it has represented a great step forward for the Union, and it has been put on an official footing for the first time in the new principles of the Constitutional Treaty.
Of course, Europe still has difficult challenges ahead in creating peace and security, in combating terrorism in a truly effective way, and not with war, and in restoring impetus to our societies and economies along the Lisbon lines.
But these are challenges that can be met only if we have stronger institutions, as you said, and a more united Europe, and this is the approach that the Prodi Commission has adopted in its patient and resolute work.
I would therefore like to see Parliament extend its thanks to you and all the Commissioners, as is indeed happening.
As far as I am concerned in particular â since five years ago I had the honour, together with Chancellor Schroeder, to put your name forward as Commission President at the Berlin European Council and as I also nominated Mario Monti â I would like to say to you, Romano, and to Mario Monti, that Italy feels honoured by the way in which you, in your European labours, have been a model of the best pro-European and democratic traditions of our country.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prodi, the last five years have been filled with changes and on some occasions with dramatic events: the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 11 September and international terrorism, which reached right to the heart of Europe with the Madrid massacre.
In the face of these challenges, the Member States have not always responded with one voice.
But the Commission under your command has firmly held its course in the direction of an ever greater and more unified Europe.
Indeed, no one can deny that you have achieved historic goals, which are certain to change for ever the conception of Europe and its role on the international stage.
Thanks to your actions, the Commission has regained impetus, respectability and authority.
The unification of Europe that has been achieved through the accession of ten new countries, the greatest enlargement ever seen in history, has healed the scars of fifty years of divisions and has been the political response to the end of the Cold War.
The introduction of the euro and its performance on the international markets has increased Europeâs economic stature worldwide and today these are fundamental ingredients for the strengthening of our continent in an era of economic interdependence and globalisation.
The neighbourhood policy has made it possible to stabilise the Balkans and Europeâs borders.
Finally, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is an historic step and for us represents a new starting point on the route towards the goal of political integration.
These objectives would not have been achieved without your leadership, your moral integrity and your dedication to the cause of the European Union.
Our group therefore thanks you for the vision and courage you have displayed over the last five years, laying the foundations for a Europe which is more united within and a leading player on the world stage.
If I had to sum it all up in two words, I would know exactly which ones to choose: âmission accomplishedâ
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, there is a consistent thread running through your work and that of the Commission: the desire for Europeâs political union.
We pursued this demanding objective together with you in having Italy join the euro.
Thanks to you, Mr Prodi, today we can say that the political union of Europe is closer, and for this very reason I do not believe it is worthwhile repeating the goals that have been achieved in the political and institutional spheres.
On the other hand, it is worth noting what we still lack in order to have peace as an objective and as a tool with which to resolve political conflicts throughout the world and to achieve true multipolarism as rapidly as possible, with a view to combating the clash between civilisations that is the fruit of preventive war and of terrorism.
A Europe of social and individual rights, work for all, a modern and efficient welfare state, a multiracial and multicultural society, where each personâs rights become the wealth of all.
Thank you, Mr Prodi, for what you have done.
We have been and will continue to be critical on many issues, we have had and will continue to have differing opinions, but we are and will continue to be united for the Europe of peace and progress which we would like to create.
In view of recent events, we are sure we will miss you.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin with some congratulatory remarks.
One of your key aims was successful enlargement of the European Union.
In May this year the EU welcomed ten new Member States in the largest expansion since its creation.
This was a historic moment in the post-Cold War history of our continent and it is only right to acknowledge your role in attaining this political milestone.
I also wish to say that the Commission has developed some, at least, of the more liberal economic strategies that your successor has now pledged to advance.
The Lisbon Strategy was embarked upon under your watch but, sadly, too little progress has been made and Mr Wim Kokâs report to the Council in November will probably reveal this.
However, the positive remarks about the Commission end there.
For the past five years the Commission has become fatally addicted to constitutional change.
When you spoke to Parliament in 2000, setting out your priorities as President, you said: âEuropeâs citizens are disenchanted and anxious.
They have lost faith in the European institutionsâ.
I am afraid that the intervening period has brought us the Constitutional Convention, the IGC and what may eventually be an EU Constitution.
It is clear from the turnout in this yearâs European elections that this process has failed to inspire.
Indeed, it has reinforced the perception across Europe that institutions like the Commission are too self-serving.
In that 2000 speech you also said that a simple benchmark of whether the EU had delivered would be a higher turnout in the 2004 European Parliamentary elections.
One of the key reasons for your goal not being reached has been this obsession with constitutional change, which means very little to our constituents.
At the same time â and it saddens me to say this, particularly as Vice-President Kinnock is sitting alongside you in the Chamber â too little progress has been made on the reform of the Commission.
I regret to say that all this was inevitable, because over the past 12 months the Commission has been rudderless.
I make no apology for saying that this is in large measure due to your decision to spend a significant amount of your time attacking MrÂ Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, and constructing alliances to challenge him.
These activities have undermined the impartiality of the office of the President of the Commission and have ensured that the Commission has come to be seen as something of a lame duck.
All presidents are entitled to their political opinions, but I regret to say that your political interventions have been âŠ
Â Â  MrÂ President, President of the Commission, I remember the state of mind that prevailed in this House five years ago when you assumed your responsibilities.
This Parliament was then in a rather paradoxical situation.
The problem was that it had for too long been too indulgent towards the institution to which it was closest, namely your own.
Because it had been too indulgent, Parliament had suddenly had to bang its fist on the table and almost censure your predecessor.
You arrived filled with a spirit of distrust of our institution because, ever since we had ceased to be indulgent and had banged our fists on the table, the Commission saw us as a threat and seemed to tremble whenever our institution took the slightest initiative.
For your part, the governing idea of your legislature was that you would be the government of Europe.
Since then, it seems to me that matters have righted themselves.
You have renewed the closeness that existed between our two institutions, and you have not become the government of Europe, with or without the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which our nations are now asked to consider.
You have presided over a college. I should like to salute the track records of a number of its members and, as you will not be surprised to hear, particularly of MrÂ Vitorino, MrÂ Lamy, MrÂ Verheugen, MrÂ Almunia and his predecessor, and MrÂ Busquin.
I believe that it is thanks to the energy of these Commissioners, and of a number of others, that the college over which you have presided has been able to achieve its, and your, present track record.
Next, I wish to commend one particular feature of your term of office: almost paradoxically, a sometimes too visionary form of perhaps unwarranted intelligence.
I refer to three of your experiments.
The first is the occasion on which you appointed a group of âwise menâ around MrÂ Dehaene who, intelligently enough, had proposed that our documents be divided into two parts and that our common policies be revised to reflect the majority opinion.
There were also the Sapir and Penelope reports.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate you for having presided over a Commission that has contributed so much to the political unification of Europe.
Under your Presidency the old question of whether Europe can 'widen' and 'deepen' at the same time, which is one that plagued most of your predecessors, has been answered decisively and positively.
I wonder, on the basis of your five years' experience at the head of the Executive, what your top tip would be for your successor as regards the conduct of relations with this Parliament?
I should like to end by wishing you personal success.
There has only been one former President of the Commission who succeeded in carrying on a political career after retiring from the Commission.
That was Roy Jenkins, who showed the British that Europe is so important to their national life that radical political change also had to take place inside his own country.
Â Â  Mr President, President of the Commission, over recent years Europe has taken many steps forward and some important goals have been achieved: reunification with the eastern countries, the birth of the euro, the signing of the first Constitution; these were achieved through the commitment of all the Unionâs institutions: Commission, Council and Parliament.
I have to be equally honest and say that other objectives which fall within the Commissionâs remit have been disregarded.
First, the Lisbon tasks have been trivialised, and the spring reports have often disappointed us; secondly, in industrial policy there has been a lack of activity in making proposals and planning; thirdly, with regard to legislative activity, the annual programmes have never topped 50%; fourthly, with regard to the reform of the Commission, there has been too much parachuting in from above to fill appointments.
To sum up, over these last five years there have been many shadows which have dimmed the good work done by so many Commissioners, starting with Mrs Loyola de Palacio.
For all that, Mr Prodi, your term of office had begun with the best possible omens.
Parliament had given you its almost unanimous approval.
Even we, your political opponents in Italy, had given you our vote of confidence for the sake of the greater interests of the European Union and of our country.
We wanted to show you that national polemics is one thing, but that the leadership of the European institutions is quite another.
Because of our great sense of responsibility, we have never withdrawn our support from you in this Chamber.
You, on the other hand, have preferred to use your prestigious post in order to carry out political activities in Italy directed against the government and to take on the leadership of the opposition.
We have been deeply saddened by this.
We would have preferred to see you adopt an attitude like that of Jacques Delors, who forsook the leadership of the commune of Clichy before taking on the presidency of the Commission.
That was an overt way of making it clear that leading the Commission cannot be combined with participating in national politics.
Â Â  âMr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, defending the Lisbon Strategy in economic and political terms, in difficult times, is a significant matter.
I would furthermore like to remind everyone of the reform of the telecommunications sector.
This is a huge legislative package which has raised our status once again, for example, as a legislator on the world stage, and in putting us in a position to compete once more with the United States.
Monopolies and duopolies have been dissolved to the benefit of consumers and users, which is important.
This has been a great achievement.
We have achieved just as much with regard to energy issues as well.
We are now acquiring and constructing Trans-European energy networks.
All of us understand how important this is for a reliable and consumer-friendly system.
We should be taking better care of those people who, as the barriers come down, remain on the wrong side of our internal borders.
It is a fact that intellectual and social barriers are becoming ever more rigid.
Enlargement is an important matter, and we are now reaping its benefits: equality and justice.
It should make these qualities visible outside Europe as well.
For this reason I would say that sexual discrimination on the part of the Commission, for example, is an intolerable idea, and this Parliament will not be able to co-exist with a Commission that acts in such a way.
Â Â  Mr President, taking my cue from the experience I have had in recent years at the head of a local authority in Italyâs Mezzogiorno, I would like to emphasise one of the elements of the Prodi Commission which has been undeniably positive: the constant attention paid to local authorities and above all to the regions, which, with Agenda 2000, have truly become the main players in European cohesion policy.
The outlying areas welcomed the working method based on a permanent dialogue with the regions and local authorities, a method which was confirmed by the Commission in its communication of December 2003 and also evidenced by the call to local authority representatives, under the title âA thousand debates for Europeâ on the subject of the Constitution, which you launched, Mr Prodi, together with Mr Cox, Parliamentâs former president, and the President of the Committee of the Regions.
Over these past years, with the White Paper on the new system of governance, the Commission has tackled the problem of the EU democratic deficit, relaunching the concept of grassroots democracy.
With EU policies it has helped the weakest European regions to create institutions to promote development and has introduced a culture of planning, assessment and assimilation of intervention.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Commission under Romano Prodiâs leadership is finishing its term.
It is true that during the term in office of this particular Commission the largest EU enlargement was carried out successfully and my homeland, Lithuania, became a fully-fledged member of the European Union.
It is most likely that in the near future the name of Romano Prodi will be in the textbooks of Lithuanian children.
Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments about one of the Commissionâs responsibilities: external relations, and especially the European neighbourhood policy, mentioned by Mr Prodi today.
This policy, which is of the greatest importance, seeks not just to extend the borders of the EU, but also to extend the area of peace and stability in Europe.
It is a fact that sometimes our neighbours are countries with a highly developed bureaucracy and controlled democracy.
Sometimes these are countries where human rights are undermined and violated every day, for example Belarus.
The European Parliament resolution on EU-Russia policy states that this policy is far from adequate: objectives are not clearly defined, there is a lack of internal coherence, interests and values are not effectively promoted.
If one looks at the figures on financial assistance for strengthening democracy in Belarus and guaranteeing civil and human rights, comparing the United States of America and the EU one might question whether Belarus is on the eastern border of the United States or the EU.
I would add Moldova to this list, given that so far there is no EU permanent representation in that country.
Only six EU Member States have embassies there, in comparison to the presence of EU representatives in many countries that are quite a distance from the EU and are not very important players at all.
I wish to finish by saying that I sincerely hope that the Lisbon Strategy, with all the high expectations placed in it, will not become an unfinished European project, as have some promising strategies in the past.
I wish the Members of the Commission well.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Prodi Commissionâs term of office will go down in history as the time of the largest and most crucial enlargement in the history of the EU.
This enlargement brought into the EU countries which were once divided from it by the Iron Curtain.
Yet although the enlargement itself was a success for theÂ Prodi Commission, it is hard to view the conditions upon which it was carried out as such.
The Commission imposed tough and unfair negotiating conditions on the candidate countries, and the process of achieving full membership rights and levelling out development differences will be a long one.
The firmly established division into an old EU and a new EU will cause problems for us all, and it is a pity that this historic opportunity was not exploited fully.
There was a lack of political imagination, and of a vision of a Europe fully committed to solidarity.
As a Polish MEP, I am concerned by the tenor of certain changes in agricultural policy.
Liberalisation and a departure from the previous protection of the EU agricultural market are a blow to European agriculture, and most of all to farmers in the new Member States.
Polish farmers must face up to competition which is doubly unfair. They have to compete on unfair terms both within the EU, as Poland receives significantly lower subsidies, and globally, as the EU is opening up to the global market on a massive scale.
Measures to fight global poverty must not be implemented at the cost of perpetuating or intensifying poverty within the EU.
The sugar market reforms proposed by the Commission will result in the bankruptcy of a large part of the European sugar industry, and could lead to utter disaster for farmers and producers in Poland.
As Polish members of the Peopleâs Party, we want nothing to do with such reforms and such a policy.
On the other hand, we very much welcome the Commissionâs refusal to give in to pressure to reduce the EU budget.
Such a reduction could rob enlargement of its economic sense, and eventually of its political sense also.
I would like to congratulate MrÂ Prodi on having accomplished his mission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have an historic enlargement behind us which is one of the reasons why we are now living in a Europe that is better than ever and better for our generation than for any previous generation.
For that, I think that the Commission and the Member States deserve both thanks and congratulations.
At the same time, it is a new Europe that is faced with new challenges, and it also has to be said that the present Commission has not been equally successful at dealing with many of those challenges, specifically when it comes to being able to rise above the temptations of national party politics.
If this cannot be done, there will be insufficient impetus for pressing ahead with the European project of unification.
We are concerned here with the ability to drive the Lisbon process forward.
We now face the challenge of ensuring that enlargement is successful in a real, and not just a formal, sense.
This demands a Lisbon process ensuring that all parts of the EU can become progressively more competitive and that the new Member States are given the opportunity to grow on their own terms, and not on someone elseâs.
It also makes demands of our ability to operate in an international context.
The European Union must have a credible policy for the Middle East, and that is why it is important for the EU to have the strength and ability to identify those threats to peace that exist.
The big threat to peace in the Middle East lies not with the small democracy there but with the big dictatorships.
It lies, in particular, with a country that openly supports terrorism, that has the open aim of destroying another country and that constantly shows the extent to which it is equipped with nuclear and medium-range weapons.
I believe that the European Union must also develop a policy for the Middle East that dares to get to grips with the problems that Iran now presents.
Â Â  Mr President, during the period when Mr Delors led the Commission, Europe witnessed the fall of communism, the restoration of democracy in the East, the emergence of new states, and, concomitantly, the initiation of the political process leading to the unification of Europe.
The presidency of Mr Santer saw the evolution of the process of bringing the candidate states into the greatest enlargement of the European Union in its history.
Mr President, under your presidency, after exacting negotiations and accommodations, the ten new Member States have become fully fledged members of the European Union with the expectation that this foundation will result in a truly united Europe, built not just by professional Europeans, but by its citizens, both men and women.
As I have, on various occasions and in different functions, had the opportunity to participate in this process on the Slovenian side, I am aware of just how much will, coordination, and mutual attention this project has demanded.
Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has followed the vision and the priorities that you set out from the very beginning of your presidency, and I am also pleased that your efforts have left a powerful impression on this unique period in the development of the European Union and on European history.
Please allow me, as leader of the Slovene delegation in the PPE-DE, to express my sincere gratitude for your contribution and particularly for the attention that you have shown towards Slovenia.
I would also like to thank you for emphasising, with your presence on 1 May 2004 at the celebration marking the enlargement of Europe on the Slovene-Italian border, the south-western edge of the former Iron Curtain, that the era of totalitarianism and a divided Europe was over.
Allow me, as a former member of the presidency of the European Convention, to express my recognition of the excellent contribution of the European Commission to the agreement reached on the European Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will be very brief because I have taken note of the remarks and advice addressed to me and it does not seem to me that it is necessary to give an analytical response now.
I have noted and digested what you have all said on industrial development, on the need for an economic upturn in Europe and on the fact that the rules which apply to industry ought not to act as a brake on this development.
The same applies to the suggestions concerning energy, the environment and the progress to be made.
Instead, I would like to conclude simply with a remark and with my thanks.
The remark is this: all your speeches â even those that contained criticisms or particular points of view â at bottom were conscious of the fact that the European model has a special character and that we have given the world a lesson in how to achieve progress using a method which is not only the traditional one of power politics, and to do so without being under any illusions, without believing that we are something we are not and without believing that the world is other than it is.
The priority that we give to multilateralism, our way of seeing the world as a single whole, for the first time ever in so many different realms â that of the environment, the economy, energy â and therefore trying to find working methods that are suited to this view: this is the extraordinary contribution that Europe is striving to give to the globalised world.
I have quite rightly heard criticism with regard to globalisation: but globalisation exists and is increasing.
The problem is to interpret it, and only the European method has done this so far.
Why?
Because we have given an example through the way in which we are uniting together and now, at the end of my mandate, I would like to repeat the true, unique, great definition of Europe, which I learnt when I went to the Romanian parliament for the first talks in the negotiations.
On that occasion I was told: âWe want to join Europe because Europe is a union of minorities; it is a union in which no one is the arbiter of the others, no one has power over the othersâ.
We are, truly, small and large countries gathered in this great, difficult balancing act, and this is a lesson for the world, a great lesson that we are giving.
Then there are obviously also failures, individual aspects, the difficulties inherent in translating these aspirations and feelings into everyday policy.
It is an effort, however, that is being increasingly understood.
In recent weeks I went to the countries of the Caucasus and saw the national flag flying next to the European flag, for no reason at all, if not for that feeling of being safe next to a great structure that has no colonial desires, no desires for domination or desires for supremacy: this is the lesson that we can give to the world.
This is what we have tried to do in the Commission, within limits and with shortcomings, naturally, but with an enormous sense of harmony.
In this Commission you have never perceived disputes or tensions; we have never acted spitefully towards each other.
Perhaps we too have been influenced by that European spirit of being a union of minorities in the Commission itself, and thus absorbing this lesson which, in my opinion, is the greatest legacy that we can give to all the worldâs citizens.
I would like to end with thanks for your cooperation, for your comprehension, and also for having tolerated some excesses and some choices with which you have not agreed, but whose spirit you have perhaps understood: in truth, if we do not have a strong and politically robust Parliament and a strong and politically robust Commission in the future, it will be difficult for us to achieve our objectives, objectives which â as I can see â we truly all share.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The policies promoted by the outgoing Commission had an adverse impact on the working classes and grass roots sections of society.
The militarisation of the ÎU proceeded at a fast pace and the EU participated in or tolerated imperialist wars, interested only in its share of the spoils.
Using 'terrorism' as a pretext, it reinforced and created new mechanisms to repress human rights and freedoms.
It adopted the US doctrine of 'preventive war'.
The Commission contributed to and promoted a deeply reactionary Constitutional Treaty, which will create new ordeals for the workers.
The ÎU took action to increase the power and profits of big business. The consequences are unbearable for the working classes and grass roots sections of society.
The 'miracle' of EMU signalled new austerity programmes and new programmes to reduce the purchasing power of grass-roots families, massacre the social and political rights which the working classes have fought for, keep unemployment high and cut social spending under the Stability Pact.
The implementation of the Lisbon strategy confirmed the objective of increasing the profitability of big business by reducing wage costs and creating conditions of insecurity and uncertainty for workers.
Mr Barroso has stated that he intends to continue at a fast pace with the same anti-grass roots policy.
The grass-roots movement in Europe is growing stronger and is putting up resistance.
This is where the people's hope lies for a Europe of peace and grass-roots rights, a socialist Europe.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, before discussing the subject now on the agenda, and since this is the first time I have appeared before this Parliament which was elected before the summer, I would like to repeat what I said five years ago â on the first occasion I appeared in Parliament: that I will assist and cooperate with this House in every way I can in relation to the issues that fall within my competence.
I would also like to wish all of you every success, and I hope that through the work of everybody, of all the institutions working together, we can realise the dream we all share: a better Europe at the service of the citizens and also a better Europe at the service of the world.
I regret, Mr President, that my first appearance before the honourable Members relates to an issue that has caused so much emotion, so much frustration and so much passion over recent years.
The issue of the Middle East has a place in the hearts of all the citizens of Europe and we feel the suffering of the peoples of that region that is so close to us as if it were our own.
In Luxembourg last Monday, the 11th, the Council of Ministers of the European Union analysed this issue in great depth â as the honourable Members are aware â and approved a Resolution that I am not going to repeat, because I hope, and I am sure, that all of you have read it.
