In a democracy, it is the electorate alone that decides who is represented in Parliament, and the parties must compete on an equal footing.
Particular parties cannot be given advantages according to whether they are organised on a local or supranational basis.
It is not for the majority in Parliament to correct the election results by forcing the entire electorate to contribute to the financing of five supranational EU parties.
It is incredible, moreover, that the Commission, as the guardian of legality, is able to submit such a clearly unlawful proposal, and it is inconceivable that Parliament should today adopt a proposal which, in accordance with current legal practice, can be declared unlawful by the EC Court of Justice.
I would call upon the groups to talk the matter through with Parliament' s own legal service and, at least, to defer the vote until the next session.
Mr President, I think yesterday' s episode and today' s represent another sombre period for our Parliament.
It really is a Parliament of charlatans that has spoken this morning.
I think the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will find the matter ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Dupuis, you too are part of this Parliament.
Please try to measure your words.
Mr President, for me our Parliament has been acting the clown.
I warn you, we are working on going to Luxembourg.
The reasoning given by Mr Ribeiro and other Members on the lack of any legal base is glaringly obvious in my opinion, and our Parliament has not wanted to see this.
The discrimination issue is just as glaringly obvious.
Then there are some other points: this report speaks of 'lasting' parties.
I would like to hear from you, ladies and gentlemen, what a 'lasting' party means.
There is a political judgment inherent in this report: the Bureau of Parliament will be called upon to decide whether a party is worthy or not of receiving funding.
That is a political judgment!
I have listened with interest to the Members, and without too many surprises.
Jules Maaten tells us so many fine things about where the funding for the parties is to come from.
However, what are political parties?
They are the expression, they should be the expression of civil society, and therefore either civil society, the citizens (nobody has said anything about the citizens) give money to the parties, and so the parties survive because they are the expression of civil society, or they are condemned to die, as quite rightly they should die if they do not represent anyone.
Nobody wants to talk about this.
That is incredible!
It is the bureaucratisation not just of Europe but also of our society.
They are parties that live outside society: an expression of this - read last month' s Eurobarometer - is the ever-increasing distance between you, your bureaucracies and the citizens.
You have invented a new tax for the citizens, which forces them to finance your bureaucracies.
This is intolerable; it is a measure against the citizens, and we will act with determination and take this to Luxembourg, because all of this is against Europe.
Mr BarÃ³n thinks that somebody here is against parties!
We are for parties that are alive, are expressions of society and not expressions of bureaucracies.
Mr President, yesterday Mr Poettering said that he was taking note of the decision made pursuant to Rule 143 Paragraph 1 as a democrat.
He wanted yesterday's majority to prove themselves to be democrats if the tables were turned.
I can assure him that we are behaving like democrats.
It is precisely democrats, however, who are deeply concerned about the Rules of Procedure being complied with.
If, in accordance with Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure, the inadmissibility - due to legal shortcomings - of a specific item on the agenda is once moved and agreed, then in my view there is no possibility of magically reinstating it on the agenda by means of Rule 111 Paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure.
Rule 111 Paragraph 2 provides, you see, that the agenda may not be amended, except in pursuance of Rule 143, amongst others, or on a proposal from the President.
That is an exclusive rule.
Since here the case in Rule 143 has occurred the second case does not apply.
This means, in other words, that today's debate, in my view, is at variance with the Rules of Procedure, which is why I do not wish to contribute any further to it.
I have one comment on the legal base: in COM document 2000/444 the Commission also proposed adding a legal base for the statute to Article 191.
This was in July 2000.
I cannot understand the assertion that this cannot have been discussed in the committee.
Madam President, firstly I will refer to Mr Dupuis' s speech.
He said that it is the people and civil society that should decide whether a party exists or disappears.
I was concerned to hear this from Mr Dupuis, because obviously it is a subject that he knows well, as his party has just disappeared from the Italian political map.
Going back to serious matters and serious speeches, I am the secretary-general of a European political party and moreover, I would like to stress, of a party that does not sit in the European Parliament.
It is the only party that has its own headquarters, a small house in Brussels that is separate from the European Parliament, and funding that for the most part (more than 70%) is not dependent on the parliamentary group but on the parties that are members of our political family.
I think that today is a great day for European construction, but I would go even further: today a big step is being taken in constructing a political Europe.
Because those of us who believe in a political Europe, and in my group we do, of course, believe in this, know that the parties are a fundamental part of a political union.
Political areas, such as the Member States, have parties that provide cohesion: France, Spain, Italy, Germany... all have national parties.
Europe needs parties that deal with and work in the whole of the Union, and this is what will give cohesion and coherence to the European Union.
I therefore think that this Regulation is a good one and is to be welcomed, for two reasons. Firstly and obviously, because it provides rules and transparency for the functioning and funding of these very important elements for the political future of the European Union.
Secondly, because of the role that these parties will play in the future.
Because, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a political union, a Europe of 23, 25, 27 or more Member States is going to be increasingly difficult to manage. It is going to be increasingly difficult to move forward and increasingly difficult to have common opinions.
The European parties are a new instrument that can provide coherence, which can act as the backbone of this political union that we desire, in order to achieve a consensus where it would otherwise be difficult.
I can imagine the different European political families meeting prior to the meetings of the European Council with 27 prime ministers and reaching consensuses that will enable the European Union to move forward with a firm step towards the future.
I do not think, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that we realise the importance of the step that we are taking today.
Madam President, this proposal will probably succeed as a transitional measure to regularise what is at present a flawed system of financing our fledgling political parties.
I agree, however, with some of the critics who say that the proposal in front of us will not provide a lasting statute for the development of campaigning political parties, which are an essential factor should our vibrant transnational European parliamentary democracy flourish.
We are proposing one amendment that will improve the proposal, which is to grant the political parties legal personality under European Union law.
To leave things as they are at present, with 15 competing national jurisdictions, will be a cause of confusion and future problems.
We should sort this out now and address the other outstanding issues more seriously and more successfully once the Treaty of Nice comes into force.
We also welcome the compromise amendment, which lowers the threshold for the registration of political parties from a third to a quarter, which is in the interest of both fairness and pluralism.
Madam President, first I wanted to return for a few seconds to what happened this morning.
My group is slightly concerned about procedural squabbles ruining this text, which is important to us.
We hope that the fact that there was a sort of forced passage this morning is not going to secure the future of this text because, for us, it is imperative to have transparent financing for these European political parties.
We are well aware of what those who reject this financing mechanism are waiting for.
They still prefer the system where suitcases of banknotes are handed over in the dark.
As things stand, it must be flatly stated that the report which has emerged from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is still not acceptable.
It does not really ensure transparency.
The democratic threshold for accessing the financing is far too high.
As for the type of financing, we are extremely disturbed to see that this text allows private companies to finance parties.
Everyone is perfectly well aware of what that means too: when a company finances a party, it is hoping for advantages in return.
That is called organised corruption.
We therefore hope - because there are now some very good compromise amendments on the table - that this transparency will be strengthened, and that, as my friend Andrew Duff has said, the democratic threshold will indeed be lowered, five right away, and a quarter of the Member States after Nice. Above all we hope private financing will be totally banned, because it is not our calling in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to organise corruption, even if done transparently.
I hereby announce that if private companies are allowed to use their money to buy political parties at European level, our group will not vote for this report at the end of the day.
The extent to which there are, or are not, to be European parties must be a matter for the peoples of Europe and, in a democratic society, this is not something in which Parliament or a Commission should get involved.
This is not, of course, about constructing European parties. It is about giving money to European parties, and that is quite a different matter.
As I understand it, the problem is that there is now a grey area and that some are opting for corruption and other curious methods of obtaining money for their activities.
In that case, however, we must demand that they clean up their acts.
We must demand transparency, and we must demand that the existing European parties scrupulously observe rules and laws instead of cheating their way around them.
Instead, a system is now being devised in which the parties themselves can put their fingers in the till.
Fewer and fewer people are joining political parties. In Germany, the figure is 3%, which is certainly a very good reflection of the situation in my own country.
No one joins European parties, and in that situation parties are opting to enrich themselves.
It is an enormous problem we are creating.
We are hugely deepening the gulf between ourselves and the people.
It will be difficult to face the electorate at the next parliamentary election.
We have just had a foretaste of what we can expect if the Regulation we are debating today were to be implemented.
We have seen how Parliament has voted down the minority groups in contravention of clear legal principles.
It stands to reason that Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure cannot be used as this majority has used it.
It is shameful that there has not been a single legal challenge arising from the fact that Parliament yesterday voted to throw out the matter and is today saying that it is of no significance.
The majority decides; the majority is always right; that is the attitude.
Once this Regulation has come into force, the major political parties will subsequently have some very serious problems, however.
They will have problems because it stands to reason that this Regulation cannot be implemented with Article 308 as its legal basis.
This is completely clear following the Court of Justice' s pronouncement of 28 March 1996.
Article 308 cannot be used to alter the Treaty, but that is what in reality is being done because the Treaty of Nice, which contains the necessary legal basis, has not come into force.
That is the practical situation, and I can assure all the representatives of parties which vote down the minority groups - those parties that decide here in this Chamber - that we shall do everything to contest this legal basis.
We shall take steps to bring the matter before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, and I can promise that there will be a political storm over the abuse of power of which this Regulation is an expression.
Madam President, the proposal for a regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties is both inappropriate for all the reasons I shall set out in my explanation of vote, and is also lacking a legal basis.
It is actually based on Article 308 (former Article 235) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but that cannot be used unless there is a Community power in existence first and no such power to act has been provided for.
The Court of Justice clearly established this, in its opinion of 28 March 1996 on the possibility of the Community becoming a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights using Article 308 as the basis.
It declared that the use of Article 308 in such a case was impossible, because no prior general Community power existed to define and modify fundamental rights.
Consequently, in Paragraph 30 of its opinion - which I shall quote in full - the Court concludes that 'That provision (Article 308), being an integral part of an institutional system based on the principle of conferred powers, cannot serve as a basis for widening the scope of Community powers beyond the general framework created by the provisions of the Treaty as a whole and, in particular, by those that define the tasks and the activities of the Community.
On any view, Article 235 cannot be used as a basis for the adoption of provisions whose effect would, in substance, be to amend the Treaty without following the procedure which it provides for that purpose.'
Today we find ourselves in precisely that scenario with the European political parties.
Article 191 of the Treaty mentions them, but that only has declaratory value, because it does not entrust any mission to the Community as regards those political parties.
Therefore that article can in no case serve as a point of departure for using Article 308, that is clear.
Lastly, I would add in conclusion that the reform planned in the Treaty of Nice, which seeks to create the absent legal basis, has not yet been ratified, and I hope it never will be, because it runs counter to the French constitution and the general principles of a free society, by which political parties must be free.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European statute on political parties, which we are debating today, is long overdue.
I should therefore like to thank the Commission for helping us, together with the European parties and the groups, to close this gap in European-level legislation in this parliamentary session.
The provisions being introduced here have been national law and have applied to the national parties in all the Member States for a long time, despite varying rules.
To all those who are now talking about parties I do have to say that each of us is sitting here because he was the candidate of a political party at national level.
We are after all living in a multi-party democracy.
Parties are not an end in themselves.
They are an essential part of a functioning democracy and constitute a link between citizens, the groups and the public in the opinion-forming and decision-making process.
In approving the Regulation that we are discussing today, we are making a contribution towards strengthening European democracy, intensifying the opinion-forming process and the debate within Europe and making the national parties more European.
The Regulation helps to increase transparency in respect of the funding of political work, create greater clarity, and separate group and party work, something which the European People's Party - my friend Alejandro Agag has spoken about this - has been working hard to achieve for some time already, harder than the other parties.
In addition it contributes to guaranteeing the right of the European Court of Auditors to monitor the affairs of the European parties.
This Regulation is, however, also a basic prerequisite for a debate which we need to have on common electoral law and on common rules governing incompatibility for Members of Parliament in the different countries, and a prerequisite for the debate on the possibility of European parties standing in European parliamentary elections.
It contributes to making the post-Nice process more democratic.
We, the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, want more transparency and we want to strengthen the people's Europe, instead of having more closed doors - read the Council - and secretariats.
We are in favour of the right to have recourse to legal action, enshrining the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a qualitative pre-condition for parties, European parties having legal personality and putting an end to cross-financing.
Madam President, this Parliament certainly lacks neither imagination nor brutality when it comes to consolidating, underpinning and protecting the closed circuit system it christens 'democracy' . Here we are, faced with another of its innovations
Mrs Schleicher, good authors would say your text was about teratogenesis, that is, the production of monsters, a discipline in which the good Dr Frankenstein distinguished himself before you.
That is what it amounts to when we are presented with a proposal to create European political parties out of nothing, and the very expression is absurd. They are not parties - they are not competing for the expression of universal suffrage which remains national in context - nor is this a matter of politics, because the only reason for this text is to let the large parliamentary groups get round a decision of the European Court of Auditors, and the whole thing is only European in the sense that it is not African or Asian.
In reality, Mrs Schleicher, the pompous name of European political party disguises a trick as old as the hills, the great lottery for the benefit of the lottery organisers or, if you prefer, a comfortable pension granted to the parliamentary groups most docile towards the institutions this Parliament is actually either responsible for controlling - like the Commission - or supposed to share decision-making power with - the Council: a pension granted by those institutions themselves.
The real name for that is misappropriation of public funds.
Madam President, I feel rather like the great Blondin, just before he started out on his tightrope walk across the Niagara Falls.
I have to say that my group and my delegation are opposed in principle to the regulation or financing of political parties at a European level.
We, like others in this Chamber, have deep concerns that the proposed funding for European political parties has no legal base.
It follows from this that we cannot favour a legal provision for state funding of political parties at European level.
State funding of European political parties is quite different, therefore, to state funding of political groups within the European Parliament.
In the UK, short money, as it is known, is provided for the support of opposition parties' leadership in their parliamentary activities.
Our view also is that the Schleicher report does not follow the principles of the Nice Declaration.
Article 191 of the Declaration states: "The provisions on the funding for political parties shall apply on the same basis for all these political forces represented in the European Parliament."
The Schleicher report quite clearly discriminates against some of the smaller parties and groups.
Finally, as Commissioner Patten said: "This regulation is mistaken in principle, unworkable in practice and discriminatory in effect."
However, I wish to thank all the colleagues who understand that, like Europe, our group and our delegation do thrive on its differences.
Nevertheless, for the reasons stated, that is why I and my British colleagues will be opposing this premature report.
In conclusion, my late grandfather, Harold Macmillan, always held the view that Members of Parliament should not be paid, because when they were paid it attracted the wrong sort of chap.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are firmly convinced that Article 191 of the Treaty establishes an important principle.
I quote: "Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union.
They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union."
If this is the case and if the European parties are also to play the role assigned to them, then they need, in an open and transparent way, to be put on a sound and legitimate footing and to receive the necessary resources to do their work.
This, in essence, is the reasoning behind the proposal for a regulation on the financing of European political parties which we are debating today.
Firstly, warm thanks go to Mrs Schleicher for her excellent work.
In addition, on behalf of the Commission I should also like to thank those involved from the other committees for their proposed amendments, in particular Mr Marinho from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and Mr Costa Neves from the Committee on Budgets.
At this stage I should also like briefly once again to address the issue of the legal base for the proposal and, particularly with regard to yesterday's debate, emphasise once more that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has obviously checked very carefully what the legal base is and can be.
Article 191, as it stands in the Treaty of Maastricht, is merely declarative in nature and does not contain a specific provision which would make it possible to adopt the requisite legislation.
We understood the urgent appeal which was made to us last year in the wake of the Court of Auditors' report which criticised current practices, namely to find ways and means to establish a sound legal base.
As you know, we opted for a twin-track approach.
The first track, which led to success in Nice, was to incorporate a specific provision in Article 191 to make it possible in the future for a legal act on the financing of European political parties to be adopted by a qualified majority under the codecision procedure.
At the same time, we proposed interim rules on the basis of Article 308.
This is a sound legal base for this proposal.
We received a boost here from the political signal sent out in Nice at the highest political level.
We are pleased that this Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee also supports the concept of interim rules on the basis of Article 308.
In its proposal the Commission tried to adhere to two principles.
Firstly, when defining European parties we wanted to leave room for manoeuvre and make it possible for the concept to evolve.
At the same time, however, we wanted to put in place minimum democratic standards and minimum requirements for European representativeness and guarantee a maximum degree of transparency in respect of financing.
On the definition of European parties, allow me to say quite clearly that European parties in no way have to toe a particular European political line, but the values of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights must be respected.
As the amendments originally submitted to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed, people's views on how precisely the funding principles should be implemented can diverge widely.
The Commission has tried to reach a consensus and find a happy medium.
I wish to comment on the most important amendments before the House.
We share the view that there should be a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We also share the view that European political parties ought to have legal personality.
Furthermore, we welcome the idea of greater transparency and having a high degree of transparency where private donations to parties are concerned, which means disclosure of these donations.
We also think that the amendments which would allow Parliament to make facilities available to parties in return for a fee merit discussion.
Nevertheless, we do need to guarantee of course that this does not once again lead to covert party financing.
The right rules need to be found for this.
On the issue of representativeness, that is the question of the number of Member States in which parties need to be represented in parliaments or have achieved a certain degree of success in elections, we believe that our proposed requirements are balanced and we stand by them.
Allow me to add that the Commission made a conscious decision to have an absolute figure rather than a relative figure - so not one third or one quarter - after a lengthy discussion, because precisely because of the enlargement process this would obviously raise the question of what happens if you have different figures in one parliamentary term during the enlargement process.
Would an adjustment have to be made each time?
What does a quarter mean in respect of a figure of 21 or 23 Member States?
This would mean that extra rules would constantly have to be dreamt up.
For this reason we explicitly propose the figure five.
We thought that a procedure which was independent of Parliament for settling disputes concerning compliance with the conditions in Article 1, that is compliance with the criteria for European parties, was the most expedient.
However, this is an issue for political judgment where we can defer to Parliament's position, and we could therefore accept Amendment No 13.
We cannot accept Amendment No 22 on the period of validity of the Regulation.
We have particular legal or constitutional difficulties with two amendments: firstly with Amendment No 16, which would prohibit donations from publicly owned enterprises.
Quite apart from the difficulties of identifying these, in the light of Article 295 we think it is difficult to justify a ban of this kind at European level from a legal point of view.
Secondly, the Commission has considerable difficulties with Amendment No 21 on penalties.
We can accept the second sentence, "Monies wrongly received must be refunded."
I would point out, however, that this is simply reiterating normal budget rules.
Obviously we have no objections to the principles mentioned in the first sentence, but the procedure is out of all proportion.
Funds are granted by the Commission in accordance with the usual rules.
Article 274 offers neither the Council nor Parliament the opportunity to intervene in the budget's penal system.
The expression, "appropriate financial penalties" , which is contained in the amendment, is too imprecise and would raise legal problems.
Regarding the amendments adopted in the committee, the Commission can accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5 (first sentence), 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17 (in part), 18, 19, 20 and 21 (in part).
As far as the amendments tabled directly in Parliament are concerned, the Commission could also accept Amendments Nos 23, 31, 32, 34, 37, 56, 58 and 62.
Amendments Nos 33, 46 and 57, which concern the same issue, do - as I have said - merit discussion.
However, I would refer once again to the associated risks.
Perhaps I could make one brief comment on the period of validity. The Commission has proposed that the Regulation should expire at the end of the second financial year following its entry into force.
Why this temporary status?
I would once again point out that this is of course also about taking advantage of the experience which we gain over the two years in the next regulation.
Party financing is a politically sensitive issue.
It is precisely for this reason that it is important for us to discuss it and legislate on it with transparency and openness.
The Commission hopes that we will very soon have transparent legislation of this kind. It is in the democratic interest.
It is in the interests of democracy and in the interests of democracy in the Community.
Thank you for the very full information you have been kind enough to give us, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
EUROJUST
The next item is the report (A5-0153/2001) by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic, the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to adopting a Council decision setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious organised crime (10357/2000 - C5-0396/2000 - 2000/0817(CNS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we Members think of the Council of the European Union we are by no means always filled with a deep sense of happiness.
It is not only the lack of good will; difficulties with the subject matter and different priorities also sometimes make working with the Council rather a trial.
All the more reason then for me to be glad today as rapporteur that everything has gone smoothly with Eurojust.
We have acted in concert and made good progress in the fight against serious cross-border crime.
I should like to express my thanks for this, in a personal capacity and on behalf of Parliament, but especially on behalf of the people who live in the European Union.
If Eurojust starts work at the beginning of 2002 and supersedes the provisional unit to combat serious forms of organised cross-border crime, the public will have reason to be glad.
This is because Europe will then have moved considerably closer to being an area of freedom, security and justice.
The public also expect this of us, and I am convinced that they even have a right to it.
That is why I should like to thank warmly colleagues in the committee who have helped to improve the Council initiative and make it more tangible.
By so doing we want to create a judicial coordination unit which is as effective as possible and which works closely with the institutional partners, such as Europol, and the European Judicial Network.
I would ask Parliament to vote in favour of the amendments and additions to the Council proposal which are necessary to achieve this.
Allow me to give just a few examples from the Eurojust proposal where the hand of the European Parliament is visible.
Firstly, the extended and clear-cut list of Eurojust's areas of competence is very important.
It incorporates the essential features of my ideal of a European public prosecutor and goes far beyond the minimal concept occasionally put forward, which is based on the belief that it is quite sufficient to protect the financial interests of the European Union.
From the public's point of view if we had adopted this minimal concept we would definitely not have gone far enough.
We need to vigorously tackle all forms of crime which the people of Europe, not without reason, fear today.
The fight must target cross-border fraud, corruption and crimes against the financial interests of the European Community just as much as computer crime.
Money launderers must feel just as vulnerable as polluters.
Of course Eurojust's general responsibilities must also include all of the other forms of crime and offences in respect of which Europol, as a police authority, is competent to act, including such dreadful crimes as trafficking in human beings or terrorist acts, which we have to read about every day in the newspaper.
Secondly, we have added a recital on data protection.
In my view this was also absolutely essential because the rule of law does not cease to apply in the fight against international and organised crime.
This means that Eurojust must also submit to strict rules on data protection when pursuing all of its investigative activities.
When collecting, processing and using personal data the international rules of the Council of Europe and the individual rules of the Member States apply equally in each case.
Rules on data protection must also be observed unreservedly when personal data are exchanged.
Thirdly, we want to ensure that Eurojust is able to work as flexibly as it possibly can.
This is a fundamental prerequisite for success.
Direct and uncomplicated contact between those involved is particularly important.
That is why we have deleted the national correspondents from the proposal and removed anything which might foster the growth of bureaucratic hurdles.
In conclusion, allow me to say that the Belgian government has announced that it wishes to complete the preparations for the definitive Eurojust unit during its presidency.
With this undertaking and the agreement of Parliament on my report - which I earnestly request - Europe is striking a powerful blow against international crime.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half years have passed since the Tampere Council decided to set up Eurojust as a European coordination unit for criminal prosecution authorities and public prosecutors.
This is a relatively short period of time if you compare progress in other areas of European policy.
In Parliament we have been very positive towards this rapid progress and have taken an active interest in it.
After Europol, the creation of Eurojust is a further important step towards combating organised cross-border crime in Europe more effectively.
The first step in the judicial area, namely setting up the European Judicial Network, has already been a success.
With the help of this network, for example, the public prosecutor in the German town of Celle was, within the space of a few hours, able to deploy an undercover detective from Belgian customs and, together with public prosecutors from another country, carry out an observation operation in a third country, again within the space of a few hours.
Thus many an opportunity to give mutual assistance - which was supposed forgotten - has been made to bear fruit.
Problems remained, however, for example with interpreting conventions on mutual assistance, criminal law and criminal proceedings and with the division of responsibilities.
To compound matters there were communication problems because of the natural language barriers.
With Eurojust these obstacles should now be surmounted.
Eurojust has, first and foremost, a clearing function.
The officials are to draft comparisons of laws, resolve bilateral disputes over the application and interpretation of conventions on mutual assistance, set priorities for fighting crime in Europe and monitor current transnational criminal prosecution measures.
In the future, Eurojust will also have to keep lists of transnational investigations and be in a position to pass on this information; it will have to act as a registration point for information on serious offences and plan, coordinate and run training and development programmes.
Through Eurojust, the national prosecution authorities will have access to reliable legal advice - without encountering language difficulties - and will be able to resolve transnational disputes.
I should like to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, for drafting Parliament's opinion, which is now to be put to the vote, and for the good level of cooperation.
Alongside her amendments, there is one further amendment in particular to which I attach great importance.
Until now, the judicial network has been a body without a head.
If we are now setting up Eurojust to be the missing head then we are also obliged to provide shared nerve fibres, without which body and head will not function together.
Eurojust and the European Judicial Network should not stand alongside each other or only enter loosely into contact with each other; they need to be bound together in one unit.
This can be achieved by using the already existing contact points of the European Judicial Network instead of the proposed national correspondents for Eurojust.
Only in this way can a superfluous juxtaposition of two systems with the same area of responsibility be avoided in the long term.
This is one of the ideas which our proposals contain.
I should like to ask the Council to take account of these in its considerations.
Then Eurojust really will be a success and make a contribution to the people of Europe living in greater security.
Madam President, the construction of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice is making steady progress and growing day by day, although rather more slowly than some of us would like.
Today we are discussing two important segments of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The more important is precisely the creation of Eurojust, which has already been started off with the setting up of the provisional unit, which has prepared the ground for the definitive body.
The European Parliament will, I hope, approve the excellent report by Mrs Gebhardt and hence the proposed amendments intended to strengthen the role and effectiveness of Eurojust.
They do in fact indicate its duties and the scope of its competencies in a broad enough way to avoid difficulties and uncertainties in its actions and thus to be able to better ensure the security of the citizens. They set out better the guarantees that fundamental rights will be respected, especially with regard to the right to a defence and the confidentiality of personal data, and not least they ensure the autonomy and independence of the body, as behoves its nature as a judicial body.
More effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a crucial element of the area of freedom, security and justice in order to face the challenge of crime in an area of free movement.
However, in order to establish this cooperation in concrete form, the complexity of the procedures makes me hope yet again that in the next Treaty on the Union this matter too will finally become a Community matter, on a par with civil judicial cooperation, by means of the communitisation of the third pillar.
Madam President, history will show that decisions to set up networks are more important than many other decisions we take.
That also applies, for example, to the network of consumer ombudsmen.
We see that we can all cooperate.
We shall bring about practical results.
As previous speakers have pointed out, it is important that the rules relating to personal protection are respected.
I also want, however, to highlight an idea which Mr Watson has presented, namely that similar cooperation should be organised for those who have been accused and require a defence, so that everyone is operating on a level playing field.
Our group fully supports the view that environmental crimes should be added to those crimes that are to be covered by this proposal.
Unfortunately, we know that deliberate oil emissions are a significantly greater source of pollution than accidents.
It is extremely rare for prosecutors to deal with these crimes.
We therefore need Eurojust for cooperation in connection, for example, with my cherished Baltic.
Our group has tabled Amendment 28 because we have to respect the different ways in which preliminary investigations are organised.
In certain countries, such as my own, the prosecuting authority is, in part, dissociated from the preliminary investigation.
That must be respected, as it also was in the Tampere conclusions, which are the basis for our decision and discussion today.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the continual increase in organised crime, the European Union has stepped up its initiatives to reinforce the fight against criminal organisations and improve cooperation between investigating and prosecuting authorities.
The Tampere Summit provided new perspectives for this cooperation between police and judiciary, long regarded as the poor relation of European unification.
Eurojust, made up of public prosecutors, magistrates and police liaison officers, has become the object of everyone' s attention.
How, though, can we envisage effective operation of a unit which could become the future European public prosecutor' s office without prior harmonisation of Member States' legislation and a basic rapprochement of their procedures?
The purpose, for the Member States, is surely to achieve the highest possible standards, at the same time providing sufficient procedural guarantees and effective justice for all citizens, while respecting human rights, including the right to a defence.
Yet, we have to recognise that today we are dealing with a body which is not subject to any European Parliament control.
More serious still is the lack of all jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in accordance with Article 35 of the Treaty.
Another point to bear in mind concerns the processing of the data that the unit is responsible for.
Eurojust will also have the task of collating information from police records, police reports and Member States' registers.
This gives rise to a few questions.
What protection will be provided for this information?
Who can access and use it?
What right of reply and defence, indeed of correction of incorrect or out-of-date data is there?
That is the purpose of my amendments, on which our support for this report will depend.
It is true, the European Union needs a supranational judicial structure to coordinate and enhance public action across the whole of European Union territory.
The stakes are as high as they can be.
That presupposes a willingness to implement a common crime policy which will go hand in hand with a minimum of national sovereignty being abandoned, whether the Member States want it or not.
Eurojust is about giving Europol a real judicial partner.
Its whole effectiveness will depend on the complementarity of the added value that the unit will be capable of bringing to the other players in the judicial and police worlds.
So, what use is it to establish supranational structures?
Why ensure complex coordination between different countries to centralise an investigation if the judge in charge of the case does not have the resources to complete his investigation or secure conviction of the people charged?
To sum up, rather than having an endless epilogue on the possible powers of a real European party, surely it would be better to make a real decision on a structure which would distinguish itself by its rapidity, effectiveness, and availability to the citizens of Europe while giving them full guarantees.
Mr President, the report considers that creating this overly centralised and authoritarian structure called Eurojust will give added value.
This is an institution with public prosecutors and judges from the Member States with the widest independent powers to prosecute and conduct investigations into so-called 'serious cross-border crimes' , not that these crimes are described anywhere.
It is an institution which will be able to circumvent national authorities in order to react instantly, which will be able to pluck a case from one Member State and give it - one wonders on the basis of what criteria - to another Member State.
The right hand of Eurojust will be the Schengen system and Europol, which is promoted to the status of institutional partner.
Provision is also made for the European judicial network to be maintained, while Eurojust will create its own database, that is, there will be four networks with sensitive personal data for the criminal records, four means of filing information on citizens and anyone who enters the portal of the authoritarian fortress called the European Union.
The much-vaunted operational independence of the justice system, which civil democracy was so proud of, has been sidelined.
Eurojust and the future European public prosecutor are the finishing touches to a suffocatingly centralised, unaccountable, nightmarish structure for each and every citizen and, more importantly, for the grass-roots movement.
As we watch the European Union march towards unification, we note the trend towards full liberalisation of the market on the one hand, that is, the complete unaccountability of the monopolies in their quest for profit, and the authoritarian centralisation of institutions, the growing militarism of the European Union and suppression, on the other.
The people of the European Union must reverse this march and they will.
This is clear from events in my country, where the grass-roots movement and democratic powers in general have rallied and are resolutely opposing the new authoritarian and anti-democratic law on demonstrations which the government is currently trying to push through the Greek parliament.
Madam President, for too long the European Union has had its hands tied when it comes to fighting organised crime.
In approving the setting-up of Eurojust, I believe we would be adding a new weapon to take on Europe's criminal organisations.
Organised crime in Europe has been at least ten steps ahead of us, taking advantage of weaknesses in our legal and economic systems.
These criminals are experts in exploiting legal provisions and jurisdictions and they have taken full advantage of our open market.
The European Union must no longer be a soft touch for serious crime.
Traditional enforcement measures are no longer enough.
National prevention measures must be complemented, where necessary, by appropriate action at Community level.
This initiative specifies that it should include trafficking in human beings, and I wish to insist that this should also include the smuggling of illegal immigrants, prostitution rings and the sexual exploitation of children.
In addition, we are talking about competence for dealing with acts of terrorism, protection of the euro, computer crime and protection of financial interests of the EU.
It also extends to the laundering of proceeds of crime.
Today in Brussels the EU Forum on Organised Crime is holding its first meeting.
The Commission must keep us and the public informed of the results of such meetings.
Let us make it a general rule that all relevant EU policies will incorporate a crime prevention element.
Let us make it known that the EU programme against social exclusion can be matched by the crime prevention strategy.
Let us make it known that the Regional Fund can contribute to the national programmes, supporting initiatives to fight and prevent crime.
Let us make it known that the Community's cooperation and assistance policies and programmes already extensively incorporate the fight against crime.
Let us ensure that all new legislation is crime-proof and existing legislation is evaluated.
Our group will be supporting this report.
Madam President, first I would like to congratulate you in that position, and assure you that, as usual, I will be speaking on behalf of the radical Members of the Technical Group of Independent Members.
My friends and I have studied the issue of Eurojust in depth and frankly it deserves to be called 'Euro Saint-Just' instead, in view of the way this matter has come before us.
I am told Saint-Just was a good lawyer too.
Eurojust raises many questions, so I am glad Commissioner Vitorino is here.
Nice clearly rejected the principle of an independent public prosecutor.
The countries do not want it, for all sorts of reasons.
A prosecution system cannot be developed without at the same time developing a defence system, a data protection system, and a rights guarantee system.
A bureaucracy will be created which will try to ask governments for criminal proceedings, when criminal proceedings are reserved for the judiciary.
The rules on that vary from one country to another.
In our country criminal proceedings are obligatory, but that is not the case in others.
These are complex matters which, in my opinion, are not going to be improved by this 'Euro Saint-Just' which seems to me to be a bit like holding the inquisition at European level, if we do not build a parallel system of control and legality.
Furthermore, Commissioner, it makes me wonder when I think of the circumstances in which some countries have nominated their representatives - my country, for instance, which nominated Mr Caselli, in violation of rules laid down by the judiciary itself.
It makes me wonder when my country sends you the procurator of Palermo, who brought charges against Mr Andreotti, Mr Muzotto and Mr Contrada, who has tried five cases on the basis of the revelations of penitents, and who lost five cases out of five - the people he charged were acquitted in court.
I wonder where we will end up if these methods are exported to Europe.
For pity' s sake, let us reject this 'Euro Saint-Just' .
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, international organised crime accounts for 10% of world trade, and a large proportion of it is in the European Union.
If the statistics are correct, developments in the crime sector are extremely alarming because in the European Union 30% of crime is already classified as international organised crime.
In the light of this trend we have to ask ourselves whether the border-free European Union is actually taking advantage of all the opportunities it has to take action against this organised crime.
Where police cooperation is concerned we can say that substantial progress has been made.
We have Europol, and Europol is working extremely successfully to fight crime.
In the field of judicial cooperation, however, we must unfortunately note that here cooperation is still in its infancy.
With Eurojust we now have a new instrument which will become operational in 2002 and will represent decisive progress in cooperation between the judicial authorities.
In principle, then, Eurojust works like Europol.
It coordinates the criminal prosecution authorities in the fight against organised crime.
What we must hope is that cooperation with existing units, with the judicial network and with Europol, works and that duplicate investigations are avoided.
I would congratulate the rapporteur.
There is only one point on which I disagree with her.
She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat.
As an Austrian, who also knows that the enlargement of the European Union is at hand - and welcomes it - and that Vienna is moving closer to the heart of the European Union, I would make a counter-proposal and propose not Luxembourg but Vienna as the seat of this authority.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives adopted within the framework of the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice have made this major political objective of the Union one of the most dynamic vectors for the broadening and deepening of European integration.
As regards the area of freedom, security and justice, the creation of a Eurojust unit in the field is certainly a most promising leap forward.
Eurojust is facing and trying to find an answer to one of the most serious, pressing threats to the rule of law: transnational organised crime, which is estimated to be worth a frightening amount in the world economy and, of necessity, in the European economy too.
The nation states have shown abundant signs that the legal mechanisms they have are insufficient to tackle organised crime in a satisfactory way.
Here, then, the European Union will have exceptional scope for affirming the principle of subsidiarity, for Eurojust is the democracies' necessary, indispensable response to the scourge of organised crime. Such crime has accompanied the growing interdependence of economies and technological developments, exploiting the weaknesses in national legal systems which turn their backs on each other, impotent victims of an anachronistic pretension to self-sufficiency.
Eurojust and the inevitable European public prosecution service of the future confirm that European integration is a necessity for citizenship, a tangible response to tangible problems affecting the ordinary citizen.
It is on the success of all the concerted action at judicial and police level that the future confidence of societies in their democratic institutions will largely depend.
Eurojust will help preserve the effectiveness and prestige of these institutions and will render a great service to the rule of law.
Information, cooperation and joint coordination measures are the key to a new push forward in the fight against money laundering, the trafficking of human beings, environmental crimes, forgery and other serious offences.
The proposed college is an innovative instrument essential to the pursuit of these objectives.
However, for the rule of law to be strengthened as we would like with the creation of this important instrument of judicial cooperation, it is important that procedural guarantees, so important in domestic law, should also be worked into the operation of the Eurojust system so that the fundamental rights that these guarantees aim to preserve do not end up being diminished.
In conclusion, I congratulate the rapporteur on the thoroughness and quality of her report and, in particular, on the sense of balance which inspired the proposed amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, a word of congratulation to Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent work and also to Mr von Boettcher, who was the PPE-DE shadow rapporteur.
We are aware of the enormous proportions that organised and cross-border crime has reached, requiring swift, common and concerted action particularly in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, child pornography, the trafficking of people, forgery of the euro, computer crime and money laundering.
On the subject of Eurojust, I have four things to say: first, we should be pleased to be making progress in this matter.
When the European Parliament gave its opinion on the provisional unit in November last year, we made a clear recommendation that the creation of this unit should not be a pretext for undesirably delaying the setting-up of Eurojust.
Secondly, we are taking one more step towards the creation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.
The Tampere decisions are moving ahead, making their way.
Step by step, we are constructing a citizens' Europe, with the Commission scoreboard, respecting the role of Parliament and with an initiative shared between the Commission and the Member States.
Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino knows full well, however, that we have found more to our taste in his initiative than we have at times in the Member States' initiative, as regards its coherence and comprehensive view.
Thirdly, we are honouring the values of our civilisation, the principles of the rule of law: in Commissioner Vitorino' s fortunate expression, Eurojust is the judicial counterpart of Europol.
Eurojust is to operate with appreciable independent status.
Its annual report is to be placed not only before the Council but also before the Commission and Parliament.
Fourthly and lastly, data protection.
Parliament has already drawn attention to this issue: Eurojust will have to cooperate with Europol, with the European judicial network, with OLAF and with the Schengen information system, in addition to benefiting from crime information supplied by the Member States.
It is particularly important to find a solution that is balanced between guaranteeing and safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms, on the one hand, and the instruments needed to fight crime on the other.
It is also always worth emphasising, when talking about the Community institutions, that we must make every effort to avoid any duplication of tasks or conflict of competencies.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be extremely brief so as not to delay voting time.
The Commission shares the overall view that Mrs Gebhardt presents regarding the Eurojust report and would like to congratulate her on the excellent job she has done.
Above all, we stress the importance of finding suitable solutions for the relationship between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network, which has made a very important contribution to the development of judicial cooperation at European level, as well as defining the conditions under which the Commission itself and Europol can be associated with the work of Eurojust.
At this stage, the Eurojust unit has no powers to take operational decisions or to promote investigations as such or to take cases to court.
Obviously, however, the natural course of evolution for Eurojust will be to arrive at this higher stage of judicial cooperation.
Hence the importance of the ideas set out by Mrs Gebhardt, which the Commission recognises, regarding guarantees of a defence for the accused, the rules on data protection and global issues of safeguarding citizens' fundamental rights.
We all believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important guide in the adoption of these solutions.
We agree with the suggestions made by Mrs Gebhardt, but there is just one point upon which I should like to express a reservation. One has to be very careful when defining the competence of Eurojust with regard to crime affecting the protection of the financial interests of the Communities.
We feel it would be preferable to speak of competence in matters of economic and financial crime.
One of the most sensitive questions is the relationship between Eurojust and OLAF.
OLAF has competencies within the first pillar; Eurojust falls within the specific intergovernmental context of the third pillar; therefore we feel it would be best to avoid giving the idea that Eurojust always has to be involved in cases where OLAF takes the initiative to safeguard the protection of the Community' s financial interests.
Thus, we feel it is very important to specify their different scopes.
Finally, Madam President, with regard to the imaginative and creative figure of speech used by Mr Dell' Alba, who called Eurojust 'Euro Saint Just' , I have to say that, for my part, I believe Eurojust is not an instrument of justice for saints: it is an instrument of justice for human beings.
Aware of the difficulties, and even some risks, I say that, like any human endeavour, it is imperfect.
It is not a holy office; on the contrary, it is a first step towards guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights and fighting crime at European level.
Not perfect, but an essential first step.
That is why I hope the House will support Mrs Gebhardt' s report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Thank you very much Madam President.
As you know, I was in the Chair yesterday when the Turkish demonstrators broke into the Chamber.
It is not my intention in any way to delay the votes or to re-open the debate we had this morning, but I think it appropriate to place on record my thanks to the ushers for their very efficient and prompt handling of the situation.
I think their professionalism in the situation deserves much credit.
Thank you for that statement, Mr Martin, which we are very pleased to note.
I ask for your permission to take up a minute of Parliament' s time to remind you that seven Portuguese citizens are still being held captive in the enclave of Cabinda, a territory situated to the north of Angola and incorporated into that African country.
They are citizens who were working in Cabinda for Portuguese companies and were therefore totally uninvolved in the independence conflict which has been going on there for decades.
Madam President, two of these hostages have been held for practically a year, I repeat, a year in captivity, and the other five for more than two months!
The little news that reaches us indicates that the Angolan authorities are currently placing enormous military pressure on the territory and, in a parallel move, recently ordered the expulsion of all foreign journalists.
We therefore do not know what is happening there, and there is a total lack of impartial witnesses in the field.
Naturally we fear for the safety or even the lives of the hostages.
The seriousness of the matter led me to write to the Council myself recently, to ask Mr Javier Solana to intervene.
He would certainly have the opportunity to create favourable conditions for our compatriots to be set free, the primary objective of this speech.
As I asked in my letter, Madam President - I ask you to make every effort within your competencies and to exert all possible diplomatic pressure on the kidnappers and the Angolan authorities so as to create a situation in which the seven hostages can be set free.
Mr QueirÃ³, we have understood your message very well.
For my part, I am going to see what I can do to throw light on that situation which is indeed absolutely tragic.
However, it is 12.20 p.m. and we have an enormous amount of votes.
All the same, we have certainly heard your message.
VOTE
Madam President, I realised just now that this question, which was set aside by the vote in this House yesterday, pursuant to Rule 143, and removed from the agenda by a motion of inadmissibility, had been reintroduced pursuant to Rule 111(2).
Now Rule 111(2), explicitly states that the agenda can be altered by application of Rule 143, which has taken place, or on a proposal from the President, in other words you, Madam President. The word 'or' , however, clearly denotes, in law, an alternative.
In other words, if the agenda was altered by application of Rule 143, it cannot be altered again, quite obviously, by a proposal from the President.
That is the reason why I have the strongest reservations about the legality of the vote which is about to take place, with many Members prevented from taking part in the debate.
I think the Court of Justice should rule on this matter and I have no doubt that once again, Madam President, it will, sadly, reveal your rather light approach to your responsibilities.
Before the vote on Amendment No 12:
Madam President, I would ask, pursuant to Rule 130 Paragraph 3 of the Rules of Procedure, that of the three amendments on the table the committee's amendment be put to the vote first: a split vote has been requested here and I would ask that this request be taken into account.
Please put Amendment No 12 to the vote first and then the others.
After the vote on Amendment No 54:
Madam President, I should like to ask you to put Amendment No 63 to the vote first.
It is a compromise amendment from the PSE, Liberal and Green Groups.
A new situation has arisen.
Now the parties are only required to be represented in a quarter of the Member States.
It would be more logical to put this to the vote first and only then the Commission proposal.
Before the vote on Amendment No 46:
Madam President, may I suggest to you that the adoption of Amendment No 46, does not mean Amendment No 47 falls. In my group' s view, it constitutes a wholly useful complement and is in no way opposed to the wording of Article 46.
Madam President, I have checked the documents again and established that we already voted on the issue addressed in Amendment No 28 when we voted on Amendment No 7.
For that reason this amendment is redundant.
I would imagine that we will be able to discuss the quite specific problem which is the subject of this amendment with the Council at a later stage.

Thank you, Madam President, I just wanted to say, in accordance with the customs of this House and the recommendations of the Quaestors, that, in line with the legal position expressed just now, my colleagues and I would not be participating in the final vote of the Schleicher report.
There, that was very simple, that was nothing much, and I will add just one small comment. Madam President, do not be afraid of us, do not be afraid to give us the floor, we will only take it to refer to the rules and conform to the customs of this House.
All in all, we are not nearly as nasty as people say we are.
Mr Gollnisch, I note that it is also an explanation of vote, really.
So you are quite entitled to present it now.
Thank you, Madam President, for giving me the floor after suggesting that the audience leave the Chamber.
I want to make a comment, invoking the Rules, on the way you personally have been presiding over the sittings for two days now, on the Schleicher report, on the vote on Strasbourg yesterday, when you caught us on the hop as you very well know, and on the way you decide who to call, for example, refusing the floor just now to the excellent Mr Gollnisch.
I challenge the way you carry out your role as President and I would inform you that we, I and some of my colleagues, will be sending you an open letter on the matter, for which we shall be ensuring wide publication in the French press.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Fine, I do not think I need to respond to those remarks.
I am delighted that you are planning a letter, and I shall make it a duty and a pleasure to answer it point by point, Mr CoÃ»teaux, particularly about catching you on the hop for the vote yesterday.
I think everyone can testify that the way that vote took place was perfectly objective.
It is not my fault if you were not at the sitting at the time of the vote.
I do apologise!
Mrs Doyle presented a procedural motion, and we waited some time.
I can understand your being embarrassed, Mr CoÃ»teaux.
This is all rather stupid, really!
Of course I understand your embarrassment as a Frenchman, but that is not my business.
I am the President of the European Parliament.
I do entirely understand your embarrassment, Mr CoÃ»teaux, believe me.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Figueiredo report (A5-0155/2001)
Madam President, the document by Mrs Figueiredo is very important.
Combating and overcoming poverty in Europe is certainly a goal that nobody in the world has yet managed to achieve.
Will Europe succeed?
I really hope so, for the sake of all the poor people in Europe, among whom there are unfortunately many pensioners.
If we succeed, then it will be said that in Europe there are three fairy godmothers for the poorest citizens: the President of Parliament, Nicole Fontaine, who represents us all; Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou, who proposed this programme; and Mrs Ilda Figueiredo, who has carried it through to completion.
Mrs Ilda Figueiredo's report on the programme to combat social exclusion deserves our support.
In fact, cooperation must be encouraged in order to make it possible for the European Union and the Member States to fight against social exclusion and to eradicate poverty - social realities still unfortunately deeply affecting some Member States, such as my own, Portugal - in accordance with qualitative and quantitative targets to be agreed by the Council and Parliament.
The Commission is to provide Parliament and the Council with information on the progress made within this programme annually.
Encouraging dialogue with our partners in this area at European, national and regional levels so as to combat poverty and social exclusion more effectively, and maximising financial support for innovative projects with a European added value are determining factors for its success.
In order to give full practical effect to the programme, providing for field inspections, the involvement of those suffering from social exclusion and poverty and funding for operations carried out by NGOs, it is essential to raise the reference amount to 100 million euro, including technical and administrative expenditure.
Core funding for key European networks involved in these actions should also be considered.
The preparation of an annual Round Table Conference of the European Union on social exclusion, organised in close collaboration with the Presidency of the Council of the Union and in consultation with all the actors concerned, is another essential initiative.
Finally, I should like to alert you to the insufficiency of the NGO financial control mechanisms, which will require closer supervision to ensure the strict and judicious application of public funds.
The European Commission' s proposal, which is the subject of the report we have discussed today, aims to establish a programme of Community action to support and encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion.
The aim of this programme is to encourage the Member States to combine their efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe in a framework of open coordination.
To be more effective, this coordination must be based on national action plans to combat exclusion, with guidelines established at European level.
The European Parliament examined this text at first reading in November last year under the French Presidency, which promoted a number of social affairs initiatives and was intent on making the fight against poverty a priority on the European social agenda.
The Council' s common position fully or partially incorporates 25 of the 47 amendments adopted by Parliament during the sitting of 16 November 2000, while the Commission accepted 31 amendments.
To my great regret, the Council has rejected some of the most important amendments.
It has rejected the reference to the revised Social Charter (1996) of the Council of Europe, to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must now be added.
It does not want to retain the 90% funding for the activities to be carried out by the NGOs under the programme to combat poverty and social exclusion, bearing in mind that the same level of support has already been approved for the programme to combat discrimination.
The funding of the programme also represents a stumbling block.
Believing that resources on a par with ambition are needed, the European Parliament hoped to increase the budgetary envelope from EUR 70 million to EUR 100 million, but in vain!
Just as questionable is the refusal to involve the European Parliament explicitly in the monitoring of the programme.
I have naturally voted in favour of the amendments seeking to reinstate the provisions which were not endorsed by the Council and/or the Commission.
Indeed, I think the programme ought to be as determined as possible.
It should be an instrument for promoting equality of opportunity amongst all men and women, and send a strong political signal from the European Union.
Just because our statistics for growth and employment are satisfactory overall, that is no reason to forget that far too many people still live on the margins of society.
The main focus of this report relates to supporting greater cooperation between the fifteen Member States of the European Union to combat social exclusion.
I believe it is very important that we all work together in a spirit of cooperation so as to ensure that the problems of social exclusion are solved within our community.
In this regard I fully welcome the setting up of the new Social Protection Committee which is included as one of the changes within the Treaty of Nice.
A Programme of Community Action to combat social exclusion must be fully supported.
The European Union is economically strong, but there are still key social problems in many rural and urban areas.
The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment is quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union.
It is in fact concentrated in many specific blackspots.
Putting in place initiatives to solve social exclusion and to give opportunities for the disadvantaged in our society must be a central policy of any government within the E.U.
The principle underpinning this new Community Action Programme is to create an open method of coordination between the Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion.
This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into National Action Plans and to implement policies to promote equal opportunities.
The implementation of the Social Policy Action Programme 2000-2005 as published by the Commission will also help in combating social exclusion.
Particular emphasis will be placed on setting up schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help early school leavers.
There will also be continued national support for local job creation programmes under the principle of subsidiarity.
There will also be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the Information Society, modern telecommunications services and Internet-related activities.
We do not want to build a two-tier Europe, or a Europe of the haves and have nots.
It is very important that education and training opportunities are given to those without skills.
It is equally important to give retraining opportunities to those in the existing workplace.
Partnership is the key at all times and consultation between all interested parties is very important if the problem of social exclusion is to be solved sooner rather than later.
- My group is happy to support the Figueiredo report, and congratulates the rapporteur on her dedicated approach to the issue.
We feel that the higher amount of funding proposed is essential if we are to be able to do serious work in tackling social exclusion and poverty.
It is obvious that the current economic system is not delivering an adequate standard of living for many people within the EU, and before we push applicant countries in the same direction we have to know what we can do that is more effective in meeting people's needs.
It is clear that we have a considerable number of working poor and people who will not be able to work at all, or work full-time and we need to see what can be done to ensure that they have an adequate income and other opportunities which allow them to participate in society.
We cannot assume that work is the only activity that implies that you are a worthy citizen.
Young people, those from minority ethnic groups, the elderly, people with disabilities, the homeless, the mentally ill and many others find themselves excluded in our societies in many different ways.
Therefore, we support the rapporteur's view that there is a need for a wider body to evaluate the working of the action programme.
We reject the view that only Member State governments should evaluate their own choices of research and other activities.
They are not the poor and socially-excluded, so there is a role for civil society being involved in the evaluation to help ensure that the Commission and Member States are on the right lines in their approach and to provide greater transparency.
Members of the European Parliament represent many of the poor and socially-excluded and also have valuable experience to bring to any evaluation.
It is essential that we are given this opportunity.
Ferber report (A5-0138/2001)
This, Madam President, is an adjustment of the budget for the systems and administrative organisation of the European security and defence policy.
General White, an Englishman, of the future European rapid reaction force, meets Captain Rossi, an Italian.
They are both veterans and pensioners of the future European force.
'How are you?' asks the captain.
'Fine, and you?' answers the general.
'Not so good,' says the Italian.
'Why?'
'Because my pension is too low,' says the Italian captain.
'But no,' continues the Englishman, 'my pension is quite high, actually.'
'How much is it?
Oh, three times as much as mine!
But how come the pensions of generals who have served in the European reaction force are so different?
Let us remember to tell Mr Fatuzzo to bring up the fact that it would be good if pay and pensions in the future European army were the same for everyone.'
The Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget (SAB) 2/2001 presented by the Council aims to continue and to speed up the development of the common European security and defence policy (ESDP) by setting up three new directorates within the General Secretariat of the Council, recruiting 51 staff, paying daily allowances for military experts and purchasing telecommunications and data protection equipment.
In this way, the ESDP management structures will be created, helping speed up the militarisation of the European Union, a process we reject and which is sufficient justification in itself for rejecting the current SAB and the Ferber report.
Besides, Mr Ferber not only fails to question this process but he also 'welcomes the Council' s decision to launch with this SAB a new European defence policy' and also 'regrets that this policy is not more integrated in the first pillar' .
There are also, however, institutional and technical issues to examine.
Firstly, the entering of this operating expenditure as administrative expenditure of the Council both confuses the nature of the expenditure and removes the possibility of democratic control over it, specifically by Parliament, which, in practice, is thus giving up its budgetary power.
However, in addition to the issues of democracy and transparency, there is increased pressure on the ceiling for expenditure under heading 5 - administrative expenditure - at a time when the European Union is preparing for enlargement.
The motion for rejection tabled by the Group of the Greens only deals with these last two issues but essentially accepts the position of the Ferber report, without commenting on the basic issues of the ESDP.
We cannot, therefore, vote in favour of this rejection.
Schleicher report (A5-0167/2001)
Madam President, the Pensioners' Party, represented by me in this House, has voted in favour of the statute and financing of European political parties.
I am convinced, as Mr Maaten said in the report he described for us when he spoke on behalf of the Liberal Group, that Europe is also and most of all constructed through the European political parties.
In my opinion, it would be appropriate if the European political parties took part in national elections, rather than having national political parties take part in European elections.
Europe is being constructed by beginning to construct European centres for doing politics.
As long as we have national parties, we will never have a Europe.
I hope, therefore, that there will soon be a register for European elections, with at least ten per cent of us elected at a European level.
Madam President, the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognise the importance of and need for political parties at European level in order to promote integration.
I think, however, that the requirement to have representation in at least five Member States, that is in 33% of them, in order to obtain funding, is excessively restrictive and gives the impression of wanting to close the doors to new ideas and new ways of understanding politics.
What would happen if, within a Member State, a party were required to obtain parliamentary representation in 33% of the constituencies in order to be considered an established party with the right to a presence and to public resources and funding?
Firstly, many of the parties from Federal States and regions could not get into the State parliaments, and we would therefore have less democracy, less integration and less Europe.
The same applies to European parties.
If we want to promote integration and the shaping of the broadest political awareness and will, we have to decrease this limit and immediately make representation in three Member States sufficient to be considered a European party.
Moreover, the small parties of today could be the big parties of tomorrow.
We should not close the doors on the future.
Through this vote the large parties have tried to snatch the contributors' money to finance themselves.
We are not, in principle, against the public financing of parties; but we are against this form of discrimination based on two factors: numbers and territory.
In fact, this measure excludes the parties that support territorial identities, even if they are sizeable.
A party could even represent 80% in its own country, but if it does not have European connections it will be excluded.
It would be like saying that, in Italy, for instance, the SÃŒdtiroler Volkspartei or the Union ValdÃŽtaine should not have access to public funds.
It is a profoundly unfair measure, and that is why we have voted against it.
Madam President, I would like to thank you for your skilful and impartial management of the sittings.
My remarks concern Mr Schleicher' s report on the financing of European political parties.
It states that parties' own funding amounts to just 25%, and, thus, 75% is from subsidies, which is why I did not think the support of companies was necessary.
We have to accomplish things through being active and, furthermore, support must be obtained from members.
For this reason I voted against donations by companies.
In any case I think that the excessive use of money has started to distort elections, an excellent example of which is the Italian elections.
It might distort elections in the future too, and for that reason a limit must be found to the use of money in elections.
Madam President, the Schleicher report takes us down the road not just of corruption but of institutionalised corruption.
The big parties, the departing parties, the establishment parties will have the oligopoly, if not the monopoly, of funding for their electoral campaigns and propaganda.
Of course, they will deprive those not large enough of that funding.
Few speakers, however, have noted that it will not be enough to be a party with a European base - which is already questionable, as my colleague Mr Speroni has mentioned - it must be more than European, it must be pro-Europe.
As Amendment No 2 to recital 2 states, fundamental rights must be respected, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
What about those who would challenge the Treaties?
What about those who will be challenging the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
They are pariahs, vermin, scum.
They will be deprived of financing.
They will be prosecuted.
As in Belgium, they will be placed under police surveillance.
They will be dragged before the courts.
Today' s totalitarian system is no longer behind any iron curtain.
As I explained in the main debate, there is no legal basis for the Commission' s proposal on the statute and financing of European political parties or the Schleicher report supporting it.
The obstinacy of the main federalist groups in pursuing their adoption come what may shows exactly how far the law is respected in the Europe they are building.
The same can be said of the French government which, in its note of 9 May, sees no difficulty about using Article 308 in such a case.
In terms of content, the proposed text turns the logical progress of a free society on its head.
At national level political parties are created by the citizens and nurtured by their participation. They may eventually be granted public finance by law, but only later on.
With this new text, the reverse would happen at European level: public finance from the Community budget would be intended to make European political parties - which do not exist today, or not with any real substance - 'emerge' .
The perversion, however, does not end there.
Next, these artificial creations will be used as evidence of the existence of a so-called 'European political scene' , which will itself be produced as proof that 'European democracy' is working well.
And this largely invented 'European democracy' will in turn serve to justify the removal of powers from the national democracies, the only truly genuine ones.
This anti-democratic machine for despoiling the peoples is operating at full speed, activated in this case by the lure of gain, since the ectoplasms currently entitled 'European political parties' , supported by their friends in the European Parliament, are waiting impatiently for the time when they can feed on public funds.
Added to these basic reasons for our opposition are many others relating to the irregularity of the text presented, because it gives a 'statute' to political parties which ought to remain free, because it is biased in favour of the partisans of supranationality, because it establishes a real political law, and because it institutes indefensible discrimination to the detriment of national parties acting directly at European level.
Texts like these show how badly France needs a means of checking that acts derived from Community legislation are constitutional.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mrs Schleicher' s report on the statute and financing of European political parties.
The Treaty contains provisions concerning the political parties.
The most important purpose of this statute is to create openness and transparency in the financing of the European political parties.
The European Parliament' s amendment is a substantial tightening up of the Commission' s proposal, which we can fully support.
An important point are the demands that European parties be representative.
We are of the view that the demands must not be so tough that it is only the major parties that are covered by the rules.
It is important to recognise that smaller parties too contribute substantially to European democracy, especially in connection with enlargement.
- (DA) We have voted against the report for two basic reasons.
The first reason concerns the content of the report.
It is contrary to democratic principles to favour larger political groupings over smaller groupings.
The idea is unequivocally to give the largest political groups in the European Parliament a financial advantage, without its being in any way apparent that they represent people in the different countries better than the smaller groups.
The second reason concerns the legal uncertainty and lack of basis in the Treaties, together with the President' s completely unacceptable reintroduction of the proposal, even though it was agreed to throw out the reading in accordance with Article 143 of the Rules of Procedure.
It is well known that we are against the creation of 'European political parties' or other forms of organisation with supranational characteristics, since going down this path clearly means one more step towards a strengthening of the federalist orientation of the European Union and foreshadows predictable measures to this end.
Although this European parties' initiative is presented as a way of getting round the criticism from the Court of Auditors regarding the financing of political groups in the European Parliament, it has really been imposed by the dominant forces in the European Union without there being any real support for the creation of such 'European parties' , since the Treaty of Nice has not yet even been ratified by any national parliament in a Member State.
Lastly, mention must also be made of our disagreement in principle with countless points included in the current proposal, specifically the criteria for their formation and funding possibilities.
All over Europe the funding of political parties is tainted by sleaze which is bad for democratic politics.
For that reason I believe that European funding for European-wide political activity, be it for or against the European Union, should be considered seriously, so long as that activity remains within the accepted parameters of Western values.
Nonetheless I have serious reservations about some of the detailed proposals in the Report, as well as considering it not to have a proper legal base.
. (EL) The Nice Treaty, which makes provision for a method to fund European political parties, has not yet been ratified by the Member States and therefore entered into force, and yet the Council and the parliamentary committee responsible have rushed to put a report on the statute and funding of European political parties to the vote in plenary.
The pretext for the hurry is the EU's alleged concern at the increasingly poor turnout at elections.
There is not a grain of truth in this argument, as is clear from the huge turnout at the recent elections in Italy and all the relevant studies, which talk of the disappointment and apathy of voters (due to the contradiction between what the bourgeois parties do and say) as regards the machinations going on in Brussels and Strasbourg.
This alienation will increase even more when European parties with even looser ties to their voters are set up.
Mainly using economic incentives as bait, legislation is being passed on what are, to all intents and purposes, binding rules governing the constitution and modus operandi of European parties.
These strict binding rules concern both their statute and the electoral power which parties must have in order to qualify as 'European' and obtain the relevant funding.
These parties must have clear European objectives, such as European integration, even if they appear to take the opposite approach.
The word 'appear' is highly suspicious.
Will a party such as the Communist Party of Greece, which not only appears but is, in fact, clearly opposed to European integration be approved?
Further on it says that a political party cannot qualify as European if it preaches intransigence.
In other words, is it prohibited to preach intransigence against fascism or, more importantly, against class enemies and the exploitation of the working classes?
As far as electoral power is concerned, the proposal is that the party must either have elected representatives in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments in at least 5 Member States (either in one third of the Member States or in one quarter according to today's resolution) or must have gained at least 5% in at least 5 Member States at the last European elections (either in one third or in one quarter of the Member States).
This is direct interference in the electoral system of each country, because higher electoral quotas are being introduced which, in practice, will exclude the voices opposed to the so-called 'European ideal' , that is, the imperialist nature of the ÃU.
Finally, provision is made for contributions to be published for the sake of transparency.
However, as there is no limit on contributions, we must assume that even the names of the members and friends of a party who pay a subscription will be recorded.
The report considers the ban on donations to a party by public corporations to be something of an achievement in the transparency stakes.
Woe betide that it should say the opposite!
However, the problem lies in donations from the highly powerful private sector, on which it remains as quiet as the grave.
The attempt here to introduce compulsory European parties is tantamount to serious interference in the political system of each country, the aim being to weaken the role of the national parties, especially those which oppose the ÃU.
The parties are institutions set up to express the free will of their members, as regards both their programmes and their modus operandi.
By setting up European political parties as described above, they are trying to get the people to accept the imperialist integration of the EU as a one-way street, as destiny and as the only course available, to hit out at and - if they can - exclude any dissenting voices from the European Parliament and to distance the workers even more from the centres which take the decisions which directly affect them.
.
(NL) Parties should be organisations ruled from the bottom up, not from the top down.
Real parties do not come into being because the structures of a state have a need for organising a competitive battle during elections, but because there are groups of people who share the same ideas, interests and activities.
However, those in favour of a European multicultural state have discovered that there is no European public opinion.
Artificially, from the top down, they now want to put forward leaders and structures which attempt to create an opinion of that kind.
Four cooperatives of more or less like-minded parties in different Member States have now combined into a European party, and they support that party to some extent with funds from their common groups in this Parliament.
In my view, this proposal is mainly a tool for legalising this unprofessional conduct.
The doling out of tax money to parties, as well as the imposing of rules on parties by the government adds to the mistrust on the part of the citizens against what they see as a political elite.
A centralistically organised European party could well create a situation where, within a joint political movement, member involvement, party democracy and the priorities which differ from Member State to Member State are being compromised.
Although I welcome the fact that this proposal does not discriminate on the basis of their political persuasion and their scale, and that gifts from businesses are prohibited, I will be voting against it.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the proposal to lay down clear and transparent guidelines for the operation of European political parties and to regulate their finances.
European political parties already exist and obtain public funds via their political groups in the European Parliament.
It is therefore important that we regulate on this.
The new rules would make the system more visible, more open, more transparent and above that fairer.
Democracy requires parties to provide choice to the electorate and to articulate the views of voters.
At European level, they remind us that, on most policy issues our differences of view are not between Member States but between different philosophies and political viewpoints that exist within all Member States.
I have voted against the report for the following reasons: Article 308 of the Treaty does not provide the legal basis for giving the European Parliament the right to deal with the matter at this time.
The statutes have the effect of being democratically and financially exclusive and also appear to be discriminatory in as much as high thresholds are introduced for determining whether a party is to be counted as a European party.
Thus, they do not safeguard justice for minorities and the protection of the latter.
There is also an obvious danger, along the lines of American policy, in companies being granted the right to provide financial subsidy to what have been approved as European political parties.
Not until the end of 2001 at the earliest will all 15 Member States' parliaments and governments have ratified the Treaty of Nice.
Only then will it be possible for the issue of the financing of European political parties to be dealt with in detail by the European Parliament.
Today' s decision is premature.
The EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg will examine and ascertain whether Article 308 of the Treaty really can be invoked as a legal basis.
It is my conviction that today' s decision will then be declared as being contrary to the Treaty and thus repealed.
Article 308 reads: 'If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures.'
The European Parliament believes that, to be eligible for subsidy at European level, financed by taxation, a party association must have obtained at least five per cent of the vote in at least a third of the Member States or be represented in the European Parliament or national or regional parliaments in a third of the Member States.
The Commission does not want a relative number, but a fixed number, of Member States (five, irrespective of the size of the EU).
The European Parliament has made the democratic threshold remarkably high, too high in fact.
Large groups of citizens, with representatives in the European Parliament, may be excluded from this financing of parties at European level through taxation.
The wording in Article 3 concerning the approach to European political associations and national parties bears witness to a view of the future which I cannot in any way share: 'the party or its national components' .
In this way, the European Parliament has, then, established the national political parties as future 'national components' or types of district organisation of what are being called European political parties and which taxpayers around Europe are expected to subsidise.
Developed as it was by pioneers with a strong spirit of self-sacrifice, perseverance and faith in the fundamental importance to society of the Christian ethic and view of human beings and of the family, Sweden' s Christian Democratic Party, led by Birger Ekstedt at the beginning of 1964 and by Alf Svensson from 1973, is far too significant and important in terms of democracy to be described as 'a national component' .
The debates arising from examination of the Schleicher report in this part-session reveal extremely disturbing anti-democratic trends within the Community institutions and particularly within this Parliament.
Democracy means, first and foremost, respect for the law.
Everyone knows perfectly well, even those who claim the contrary, that this plan for financing European political parties has no legal base.
Article 191, as Mr Berthu has shown, cannot be used as a base for implementing Article 308.
Court of Justice case law on this point is as clear as day.
There is no Community competence.
The majority of this Parliament, however, like the Commission, pretends not to know that, because there is so very much at stake for the federalist parties and the federalist ideology.
What all this is really about is, on the one hand, the cash flow of several large parties whose members' subscriptions no longer suffice to maintain their bureaucracies, and which are tightly confined by strict national anti-corruption provisions, and, on the other, the creation of a new instrument of forced federalisation which will limit the peoples' freedom of choice.
Next, democracy means transparency.
There is a danger that the system of financing for supranational European parties proposed by the Commission and the Schleicher report will constitute an exceptional channel for corruption and in particular for money laundering, since companies can make unlimited donations and the conditions for accepting donations from individuals are extremely lax.
European financing would therefore make it possible to by-pass and thwart national efforts to clean up the funding of political parties and apply strict conditions to make it transparent.
Democracy is also respect for minorities.
It is extremely disturbing that the debate on the Schleicher report, after being declared inadmissible by Parliament, was forcibly restored to the agenda this morning by an arrogant majority with minimal concern for respecting the law, as shown by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo' s alarming description of the minority in this Parliament as a 'commando' .
The majority of a Parliament that prides itself on teaching the whole world to respect minority rights would do well to start by respecting the minority within it.
. (NL) It is important for a democratic Europe to have European parties.
They offer the citizen the opportunity to vote for a party directly.
The elections, with European lists and people heading the list of candidates, should serve as a basis for making up the European Commission.
In order to form major European parties, a sound legal basis is required.
In this connection, it is important to establish transparent financial criteria and guarantee the independence of politicians and political parties.
We cannot be bought.
It is impossible to accept money from public companies or industry, however small the amounts involved are.
We are at the service of the citizen who has elected us.
Brussels is an attractive base for industry to lobby from.
Lobbyists often perform the useful task of informing us.
However, given the sometimes conflicting interests between the European Parliament and, for example, the pharmaceutical industry (the price of AIDS medicines) or the car industry (environmental standards), we cannot possibly accept donations from them.
As we are currently in the development stage of European parties, we might as well get it right from the outset by creating one European standard.
I would call on the Greens, the Liberals and the Christian-Democrats to support this standard.
JovÃ© Peres report (A5-0137/2001)
It is almost time for lunch, Madam President.
Can you not smell the olive oil on the Neapolitan mozzarella, on the tomatoes from southern Italy, with a little parmesan and a good glass of red wine or beer?
It is the Mediterranean diet which makes Italians live so long and makes them remain pensioners for so long too, although much to the regret of the finances and the treasury ministers of several governments.
Therefore, with this picture in mind, could I, Madam President, vote against a measure to increase the production of oil and regulate it so that we can always have olive oil in Europe?
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Parliament' s report on the olive oil scheme.
The report does not acknowledge that there has been extensive fraud involving the aid scheme for olive oil, and it is dismissive of the Commission' s proposed changes in the aid.
At the moment, the EU provides aid per ton of olive oil.
This form of aid requires the monitoring of actual production.
Such monitoring has not operated at all satisfactorily.
The Member States have not been anything like good enough at doing the monitoring.
The Commission is proposing in the longer term to introduce aid-per-tree instead of per ton of olive oil.
Such a form of aid requires the introduction of what is called a Geographical Information System so that the producers' cultivation declarations can be monitored with the help of aerial photographs.
The Commission proposes extending the present system by 2 years until such a system is in place.
We support the Commission' s proposal and hope that the whole sector can be reformed, together with the rest of agricultural policy, during the Danish Presidency in 2 years' time.
The amendments proposed by the rapporteur of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are an improvement on the Commission's proposal, although they too fail to break away from the thinking behind the Regulation or address the basic worries of olive producers and the olive oil market, such as the abolition of intervention, the unaccountability and profiteering of the industry and the multinationals, the low quotas and the extortionate coresponsibility levies, that is, the disastrous consequences of Regulation No 1638/98, which have caused the olive oil market to collapse, prices to hit rock bottom and incomes to evaporate for olive producers, all of whom are small or medium-sized farmers in barren and island regions.
The Commission deliberately and wittingly overlooks these consequences and does not even brook the idea of repeating intervention so as to secure a minimum wage for olive producers.
It has not proposed any increase in quotas so as to at least cover existing production, preferring instead to focus on the quality of olive oil, as if the healthiest and most suitable product for consumers' health has been totally unsuitable in the past.
The Commission's alleged interest in the quality of olive oil is misleading and hypocritical.
If it is so interested in quality, why does it allow olive oil mixed with different seed oils to be marketed? Because that way large quantities of seed oil are sold, which have nothing in common with the nutritional value of olive oil and because that way the industry and the multinationals make more profit.
What makes the Commission's deliberate undermining and blatant hypocrisy obvious is that it examines the application of measures, such as the subsidy per tree, with total indifference as to the disastrous consequences which this will have on the olive groves themselves, the quality of the product and the employment and income of the producers.
And all this at a time when the Commission is arranging for mixing, that is, the adulteration of olive oil, to be legalised, is working to abolish the transportation and marketing of olive oil in cans of more than 5 litres on the pretext of avoiding adulteration, as if olive oil in cans of less than 5 litres cannot be adulterated.
In other words, this measure is not intended to improve quality but to allow the industry and the multinationals to monopolise the marketing and transportation of olive oil.
We need changes to the common organisation in the market in olive oil and for what is a catastrophic situation for olive producers to be reversed, not a few isolated interventions in secondary issues.
Unfortunately, the Commission is able to cover up its unacceptable action with the collusion of the Greek government.
Gebhardt report (A5-0153/2001)
Madam President, It was a deplorable feature of the document to which Mrs Gebhardt's report responded that, as I said in the explanatory statement, Parliament commented in detail on the protection of individual rights, which did not feature at all in the Council text.
It seems to me that every step that we take and justifiably take in this direction must be, at the same time, one which recognises in the highest degree protection of the rights of the defence and of the rights of persons accused of crime in all parts of the Union.
This should not become a way of achieving a lowest common factor of protection.
It must be the case that at all points people involved in criminal processes achieve the highest level of respect for their rights of defence.
May I remark that the provision on national representatives allows for substitutes?
I hope that the United Kingdom in appointing persons will take note of the fact there are two distinct systems of criminal justice in the UK.
Madam President, yesterday evening at the asparagus festival - which I attended and for which I thank the Mayor of Strasbourg for having invited us and you, Madam President, for having agreed and coordinated this important annual event of friendship - I found I was sharing a table with a retired judge.
Naturally, between one stick of asparagus and another, we chatted about various things and I did not let the opportunity slip of asking him for information on the significance of this report by Mrs Gebhardt, if, that is, it was a good thing to have Eurojust.
His answer was unequivocal: 'It is an important document.
Europe should proceed towards a European justice system, towards European cooperation, while looking forward to a European code.'
I followed his suggestion and therefore I voted in favour.
The Eurojust judicial cooperation unit, as presented today following an initiative by a number of Member States, is intended to ensure good liaison between the national authorities responsible for criminal prosecutions in cases of cross-border crime.
This cooperation excludes any action by an authority against Member States, and any desire to integrate national judicial systems.
Its purpose is to make all the various legal players work better together, and its context is clearly intergovernmental.
We approve of this approach, because it is the most realistic. There is no dream of any general merging of national legal systems - an impossible dream, which would only delay practical solutions - but, on the contrary, a determination to work from the basis of the existing judicial networks, by removing technical obstacles which might hinder fluid relations between them.
For once a report by Parliament appears to rally to a realistic approach, and does not reject an initiative out of hand, as it has tended to do recently, under the pretext that it has come from the Member States and not the Commission. The report does not make the customary demand for a supranational European public prosecutor, a unified body of law, or indeed federal criminal courts.
For once it seems to accept the intergovernmental approach as the most viable, and we can only rejoice at that.
This apparent moderation, however, conceals several traps.
First, the amendments proposed by the European Parliament seek to strengthen centralisation around the Eurojust unit, notably by seeking to eliminate the national correspondents, thus surreptitiously renouncing the 'network' idea, on which the system is supposed to be based.
And above all, these amendments totally undermine the intergovernmental spirit, transforming the applications for investigations or prosecutions issued by Eurojust into decisions binding on the Member States, and eliminating their whole margin of manoeuvre in applying the law in their own territory.
As we see it, this surreptitious transformation of the original text is utterly unacceptable.
Obviously we must subscribe to a policy of strengthening the fight against all forms of corruption, both national and European.
Nor have we ever stopped saying so, especially since the Schengen Agreement eliminated Member States' border controls.
All these serious issues, which affect the actual exercise of justice, public freedoms and public order, can only fall within the competence of the Member States.
It should be remembered that justice is a right bestowed and organised by national governments.
With all kinds of organised and cross-border crime on the increase, however, with growing insecurity and violence, intergovernmental cooperation between Member States' police forces and judiciaries is desirable.
Lo and behold, though, Europe is trying to impose communitisation of our judicial system and our internal public order on the pretext of this cooperation, notably by creating a European public prosecutor' s office.
The Nice Council of December 2000 adjudged this latter measure a danger to respect for individual' s rights and democracy, and rightly rejected the creation of this supranational public prosecutor.
The European Parliament is once again treating the deep feelings of the Member States with disdain.
Following the old custom of coming through the back door in disguise after leaving through the front, it is actually trying, with the help of Mrs Guigou, French Minister of Justice at the time, to make Eurojust an embryo European public prosecutor' s office.
A single prosecution service, independent of the Member States could therefore, at its convenience, decide to arrest, prosecute or extradite suspects, without any recourse to the judiciaries of the Member States concerned.
Is this progress in common security?
No, more like another step towards confusion of powers.
Situation in the Middle East (RC B5-0344/2001)
Madam President, this is a very serious and important argument.
As you know, the Pensioners' Party - like all parties, in fact - is for peace and is aware of the difficulties in achieving this peace in the Middle East.
You know that all over the world there are divisions between groups of people as a result of their race, their ethnicity, their origins and also as a result of the place where they have lived for so many years.
The Pensioners' Party believes that these should not be the reasons that make us do things.
We must strive in this life for all of us - all the citizens of the world - to become better than we are now: we must argue over how to achieve this result but not over ethnic divisions, which may exist but which must not lead to war.
The dramatic events in Palestine over recent months, the heroic intifada of the Palestinian people and barbaric suppression by Israel have forced the European Parliament to adopt a resolution highlighting the responsibility of the state of Israel.
The joint resolution on the Middle East, as it now stands, recognises what has become an unbearable situation for the Palestinians in the occupied areas, who are being made to suffer unbearable and unfair collective punishment.
It condemns the illegal incursions by the Israeli army, the extrajudicial executions, the complete blockade of the occupied territories and the extension of the settlements there.
It makes special mention of Israel's practice of marketing products from the settlements in the occupied territories as produce of Israel, so that it qualifies for Community preferences, and it calls for measures to be taken.
It considers that the disproportionate use of violence by the Israeli army and collective punishment are incompatible with the principles of the Association Agreement between the ÃU and Israel.
It calls for all settlement procedures to be frozen, including the natural increase in the population and it calls on the Member States to propose that the UN Security Council send observers and take a stand in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state.
However, on certain points, the resolution resorts to a policy of equal treatment which puts the sacrificer and the sacrificed on the same footing, it talks of terrorist attacks by the Palestinians, it urges all the interested parties to put an end to the violence and it calls on the Palestinian Authority to make every effort to combat the terrorism, limit the violence and control the terrorists.
Despite these shortcomings, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece supported the resolution, together with 57% of the MEPs present, because this is the first time a European Parliament resolution has highlighted the responsibility and condemned the practices of Israel.
The situation of Palestine is extremely serious due to the occupation of its land by Israel and the brutal repression of its people by the Israeli army.
Since 29 September 2000, the date of Ariel Sharon' s provocative act in the Mosque compound (Haram al-Sharif), the Israeli army of occupation has already caused hundreds of deaths, mostly children and adolescents, injured tens of thousands and arrested hundreds of Palestinians who are fighting to make their right to a have a State a reality.
In the escalating aggression, Israel destroys Palestinian houses, continues its policy of occupation and the illegal building of settlements, restricts the free movement of Palestinian communities, drops bombs, sets up road blocks, does not fulfil financial commitments or signed agreements, carries out selective assassinations, invades territories under the administration of the Palestinian authority and attacks Syrian forces in Lebanon, attracting the strongest condemnation.
As we all know, Israel has occupied Palestinian territories since 1947.
Since 1967, it has occupied Gaza and the West Bank, forcing thousands of Palestinians to live outside their country, a situation which is condemned by the UN and only maintained through the support of the USA and with at least the connivance of the EU.
Peace will only be possible when the UN resolutions are fully implemented and the Israeli aggression comes to an end. This means that we should support all serious initiatives so that the Palestinian people can secure their own independent, sovereign state.
It is time for sanctions against Israel, Mrs Lindh.
In today' s edition of the French newspaper, LibÃ©ration (16 May 2001), one of Israel' s best known pacifists, the writer David Grossman, observes that, if one does not believe in miracles and does not approve of catastrophes, there is only one way to change the situation in the Middle East, namely through 'international pressure' .
He also states that it is Israel, the occupying power, which is mainly responsible and therefore in greatest need of external pressure.
Because the United States never does anything that Israel does not like, there is an important international role waiting to be fulfilled in this area.
The EU has for a long time been the biggest provider of economic and administrative aid and the most important supporter of the Palestinian Authority.
EU politicians have complained that the EU does not play a corresponding political role.
Why, then, not take up the gauntlet and do what the United States does not want to do and what both Palestinians and Israeli pacifists are pleading should be done, that is to say bring specific pressure to bear upon Israel?
Formal bases in international law for economic sanctions against Israel are to be found in the shape of those infringements of Israel' s Association Agreement with the EU, demonstrated by the Commission with reference to the fact that goods from unlawful Israeli settlements on occupied land are being sold to the EU with 'Israel' cited as the country of origin.
If, now, it really is the case that the EU' s new rapid reaction force does not exist at all to protect the EU' s interests as a superpower but, in fact - and as Mrs Lindh usually maintains - is there simply to be unselfish about making peace in the world, why not propose that it be deployed in the Middle East along the only lawful dividing line between Israel and Palestine, namely the 1967 frontier?
Unfortunately, nothing of this was heard when Mrs Lindh presented the EU' s Middle East policy before the European Parliament today.
There were a whole lot of words, but absolutely nothing concrete and nothing which could in any way put an end to the bloodbath and to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine.
The matter is made that much the more tragic by the fact that Sweden' s own voice on the subject of Palestine has gone completely silent.
The work of the former Foreign Minister, Mr Andersson, is being carried on not by Mrs Lindh but by her Danish colleague, Mr Lycketoft, who now talks in no uncertain terms about Israel' s violation of human rights and of international law.
Both in her capacity as EU President and as Swedish Foreign Minister, Mrs Lindh appears, rather, to have capitulated before those forces which do not dare to stand up to Israel and the United States.
That is deplorable.
It is the extremist and terrorist violence which is holding back the peace process.
It is the attacks that then provoke reactions from the Israeli state, which responds with measures that are perhaps disproportionate compared with the attacks that caused them.
Where violence rules, however, it is difficult to classify it according to a scale of values and condemn only those who use it to defend themselves.
I feel uncomfortable in approving the so-called compromise resolution.
I find too many condemnations of Israel in it.
It is not a resolution that expresses an equal distance from the parties in question.
It is a document that upholds the rationale of just one side and belies the good will demonstrated on many occasions by the Israeli leaders.
Besides, it is easy to see that whenever the peace process was about to resume, the terrorist extremists went into action.
And Europe never spoke up at times like that.
The 'principle of reciprocity' on which agreement was reached in Oslo in 1993 must be safeguarded.
Dialogue, mutual understanding, condemnation of violence are elements characterised by an action that favours resumption of the process.
Europe, and primarily our institutions, must not assume the role of judge but rather that of a credible and authoritative interlocutor, if it wants to contribute effectively to the peace process.
Trust and respect for the legitimate aspirations of both sides should be expressed in a balanced way in the text we are discussing, but I do not find in it the balance I would like to see.
State of the Transatlantic dialogue (RC B5-0342/2001 and RC B5-0345/2001)
Madam President, like, I am sure, many of us Members of the European Parliament, I consider the citizens of the other side of the Atlantic, in America, the citizens of all the Americas, to be our friends and my friends.
I myself, as you know, have often stepped onto the soil of the United States, even if only on Saturdays, when I left the cruise ship the Oceanic, on which I had embarked as a crew member.
I experienced the warmth, the enthusiasm, the creativity and the intelligence of the American citizens.
I hope, therefore, that this collaboration will continue, and will continue also between American pensioners and European pensioners, so that a way can be found for all of us to live better.
The transatlantic agenda reveals the special interest that exists in an in-depth agreement between the USA and the European Union on the major world economic issues, as is particularly evident in relation to monetarist and neo-liberal policies, policies of centralisation and concentration of wealth and exploitation of workers and peoples, showing greater concern for issues of interest to economic groups and multinationals and neglecting social issues, including health and education, the environment, development and cultural diversity.
An identical situation occurs in relation to so-called security and defence issues and the policy of interference in the internal affairs of peoples, examples of which are cooperation within NATO and the adoption of the new strategic concept, as, moreover, was made quite clear in the war against Yugoslavia.
Currently, however, the pretensions of North American imperialism for world hegemony and domination and construction of a 'new order' to suit US interests - dismantling the legal and institutional order resulting from the second world war, tackling the UN Charter and international law and rejecting protocols like the Kyoto Protocol, taking on a more aggressive character with the new Bush administration - all this is making the world situation deteriorate.
It was in this context, then, that I supported the resolution that our Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left subscribed to on the state of the transatlantic dialogue and I voted against the rest.
Cercas report (A5-0147/2001)
Madam President, on this document regarding safe and sustainable pensions I could not fail to give an explanation of vote.
I voted for it, but I should like to draw everyone' s attention to the fact that the Pensioners' Party is asking for a European pension.
The pensions problem can only be solved when the European Union has the competence to decide on pensions too.
The Pensioners' Party is asking that social security, which is financed out of our wages, out of workers' pay, should be voluntary and not compulsory.
The Member States have shown that they cannot administer our money: therefore we should have the right to administer our own wages in order to have our pensions, freely and without being forced to give money to the state.
.
(NL) The Cercas report has not received our backing for the following reasons. First of all, the report turns social security into a Community issue in terms of policy development and policy measures.
In doing so, the report imposes a certain vision: the pursuit of social convergence.
Consequently, Member States are afforded little scope for creating their own solutions.
It is precisely the diversity of systems that requires every Member State to use its own tailored approach.
Many large Member States still need to restructure their provisions for old age in the light of the ageing population.
The supra-national aspects affect the pre-conditions, such as the budgetary implications and the requirement that saving for a pension in one Member State should not hinder mobility to another Member State.
We have more than enough to deal with.
If the reforms are to be accompanied by coordination efforts for a European social security system, this will seriously hamper the reforms, and will stand in the way of an effective solution.
It should be noted in this connection that the enlargement is already taking up a considerable amount of the limited resources.
As such, the report is not in touch with reality.
Pensions will thus become unsafe, untenable and unaffordable.
Indeed, no one wants to be worse off, and the system which offers most facilities should be taken as the guiding principle.
The document by the European Commission, on the other hand, gives a clear analysis of the issue.
The Commission document has a much more targeted approach.
The report is thus no improvement on the Commission document.
This is why we have decided against giving our support to this report, which is only detracting from the sound approach in the Commission communication.
. (DE) We take the current and future problems of pensions policy and social change very seriously.
The Commission communication and the report by Mr Cercas undoubtedly contain important and positive proposals.
The calls for better social protection for women are a case in point.
However, as regards the basic problem - defending and renewing social protection systems based on solidarity - the report conflicts with the fundamental positions held by our group.
We therefore cannot vote for the report.
The general emphasis on solidarity is clearly at odds with the specific proposals.
The majority of Members of the European Parliament fully support the shift away from statutory pensions schemes based on solidarity towards a three-pillar model of pensions provision.
The report does not develop any fundamental alternatives to the pensions reform initiated by the decisions taken at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, which lacked a social framework.
I think it is especially tragic that by promoting the partial privatisation of pensions systems based on solidarity, European social democracy is breaking radically with its entire historical tradition.
For more than a hundred years, social democracy has fought for a redistributive welfare state based on solidarity. Now it is at the forefront of the campaign to dismantle it.
The emphasis on demographic arguments, such as the 'greying' of the European societies, is not convincing.
Furthermore, no attempt is made to examine other options - such as the inclusion of all types of income in financing the pensions system, as in Switzerland - in terms of their viability.
'Live longer, save more, spend less!' These are the watchwords of the 'pensions reform'.
The Commission and the High-Level Working Party on Social Protection are calling for new regulations to push back the current retirement age.
In future, the statutory pension will no longer maintain a person's existing living standards in old age, but will merely offer basic provision.
Maintaining pensions systems based on solidarity is possible even under current and future conditions as long as policies are guided by the principle of social justice rather than the self-seeking interests of banks, investment funds and insurance companies.
We therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy.
Many of the children that are presently being born will live to the age of 120 or more.
This has been as a result of evidence which has been forthcoming by scientific communities, both in America and in the European Union.
The fact of the matter is simply this.
People are living longer.
People are leading healthier lives.
People know what foods they should eat in an effort to promote healthy living and, in its simplest terms, people are living longer.
Many people retire from work at the age of 55 and the fact of the matter is that EU governments are going to have put in structures to ensure that future pensions can be paid to public servants.
Equally, those working in the private sector will have to look more carefully at their pension plans.
I welcome a recent study carried out by Merril Lynch, a leading US bank, which stated that Ireland tops the European league for safeguarding future pension payments.
One per cent of our GDP is now being put aside per annum into what is known as the National Pension Reserve Fund so as to ensure that pensions for our public servants can be paid after the year 2025.
Per annum we are now paying as much as Â£600 - Â£700 million pounds into this fund.
I also believe it is important that we not only promote good savings programmes in our country but also ensure that people take out a pension at an early age.
I am aware that EU leaders discussed this matter when they met in Stockholm recently.
It is incumbent on all the governments of the European Union to bring forward legislation which can ensure primarily the payment of public service pensions into the future and secondly, to promote good pension programmes for the private sector.
If this entails giving more tax breaks for persons so as to encourage them to take out pensions in the private sector, so be it.
This report deals with a problem of the greatest importance for the future well-being of workers in the European Union, for whom it is necessary to guarantee safe and sustainable pension systems for the long term.
Now as is well known, there has been no lack of catastrophic visions for the future of social protection, based on the ageing of the population and increased life expectancy.
Although the report does not distance itself enough from the more negative positions of the Commission, particularly when it refers to the need for greater flexibility in pension systems, it does highlight the importance of the rise in the employment rate and of public systems based on intergenerational solidarity, and a fair balance between proportional contributions and benefits, on the one hand, and the principle of solidarity, on the other, in order to prevent poverty and social exclusion.
It also takes up the 1992 recommendation concerning the minimum income to be guaranteed by the social protection systems, by supporting initiatives for its implementation.
However, the report does not go far enough regarding what needs to be put into practice in terms of economic and social policies so as to effectively ensure that public systems are sound enough and guarantee worthwhile pensions.
For that reason, I abstained.
So there you have it!
Despite all the hypocritical posturing, maintaining our pension systems by dividing them up is the least of your worries.
Even if we agree that the vital demographic challenge facing Europe as a whole today is a crucial issue for the Member States, the very least we can say is that we disapprove of the pseudo-solutions which you propose in your report.
The rapporteur has managed to duck the issue in 31 convoluted paragraphs.
At no point is there any talk of encouraging the birth rate in Europe or promoting real family policies.
The only talk is of how best to manage the demographic collapse and ageing in the Member States, with pension funds authorised in a passing nod to global finance.
AprÃšs vous, le dÃ©luge, provided that, until such time as Europeans are replaced by immigrants, we maintain a modicum of inter-generational 'solidarity' by putting women and pensioners out to work, encouraging social breakdown by developing private insurance and promoting the dumbing down (or, to use the rapporteur's new-speak, the open coordination) of pensions.
With the exception of a few paragraphs, the whole report invites a reaction somewhere between anger at how you cave in before what you think of as fate and disgust at the financial, mercenary solutions which you recommend in order to resolve such a challenge.
You prove in the most striking manner, however, that the nation state is by far the only viable and reliable framework within which to organise solidarity and social protection.
. (DE) I am most grateful that in its resolution on safe and sustainable pensions, the European Parliament has included a number of ideas and demands relating to women in particular for which I have worked actively for many years here and in Luxembourg.
The debates about the equal treatment of women and men in social security, which have been ongoing since 1975, have borne witness to the usefulness and importance of the European Union's support, through its equal opportunities and equal treatment policies, in dismantling discrimination against women in pensions provision.
I hope that our proposals will be taken seriously by governments facing the challenge of safeguarding living standards through adequate pensions for all, and that they will lead to Europe-wide cooperation on pensions issues.
One of the goals of the Lisbon Process is to increase the number of women in the workforce.
Those who lament the low numbers of working women - in my country too - often forget the millions of 'invisible' women working in the 15 EU countries, namely the wives who work in family businesses and who do not appear in the employment statistics.
For many years, we have called for framework legislation at European level for spouses who work in family businesses, especially to guarantee their statutory participation in pensions schemes.
I should also like to call attention once more to our demand that women's derived rights to a widow's pension be safeguarded, especially for the generations who had no access to employment and who worked solely in the home.
Naturally, I believe that women should increasingly build up their own individual pension rights.
However, this means that spouses who take a break from or opt out of paid employment to care for children or dependent relatives must have guaranteed pension entitlements based on the right to continue paying their social insurance contributions during maternity leave, parental leave, etc.
.
(NL) People outlive their productive lives by quite a margin, at least if their health care, housing, food, working conditions and social security are adequate.
Now that working is threatening to turn into a kind of elite sport, people end up being burnt-out at a younger age, and the need for a lower pensionable age is growing.
In addition, due to small families, younger generations are outnumbered by the older generations, as a result of which, fewer people will be working per pensioner in future.
The wrong answer to that has come from most governments and businesses over the last few decades.
They wanted to reduce the number of people entitled to pensions, by, inter alia, abolishing widows' pensions, and by starting the old-age pension at an older age.
In this way, it was hoped that taxes and pension premiums would drop.
It has now become clear that skimping on pension rights only leads to poverty in the long run.
The only way to stave off that poverty then is to suddenly raise government spending sharply.
The real answer is to start saving in good time for a general pension right for everyone at the age of 60, and to improve pensions caused by inability to work at a younger age.
This report still leaves something to be desired but is moving in the right direction.
. (EL) Surely the title of the report under discussion - safe and sustainable pensions - is meant euphemistically, given that it is obvious both from the spirit and the letter of the report that its concern is for companies and employers and to radically dismantle social security and pensions in a way best in keeping with interests of big business.
Using the "challenges posed by the ageing of the population", which extends the period of retirement and has an adverse effect on business activity, as a pretext, it promotes the gradual implementation of the Stockholm decisions on drastic intervention in social security systems: part-time employment, the abolition of early retirement, benefits indexed to contributions, harsh cuts in benefits, a longer working life and an increase in the retirement age or the number of years' contributions required before full retirement, the gradual dismantling of the welfare state and the promotion of alternative private care and welfare systems.
This endless list of harsh, anti-grass roots measures which may fail to persuade us about 'safe and sustainable pensions' is a knee-jerk reaction to the other part of the report, which is the "future evolution of social protection from a long-term point of view".
Fleecing the workforce, insecurity, expensive private care, commercialising the pension system, poverty and social exclusion.
That is what is in store for the workers, while big business, which demands that the social security system be sacrificed in order to safeguard its competitiveness, can look forward to a more robust, completely unaccountable and hugely profitable future.
The break up of the social security system, in conjunction with working time arrangements geared to employers' interests, that is, part-time work and 'flexible' working times, are the terrifying reality of what was so cynically referred to in Stockholm as "the need to reduce bottlenecks in the labour market", that is, the creation of a huge army of employable people with no rights and no demands who must dance to the tune of big business with its speculative, competitive interests.
The reaction of Greek workers and the Greek people as a whole to the abolition of the welfare state, the mass, combative rallies and strikes taking place, even as we speak, are a most resonant and categorical response to leaders laying disgusting plans without any thought for the people affected.
The Greek workers have said the first resounding and steadfast "no" to the poverty and insecurity in store for them.
We are positive that all the workers of Europe will say the same and we shall be at their side.
You are sowing an anti-grass roots storm and you will reap a grass-roots hurricane.
However, you can be sure that what you are trying to do will not wash!
Buitenweg report (A5-0166/2001)
Madam President, before leaving for Strasbourg from Bergamo airport, I was followed and greeted by some pensioners.
One of them, however, did not trust me and followed me by plane to see and hear how I would vote in this round.
He is that gentleman in the red jacket you can see amongst the people in the public gallery; if you cannot see him it is because pensioners can only be seen when they are amongst themselves.
I want to reassure him that I also voted for the European Parliament budget for 2002, although I still think that part of this funding should be used to have our plenary session seen on television throughout Europe.
I think we should finance live broadcasts of the sittings of the European Parliament with all its trials and tribulations but also all its importance.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Situation in Algeria
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0350/2001 by Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Algeria ;
B5-0361/2001 by Swoboda and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Algeria;
B5-0366/2001 by Flautre and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Algeria;
B5-0368/2001 by Ferrer and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Algeria;
B5-0373/2001 by MalmstrÃ¶m and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Algeria;
B5-0384/2001 by Boudjenah and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Algeria;
B5-0394/2001 by Caullery, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Algeria;
Mr President, as an ex-journalist, freedom, as well as ethical responsibility, of the press are close to my heart.
Islamic fundamentalists and state authorities threaten, and are determined, to extinguish the flame of the freedom of the press in Algeria.
Nevertheless, it is still burning, despite the numerous killings and detentions among independent Algerian journalists.
However, a tightening up of the clause on defamation in the Code of Criminal Procedure forms a fresh attempt on the part of the Algerian government to kill that flame.
As a result, it is possible to lock up Algerian journalists more quickly and for longer.
The extent to which the freedom of the press is at stake in Algeria is also patently obvious from the official resistance which the newspaper publisher, Omar Belhouchet, has experienced over the past couple of months when he imported a new printing press from Germany.
His statement speaks volumes: 'To Algeria, that piece of equipment represents a technological, but mainly a political, revolution.
At long last, the state printing office can no longer prevent our publications.
We have taken a portion of the power from those in power.'
How exactly?
By not succumbing to the contempt of the citizens and their rights by the current regime, by openly defying the arbitrariness of political authorities, police and justice, which act in the interest of the ruling clans.
The Algerians sum up this abhorrent government attitude in a single word: 'hogra' .
It is precisely this 'hogra' , according to critical Algerian minds, that drove their own young people into the terrorist tentacles of the fundamentalists.
'Hogra' is, in other words, the key word in Algeria' s tragedy today.
By way of healing social antidote to 'hogra' , the Algerian independent press - referred to as 'the incorruptibles' at home - deserves the support of the European institutions.
As and when possible, they must provide the vital oxygen for this pilot light of the Algerian freedom of press, not least during the negotiations involving the country' s authorities.
For in the final analysis, only the independent press in Algeria raises the issues which are really preoccupying the minds of the citizens.
And what does this country, weighed down by so much violence, need more than an honest, public, political debate?
Mr President, since December 1991, Algeria has been in a situation of permanent violence.
According to the official figures 100 000 people have died during that period, which represents around 1 200 deaths per month, and the figures that the non-official organisations are giving are even worse.
In April 1999 the new President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, ordered a partial amnesty, a law of civil concord, and promised fundamental reforms in order to put an end to the ongoing crisis in the country.
So far, however, this policy has had a very limited effect.
It does not seem to have been accepted as a true policy of total democratisation and reconciliation.
The terrorist activity of the violent fundamentalists has continued, and the situation has been aggravated by the violence of the last few weeks in Kabylia, where demonstrations by hundreds of young people, following the violent death of one of them in a police station, were very violently suppressed in a real bloodbath, which left more than 60 young people dead from police bullets.
The situation is really very critical.
It is, of course, an Algerian problem, which can only be resolved by Algerians and between Algerians, through a process that democratically restructures and gives greater legitimacy to the institutions and the State, through the agreement of all the political and social sectors who reject violence, from whatever source, and which can, in the face of the violent fundamentalists and also the sectors of the current ruling power that are resistant to change, achieve greater transparency and the participation of all the peaceful forces in the reconstruction of the country.
This is a very complicated and difficult task, and the European Union should not miss the target in its support for those in positions of responsibility in the country, supporting all those who are coming from the point of view of peace and democracy.
We should act without seeking to interfere, but with firmness and a positive spirit to promote human rights and the democratic process.
Tomorrow, a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Algeria.
I hope this debate will help to clarify our attitude, which is an entirely positive one, supporting the whole democratic political field in the country, in the institutions and in society, in finding a way out of this violent situation when there does not seem to be one.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the outburst of violence which rocked the region of Kabylia was, unfortunately, predictable - or even inevitable.
Instead of worrying if this sort of social explosion might happen, we should have been forecasting when it would happen.
The region of Kabylia is a microcosm of all the ills which beset Algeria, with its unfortunate colonial parentage, a microcosm of the national cohesion which has never quite made it and is based on democratic and legal institutions and a rule of law which have never been credibly founded.
And, centre stage on this Algerian social scene, masses of young people, the life force of the nation, crammed into a few urban centres facing nothing but mass unemployment.
What choice did they have other than to rebel and bemoan their fate?
Are they supposed to keep quiet as well?
And what policy can the Algerian government engage in other than to establish proper rule of law, starting today with committees of inquiry.
Is the government supposed to turn a blind eye as well?
Surely - and this is vital - it should at long last offer Algerians a real future by introducing economic reform.
Otherwise, this fire will continue to smoulder beneath the surface of Algeria.
Mr President, Algeria has a turbulent history.
Colonial rule, which destroyed the country's traditional structures, was followed by a brutal war.
After this brutal war, a socialist one-party system was established which finally collapsed as a result of corruption.
Today, the country of Algeria - this large and important country - faces two major challenges. Firstly, there is a youth revolt in progress, for Algeria is a young country, and its young people are rebelling because they feel that no one cares about them and they have no future.
When social exclusion is combined with national sentiment, the result is powerful and explosive.
Secondly, there is the danger of Islamism, which is systematically fomented by certain groups.
We must therefore give the country our support, but we must proceed very sensitively.
President Bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up Algeria.
He has moved towards reform.
A few weeks ago, he held a landmark ceremony to honour St Augustine.
We might regard this as gesture politics, but he wanted to show that St Augustine's origins lie in what is now Algeria.
In doing so, he also wanted to tell his people that as Algerians in an Islamic country, they have cultural links with Europe and therefore also with the Christian world.
These are signs of openness, and they are important.
This kind of gesture politics, however, is not enough. Real and substantive reforms are required.
They must include press freedom, the rule of law, but also tolerance towards different nationalities and ethnic groups.
Traditionally, Berbers have cultivated their own culture and identity and have maintained a substantial measure of independence in Kabylie.
This third major revolt among the Kabyle people sends out an alarm signal, for it is a revolt by young people who feel marginalised by the Algerian state.
