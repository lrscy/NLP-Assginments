The consequences for employment, social cohesion in an area around the company, consumers and the scope for a democratically determined government policy is extremely negative.
That is why manageable, checkable and small-scale companies are far preferable to global giants, that are constantly surprising others and laying down the law to them.
Mergers that provide no right of veto for trade unions and government lead to accidents.
I reject this trade in companies and am voting against the proposal.
. (NL) Unfortunately, as regards the Takeover Directive, I was forced to vote against the findings of the Conciliation Committee.
I consider it a great shame that partly because of my "no" vote so many years of work have been lost.
But ultimately the quality of the end product must be our guide.
The end product is not good, partly because it makes the position of European companies facing American takeover bids too weak and specifically weaker than that of an American company targeted by a European bidder.
Moreover, everything is concentrated on only one aspect, namely increased capitalisation, while other defensive techniques or instruments are not coordinated.
Anyone who believes that as a result of this proposal European companies will be dealt with on an equal footing, is proved wrong.
I regret, in all sincerity, that for these reasons I was bound to vote against.
Recommendation for second reading Rothe (A5-0227/2001)
Madam President, recently, I visited the beautiful island of Capri which has sun, sea and blue sky, and I remembered another beautiful island, this one in Sweden: the island of Gotland. That island is also beautiful, with sea, sky, sun and ... windmills!
Madam President, these islands are very windy and there were devices which convert wind energy into electricity.
There you are: this is the sort of Europe I like, and I believe the European citizens would like it too.
Therefore, I voted in favour of greater commitment to renewable energies.
Madam President, we have voted today, in a second reading, on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.
The Commission' s White Paper has set us an indicative target, namely that 12% of gross energy consumption should be covered from renewable sources by 2010.
In order to achieve this goal, we must promote the generation of electricity from renewable sources by means of various incentives, as we are still a long way from achieving this target.
New technologies need unbureaucratic, simple and effective promotion mechanisms.
I would like to take this opportunity to underline, above all, the importance of renewable energies for the rural regions.
The production of energy and the cultivation of energy crops offer an alternative income-generation opportunity for our farmers in Europe, which must be exploited.
The multifunctionality of the rural regions can thus be strengthened and increased.
I see this as a major opportunity for agriculture and dynamic rural development in a united Europe.
Madam President, we have just voted on the definition of renewable energy sources, and we also defined the concept of biomass more precisely.
It was said that biomass shall mean the biodegradable fraction of products from agriculture, forestry and related industries.
Although Parliament has unfortunately not reproduced the definition we agreed on last time, according to which peat should count among the renewables, inasmuch as it regenerates each year, I would like to state that peat should be implicitly included in the version now agreed.
Every gardener knows that peat is a biodegradable product.
It breaks down entirely - obviously, as it is generated biologically.
Bacteria and microbes cause it to decompose if it is taken away from its oxygen-free state.
It also decomposes on the surface of marshland.
This is what the theory of peat growth is based upon: marshland grows where there is more peat growing than decomposing.
As these are the facts, and they are not going to change, I hope that Parliament, the Commission and the Council will make the implicit explicit and make clear mention of peat in the future.
This I hope for in the name of environmental protection.
In my own amendment, adopted by Parliament in November, restrictions were imposed on the use of peat: the capital would not be touched, but just the interest would be used.
Environmental organisations, which based their views on outdated knowledge regarding the carbon cycle of marshlands, paradoxically opposed my design to prevent the exploitation of marshes, and this is the result: greed leads to a sorry end, and so, probably, does environmental greed too.
I hope the debate will continue.
- (FR) The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy unanimously approved the report by Mrs Rothe on the Council common position on the directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources (RES) in the internal electricity market.
The common position adopted in March differs considerably from the position Parliament adopted at first reading last November, even though the Council has accepted about one third of Parliament' s proposed amendments.
The rapporteur went to great lengths to achieve a compromise before the second reading in the EP and explained to the committee that the Council had agreed to eight of the nine compromise amendments during the trialogue held on Tuesday, 19 June.
The only outstanding point was whether waste incineration should be regarded as a renewable energy source.
The Council wants to include it.
Members, however, have pointed out that the support given to renewable energy sources must be compatible with the other Community objectives, in particular the principle of "respect for the waste treatment hierarchy".
That is why the incineration of non-separated household waste should not be promoted under this directive and under a future support system for renewable energy sources.
Where the two legislative bodies disagreed most profoundly was on the question whether the national targets for the use of renewable energy sources should be mandatory or merely indicative.
In November, Parliament called emphatically for mandatory targets, but the Council was opposed.
The compromise stipulates that if the Member States have not made progress towards achieving their national indicative objectives, the Commission shall present proposals that may contain mandatory targets.
The national indicative targets must be consistent with the global indicative target of 12% of gross national energy consumption by 2010 from renewable energy sources.
At the same time, these renewable energy sources must account for a 22.1% indicative share of total Community electricity consumption.
(Explanation cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (IT) The importance of renewable energy and increasing its use in Europe are at the basis of the measure we are examining at second reading.
I would like to reiterate, on this occasion, my satisfaction at the united effort that sets the important figure of 12% as the target for the share of the European electricity market produced from renewable sources which also benefit the environment to be reached by 2010: we know how topical these issues are, especially in relation to climate change.
This means that the 'white gold' , the water used in mountainous areas of Europe to generate hydroelectric power, will clearly acquire greater value as a fundamental resource for the mountain economy.
I am pleased that, as recorded in the Minutes, some of the improvements I suggested figure decisively in the text.
This will make it possible - a substantial, tangible example, albeit on a small scale - for my Valle d' Aosta, an Alpine region par excellence, to focus on and invest in the hydroelectric sector, after being deprived for 40 years of a great asset in terms of the wealth of the local economy by the nationalisation and monopoly of the electricity sector in Italy, a situation which is only now being remedied thanks to the European impetus, which is opening the doors once again for regional competences granted, in the case of my Valle d' Aosta, by the Statute of autonomy.
In this sense, it is a good thing that the European Union is attaching due importance to that - by definition - renewable source, hydroelectric power, providing security and incentive mechanisms on the market which will certainly benefit the mountainous areas as well, particularly those where the electricity companies are directly managed by the local communities.
. -(NL) As a result of market forces, where the main objective is to find the cheapest rather than the cleanest electricity, we are threatened with a new upsurge of polluting fuels such as nuclear energy, coal, brown coal and oil.
In the Netherlands relatively clean power stations have been shut down to enable dirty electricity to be imported.
The replacement as soon as possible of those dirty fuels by solar, wind and hydroelectric power is indispensable for the preservation of our environment.
Instead of campaigning actively for new forms of electricity generation the individual consumer is first asked to buy cleaner energy at a different price from another supplier.
Those suppliers can now supply less clean electricity than the consumer is asking for.
This leads to attempts to include more forms of electricity generation with clean energy.
The incineration of undivided organic domestic waste and wood waste has always taken place, and is now suddenly included in the clean category so that targets can be met.
My support for the generation of clean energy does not apply to this addition.
Large-scale investment that anticipates requests from consumers and is not dependent on waste collection are an alternative to the system at present required by the Council.
. (SV) We Swedish Christian Democrats welcome the Directive on electricity from renewable energy sources.
We accept that the electricity gained from incinerating that part of household waste which is biodegradable should be included in the national guiding targets.
However, we would like to see incineration of unsorted household waste not being counted as electricity deriving from a renewable energy source.
Therefore, we do not accept that incineration of unsorted household waste should receive aid.
We believe that the compromise negotiated with the Council in this case is too weak.
In this regard the Council has reached a decision, but not understood its significance.
However, we believe that the importance of the directive being adopted as quickly as possible, especially in view of the vital role which the EU has and must retain during the coming climate negotiations, constitutes sufficient grounds for supporting the compromise which has been negotiated with the Council in this respect.
We therefore choose to support the compromise.
Karas report (A5-0220/2001)
Madam President, the Karas report concerns professional pension funds.
Today, Madam President, is not 4 July 2001: it is 4 July 2030.
Do not worry about calculating how old we will be in 2030; just listen to the rest of this explanation of vote.
In 2030, a French pensioner meets an English pensioner and says to him: 'Look what a good pension we have got!
Just think: in the year 2000, the European citizens' pensions were less than half the size of ours.
And how did we manage it?
By adopting a further European directive compelling all the States to transfer all the pension funds paid to the State up until that time into professional funds, which managed the money well and thus generated good pensions' .
- (FR) The draft directive and the Karas report on pension funds and supplementary systems represent yet another attack on the existing pension schemes in the European Union.
The Karas report draws on the very liberal conclusions of the Feira European Council in approving the directive.
It takes an 'Anglo-Saxon' approach to regulation, based on a minimum of harmonisation, as reflected in the absence of specific rules to define the commitments entered into by the pension funds.
The directive meets the demands of the UK and Netherlands pension funds, which want to be able to intervene at European level by having a single fund instead of separate funds set up in each country.
Once again, the European Union is surrendering to the dictatorship of the single market, this time in regard to retirement pensions, with the consequences we know so well: even worse inequality between workers, the stranglehold of the financial markets and shareholders on retirement savings schemes, and heavier pension fund pressure on employees.
Instead of harmonising downwards and creating a single retirement pension market, we should set up a system based on solidarity and equality at European level.
That is why we voted against the Karas report and reject the proposal for a directive.
. (NL) Entrepreneurs have discovered company pension funds as a source of venture capital.
Governments regard those funds as part of an integrated financial market designed to contribute to the competitive power of the European economy.
In expectation of increased returns pension capital is passed on to companies whose sole object is to make profit.
Soon the shareholders of banks and insurance companies start benefiting from profits, the retired bear the increased risk as a result of protective instruments being eliminated and the disadvantages of moving to a different employer or to another Member State are not resolved.
The proposed European regulation does not do justice to the reasons why those pension reserves were created.
Pensions are a means of redistributing and supplementing incomes, offering everyone lasting social security, even when, at the age of 70, 90 or 110, they are no longer productive.
An equal state pension for all of a sufficient amount is the best guarantee that no one loses the right to an income.
On the other hand company pensions are only favourable for those with permanent highly paid jobs.
They offer no solution to people who have frequently had to change jobs or employers.
That is even more true of supplementary private pensions, which are only affordable by those who are able and willing to invest surpluses in an insurance company in their productive years.
Ettl report (A5-0211/2001)
Mr Ettl' s report concerns the solvency of life assurance undertakings.
I feel, Madam President, that Europe, which cares so much about the quality of life of the European citizens and the quality of all kinds of consumer goods, should force life assurance undertakings to respect this directive and subscribe to the declaration: 'This is a reliable assurance company in accordance with the European directive' .
For example, they could use the format: 'Such-and-such assurance, reliable' , so that the citizens will know that the assurance undertaking uses its funds well.
Ettl report (A5-0212/2001)
Mr Ettl' s second report provides greater guarantees that insurance undertakings other than life assurance undertakings will remain solvent too.
Well then, I was thinking about that last night, Madam President.
I slept extremely badly last night and had a real nightmare.
Why is that?
I dreamt, I am sorry to say, that the house where I live was going to be destroyed; I was running out of the bedroom and, distraught, I saw Mr Fatuzzo' s house fall in ruins.
My despair was all the greater because I was insured with a dreadful insurance company.
At that moment, I woke up and remembered that, I am glad to say, I am insured with a good insurance company and, most importantly, my house is still standing and I am in Strasbourg.
Flesch report (A5-0226/2001)
Madam President, in order to illustrate my explanation of vote on Mrs Flesch' s report concerning the '.EU' designation in computers, I have to tell you that, in the last few days, right here in Strasbourg, I met a very attractive girl from one of the Eastern European countries, one of the countries that have applied to join our Union.
While we were talking, as we walked along, the young girl from this country - a Bulgarian country - asked me: -Why do you not authorise the candidate countries that want to join the European Union to use the '.EU' Internet domain as well?'
That is why I am putting this question to Mrs Flesch.
- (FR) This report is about a proposal for a regulation on the Internet Top Level Domain '.EU' .
The Commission proposal is a response to the instructions of the Lisbon Council (23-24 March 2000).
The Stockholm Council (23-24 March 2001) confirmed that "the Council will take the necessary measures, together with the Commission, to ensure that the .EU top-level domain is available to users as soon as possible."
This wording may sound a little far-fetched and need some explanation.
The regulation is meant to be a general act laying down a framework for the creation of an '.EU' registry.
This registry should enter into contracts both with the Commission and with ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
Let me remind you that ICANN was created in October 1998 in order to stand up to American hegemony in Internet running.
This private, non-profit-making company is concerned with four key Internet sectors, including DNS (domain name systems) and allocating Internet Protocol addresses.
ICANN has a Policy Advisory Board of 19 members.
Its external directors and members are appointed on a geographically balanced basis.
ICANN also has four advisory committees, including the GAC (Governmental Advisory Committee) to which the European Commission and the Member States belong.
To my great satisfaction, the European Union has decided to devote more attention to this body so as to play a decisive part in the international running of the Internet and to make ICANN more neutral.
In the same context, if the European Union wishes to exist in cyberspace, it will have to create a domain name like its Member States.
Then the national territories will be able to recognise each other on the Internet by means of domain names such as '.uk' or '.be' .
That would certainly be a factor in speeding up the development of the e-economy and e-commerce in Europe.
I therefore felt it important to endorse the good work done by the rapporteur.
Gothenburg European Council
Madam President, I would also like to comment on the report on the Gothenburg Council.
As you know, it was decided at the Council to tackle the issue of pensions in the 15 States of the European Union resolutely.
In your opinion, how could I not take the floor to explain why I voted for the motion?
Yesterday, at lunchtime, at a meeting of the Kangaroo group, here at the European Parliament, I listened with pleasure to the leader of a Japanese company, who said: 'We Japanese industrialists are waiting anxiously for there to be a single European pension in Europe, governed by the same rules and laws throughout Europe' .
Therefore, I am not the only one to call for a European pension!
I rejoice at this and so I voted for this report because the Gothenburg Council has started out along this path.
Madam President, in this resolution, we have expressed our views on the issue of Macedonia, and I would just like to say that I welcome the European Union' s active commitment in Macedonia.
However, we should not proceed in a didactic way, but on the basis of respect for the people and nations there.
Macedonia has an all-party government in which all the nations are also represented.
It has a pro-European prime minister and an outstanding pro-European president.
If we continually talk about minority rights, we must acknowledge for once that the European standards on minority rights which we constantly refer to actually do not exist, unfortunately, in the EU itself.
We really would be well-advised, therefore, to approach the matter with some measure of humility. We can offer our services, but we should be careful not to adopt a didactic approach all the time.
Above all, we should strengthen the government by making it clear that countries such as Macedonia which work with the European Union will also receive massive political and financial support from us.
This was why I thought it was regrettable that Commissioner Patten, who is unfortunately no longer present, said that if we were to provide funds, the money would simply be used for bombs.
This was a most inappropriate statement towards this democratically elected all-party government. I hope that our Macedonian friends, represented by their President, will visit us here in Strasbourg soon, and that the visit by Boris Trajkovski can be rescheduled.
We must tackle the signs of disintegration, but we can only do so by strengthening the country' s democratic authorities.
Madam President, in the interest of a democratic and just European Union I ask the Council to respect the Irish people' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice by immediately halting further ratification.
I also call on the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that the requirement for unanimity is upheld.
I likewise request that all further ratifications stop.
I, and those people I represent, support a united democratic Europe and enlargement.
I welcome, therefore, the Commission' s confirmation of my understanding that enlargement can proceed without the ratification of the Nice Treaty.
I believe that enlargement should proceed with all speed so that the accession countries can not only share in the benefits of European Union membership, but also contribute fully to the debate on the kind of European Union we hope to build.
I support a full and open debate prior to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference, but not in the form of a convention.
- (FR) The European Union is about to invent a new form of democracy: democracy without the people.
That is the only conclusion we can draw from the arrogant way the Gothenburg Council dismissed the Irish vote.
Today the new President-in-Office of the Council, Guy Verhofstadt, has just confirmed this impression by giving us a preview of the conclusions of the debate that is supposed to be held in preparation for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.
The way this debate is being organised in France, following the communiquÃ© of 11 April this year published jointly by the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, makes it quite clear that it has been rigged from the start.
Various people pretend they want to initiate a discussion on the future of Europe, but our country deliberately evaded the issue of the ratification of the Nice Treaty, which is vital in this regard.
The Constitutional Council was not consulted, there was no referendum, the debates in the French National Assembly and the Senate were extremely short, the speeches were mediocre, except for those of members of the pro-sovereignty group, including Philippe de Villiers, who seem to be the only ones to have retained their freedom of thought in this debacle that has hit the national political community.
This means that the document that is most crucial to the future of the Union, the new supranational developments set out in the Nice Treaty, have been taken out of the debate.
For the rest, it is clear that everything has been organised in such a way that the discussion forums only produce conclusions acceptable to the federalists.
Not only are the meetings prepared by the prefects - which says a lot about their independence vis Ã  vis the government - their conclusions will actually be drafted by a group of ten experts freely chosen by the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister.
I myself wrote to the two heads of the executive on 20 April this year to ask them to ensure that this group was made up of all the political elements elected at the European elections.
The result is plain to see: among the appointments that have just been made it would be hard to find any opposition, however slight, to the line pursued by Brussels.
To crown it all, this ridiculous procedure is to be closed in October, which means that the great national debate will have lasted four months, of which two were holiday months.
But it is easy to understand why it will be concluded so speedily: at the end of the year we will be entering the dangerous period when we have to exchange our national coins and banknotes for euros.
Clearly, our national leaders have no wish to be burdened with a debate about Europe at that particular moment.
UE/NGL), in writing. (EL) The Gothenburg Summit will go down in history not just for what happened inside the conference room but also for what happened outside it.
The tens of thousands of demonstrators expressing their opposition to the anti-grass roots, autocratic, centralised structure of the ÃU were dealt with by the police with unprecedented violence, proving yet again that the leaders of the ÃU make their decisions without consulting the people.
Not only does the European Parliament resolution fail to make any reference to the demands of thousands of demonstrators, let alone the victims of police violence, it also talks of special riot squads, thereby helping to pave the way for even harsher, anti-democratic measures to deal with "the enemy" at future summits of the ÃU and other imperialist organisations.
Faced with the Irish "no" to the Treaty of Nice, the European Parliament has aligned with the Council, which is determined, so it says, to help in any way it can in assisting the Irish government to find a solution, thereby pressurising the Irish government into ratifying the Treaty by the end of 2002 come what may and disregarding the opinion expressed by the Irish people.
When it comes to the tragic developments in the FYROM, the resolution approves both of the interventionist policy and of NATO' s intention not to get drawn into taking on a full peacekeeping role.
Of course, how the EU perceives the process of reaching agreement was clearly expressed by the special envoy Mr Leotard, who called on the government of the FYROM to institute a dialogue with the Albanian extremists.
The resolution even approves of progress made in militarising the ÃU, developing the rapid reaction force and establishing permanent and constructive relations with ÃÃÃÃ and it calls on the Member States to restructure their defence budgets to take account of the sums required in order to achieve the ambitious objectives of the CFSP.
On the question of enlargement, the internal imperialist contradictions which have arisen notwithstanding, its insistence on a policy of trapping new countries in the ÃU is clear, even if the timetable is becoming more and more obscure.
At the same time, because they know that grass-roots opposition to the prospect of integration is increasing in the candidate countries, they are trying to lure them with the prospect of taking part in European elections in 2004.
For the rest, the Gothenburg summit confirmed the direction taken in Lisbon and Stockholm, which requires that the state of the economy be tackled with harsher, even more anti-grass roots measures which hit the workers, starting with the pension system and the national insurance systems in general.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution.
- (FR) In January 2001, the Swedish presidency of the European Union modestly announced three priorities: the environment, enlargement and employment.
Six months later, with the Gothenburg Council, we have to acknowledge failure.
In employment, this period was marked by a huge wave of redundancies in large transnational groups that are making millions of euros in profits, like Marks & Spencer and Danone.
The EU has once again proved unable to counterbalance the dictatorship of the markets and shareholders, for example by introducing a tax on speculation - such as the 'Tobin tax' - by strengthening employees' and citizens' rights of economic control or by introducing European-level legislation banning redundancies.
In relation to enlargement, the only prospect opened to the candidate countries is quite simply for their economy to be absorbed into the single market.
At no moment will the people concerned be consulted on either the contents or the implications of accession.
Yet the Irish 'no' vote shows once again that Europe cannot be built without the people and without their support for a democratic, political and social project.
Finally, at international level, the European Union has shown itself unable to make a positive contribution to resolving conflicts, notably by imposing a just and lasting peace in Palestine on Israel.
The Swedish presidency will be marked mainly by the provocative police actions that punctuated the Gothenburg summit.
Instead of embarking as they should on a thorough review of the European projects, the governments, from their bunker, have for the first time turned to violence and fired on the demonstrators.
We urgently need a different Europe: a Europe based on democracy and social progress.
That is why we voted against the joint motion for a resolution.
. There is much to commend in this resolution, especially in terms of sustainable development.
I welcome the call for the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is an essential international agreement in terms of protecting our planet.
I welcome the renewed commitment to reaching the UN target for development assistance and hope that, at last, this will be achieved as there is a desperate need for this.
I also welcome the need expressed for the EU to prepare fully for the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Why then did I abstain on the motion as a whole?
I do not believe that developing a Common Security Policy, which seeks to link us closely to NATO, has any part in the sustainable development of the EU.
Nor do I believe that we should be asking Ireland to negate its recent referendum and prepare for the ratification of the Nice Treaty.
Such a call ignores the democratically expressed wishes of the people and does this House no credit.
- (FR) The joint resolution modelled on the report of the European Council held on 15-16 June 2001 in Gothenburg is the combined effort of the green, pink and white liberals and the purple Christian Democrats, i.e. of a syncretic and political majority ranging from Messrs SchrÃ¶der-Jospin to Messrs Aznar-Chirac, via the Greens, the Joschka Fischers and Dominique Voynets and the ultra-liberals of Alain Madelin. It is like a jumble sale of words, concepts and issues ranging from the death penalty (paragraph 32) to the 'tax package' (paragraph 25), via bananas (paragraph 30), Mr LÃ©otard' s diplomatic mission to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has now become FYROM (paragraph 42), not forgetting residually the CAP, development aid, Kyoto, the US tax fraud via the Caribbean tax havens, enlargement and the need for a convention - in unsaid memory of Philadelphia in 1787 - to adopt a European constitution in 2004.
But beneath all this apparent jumble of bric-a-brac lie the two key notes of the oligarchic sect that governs us, namely contempt for the people and the quest for an obscure world 'governance' .
The contempt in which the euro-federal oligarchy in Brussels holds the people is reflected in both paragraph 3, with the refusal to respect the clear implications of the Irish referendum, which is analysed as a kind of deadlock from which 'a way forward' must be found, and in paragraph 9, where the spontaneous rejection by the people of the excesses of globalisation - from Seattle to Gothenburg, via Prague, Nice, Davos, Washington, Salzburg and perhaps Genoa next - is condemned as 'provocation' , forgetting that the right to 'resist' the economic pressure the global market is exerting on the women and men of Marks & Spencer and Danone, not to mention Moulinex, Michelin, Vilvorde, Alcatel, Ericsson and AOM, is one of the basic freedoms that was established two centuries before the European Charter, which proclaims for the rich alone formal rights that the unemployed, the excluded young and the old and poor do not, for their part, regard as fundamental.
Similarly, the nine paragraphs devoted to sustained development - even going so far as a world summit in Johannesburg in 2002 - can scarcely conceal, in the dark recesses of this vague concept that has become a kind of catechism, the quest for a global approach that would miraculously resolve the problems, facing Africa in particular, of under-development, the AIDS epidemic and the economic slavery and poverty so skilfully maintained by the free traders who do not pay the real price for cotton, cocoa, coffee and all the raw materials, i.e. the price of the life of the people whose labour they exploit.
I have noticed that recent events have borne out my predictions on 15 March and 3 May.
Just read up on them in the Minutes, if you so wish.
I said then that pledging support to the Macedonian Government and condemning so-called extremists would not lead to the search for solutions, peace and conciliation, but to the encouragement of violence.
A section of the Macedonian population and of the Macedonian Government believes that all the problems will be solved by ignoring or driving away the large Albanian minority.
That section is keen to buy weapons with EU subsidies.
They continue to reject an arrangement whereby Albanian becomes the language of administration and education for that part of the country where the Albanian-speakers live.
I do not expect a sustainable solution without a state arrangement similar to that in Belgium.
I wish the Council and Commission much success in their attempts at long last to ensure that their interference does not lead to more violence and suppression, but to a peaceful solution which is sustained by all the parties
. (PT) I did not feel able to vote in favour of the Joint Resolution on the Gothenburg Summit, despite the fact that it contains several positive conclusions, specifically with regard to enlargement, to the circumstances surrounding the summit, to the follow-up to the Lisbon European Council, to external relations and to the Middle East in particular, amongst others.
Nevertheless, I have been forced to abstain by the fact that a majority of Members of this Parliament still insist on a post-Nice model for debate which, in terms of both method and content, goes further, not only than the conclusions of the Heads of State and Government in Nice, but also than the very Treaties currently in force, especially with regard to its harsh criticism of the intergovernmental method and its ambition to establish a broader, not to say quite unrealistic agenda for this debate.
Nor do I consider Conclusion No 5 to be a positive addition, because I do not feel that it is the Irish Government' s place to ratify the Treaty. It is up to the Irish people, in accordance with the constitution of that country.
- (FR) A European Parliament resolution on the Gothenburg summit might have been useful if it had taken a less offhand approach to the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty than the Council did in its conclusions. This is another example of the extremely disturbing decline of democracy in the process of European integration.
Alas, the resolution did not do so.
Henceforth, however, whenever we consider the future of Europe, and in particular its enlargement, we will have to take this quite unambiguous vote into account.
How can we deplore the very largely anti-democratic nature of the European Union in its present form and pretend to want to remedy this if we do not begin by respecting the clearly expressed wish of the people, in this case of the only nation asked to pronounce on the new treaty by referendum, an eminently democratic procedure?
Following on from two referendums that had already shown the growing gap between Europe as it is and the Europe the people want to see, the Irish people' s decision should give us a salutary shock.
The lesson to be drawn from the Irish referendum is that Europe can only endure in the long term if it is founded on respect for the national democracies.
We urgently need to review completely the way Europe is being constructed, basing it on principles quite different from those of Nice, which should represent the final manifestation of a process that began with the Single Act and continued with Maastricht and Amsterdam, concluding with a Europe that is now rejected by its people.
Clearly this is not the direction the Belgian presidency wishes to pursue.
It in fact proposes to make up for the democratic deficit within the Union by introducing a European tax, although only the national parliaments are democratically entitled to levy taxes.
It is in favour of having the future treaty drawn up by bodies whose democratic legitimacy is, if not doubtful, at least very indirect.
It exalts the euro, which no nation wished to see introduced and which, on the contrary, is emblematic of a Europe imposed on the people against their wishes.
The Irish lesson does not seem to have been understood.
Sooner or later, however, we will have to listen to the people.
Sooner would be best if we want to restore their belief in a European idea in which they are currently losing faith.
. Today on the Gothenburg summit resolution I abstained overall, and recommended to my UK Conservative colleagues to do likewise, since, although we fully support the references to welcoming the enlargement process of the EU and the calls for supporting reform of CAP and sustainable development, we had a number of reservations on other aspects of the report.
These include, paragraph 3, which may be seen to suggest that the EU is not fully respecting the decision of the Irish people in their referendum to reject the Nice Treaty; paragraph 6 which recommends a controversial Convention model to take the negotiations forward to the next IGC; paragraph 25 which supports the tax package involving tax harmonisation and a withholding tax; paragraph 26 which recommends social-chapter-inspired works council measures; and paragraphs 33 and 34 which are supportive of an independent ESDP which could decouple us from NATO.
Otherwise there are many positive aspects to the report, so overall an abstention was the correct position in the view of the UK Conservatives.
Randzio-Plath report (A5-0225/2001)
- (FR) The European Parliament' s report on the financial year 2000 of the ECB and that bank' s own Annual Report on the same subject attempt to iron out their differences of appraisal and present a united front on the eve of the physical changeover to euro coins and banknotes.
As soon as we scratch the surface, however, we discover contradictions, which have extremely serious implications because they go back to certain faults in the construction of the single currency that will be very difficult to put right.
Let us begin, for example, with the institutional issues.
The first difference concerns the powers of the Council of Ministers. The European Parliament' s report advocates the strengthening of economic policy coordination and stability programmes (paragraph 5 of the resolution), which would mean strengthening the Eurogroup and its means of action.
The ECB report, however, emphasises that "the first two years of the euro have also shown that the policy-making framework at European level is satisfactory" (page 3).
This makes it clear that the Bank is fiercely protective of its independence, knowing full well that the growing political pressure on the management of the single currency, within a monetary zone that is not optimal, risks leading to difficult conflicts.
But is management by technocrats any better?
To tell the truth, both systems are unworkable.
The second difference concerns transparency. The European Parliament' s report calls once again (paragraph 14) for the minutes of the ECB Governing Council meetings to be published, together with a summary of the stance of both the approving and dissenting parties.
The ECB finds this proposal repugnant, for a very good reason that the European Parliament obstinately refuses to accept: in the specific case of the eurozone, made up of separate nations, conflicts between governors could easily be assimilated with conflicts between nations, which would do further damage to the already weak credibility of the euro.
Once again, this brings us back to the non-optimal nature of the monetary zone of the Twelve.
The third difference concerns voting in the Governing Council. The ECB report upholds the "one member, one vote" principle, because the governors of the national central banks deliberate with entire personal independence and not as representatives of their country (page 181).
The European Parliament' s report, for its part, takes note of the reform introduced by the Nice Treaty to Article 10 of the Statute of the ECB, which could make it possible, in future, to weight the votes in accordance with size of country (paragraph 17 of the resolution).
That reform would suit the large countries, especially Germany, which is complaining of the ECB' s failure to act, implicitly blaming this on the disproportionate influence of the small countries within the Governing Council.
However, this would be very difficult to carry through because it seems contrary to the spirit of Maastricht, to the ECB' s position and to the interests of the small countries, which would have something to say about it.
Once again, the idea of a single currency for several nations is beset by contradictions.
. (PT) The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing its basic aim of guaranteeing price stability, which means, in practice, maintaining moderation in wage increases in the eurozone.
This is a short-sighted aim, based on controlling inflation, which ignores the contribution of monetary policy to economic growth and employment.
This is a concern which, if carried to the extreme, could cause deflation and unemployment.
The ECB is using this aim as a justification, even in the midst of an economic slowdown, for not reducing interest rates to stimulate investment or reducing the costs of excessive debt for families and other economic agents, forgetting that the eurozone is not a homogeneous area and that the cohesion countries in particular, including Portugal, face specific structural difficulties.
This is the policy for monetary stability imposed by the Stability Pact, which the rapporteur is so pleased with, and with which we disagree, even though it does attempt to implement the ECB' s policies, by means of greater economic coordination and greater development of the quarterly dialogue with the European Parliament.
The ECB, however, requires effective political supervision and not just economic coordination, which is increasingly linked to the objectives of the Stability Pact and to the EU' s neo-liberal guidelines.
. (NL) In the run-up to the compulsory exchange of bank notes and coins of eleven Member States for euro coins and notes all attention is being focused on the annoyance that this will generate shortly after the turn of the year.
Mr Maaten' s proposals attempt to make that process run faster and more efficiently.
But the fundamental problem is more connected with the annual report of the European Central Bank.
Unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, the rapporteur, I see no reason for compliments.
The value of the euro had to be kept up by means of a stability pact, which forces national governments to reduce the level of expenditure and refrain from taking out loans.
That policy has failed completely, now that the euro has fallen considerably below the dollar, not temporarily, but for a considerable amount of time.
In the meantime, in a number of Member States, including the Netherlands, annual inflation is already higher than the interest rate.
Price stability will probably not survive the coming turn of the year.
It no longer looks as if the euro will gain a position as an international currency, as the dollar has.
As a result, it is not possible either to follow the American model and pass on a portion of the annual government deficit to the rest of the world, which continues to compete for possession of an exchange currency that is falling in value.
In short, the ECB' s efforts have resulted in a flop that forces us to reject this annual report.
. (EL) The report by the European Central Bank under discussion covers its 2nd year in operation following the start of the third stage of EMU.
This is precisely why the European Parliament needs to be even stricter and more demanding in its criticism of the ECB' s annual report, because there are results which hit the workers and because it supports closer links between the general guidelines to economic policy and the stability and convergence programmes.
On the pretext of fighting inflation and adhering strictly to the Stability Pact, that 'plague' on the workers, the ECB has activated the sanctions mechanism in order to achieve that wonder of wonders, price stability, while ignoring the economic and social impact of its decisions.
It announces that wage policy is to be modernised, for which read flexible and insecure labour, and it is pushing for privatisation across the board in order to promote the competitiveness of and reward big business.
But it says nothing about speculation and "scams" on the money markets, given that its policy of cutting interest rates does everything it can to support them.
So far, the European Central Bank has raised or lowered its interest rates in line with US interest rates in a bid to fund speculation.
Will Mr Duisenberg tell us if he subscribes to the views of his counterpart, Mr Greenspan, who feels that the new growth cycle should be based on greater returns from the huge amount of capital at the disposal of companies whose performance is what will shore up stock prices and trigger a new round of investments?
He probably agrees because he has told us that the executive board of the ECB is continuing to monitor wage developments and trends in domestic and foreign demand and that, despite the oil crisis, wage increases were moderate, which he described as highly positive, stressing that inflation will be kept to 2% in 2002 thanks to wage restraint, while the monopolies' profits will, of course, keep on rising.
What else can we say?
The report and the governor of the ECB say it all.
They have told us about the acutely negative liberal policy which pushes economies into recession and what they have announced for the workers is greater unemployment, the abolition of everything they have fought for and a guaranteed level of poverty, given that prosperity is reserved for big business, which is getting bigger by the day.
We are therefore against the European Parliament' s supporting the policy of the ECB, because it is a policy which generates more poverty for the many, i.e. for the workers, and more profit for the few, i.e. for the European monopolies.
It is a policy of inequality and increased exploitation of the workers.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report and we believe that the people will unite in their fight to overturn this anti-grass roots, barbaric and inhumane policy.
. (NL) My group voted against Paragraph 20.
The reason for this is as follows. Paragraph 20 talks of a tightening of the conditions that countries entering the European Union must meet if they wish to become part of EMU.
We are not against a debate on the Member States' joining of the EMU, but feel that it is a little premature at this moment.
It will be at least two years before the first countries join after which there will be at least two years in which these countries will have to function in the exchange rate mechanism.
We must not tie ourselves down too early, a lot can happen in the meantime.
It will become a lot clearer in one or two years' time.
. I welcome this third annual report by the Governor of the European Central Bank, Mr Duisenberg.
I regret, however, that the ECB does not follow the high standards of transparency, accountability and openness set by the Bank of England.
The Bank of England was granted operational independence in May 1997 in one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government.
Minutes of meetings of its Monetary Policy Committee, including voting records and reasoning, are now published after about 6 weeks.
This boosts market confidence in its decisions and is a great example of open government.
It can surely be no coincidence that, since the Labour Government' s brave decision in May 1997, Britain has enjoyed an unprecedented period of economic stability.
It can also be no coincidence that the Labour Government' s decision was criticised at the time by the boom-and-bust Tories, who have an outstanding record on economic instability and incompetence.
The ECB will not have the full confidence of the market until it becomes more open.
Mr Duisenberg will surely face a challenge second to none with the introduction of euro banknotes on 1 January 2002.
I welcome the ECB' s decision to distribute euro coins to consumers and larger banknotes to business beforehand.
However, I am concerned that shoppers and small and medium-sized enterprises will not have smaller notes in their hands until "e-day" itself.
This may well give rise to endless chaos and confusion which should be avoided at all costs.
The practical changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002 will clearly be a litmus test for the ECB and I very much hope that it will rise to the challenge.
I would very much like to see the ECB follow a policy of openness and transparency similar to the Bank of England.
It would be perverse for Britain to go from a position of transparency to one of relative secrecy.
Therefore, if Britain is ever going to embrace the euro, the ECB must be seen also to embrace greater openness.
Maaten report (A5-0222/2001)
Madam President, my last explanation of vote relates to economic actors during the period of transition to the euro.
On 1 January 2002, we will, at last, have the euro in Europe.
However, Madam President, last week, I was at the bar of the town where I live - Curno, in the province of Bergamo in Italy - and while I was paying for my coffee, the owner, who was talking to other customers, said: "How are we going to manage in January 2002?
If people pay me in lire, will I have to give them their change in euro?
And if they pay me in euro, will I have to give them their change in lire?"
I could find no answer to that question in this or any other document and so, in this explanation of vote, I call for the euro to be introduced directly on 1 January 2001, without the transition period.
- (FR) Looking at the proposals in the Maaten report for easy ways to physically exchange coins and banknotes as from 1 January 2002, one is struck by the disproportion between these ridiculous little tricks and the real scale of the problem.
Obviously, this entire operation was conceived from the outset with no regard whatsoever for the difficulties people come up against in their day-to-day life.
And it is still going on.
Indeed what is the point of frontloading the public with euro notes so that they can get used to them (a point which, in fact, has not even been accepted) when at the same time we find that retailers will have to make huge efforts but will receive no financial aid, that they will have no guarantee of counterfeit euros being refunded and that the proposal to allow the national currencies to be used alongside the euro to make life easier for our fellow-citizens was rejected out of hand?
Not surprisingly, it now turns out that the public is not very enthusiastic.
Referring to the information campaigns, the Maaten report even notes that: "it is fair to assess how disappointing the results have been so far" (explanatory statement, page 15).
Its reaction, however, is disturbing. The way to motivate small companies is to warn them that it would be illegal not to switch over to the euro after 1 January 2002:"as 'soft' campaigns have barely influenced small- and medium-sized companies, there is the need to be more explicit" (ibidem).
So Europe will be interfering hugely in the day-to-day life of our fellow-citizens from 1 January 2002. In fact, it will make things worse because the public will realise at once and in a very tangible way that the whole massive changeover operation could only have been conceived by a brain totally indifferent to or ignorant of even the slightest practical problems and that this operation could only prosper in an institutional system cut off from the people.
Our only hope is that one good thing will come out of it, namely that this experience will help change the course of Europe tomorrow.
. (PT) Despite the negative position that we adopted when the single currency was created, not only due to issues of sovereignty, but also because of the potential economic consequences of a State losing control over monetary and exchange-rate policy, with the resulting consequences for employment, as well as the philosophy underlying the Stability Pact and wage moderation, we feel it is crucial that closer attention be paid to this preparatory phase for the introduction of the euro.
We must create macro-economic mechanisms to minimise costs and, in terms of the transition period, the workers and the small and micro-enterprises must not be the ones who ultimately pay for the introduction of the euro, either through an artificial increase in prices or through the costs of the whole process and the attempts at abuse and fraud that could take place over that period.
It is particularly important to give effective support to the crucial role of traditional trade in enlightening the public, because these traders are closest to the people.
They are a key factor in the entire process of replacing national currencies with the single currency, which requires an extra effort in addition to all of the enormous changes, specifically in terms of accounting, internal and external documentation, IT, etc.
- (FR) I voted for Mr Maaten' s report and I want to emphasise what a good job our rapporteur has done.
I am glad Parliament is finally stating its position on such an important issue, but, at the same time, I regret that it left it until 181 days before the introduction of the euro.
It is high time we took a stance on an issue that is an economic priority and continues to give rise to some doubt and disquiet among the general public.
The Maaten report draws attention to the main problems and suggests practical solutions that could make the switchover to the euro easier.
These suggestions should be taken on board at all levels of decision-making and in every sector.
Let us not forget that the people of Europe also have a key role to play, alongside the companies and financial circles, and that their reactions depend on the effectiveness of the information campaigns conducted so far.
Once again, the disappointing results of these campaigns show how necessary it is to make practical proposals that have a direct effect on people' s daily lives.
If these proposals are put into practice, they should help turn understandable apprehension into legitimate expectation.
- (FR) In my capacity as member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I tabled a number of amendments to Jules Maaten' s draft report on means to assist economic actors in switching to the euro.
I note with satisfaction that they have all been adopted.
During this debate, I very much want to emphasise once again that we must leave the door open to the three Member States that have chosen not to enter the eurozone immediately.
Let me therefore point out that it is important to launch an information campaign addressed not only to the Member States that are participating in the single currency project but also to the others, giving them a special position with regard to third countries.
Our report sends out a political signal in that regard.
Another amendment, which was largely incorporated in the final report, concerned the conversion free of charge into euros of the coins of another euro-zone country.
All the citizens of the European Union have amassed foreign coins from their travels abroad on business or pleasure.
Many of them will not have a chance to spend them before the new euro coins and notes are introduced on 1 January next year.
That is why I put a written question on the subject to the Commission at the end of November last year.
The Commission evaded the question by referring to the disproportionate handling charges.
Yet I wonder whether it is right to expect the citizens once again to have to pay the price of not being able to exchange the coins they have acquired from other Member States.
So I note with satisfaction that Parliament "believes therefore that recommendations should be made to banks to ensure that coins from the twelve eurozone Member States can be exchanged on the same terms as banknotes".
I hope the government and banking authorities will not lend a deaf ear, like the Commission.
- (FR) I congratulate Mr Maaten on his excellent report on means to assist economic actors in switching to the euro.
Six months before the entry into force of the single currency, it would be a good idea for Parliament to show an interest in the economic actors and their preparations for this final stage.
Today, during this final stage, the Member States have a crucial role to play.
For instance, some economic operators will be tempted to raise prices by unfairly rounding them off upwards.
As chairman of the Marseilles tourist office, I have heard tell of practices of this kind and of the anxiety of some of the professionals involved.
A period of adjustment will be needed for the establishment of the single currency, during which the consumers will have to be reassured rather than exploited.
The economic actors concerned must realise that it is wrong to give priority to immediate small profits over consumer confidence and the smooth changeover to the single currency.
Let me also point to the importance of flanking measures for all small and medium-sized companies.
In the tourist sector, for instance, I find that many of them are not adequately prepared.
I deplore this and I assume economic operators in other sectors are just as vague.
The idea of introducing tax incentives put forward in Mr Maaten' s report is a good one.
Following on directly from that, the Member States must endeavour to find ways of encouraging the economic operators to start thinking in terms of the euro very soon, so that they will not have to pay the price of further delays.
(The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 137of the Rules of Procedure)
(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Mr President, I refer to Rule 135(2) which says: "Where an electronic vote is taken, only the numerical result of the vote shall be recorded".
However, if a vote by roll call has been requested, in accordance with Rule 134(2): "Votes shall be recorded in the minutes of the proceedings of the sitting by political group in the alphabetical order of Members' names".
Would you be good enough to let us know whether the Minutes tomorrow will give the accurate result of the vote as published so far?
There seems to be a discrepancy between the result that came up on the board and that which has been published, the published vote being 273 in favour and 272 against.
The House, and all the press downstairs ...
(Mixed reactions) ... with all the excitement going on, would like some clarification as to what Parliament' s position is.
Mr President, my point of order is exactly the same as Mr Provan' s.
I, like many Members in this Chamber, have looked at the official record at lunchtime today and it does say 273 for, and 272 against.
If that is the official record - and that is the record that is published - then I would suggest that the result given by the President this morning is incorrect.
Mr President, obviously my name is not Al Gore and this is not Florida.
I do not want to discuss the question of pregnant chads or whatever they were in Florida, but like the other colleagues, I have looked at the written record and it shows 273 votes for, 272 votes against, contrary to the declaration of the result and the statistical evidence of earlier today.
When, for once and with considerable effort, the Liberal Democrat Group managed to vote as one and we find ourselves on the losing side of such a vote, it is all the more important to us to raise this issue.
There may be various explanations of a technical sort and I should be interested if so, to hear them.
But this touches on something of a very fundamental political nature, and merely technical responses to a record which shows a difference in votes may not be enough.
I am aware of the rule which states that the President' s ruling on votes shall be final.
At this moment, I do not insist on a particular outcome, although I reserve the right to continue questioning the technical and political dimensions.
What I do ask, Mr President, is whether you, on behalf of the presidency, are in a position consistent with Rule 138, to make a clear declaration at this time as to what is the position and what is the result of the vote cast.
The presidency will say what it has to say when the list of speakers on points of order comes to an end.
Mr Poettering has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I would have welcomed it if there had been no reason for me to rise at this point. I had assumed you would be making a statement at the start of this sitting on how you see this difficult situation.
I rose only because others have now risen and I then feel obliged to do so as well.
First of all, however, I believe it is essential for you to make a statement on your view of the situation.
I reserve the right to speak again at that stage.
I will only refrain from commenting further at this point if you now supply this House with the information it requires.
Mr President, I am not the President of the United States Federal Court, but perhaps I can help you.
Firstly, since it is the tradition in this House and furthermore is in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, what matters is the public declaration of the results by the presidency.
This is a rule which has been applied in this case and also in other dubious cases, and I am referring to the presidency' s interpretation in relation to the Ruiz Mateos case, which has been discussed here recently.
What matters is the declaration by the presidency.
Secondly, I would like to draw the Members' attention to a document they all have, or have had, on their desk today: yesterday, Tuesday, Mr Provan, presiding over the House, announced that there was a new Member of Parliament to replace Mr Casini, Mr Mario Brienza.
I would like to know whether you have checked if Mr Brienza, as is his right, has voted today without the services of this House having had the opportunity, with their usual diligence, to include him on the register.
If that is the case, it explains everything and I return to what I said at the beginning: what matters is the declaration of the results by the presidency; if not, we are led to a very dangerous interpretation which takes us nowhere.
Mr President, I would ask you to check whether Mr Brienza has voted.
Since I can see, ladies and gentlemen, that all the speeches are dealing with the same issue ....
(Laughter and comments) You know that presiding over this House requires acute observation skills.
(Laughter and comments)Since I see that you are all referring to the same issue, if Mr Bouwman, Mr Lehne, Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Bourlanges, who have asked for the floor, are going to do the same, I would ask them to give up the floor so that the presidency can give an appropriate explanation.
Ladies and gentlemen, this morning a vote took place which the electronic system recorded as a draw of 273 votes to 273 votes.
The electronic system accurately reflected the reality of the House at that moment.
However, later on, in the verification, the result recorded by the electronic system did not coincide with the number of Members appearing on the list of Members of Parliament available to the services.
This difference must naturally have an explanation, and a simple and logical explanation.
Ladies and gentlemen, the explanation is that a recent replacement had not yet been incorporated into the list available to the services.
This is, as I say, a simple explanation of a perfectly understandable circumstance which I would even go as far as to say was trivial.
You now know the explanation, which will be given in detail at the Conference of Presidents which has been called for the purpose for 4.15 p.m., although I am telling you in advance.
The vote took place correctly, the result is the one you know and which have seen with your own eyes this morning and, therefore, that clears this issue up.
(Applause)Mr Poettering has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I note your statement and believe that you are correct, both in terms of process and under our Rules of Procedure.
I simply think it is important that the President of this Parliament naturally has the right to convene the Conference of Presidents.
However, the Conference of Presidents - and this is why I have risen again - can only accept information from the President of Parliament again; it has no right to make any further amendments to any decisions announced this morning by the President.
Mr Poettering, the calling of this Conference of Presidents is simply a gesture of courtesy by the presidency towards the group presidents, in order to duly inform them of this incident.
Mr Cox has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, when I spoke earlier I said I should like to reserve the right to speak again.
I was personally aware of the explanation, which you have now given publicly.
It is an unfortunate technical slip-up, but I accept it was an honest mistake.
I also accept the declaration, albeit reluctantly.
But if it is merely a technical slip-up, it would be a political mistake to call a Conference of Presidents for the purpose of dealing in a political organ of the House with something for which there is a perfectly reasonable technical explanation.
I shall not attend such a meeting because it seems to me you should make a ruling from the Chair and we should be done with the matter.
This is not a trivial matter.
We accept the logical reason that you have given, but I have to ask you a further question.
Was the Member who replaced Mr Casini indeed entitled to vote, as Mr Casini' s resignation was only announced on Monday evening.
Under Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure, there has to be an exchange of letters between the European Parliament and the Italian Government so that we can actually confirm his entitlement to vote and if that is the case, of course, it is a valid vote.
Mrs McCarthy, I am pleased to inform the House that all the Members present this morning were able to exercise their vote.
Mr President, if you would permit me to make one final comment: all this confusion would have been quite unnecessary if the parliamentary administration - after producing the record and noting that contrary to the result given, only 272 votes against were printed out - had detected the error before this record was published.
Surely that is not an unreasonable expectation?
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Parliament of Yemen, presided over by Dr Abdelwahab Mahmoud, Vice-President of Parliament, who is in the gallery and who is doing the honour of visiting us on the occasion of the second interparliamentary meeting with the Delegation for Relations with the Mashreq Countries and the Gulf States.
This House is very pleased to note Yemen' s will to come closer to Europe and we pray that this second meeting will be the beginning of an important step towards strengthened cooperation with the European Union which will allow Yemen to once again find the road to prosperity and the consolidation of its democracy.
We wish the Yemeni Delegation fruitful meetings and an excellent stay in Strasbourg.
Human rights in the world and EU fundamental rights
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
(A5Â­0193/2001) by Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on human rights in the world in 2000 and the European Union Human Rights Policy;
(A5-0223/2001) by Mr Cornillet, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on fundamental rights in the European Union.
Mr President, the discussion of this report has in many ways shown the intolerably lightweight attitude to human rights amid the daily pressures of serious politics.
Nevertheless, human rights, which have even been called the last temporal religion of our time, go deeper than the politics of the day.
Politics is necessary in order for us not to have to look history in the eye.
But, at the same time, it may seem less obvious that human rights are not just a convenient tool for driving political objectives, or, at worst, a pretext for action or inaction as dictated by common sense politics.
Human rights are thematic, systematic and, above all, normative.
They are the result of our cultural evolution and they represent those values to which historical change, including the development of the European Union, is anchored.
They must not nor cannot be sacrificed on the altar of mere political expediency or rhetorical commitment.
So that one day the EU might have a genuine common foreign and security policy, it must be founded on a common human rights strategy.
Right now I think we are headed in the right direction.
Internally, the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, externally, both the EU' s annual report on human rights and, in particular, the latest Commission communication contain valuable points of view to consider in making human rights work more effective.
Belgium, the country to hold the presidency, whose Foreign minister, Mr Michel, is, I am pleased to say, here participating in this debate, has stressed the need for increased coherence and consistency, which will hopefully go further than the requirements of mere political correctness, as well as greater penetration, transparency and clear priorities regarding human rights, which the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 25 June 2001 also reinforce.
The annual report placed emphasis on the importance of dialogue and cooperation between governments and civil society.
As Commissioner Patten said during the Finnish presidency at the EU' s first human rights forum in 1999, it would be intellectual vandalism to ignore the opinions of NGOs as the knowledge and experience of the European human rights community is unparalleled in all the world.
But we must begin by improving our own approach.
If there is no strategy, then tactics will beget a strategy, which means that ad hoc political action will disregard the basic, intrinsic principles of human rights and the rule of law.
We are ready to lecture others on these, but we can easily bypass them for compelling political reasons, as was the case just last week in connection with Slobodan Milosevic' s rushed extradition.
It may indeed have been an important legal and political milestone that reflected a new doctrine in the making, where state sovereignty may have to step aside to make way for universal human rights.
We must also be consistent in the way we judge non-member countries and especially certain EU candidate countries, including Turkey.
For harsh criticism to be justified it must be based on fair play and impartial treatment.
Otherwise, EU enlargement may become more and more like a Potemkin village, in which the applicants implement cosmetic changes in order to comply with the EU' s demands issued from behind a deceptive faÃ§ade, one which even smacks of sanctimoniousness.
This year' s human rights report, which the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted unanimously, contains numerous proposals for making EU human rights policy more effective with regard to non-member countries.
In the light of that, thematic, topical choices would seem to be the best way to proceed, as now is the case with EU guidelines and common attitudes regarding the death penalty and torture.
It is vital to have more dialogue between the EU' s own experts and greater transparency, but we should also be able to make bolder use of existing remedies to prevent conflicts and promote observance of human rights, such as the human rights clauses contained in agreements with non-member countries, when they refer to Russia, for example.
The report' s key theme is freedom of speech, not just because both traditional and very new dangers threaten it, but because it has a strategic importance in improving the human rights of all - first, second and third generation human rights - and in exposing violations.
It would be naÃ¯ve to play down the importance of human rights.
It is high time we put principles into practice and we took determined, pragmatic action to create an integrated human rights strategy for the EU as a whole.
Mr President, let me say - and I am certainly not laying any blame on Mr Wuori here - that it is rather surrealistic to combine human rights and fundamental rights in the same joint debate.
In fact, we are entirely responsible for fundamental rights in Europe, while we can only take a humble approach to human rights in the world, knowing how little influence we can exert there.
Yet there is perhaps an intermediate area: in the candidate countries we can look at human rights and fundamental rights as a whole in view of their forthcoming accession to the European Union.
I would like to explain the new title of this report and why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs endorsed the method adopted for this year' s report.
Our report is now called a report on fundamental rights rather than a report on human rights.
We deliberately chose to take a broader and more neutral approach.
This new method is based on the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which offers a fresh perspective by introducing a new and innovative element into political life; it is up to Parliament to breathe life into this Charter.
So it was only natural for Parliament' s responsible committee to take the Charter we adopted in the House as its starting point for this report.
We agreed that since there was to be an annual report, it had to be a report and it had to be annual.
Let me explain myself.
A report looks at facts, so we had to analyse verifiable facts.
And the report had to be annual, because it is interesting to compare what happened from one year to another and to check the year after what happened to Parliament' s resolutions of the year before.
So why choose the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
I think we had to do so.
This is in fact an eminently European document since it came out of the Convention, i.e. it was the combined effort of the three legitimate bodies that made up the Convention.
In any case, this Convention has been quoted as an example that can point the way forward for other European texts.
The Charter is a complete text because, for the first time ever, it includes civil and political rights but also economic and social rights and, therefore, covers a broad sweep of fundamental rights.
Lastly, it is a reference document.
Whatever the outcome of the debate on its inclusion or not in the Treaties, it has already become a reference document since the European Court of Justice draws on it and the Commission itself has undertaken to have the activities of its services screened for compatibility with the Charter.
And, as I said earlier, it is a reference document, for the candidate countries because the Union could not accept a country that did not respect the values upheld by the European Charter on Human Rights with regard to its own inhabitants.
I also agree with Mr Wuori that our credibility is at stake here. We can only criticise others if we have the political courage to do the same to ourselves.
This report offers us a means of doing so.
Turning now to the working method, let me remind you that the Charter of Fundamental Rights sets out a minimum number of rights to which every citizen of the Union is entitled.
So we looked at the 50 articles of this Charter and checked whether they were applied in the 15 Member States and at Union level.
The report is planned in the same way as the Charter; the resolution repeats the chapter headings of the Charter, as does the explanatory statement.
We have drawn on a wide variety of different sources: the Council of Europe, of course, and the activities of its committees, the national parliaments, the NGOs, civil society, the Vienna observatory, a network of jurists.
In fact we have used every source we could find, feeling we should not disregard any important or reliable source available to us.
Let me point out here that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms has very few resources for these activities.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has nine individuals and one administrative unit for this purpose.
This is not the case of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and you will find that the resolution calls for the necessary resources to enable us to do our work properly.
While taking this opportunity to thank everyone who helped draw up this report, let me also say that we call for a network of jurists.
I think it is important to be able to consult a network of national jurists to support the team of rapporteurs and help collect information.
Lastly, we want to work with the other Parliamentary committees, for given that the Charter also focuses on environmental rights and economic and social rights, the committees responsible for these areas must of course also have a say on the way the Charter is applied in the European Union.
The philosophy underlying this report is the refusal to brand this or that state, to draw attention to this or that blunder. Quite the contrary.
In any case, the rapporteur believes that the "zero defect" idea is utopian when it comes to human rights.
Instead, human rights and fundamental rights in Europe mean that when a mistake is discovered, we can complain, condemn the perpetrator, hold an administrative inquiry and take regulatory or legislative decisions to prevent its recurrence. That is the kind of respect for human rights to which we can rightly aspire.
Lastly, this report is in two parts, as required by the rules.
First there is the resolution, which has been amended as a result of the discussions in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and the plenary Assembly; then there is the explanatory statement.
I just want to say that no country has been spared and those who take the trouble to read this report will find that both the explanatory statement and the resolution put forward proposals to resolve the matter in the spirit to which I referred a moment ago.
In fact, this first report is intended as a rough draft, the matrix of a new method.
If the plenary accepts the rapporteur' s proposals and the report adopted in committee, we will be able to work in a much more collective manner, based on cooperation within and outside the European Parliament, on a dialogue with the NGOs, a dialogue with the national parliaments, which are our natural partners. We will have a report that is detailed, checked by an entire committee and which, I believe, will be awaited, and perhaps feared, by public opinion.
At any rate, that is my hope.
Mr President, the first thing I have to say is that I do not recognise myself in the opinion which I myself am signing in relation to this report.
This is for one fundamental reason: at the point of voting, two paragraphs were removed from this opinion of the Committee on Petitions which seemed to me to be extremely important. They were voted off essentially by Members from the Right.
I would like to quote these two paragraphs which seemed so important to me and which, when they disappeared from the text, obliged me to abstain from my own opinion.
One of them said - actually it was the end of one paragraph - that 'economic, social and cultural rights are essential to the exercise of civil and political rights' .
A person who is hungry, who has no work and who has no home, is in no position to enjoy civil rights.
I thought this sentence was important and it was removed.
The other, which is perhaps a bit more arguable, said: 'the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union should be supplemented with such important binding rights as the right to work, housing, a minimum income, the right to a healthy environment and the voting rights for citizens of third countries who have resided for five years in the Union, as well as the extension of civil rights to immigrants who arrive in Europe in search of a decent life' .
This paragraph was also removed.
I therefore had to abstain from my own opinion, Mr President.
Nevertheless, I believe that the Committee on Petitions clearly contributes to the defence of the rights of the European citizens.
The proof is that more than 1 400 citizens in Europe send petitions to this committee each year, which relate to the recognition of qualifications, free movement, the rights of immigrants and the right to a healthy environment.
Mr President, I unfortunately have to recognise that in Europe we have a scourge, terrorism, which seriously harms the human right to expression and the fundamental right, the right to life.
We would very much like - and I repeat this in my recent modest capacity and I will continue to repeat it - Europe today to be a continent which is distinguished in the defence of its own human rights and of human rights outside its borders.
I believe that that is the role we must play.
Unfortunately, I believe that we are not playing it at the moment but I hope that we will be able to do so in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the great honour to address your Assembly at the beginning of this presidency.
As you know, human rights are a subject of concern to which I have a strong personal political commitment.
I will therefore seize this opportunity to tell you how the presidency proposes in concrete terms to promote the universal values on which our Union is based.
At the same time, in my capacity as President-in-Office, let me confirm that we must uphold these values here at home, first of all, but also throughout the world.
The European Union is only just over 40 years old.
That means it is still very young.
In fact, Europe still has its whole future before it.
I for my part am convinced that Europe' s future will be determined mainly by its capacity to uphold and disseminate its humanist values.
Indeed, the European model is based more than ever on three fundamental values: freedom, progress and equality.
These values have proved very fertile whenever they have been combined to initiate dialogue and exchanges of view.
Sadly, we have all too often also seen them diverted and used for sectarian and sometimes totalitarian purposes.
Freedom is an ideal that can never be fully realised. The history of Europe could be written as a long battle against arbitrary power of all kinds.
The strongest motive force of European integration remains the achievement of certain objectives: greater freedom and civil, political and social rights, the affirmation of the people, democracy and the constitutional state. Basically, most of these objectives have been attained.
Yet we are well aware that many battles remain to be fought, even in our old democracies, if they are to be achieved in full, for nothing can ever be taken for granted. Freedom can also put the rights of minorities or the rights of the weakest at risk.
When it is used as a pretext for selfishness, freedom always leads to intolerance and exclusion.
One of these freedoms is particularly close to the Union' s heart, freedom of expression.
Media freedom remains the guarantee for holding the public debate that is vital to democracy and it is what gives the citizens at least the same power of scrutiny as our parliaments.
This freedom of the press is still being flouted by regimes that do not feel blameless enough to dare face criticism, by rulers who use lies as their only means of survival. However, first and foremost it is up to the state to protect and promote media freedom.
It is up to the public authority to guarantee freedom of expression and opinion for everyone. That is what makes it all the more difficult to achieve, and at times to protect, this freedom.
We have to acknowledge the fact that even democratic governments are sometimes tempted to weaken this right and often find it hard to accept controversy and criticism. In the same vein, it is equally intolerable for democracy to be taken hostage by the press.
Freedom of the press is a vital right that lies at the very heart of the constitutional state.
Yet this right also goes hand in hand with a duty, the duty to provide honest information in an effort to explain or teach, to convince, but not to mislead.
That is why we must ensure the freedom of expression of the political press.
Second European ideal: progress. This value gave a powerful boost to the development of science, technology and the economy in the service of mankind.
This ideal enabled the European project to move forwards confidently, and without doubt irreversibly.
It has inspired a rigorous approach in both thought and action.
Because it improves effectiveness, progress too has all too often been diverted to mercenary ends.
When progress that is not properly controlled acquires its own dynamic, it generates fear and disarray.
Third ideal: equality. Equality is a hugely powerful lever in Europe.
It is in the name of equality that the countries of Europe try to secure equal rights, an equal share in the fruits of economic activity and the democratic representation of the interests of every individual.
In Western Europe, this has led to the adoption of far-reaching social legislation to guarantee equal opportunities and equality under the law.
In Communist Europe, the extreme version of egalitarianism ended up sacrificing the right to a personal identity on the altar of collectivism.
Freedom, progress and equality are not just theoretical values.
They lie at the very heart of European integration.
They give it its most specific and real meaning.
These values, incorporated in the founding texts of the Union, firmly enshrine humanism as a part of the European identity.
Last year, the 15 EU Member States adopted an essential document, the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This charter specifically sets out the rights and duties of the European citizens, both towards others and towards the community of man and future generations.
The concepts of freedom, progress and equality are given due emphasis in the preamble to that charter.
The question now is whether this charter will become a genuine European constitution. The heated debate that has surrounded this issue is an incentive for Europe to look at its own future.
It is also an opportunity for the citizens to take sides, because to take sides in itself gives them a taste of freedom. It allows them to regain their freedom of choice.
All too often, in fact, the citizens feel they have forfeited this right to various less and less identifiable powers, such as technocracy.
Article 7 of the Treaty provides for a mechanism to deal with serious and persistent violations of the European values.
In a unified Europe, it is now in the interests of all that every Member State respects the fundamental values. Henceforth, every country is affected by what is happening anywhere in Europe.
If it wants to convince third countries that its humanist values are sound, the European Union must teach by example before teaching lessons.
The essential values are not just written in the texts; they are also put into practice in the European Union' s policies.
A first example of the way the European values are applied in everyday life can be seen in the EU' s enlargement policy. As you know, EU enlargement is a tremendous challenge.
Public opinion is worried, wrongly in my view, about the imbalance between the level of development of the EU Member States and that of the candidate countries. That does not mean we can disregard the implications this has for security, social rights, immigration and agriculture, for example.
If we do not take care, this enlargement could once again call into question the progress patiently achieved over the past 40 years. Some people will then say: so why take the risk?
The reply is to be found in the bold and generous political approach of the founding fathers of Europe who enshrined the concept of international solidarity beside that of the national interest. Furthermore, we have a historical duty to enlarge the European Union, because we have to reunite nations that history has kept apart for far too long.
These two good reasons, which inspired the most splendid political idea of the twentieth century, clearly remain just as meaningful. Enlargement of the European Union is consistent with the open and generous vision of the original European project.

The second example relates to the European Union' s foreign policy.
This European policy has evolved quite spectacularly over the past two years.

By the end of the Belgian presidency, it should be possible to declare the European Union capable of managing international crises, which means in plain words that it will be able to carry out humanitarian, evacuation and peacekeeping tasks to stabilise regional conflicts.


Over and above the defence of its economic and commercial interests, Europe must also defend its values by taking concrete action.
Europe cannot watch passively while the intolerable happens. Freedom, progress and equality can only be envisaged in a context of peace.
Europe exists thanks to peace. I would even go as far as to say "Europe is peace".
Reconciliation with yesterday' s enemies, the unification of different countries by peaceful means, these are a political innovation that can set an example to third countries.
It is with good reason that there is often talk of the need to Europeanise the Balkans.
In fact this process is already under way.
I have given you a brief description of the values on which our great European enterprise is founded.
To inquire into these values is also a way of discovering our European identity.
The values on which European integration is based are universal.
To defend those values, we must do our utmost to maintain coherence and transparency.
I propose that we concentrate on the way in which Europe records, organises and evaluates the dialogue with third countries on human rights. We must also do everything in our power to strengthen the coherence of our initiatives, our positions and our actions.
Only a strong Europe will be able to persuade the international community to continue the worldwide distribution of the existing international instruments. We must also give our attention to the Council' s proposal to examine whether a common strategy on human rights can be worked out.
Defending universal values more robustly means having to work within the competent international organisations as closely as possible with third countries.
In international forums like the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe the Union must protest against systematic and organised violations of the most fundamental human rights.
In the Union itself the positions defended by the European Union are closely coordinated, but that coordination could be improved still further.
As far as the composition of the new Human Rights Commission for 2002 is concerned, we shall have to consult continuously with our traditional partners.
At the third World Conference on Combating Racism, which will shortly take place in Durban, we shall have the first opportunity to provide proof of our unanimity.
As President of the Council I shall do my utmost to ensure that the European Union contributes actively to the success of that conference. We must not pass up this unique opportunity.
Tragic abuses, such as slavery, human trafficking or colonialism must be condemned in no uncertain terms.
We must learn the necessary lessons, so that such tragedies are not repeated.
That is why the European Union wants the programme of action approved at Durban to be focused on measures for an effective battle against racism.
Through coherent and effective action we must persuade all states to ratify unreservedly and implement in full the Treaty on the banning of all forms of discrimination against women.


We must strive to ensure that the principles recognised through the world in that area are applied and that states meet their obligations.
The special session of the United Nations on the rights of the child to be held in New York in September will be an extra opportunity for the Union to assert its values. That special session is taking place in the wake of the World Summit on children on which the Treaty on the rights of the child id based.
In that respect the European Union must do its utmost to ratify as soon as possible the two recent protocols on the rights of the child. These are a protocol on children in armed conflicts and a protocol on the sexual exploitation of children.
Coherent action by the Union is an absolute necessity, especially when examining whether countries enjoying development help respect human rights.
Conducting a policy based on human right requires a strict approach.
Nevertheless, we must show patience and flexibility and take account of the political and economic context of the country, for whom are punishing if we apply the clause on respect for human rights closely and in so doing jeopardise essential matters like health, education, transport, the rule, the constitutional state, administrative organisation or the reorganisation of the courts.
One of the values that the Union advocates as part of its policy on human rights, is a value that we defend regularly, namely the abolition of the death penalty. This value must apply in all democracies.
This punishment is intolerable and unacceptable because it attacks the most essential right, namely the right to life. The abolition of the death penalty is part of the code of conduct of the Fifteen, a code of conduct that Belgium will most definitely proclaim.
In no case must the death penalty be imposed on those who are minors at the time the act was committed, on pregnant women or the mentally handicapped. We shall monitor to make sure that this theme comes up systematically in the political dialogue we conduct with third countries.
(FR) The third and final subject I wish to raise is impunity.
Events have shown that things are changing rapidly here.
We cannot pretend to uphold values such as democracy, freedom, equality and justice while enshrining the right to impunity.
The democratic countries have fully understood this and spectacular developments are occurring in international law, especially with the crack down on serious infringements of international human rights law.


The establishment by the UN Security Council of international criminal tribunals to try crimes committed in former Yugoslavia or Rwanda was a first and decisive step towards the administration of justice in the name of the international community.
It is now possible that an international criminal court will be set up in the medium term.
Its statute was adopted in Rome in 1998, in the form of a convention.
All the EU Member States have signed it, and eight have ratified it. It is now up to the European Union to convince its partners to sign it, so as to reach the threshold of 60 signatory states required for the statute to enter into force.
The court will be able to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
It will establish a balance between universal competence and the sovereignty of the states.
In effect, the court will be subsidiary to the national jurisdictions.
That is an essential feature, which means that the states cannot justify any reservations or hesitations about signing and ratifying the convention by arguing that they will lose their prerogatives


The states can only combat impunity effectively if they refuse to give sanctuary to those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.
The fight against impunity therefore requires an active and real commitment on the part of the states. It is not enough to pass on the responsibility to what is called "the international community".
It is in that spirit that the "Rwanda" case was organised in Brussels a few weeks ago.
Today, there is a part of public opinion that is sceptical about the merits of building Europe. We need only look at the results of the Irish referendum.
It is only the declared enemies of Europe who seem to feel passionately about Europe. They speak out loudly while the others are prey to doubts.
The elites are often undecided and the citizens are becoming more and more distrustful. The decline in the economic situation and the fears about enlargement have increased the risk of blocking an enterprise that is more important than many people realise.
For my part, I refuse to give in to pessimism.
To repeat what Bronislaw Geremk said, the Irish "no" may be a salutary warning.
We will succeed in awakening the interest of the people in Europe, in making them enthusiastic about an ambitious project, convincing them of the benefits they can draw from it, if we can remind them of the intrinsic values of Europe.
Perhaps we will have to explain to them more clearly that Europe represents freedom, progress and equality, that without Europe we would certainly not have had the peace we are lucky enough to enjoy now.
Perhaps the people will then end up asking more of Europe.
It is our duty as political leaders constantly to reiterate the humanist values on which our European model is based, the fundamental rights that have enabled us to overcome our differences and our prejudices.

European human rights policy, and more generally the European policy, must reflect these essential common values.
In an increasingly global world we must defend the foundations of our identity because that, I believe, will be a significant means of responding to the citizens' sense of uncertainty.
(Applause)
Mr President, may I start by commending Mr Wuori for a challenging and focussed report, which has attracted overwhelming support from this Parliament.
I also enjoyed listening to the minister' s speech: Parliament knows his personal commitment to the enhancement and protection of human rights.
The year since Parliament' s last report on human rights has been punctuated with important institutional and policy developments.
The reform of external aid has taken root and Europe Aid is tackling the avalanche of responses to the two recent calls for proposals on human rights, some 1 400 proposals for a total of EUR 1.6 billion.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights has been solemnly proclaimed and it is an important element in the European Union' s efforts to ensure coherence between internal and external human rights policy.
The adoption by the Council of guidelines on torture has provided a clear framework for policy and action in that area and the communication on human rights and democratisation, which was long in gestation, but strong in delivery, was adopted on 8 May and it sets out a clear strategy for the short term and the medium term.
We now have to focus on the implementation of its proposals.
It is evident from Mr Wuori' s report that Parliament and Commission are thinking along similar lines when it comes to human rights.
This is my first opportunity to present the communication to Parliament in a plenary session.
Boiled down to its essence, the communication seeks to promote coherent and consistent human rights policies in the European Union' s relations with third countries, to maximise the leverage afforded by political dialogue, trade and external assistance, and to set out a more strategic and focussed approach for the European initiative, for democracy and human rights.
Several issues raised in Mr Wuori' s report dovetail with points in our communication.
For example, we make clear that Parliament will be consulted on the programming of the European initiative for democracy and human rights for 2002 and the years beyond.
On reporting and evaluation, the Commission is committed to publishing regular reports on the activities that we fund.
The latest report was released on 22 May and it provides a thorough analysis of projects supported under the 2000 budget.
The promotion of human rights is, as the honourable Member' s report makes clear, an indispensable element in the prevention of conflict.
The communication on conflict prevention issued in April confirms the high priority given by the Commission to developing the Union' s capacities.
More systematic use of country-strategy papers will help to ensure the cogent use of Community instruments to address both the root causes of conflict and other human rights problems.
As regards the rapid reaction mechanism, the Commission will provide Parliament in due course with an evaluation of activities undertaken.
The central theme of the honourable Member' s report, freedom of expression, finds an echo in the communication, which makes clear that this will fall under the first of the four priority areas for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights Programme for 2002 and beyond, and that theme is indeed of pivotal importance.
The right to express one' s opinions without fear or consequence is to borrow a phrase from the great English judge Lord Devlin, -A lamp that shows that freedom lives.'
When state authorities start to close down newspapers, when they start to harass or imprison journalists, it is a sure sign that human rights and freedom are crumbling.
The European Union makes its views plain on this subject in its contacts with third countries, and in international fora such as the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Moreover, the rhetoric is matched with hard support.
Under the European initiative alone, over EUR 5.4 million was allocated in 2000 to projects in support of freedom of expression, free media and the protection and training of journalists.
A large project in Africa and Asia undertaken by 'Rapporteurs Sans FrontiÃšres' , offers a good example.
Fact-finding on imprisoned journalists, and the provision of practical assistance to journalists and their families, is coupled with education and media campaigns.
I would like to look now at another thread running through the honourable Member' s report, the relationship between our two institutions.
Parliament has cultivated a high profile with respect to human rights.
As I mentioned when I presented the communication to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 15 May, the reports and resolutions of Parliament on the Commission' s previous performance on human rights were of great use in drawing up the communication.
The Commission is keen to reinforce its dialogue on human rights with Parliament, and this is reflected in the consultations which will take place on programming the European initiative in 2002.
In cooperation with the presidency, the Commission would also seek to ensure that the timing and location of the human rights discussion forum with non-governmental organisations, and with others, takes full account of the need for systematic participation by Members of this House.
Moreover, we want to enhance the potential of the forum.
We will begin by evaluating the events held so far, in consultation with Parliament, the Council and NGOs.
On human rights clauses, I note Parliament' s concern about the lack of implementing rules on suspension in many agreements.
As we know, the most recent version of the essential elements clause, as contained, for example, in the Cotonou agreement, makes provision for a consultation procedure prior to any suspension of an agreement.
It is state-of-the-art in that respect, but changes to existing agreements would require individual renegotiations with partners, which is an undoubtedly lengthy process.
Nonetheless, the Commission stands ready to discuss the future shape and use of the clause, an issue that I raised at the informal foreign ministers' meeting last month, and it will continue to attach importance to Parliament' s views.
A final word on police and security equipment, a point which is not directly addressed to the Commission in the report.
The Commission intends to submit to the Council before the end of summer a proposal for controlling and, where necessary, prohibiting exports of equipment that may be used for the purposes of torture and cruel inhumane or degrading treatment.
The Commission will examine with Member States whether there is a need for Community action in respect of manufacturing, promoting or using such equipment.
I know this is of concern both to Members and to NGOs such as Amnesty International, and I am glad that we are close to taking such a significant step.
I congratulate the honourable Member once again on the excellent report and look forward to working with him and with the House in taking forward our shared concern in human rights.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Mr Cornillet, the rapporteur, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the high quality of the report submitted to Parliament today for its approval.
Like my colleague, Mr Chris Patten, I want to join in the congratulations to Mr Louis Michel for the commitments he has just entered into as representative of the Council, in regard to the protection of fundamental rights, in foreign policy and in the Union' s domestic policy.
In particular, let me draw your attention and thoughts to a highly significant phrase: "the Union should teach by example before it starts to preach."
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms drew up a most ambitious report this year, covering a wide range of fundamental rights.
Clearly, it has achieved its objective.
The report contains a highly detailed and extensive explanatory statement.
It also includes a large number of pertinent recommendations, which would quite tangibly improve the protection of fundamental rights in the Union.
I also admire the structure of the report, which faithfully mirrors the structure of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I think it was a very good idea to opt for that approach.
Without doubt, it will help promote a community culture when it comes to the protection of fundamental rights.
I personally am convinced that over the years this parliamentary report will become a prime means of ensuring the constant and objective evaluation of the situation of fundamental rights in the Union.
We very much need this kind of evaluation if we want to maintain and develop the area of freedom, security and justice.
As we all know and like to repeat, fundamental rights really must be protected if we are to create an area that genuinely guarantees the free movement of persons.
We actually have the necessary legal instruments to achieve this: the charter proclaimed at Nice, but also Article 6 of the EU Treaty, which refers to the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutional tradition common to the Member States, together with Article 7 of that treaty, which will be further strengthened by the Nice Treaty when it enters into force.
We now need to acquire the instruments to conduct our policy.
The Commission very warmly welcomes the various proposals set out in the report, in particular those on creating the technical tools to deliver expertise in this area.
The Commission took careful note of the recommendations addressed to it more directly: the appointment of a Commissioner with responsibility for fundamental rights in the Union and the implementation of policies linked to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, on the one hand, the reorganisation of the departments responsible for monitoring the charter, on the other hand.
These two recommendations are undeniably logical and deserve serious thought.
I can assure Mr Cornillet and Members that I will encourage the Commission to hold a political discussion on these two matters.
Turning to the first recommendation, I pointed earlier to the link between the protection of fundamental rights and establishing an area of freedom, security and justice.
So I can only agree on the need to look at this subject in the context of the on-going reorganisation of the Commission following the changes brought about by the Treaty of Amsterdam, looking ahead to the entry into force of the provisions of the Nice Treaty and especially with a view to the forthcoming enlargement.
I am in a position where I can well appreciate the real importance and necessity of these changes and of the new report on fundamental rights that the organs and institutions of the Union and the EU Member States will be drawing up pursuant to Article 7.
Coming now to the second recommendation, let me draw Parliament' s attention to an internal memo the Commission adopted last March calling on it to show strict respect for the charter in all its activities.
In particular, the services in question were asked to ensure that texts proposed or adopted by the Commission were examined a priori for their consistency with the charter.
A standard recital was to be introduced to ensure that this had been done in the case of proposals that clearly had a bearing on the protection of fundamental rights.
This has in fact been done in the various proposals recently submitted to Parliament and the Council.
I cannot give you my position on the many recommendations set out in the motion for a resolution under the various headings of the charter.
Personally, I consider these recommendations, addressed in the main to the Member States, quite feasible and, as I said, likely to bring very tangible improvements in the protection of fundamental rights in the Union.
We know that democracy is a model that can never be attained in full, but more importantly it is a model we aim to attain.
I believe the Member States must look at these recommendations in the perspective of gradually approaching our aim.
We must see them not as criticisms but as suggestions on how to give better protection to fundamental rights throughout the European Union.
The Commission has also taken careful note of the recommendations addressed to it on European citizenship, especially in regard to points 122 and 123 of the report.
Let me point out that the Commission has made a proposal, which was forwarded to Parliament and the Council late last week, on reviewing the texts in force on the free movement of persons, to which point 123 refers.
I hope the Belgian presidency will be able to examine these proposals rapidly, under the codecision procedure, since they are an important means of ensuring real freedom of movement and right of residence in the Member States.
Fundamental rights are, without doubt, the identity card of a European political and social model whose values we want to preserve, not for purely defensive reasons but mainly with a view to being proactive, while accepting the need to adapt them to a world undergoing profound change.
When we build Europe' s future we must place fundamental rights at the heart of the essential political compromise and show the prime role played by the dignity of the individual and by a humanist vision of the European political project.
I hope that this new role that has now been assigned to fundamental rights will also be the key to restoring public enthusiasm for Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mr Wuori very warmly for producing such a good and comprehensive report.
As the shadow rapporteur of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to express my sincere thanks to him for our cooperation.
The European Parliament quite rightly views itself as the European institution which, time and again, intervenes most resolutely in the internal affairs of third countries, in particular, in the interests of individuals in these states.
Yes, we intervene, for we believe that protecting human rights is not an internal matter at all.
In protecting human rights, however, individual events are often of great relevance too.
Since last week, President Milosevic is now facing justice in The Hague - a fact which is now giving many other dictators and autocrats sleepless nights.
These legal proceedings against a former head of government are classical preventive human rights policy.
I can only advise certain despots to be on their guard in future.
Their time will come!
Earthly justice will prevail.
Yet does this type of report have any real impact? This is a frequently asked question.
Let me state the case quite clearly: once you have seen how those affected, or the governments which believe they are affected, redouble their efforts, even before the report is produced, in order to prevent what they perceive as embarrassing statements from being made, it is clear that these reports must have an impact, an impact which extends into the civil society of the countries concerned.
Indeed, in some cases, the criticism is very convenient for these governments too.
Among the candidate countries, for example, they offer an opportunity, based on the failings identified in our reports, to take appropriate remedial action.
Let me take the recent example of Romania: here, Baroness Nicholson has painstakingly revealed the appalling conditions in orphanages, trafficking in children, and abuses in the field of adoption. In this case, the government is genuinely taking the initiative in a positive sense and addressing the problems identified.
However, we must continue our efforts. This is a task for the Commission' s local delegation and our 15 ambassadors as well, so that we can monitor how the measures are implemented in practice.
India is another example: I fully endorse Mr Haarder' s proposed amendments on the issues of caste-discrimination and untouchability.
The Indian Government opposes these practices in principle as well, but I have the impression that it must do more in this area.
Perhaps it needs us to call openly for action.
Human rights are not an opportunistic issue.
In specific cases, we are justified in repeatedly reprimanding all our governments.
Anyone who applies double standards, for pragmatic political reasons, to China, Russia or, indeed, one of the parties involved in the Middle East conflict ultimately does nothing to help the situation.
No double standards: this was Commissioner Patten' s call to the foreign ministers in Sweden as well.
I hope that the governments will heed this warning.
I do not want to see any more tortured looks on our side when, in delegation talks with China for example, we raise the issues of the death penalty, Falun Gong or Tibet. These tortured looks are due to fears, perhaps, that taking a stance could jeopardise good business.
Anyone who goes sleigh-riding with Mr Putin but does not find the strength to protest about Russia' s latest methods of bringing the press into line through financial takeovers does no favours to our relations with Russia or help strengthen civil society in the country.
Let us ensure that human rights become an integral and pro-active element of every minister' s speaking notes and the ensuing press conference whenever this is necessary.
Then we will have real political credibility, both internally and externally.
First of all, may I also commend Mr Wuori for his wide-ranging report and Mr Cornillet for his boldness and his vision in trying to fashion a new procedure for the annual report on Fundamental Rights in the EU, linked to the Charter.
In both reports, however, there is still cause for concern and alarm.
The reality is that as we speak in this House, human rights abuses continue; human rights defenders disappear.
In Vietnam, for example, religious persecution continues and Buddhist monks remain imprisoned and under repressive house arrest.
Flung San Suu Kyi remains imprisoned in her home in Burma.
The death penalty is still carried out in democracies such as the United States.
In Belgrade, the police stand by and watch as hooligans attack lesbians and gay people at their gay pride celebration only days after millions of EU dollars were committed to that region and Milosevic was sent to The Hague.
Egypt incarcerates 55 gay men who are still denied legal representation and now face up to eight years in prison because they are gay.
Women are still genitally mutilated, human beings stoned to death, their limbs chopped off in the name of law.
Homosexuals are stoned to death, there is religious persecution, and children are abducted into war, not to mention the obscenities of rape and terrorism, torture and false disappearances - a catalogue of almost unutterable suffering which grows year on year.
In the EU, our own record on fundamental rights needs closer examination.
The treatment of refugees and asylum-seekers; discrimination sometimes state-induced, against homosexuals; racism and racist murders; and inequality before the law.
The same applies to applicant countries.
The message we should send is that human rights are non-negotiable.
So long as one individual or one group suffers discrimination, we have all failed and we are all culpable.
A hierarchy of oppression is perpetuated by legislative inaction and democratic inaction.
We defend some minorities but not others.
When we name and shame countries, we are accused of imposing our standards.
But the standards we aspire to and we set are international standards, standards by which we must all be judged.
That is why we must be consistent in implementing human rights policy and systematically follow up human rights abuses.
I commend the Cotonou Agreement, as mentioned by Commissioner Patten.
We need to work closely with the United Nations and with the special rapporteurs as well as the NGOs.
We must develop our own in-house expertise and ensure that men, women and children born equal are afforded their natural human rights and civil liberties.
Our most powerful weapon is our imagination.
Imagine, that is you being tortured, mutilated, imprisoned, stoned to death because you are different or hold a different opinion.
Imagine that it happens to your daughter, your son, your father, your mother, your brother, your sister.
That is the reality and that is why we need a new approach.
We need it now.
We must not fail those who look to us to succeed.
Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office, the fact that Serbia' s former dictator Slobodan Milosevic is now in court in The Hague is a major victory for everyone who believes in human rights and international justice.
It shows that genocide and ethnic cleansing cannot be accepted by the international community.
The world has become a harsher place for dictators.
However, the outlook is not much better for the position of human rights in the world.
Human value is being violated on a daily basis, every minute individuals and groups are suffering various types of cruelty - torture, persecution, oppression.
In recent times, the EU has considerably increased its involvement in human rights, and it is clear that the EU shares common values.
This is expressed internally and externally, both in our new Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the demands we are making upon the candidate countries.
The EU stands united in its criticism of the death penalty, whether used in dictatorships such as China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia or democracies such as the US.
However, coordination between the EU institutions and between the EU and Member States could still be better.
In this year' s report on human rights in the world, Mr Wuori chooses to focus on the issue of freedom of expression.
No democracy can function without free and independent debate, journalists being able to feel safe and citizens being able to express their views.
However, these conditions do not prevail.
Journalists are being killed, threatened and persecuted.
The situation is particularly serious in Iran, Belarus, China, Colombia and Cuba, while developments in Russia also give cause for concern.
In several countries, the regime is trying to prevent and limit citizens' access to the Internet by censoring and closing websites.
These regimes are doing so because they know that the Internet is making it increasingly difficult to oppress their people.
As such, the Internet is a vital weapon in the fight for a better world.
Mr President, liberals around the world have stood and still stand at the barricades in order to fight for freedom of expression and human rights everywhere and for everyone.
We will continue to do this.
My group would like to thank Mr Wuori for an excellent report and the Belgian presidency for the support shown earlier for human rights.
Mr President, in areas such as human rights, the European Parliament has traditionally been, in a sense, the eye of the international community and has tried to goad the EU institutions into action.
Many people believe this is totally useless, but I think they are wrong.
Today we can do more than we could yesterday and no doubt less than tomorrow, but even that is very important.
Rather as in the case of sustainable development, respect for individual rights must become an integral element of the Union' s external policy. It must be structured and based on a genuine strategy and it must apply as much to economic relations as to political relations.
This is not yet the case, as the rapporteur, Mr Wuori, points out. But there are signs of progress.
For the rest, I firmly welcome the good cooperation Mr Wuori managed to establish with the human rights NGOs.
If Europe is to appear credible as a Union, basing its action on respect for human rights and sustainable economic development founded on solidarity, we will have to reject all forms of hypocrisy or ambiguity.
We must take a very clear stance in our political and economic relations with countries such as China, Russia, but also Saudi Arabia, the United States and many others. We cannot disregard the fact that in these countries prisoners are executed, civilians foolish enough to belong to ethnic and political minorities are massacred, women are prevented from living free and people are tortured indiscriminately.
Mr Patten raised these aspects and I hope his words will very soon be followed by deeds.
Mr Michel' s statement is reassuring as regards the coming six months, and I hope even longer.
I would like to ask him a very direct question. Will Belgium launch a European initiative and table a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly calling for a moratorium on capital punishment?
As you know, the Finnish presidency made a first attempt in 1999, which failed.
What do you intend to do in this regard, Mr Michel?
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to begin by pointing out that the GUE/NGL Group is in favour of the two reports, by Mr Wuori and by Mr Cornillet.
They are both very good reports.
I witnessed a visit which Mr Cornillet made to Spain in relation to the situation of the immigrants, exactly a year after the incidents in El Ejido and I can testify to his concern.
And Mr Wuori has distinguished himself by producing a very complete report which we have all participated in and which I believe is a source of pride for the Committee on External Relations.
Furthermore, I am grateful for the speeches by the two Commissioners, Mr Patten and Mr Vitorino, as well as the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, because they support the idea of Europe becoming the obligatory reference point for guaranteeing human rights in the world.
It is important to highlight this issue because, so far, it appears that only the United States represents this guarantee when in fact I think the opposite is happening.
Europe' s cultural, historical and social heritage, the four generations of human rights which, since the French Revolution, have been building up within European history, and also the success we have had with European integration are a guarantee of the unique privileged role which the European Union can play in the rest of the world.
Nevertheless, this should not stop us believing that we have an historic shared responsibility with regard to the tragic situation of human rights on the three continents.
Because it is precisely our presence on those continents which is one of the causes of these peoples' difficulties in having their human rights respected.
I think it would be worth establishing European Union human rights observatories in each of the three continents, which would maintain relations with the NGOs and with the instruments of the United Nations, so that the annual reports carried out by Parliament, to the Commission and the Council, may have the effect of improving our interventions.
We must not be surprised if sometimes our multinational companies (as I have observed in Colombia or as happens in Africa and Asia) are funding paramilitary groups which directly attack human rights.
It is our responsibility to bring these facts to light so that we can make progress in the establishment of human rights.
Finally, I would like to point out that, in the European Union, as Mr Cornillet has rightly said, we must offer an example rather than preach and therefore on this occasion we have the opportunity to begin with immigrants as one of the issues which Europe has still to deal with.
We cannot say that we need 70 million immigrants in order to make progress with our economy and then discriminate against them.
For all these reasons, it is important that we support these reports.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Cornillet for his work on the fundamental rights situation in the Union.
This is a detailed, balanced report which could genuinely provide constructive impetus for each Member State to give increasingly tangible, concrete substance to the principle of justice and the protection of the principal, inalienable rights of the European citizens.
This report could provide the opportunity for a moment' s reflection, for an initial stock take of the effect of the new Charter of Fundamental Rights, which represents a stage which is only just the beginning and yet so important if we are to achieve a European unification which consists of more than finance and economics, which is also the home of rights and opportunities for all the European citizens, and where special attention is given to those whose rights are most often violated such as children, the marginalised and the poorest people.

Although I support the line taken by the report, I do have a few criticisms.
With regard to the chapter on non-marital relations, I feel that it is unacceptable to envisage equal legal status for marriages between people of the opposite sex and unions between people of the same sex.
Without prejudice to the right for all people not to be subjected to discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation, there is still a legal and social need to protect the traditional marriage union as a fundamental unit of society, particularly where recourse to fertility treatment or the adoption of minors is concerned, which must remain the exclusive privilege of natural families.
This is precisely because of the need to protect minors for, all too often, we forget that fundamental rights are the prerogative not just of adults but also and above all of minors.
I would, however, like to draw Parliament' s attention once again to the case of the male descendents of the House of Savoy who, in a Europe which is an area of justice, freedom and free movement, have been unable to return to Italy for over 50 years.
It would be appropriate if Parliament could help to resolve this matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is something very important missing from the motion for a resolution on human rights in the world: the principle of the self-determination of peoples.
We Padanians consider this to be a serious omission because it is impossible not to see that the denial or, in any case, the decision not to emphasise this right is one of the greatest possible violations of human rights.
Just consider the events of recent weeks, of recent months with regard to the Palestinian situation: a genuine, tragic violation on a daily basis of the principle of self-determination, which it is Europe' s duty to give greater emphasis in its human rights documents.
Moreover, some of the States who are knocking on the door of the European Union were, until recently, stateless nations.
We must remember now, especially after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that they are free, independent States.
How, then, can the European Union subject these countries to an assessment of their respect for human rights when, in its own documents, it does not proclaim loud and clear the protection of that principle - the principle of self-determination - that the peoples of those States have been denied for decades?
Then, the part of the report which deals with the protection of cultural rights is wholly insufficient, not to say non-existent.
A guarantee of the right, for example, to see one' s own language or religion protected cannot be considered to be fully effective if that guarantee merely constitutes the protection of the individual freedom to use that language or practise that religion.
In order for there to be genuine freedom to speak one' s own language, we must ensure that new generations are educated in that cultural context, that the traditions and history of that minority are included in school curricula.
For example, in Padania, where I come from, those whose mother tongue is Piedmontese, as mine is, or Veneto, do not have the right to be taught it at school because those languages - Piedmontese and Veneto - are not part of school curricula.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that point 93 fails to include a fundamental issue, the trafficking of human organs, which is a disgrace ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, in this combined approach respect for human rights in and outside the Union is central which has prompted me to reflect yet again on the issue of human rights.
More than ever this topic is high on the agenda.
And rightly so, since there are still harrowing violations.
However, on the basis of my Christian philosophy, I should like to stress that even human rights are not above all norms.
The maintenance of human rights involves protective rules for human life in accordance with the design that God the Creator has for that life.
The Wuori report deals in a realistic way with this concept.
It limits itself to the most fundamental human rights.
But I wonder whether the European Union, with its limited financial and diplomatic means, can supervise the observance of those rights.
The policy of the Union must complement the individual capabilities of the Member States.
The only pressure that the Union can exert through human rights clauses in treaties and agreements is undermined in this report by arguing for flexible application.
We support maintaining critical dialogue, but flexibility must not become the norm for our policy.
Finally, Mr President, I should like to devote a few words to the Cornillet report.
As I have said I am a supporter of proper observance of human rights.
However, I do not believe that the European Union has the authority to concern itself in such detail with observance in Member States.
I also note the lack of a distinction between human rights and government policy objectives.
Too fanatical a plea for government action in human rights questions can simply lead to a restriction of civil liberties.
I should like to discuss Paragraphs 82-84 of the Cornillet report separately.
I regard marriage as a unique gift of the Creator.
Marginalisation of marriage through the introduction of alternative forms of cohabitation will do great harm to society.
Even in my own country I have come to be in a minority with such a view.
Still I cling to the good Biblical institution of marriage as a lasting union between man and woman.
I sincerely hope that the Netherlands government will have second thoughts on the decisions it has made.
I appeal to the Member States of the European Union to pay no heed to the call to follow in the footsteps of the Netherlands.
The attempt in Amendment No 24 to call attention to the position of terminal patients is in itself praiseworthy, but the concrete form it is given is misguided.
For this reason I have requested a split vote on this amendment.
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Cornillet very warmly, for his report is a sign of progress, above all in terms of structure, for it gives us the opportunity to review annually the extent to which we are genuinely fulfilling the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Union.
However, as is the case every year, progress has been slowed down by various votes and proposed amendments, with efforts being made yet again to pack the report with political ideologies which actually do not belong there. They are political ideologies which perhaps cannot be achieved at home and which also violate the principle of subsidiarity.
They have no place here.
I am against every form of discrimination, and I would like to make this clear with a number of examples. I am against every form of discrimination against homosexuality, but I oppose the politically-motivated attempts, apparent yet again in this report, to present homosexual marriage as the absolute norm and demand the same rights for it as marriage between partners of different sexes, which is actually still the norm today.
The fact that marriage between persons of different sexes - the core unit of society - is still the norm is a good thing, comrades, as people would say nowadays in Berlin.
I also oppose the attempts to grant all non-EU citizens the same rights to vote and stand for election as EU citizens.
This would be unique in the world, and would constitute discrimination against EU citizens.
I oppose the attempts to recast family reunion as an instrument of immigration by extending the term 'family' to a large and ill-defined group.
This is unacceptable, for it removes Member States' right to decide which workers they wish to, and are able, to admit, and how many.
Let us admit the immediate family by all means, but not the entire extended family.
We will not support the examples which I have cited or other political demands. However, we will certainly vote for the report presented by the rapporteur Mr Cornillet.
Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group for the report by Mr Cornillet, whom I should, by the way, like to congratulate on the result of his work, I should like to address the question of respect for human rights in the countries of the European Union itself.
If we look at the facts on the table two complexes of problems stand out.
In the first place this time there are again reports on misbehaviour by government servants, such as police officers, prison staff, security services, and officials involved in the handling of asylum seekers.
Secondly one is struck by the number of reports of forms of unequal treatment and discrimination, especially of people belonging to so-called "weak" groups in society.
Racist violence against foreigners is the most visible manifestation of this phenomenon, but it also relates to the trafficking in women, discrimination in the workplace, to say nothing of homosexuals, since I have had enough of the topic for the time being.
Unfortunately in the preparatory phase in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs this substantive aspect of the human rights problem in the European Union was scarcely mentioned.
All attention focused on the way in which human rights reports in the European Parliament should be produced in future.
I have great appreciation for the commitment and stamina of the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, but believe that the means are in danger of not achieving their end.
The discussion on the future design and organisation of this work took up a great deal of time and energy and was carried out under an undue amount of pressure.
A compromise turned out to have been almost reached, but elements were lost and now we must simply hope that things will turn out all right with the amendments.
Some aspects of the discussion have not yet been completely concluded and therefore I should like to raise some of these points now.
In the first place, the choice of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as the coathanger for the report.
This choice, in itself an obvious one, must not, however, become a restrictive corset.
The discussion on the scope of human rights and the concept of human rights is still fluid.
Human rights are also a matter of living law.
Moreover, we must not forget that the Member States are also bound by human rights treaties of the Council of Europe and the United Nations and the specialised bodies.
The findings of the supervisory agencies of these treaties should in fact play a much greater part in the deliberations of this Parliament.
Secondly, there is the question: who does what?
There are two parliamentary committees which deal with the matter: the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights.
There is a great deal of overlap both in the conclusions and in the themes, unnecessary and duplication of work is being carried out and there is stiff competition for staff and resources.
This requires intervention by the authorised bodies of this Parliament in order to coordinate things better.
My third question is: where should the countries of the European Union about which there is concern regarding the observance of fundamental rights be named?
In view of the nature of the supervisory mechanism itself the only appropriate answer seems to me to be in the resolution itself and not tucked away in a note, as was the original intention of the rapporteur himself.
I find that in conflict with the fact that every month in this Parliament we rap third countries over the knuckles for violation of human rights.
Mr President, it was Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and myself who wrote the reports on human rights last year. We are very pleased that the approach adopted then has been carried forward into the reports we are discussing today.
We Liberals support Mr Cornillet' s desire for the new charter of human rights to be a model and criterion of relevance for this Parliament' s work on human rights.
Like human rights watchdogs, we can make use of the charter even before it acquires formal status, and we can at the same time acquire a much needed means of opposing that watering down of the concept of human rights that threatens to turn the latter into everything and nothing.
There has, of course, been a tendency in this Parliament to make every conceivable subject from the party programmes into human rights issues.
It happens with the best of intentions, but it damages human rights because it makes citizens who disagree about one point or another say, 'f those are human rights, then we are opposed to them.'
The whole Austria business did a lot of damage, because it was all about opinions and suppositions.
If, instead, it had been about specific breaches of the charter of human rights, there would have been a lot of sympathy for the action.
That is why we here in Parliament must make the charter central.
We must guard it like watchdogs.
We must use it in such a way as to resist its being watered down by do-gooders.
That is why we Liberals are voting against almost all the amendments: not because we disagree with the intentions behind the amendments, but because we attach too much importance to human rights to be a party to using them to adorn every conceivable point of view that does not fall within the charter' s human rights criterion.
As I say, however, we warmly support the two reports as they stand, except with regard to just a few points, and we are grateful for the fact that we have in this way acquired a better organised treatment of human rights for the future.
We have indeed before us two massive and authoritative reports for which we are indebted to the two authors.
Mr Wuori said, in introducing the debate, that this is about the fundamental principle of respect for human personality in all its manifestations.
Charters and conventions and rights seek to quantify and give exact terms to the impermissible forms of disrespect and then discountenance them everywhere.
The moving section on enlargement in Mr Wuori' s paper reminds us that both a condition and a consequence of enlargement of the Union will be to expand the recognition, enforcement and upholding of human rights throughout this continent.
What could be a more welcome outcome?
Mr Cornillet suggested that we should not take the two papers together.
I think we have to.
We must always remind ourselves, as we call upon others outside the Union to rise to the standards of respect for persons which seem to us fundamental, that we are continually at risk ourselves of falling below the standards.
Last night as the Echelon Committee adopted its report, it made it clear that running systems of random interception of messages breaches the fundamental right to privacy in one' s personal life and communications.
That must stop.
Those who are doing it in the United Kingdom and elsewhere must be urged to put a stop to it.
There are other areas, such as the right to a speedy trial, where other states are not up to the mark.
We must press for rights to be recognised at home as well as abroad.
The annual report on the human rights situation in the European Union, on the one hand, and in the world on the other is a laudable and useful means of reviewing the Union' s policy in this area. It is certainly a necessary undertaking when we think of the infringements of human rights perpetrated against millions of men and women in too many parts of the world.
I will confine myself to two specific issues in this debate.
First of all I am thinking of the disturbing decline of the situation in Tunisia, at this very moment.
In the coming five days alone, militant democrats will be further harassed with at least three political trials coming up: the trial of the journalist Sihem Ben Sedrine, brutally arrested as he stepped from the plane; Doctor Moncef Marzouki; and Fathi Chamkhi, President of ATTAC Tunisia.
The European Parliament has already, on several occasions, condemned this unacceptable repression.
Yet it still needs to acquire effective tools and the necessary political will to ensure respect for the Association Agreement provisions on human rights, so that it can exert pressure that goes beyond mere words.
This question is all the more topical when we remember that on his visit to Tunis Commissioner Patten reaffirmed that Europe wants to act in close conjunction with Tunisia to give new impetus to the partnership. It is indeed a real and beneficial partnership for the people on the two shores of the Mediterranean, but it must be based on the recognition of freedom of expression, movement and opinion.
So when will we see a special Association Council on these issues with Tunisia?
The human rights situation really has declined. Arrests, violence and torture are the common lot of the militant men and women who support human rights and who quite simply want to establish and live in a free society.
But there are also signs of a decline in the rights that affect the day-to-day life of every individual in the European Union itself. Everyone, be he a European citizen or a foreign resident, has the essential right to a job, to acceptable wages, to a roof over his head.
The same applies to political rights, to the right to be treated as a full rather than a second-rate citizen in one' s place of residence.
Accordingly, it should become the established rule that third-country nationals who have resided in the Union for at least five years have the right to vote and stand for election, as advocated by the Council of Europe since 1992.
Let me conclude by saying how urgently necessary this is to the very future of a Union based on solidarity when we remember that the prospect of several candidate countries' participating in the elections...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House and the Commission to a matter which has been dealt with brilliantly in the report, a matter which is certainly less tragic than the physical violation of human rights which, I am sad to say, lies before us now, but which relates to a crucial, pivotal factor in the democratic processes of all countries and, above all - I am convinced - in the future of democracy in European and world societies: I refer to the issue of information, to a question which I feel to be central, the question of pluralism - and I will repeat this word, pluralism - of information.
At a time when this is becoming increasingly important, in a historic period in which television, in particular, is becoming an incredibly powerful and influential mass medium in the history of humanity, securing the pluralism of information in Europe means securing the basis for a democratic future.
Failure to guarantee this means exposing our countries and our area to hazards.
In my opinion, the question gains in importance precisely when we consider it in relation to enlargement, for countries are joining the Union whose experience is different, countries are acceding which have a greater need for tangible rules than ever before.
Well then, Europe does not have these tangible rules.
The Commission has been instigating and developing initial proposals for directives since the 1990s and the European Parliament has elaborated on these ideas on a number of occasions, but everything appears to have come to a standstill.
An idea also seems to be circulating which I consider to be dangerous: that world competition, particularly North American competition, should promote mergers rather than guarantee pluralism.
If that is the case, then I say to you that this is a great mistake.
The greater good, the greatest good is democracy.
I call upon Parliament and the Commission to address this issue and to produce a directive on the matter without delay.
Mr President, I had a prepared speech, which I decided to abandon after listening to Mr Michel.
He is no longer here but I am sure Mrs Neyts will pass on my words.
This is what I wanted to say to him.
Are you not slightly embarrassed, Mr Michel?
You came to tell us about human rights in the world.
You represent a government that has just failed in judicial terms by arbitrarily banning one of the most important political groups in your country, the "Flemish bloc", whose leader' s only crime is to have stood for election according to the law.
The supposed anti-racism in Belgium - led by an unfrocked Dominican - is funded directly by the prime minister' s cabinet, and all he wants to do is to muzzle the opposition.
In Belgium as elsewhere, love of country is fraudulently assimilated with xenophobia and xenophobia with racism.
They speak of the persecution of minorities while allowing certain minorities, ethnic, public or other, to persecute the majority of the population.
In Belgium there are occult lobbies - mainly freemasons and pederasts - that have been cornering the real power for aeons.
The political or trade union bosses have shared out among themselves the state, finance, the media, the university and the public offices.
One side has the right to a state prosecutor, the other to its judge.
New political groups can only stand for election if they can collect enough signatures and are prepared for police intimidation.
Mr Michel appears before us rather like the hypocrite Tartuffe in MoliÃšre' s play: fat and pink, rosy-cheeked and carmine-lipped.
He ought to blush with shame, or laugh like the augurs of ancient Rome who no longer dared believe in their own religion...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, last month we witnessed the remarkable sight of Bulgaria, an ex-communist country, electing the party by its former King, Simeon II, to office, having removed all legal barriers to his entry, ironically in preparation for EU membership.
I have always believed that the great benefit of enlargement of EU to the east is to anchor these countries in a climate of peace, prosperity and an institutional respect for democracy and fundamental human rights.
However, spare a thought for Simeon' s unfortunate Italian cousin, Prince Victor Emmanuel of Savoy and his son Philibert, who are not only formally barred from standing from public office in their country, a founder Member of the EU unlike Bulgaria, but have nurtured the dream since childhood of being allowed to enter the territory of the country of which they are citizens both by birth and descent.
In the past, I have spoken with concern in this house on the Charter of Fundamental Rights with regard to the attempt to make binding its new controversial, social and economic rights, as opposed to the civil and political rights enshrined in the much respected 1950 European Convention of Human Rights.
The EU Treaty right to freedom of movement and establishment also enjoys universal support, and yet is so clearly breached by Italy' s 13th so-called transitional constitutional article, which exiles in perpetuity the male descendants of the House of Savoy from their own country.
There is no derogation afforded to Italy to discriminate on the grounds of sex or birth with regard to freedom of movement of all its citizens, other on the basis of threats posed to public security or health.
It is frankly ludicrous if the Republic of Italy feels threatened by one old man and his son wanting to return home.
I therefore call once again on this House to show compassion and non-selective respect for human rights by joining me in supporting my Amendment No 7 calling on the Italian Parliament to honour the commitment by the last government of Italy to put a speedy end to this cruel and anomalous situation, and align its constitution with the right of all EU citizens to move around the Union freely.
I congratulate Mr Cornillet, in this respect, on his report in what is a very difficult area.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Wuori not only on his report and its recommendations, but also because it reminds us of all the atrocities which are still being committed in the world.
It is normal for us to make our aid to third countries conditional upon their respecting human rights and, naturally, we must continue urging them to do so and putting pressure on them until they do so, but, while we do not make the same demands of the larger countries, we will not deserve to consider ourselves the world reference point for the defence of human rights.
Again and again we threaten the United States when it executes a person, when it murders a human being according to its laws.
But it goes no further than these words which, though forceful, are nevertheless only words.
They sentence to death minors, the mentally handicapped, blacks, Hispanics; in short, the poorest people.
In the statement on the Gothenburg Summit, we have once again called on the United States to establish a moratorium on the death penalty, we have once again expressed our regret that it appears in their federal law and that in 38 of their jurisdictions citizens are executed in the name of the law.
We need to apply even more pressure.
Cases such as that of JoaquÃ­n JosÃ© MartÃ­nez lead us to be more optimistic about the influence of the European institutions and, in particular, our Parliament.
We must continue to fight to defend and extend the values of European civilisation.
Without liberty, without tolerance, without respect for human rights, there is nothing.
A country may be a great economic power, it may even be the envy of many others for its missiles, its strength, its powers of veto, but, if human rights are not respected and enforced, it is a society without values, an under-developed society.
This very morning, President Verhofstadt said that when Europe speaks and speaks in unison, we are heard.
We must therefore continue to exert pressure, ladies and gentlemen.
Yesterday also, before the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the President of Peru, Alejandro Toledo, reminded us that democracy has no borders and human rights have no colour.
Neither, ladies and gentlemen, should they have a cheque book.
Mr President, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for two outstanding reports.
It is true, as one of the speakers, Mrs Swiebel, said, that they overlap, but I really do not think that that matters very much.
I think it can be said that they complement one another but, above all, they of course form a fantastically good basis for further discussion in Europe.
Mr Michel mentioned that there is a gulf between the EU and its people and quoted the Irish example.
I, of course, come from Denmark where, in a way, the result of the Irish referendum can be appreciated for what it is. However, the situation is, of course, the same in other countries where there are no referenda.
I do not believe that, for example, it would have been at all possible to implement European monetary union if there had been a referendum in Germany.
This would have clearly shown that the Germans were opposed to it.
So we are all basically faced with the same problem, then, and this is naturally also highlighted by the fact that we in this Assembly and all other assemblies continue to say that there is a lot that needs to be changed and that democracy is getting a poor deal etc. We could, however, use these two reports as a basis for saying that there is, in fact, something that is very good in Europe.
There really is something that operates outstandingly in Europe. We succeeded in formulating sets of values which 15 countries - perhaps 27 countries following enlargement - can provisionally agree upon.
Where else in the world has that been achieved?
Nowhere.
