I would like to tell the Council, or whoever is reporting to the absent Council, what a failure, not to say disaster, the EU' s China policy has been.
We all know there are growing social and political contradictions in that country.
The risk of explosion is imminent and we can all imagine the disaster that will represent in a country the size of China, not only in regional terms, but also in world terms.
Our duty as elected representatives and citizens is to make the Chinese leaders, legal, yes, but certainly not legitimate, understand that only democracy and the rule of law can guarantee stability not just in China itself but also in the whole of the Asian continent.
I think it is our duty to remind the Council, and the Commission where it is appropriate - that the right way to bring the Chinese Government round to the basic principles of democracy and the state of law, is this resolution tabled by the United States due to be voted on in the next few days by the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
It is our duty to remind the Council that the European Union cannot continue to take a hypocritical stance and that it must support this resolution, sponsor it and work actively in the Human Rights Commission for its adoption.
Without intending to be either anti-Chinese or pro-Chinese, I repeat that China is a fundamental country in a regional and continental context where Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and many other countries are experiencing enormous problems, and where Vietnam and Laos too are still ruled by a one-party regime.
China can play a fundamental role providing it finally adopts a democratic system based on the rule of law.
That is what we must make clear to the Chinese leaders.
We have two goals: democracy for the Chinese, the Tibetans, the Uigurs and the Mongols, and the stability of the entire continent of Asia.
Mr President, it is often said that Europe is not capable of producing a foreign policy, just as it is not capable of adopting a unified position on international affairs.
I feel that if the countries of the European Union stick by their decision not to sign the resolution on human rights in China, that would only be confirmation of that inability.
There is absolutely no reason, other than hypocrisy and defeatism, why we should not sign this resolution, for in not doing so we are not achieving anything at all that could justify taking this standpoint on a subject upon which there is such wide consensus from our public.
Therefore, our resolution - which is not the first and, I believe and fear, will not be the last - seeks to make the Council change its mind, thereby ensuring that, at least at the level of condemnation from the civilised world, this time, China gets what it deserves.
Mr President, China is very much in our minds at the moment following the incident involving the American EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft.
This is a matter which should be resolved with great urgency by the Chinese authorities before its consequences spiral out of control.
The US Administration has expressed its regret, which we share, particularly over the loss of a Chinese fighter pilot, but now is the moment to bring this matter to an end by releasing the American aircrew and enabling recovery of the American aircraft.
Otherwise this matter will become a running sore, poisoning international relations at a very sensitive time.
The Chinese Government seems anxious to play a fuller part in the international community, particularly in terms of economic development and eventual membership of the WTO.
But it has not yet realised the need to adjust attitudes in other areas or recognise that political confrontation needs to be replaced by a more conciliatory approach.
This applies not just in the field of international relations, but in terms of domestic policy as well.
It will be an enormous leap forward when we no longer have to table resolutions on human rights abuses in China but we see very little progress being made and the catalogue of abuses continues to expand.
The Falun Gong movement is violently suppressed and some 80 of its members are reported to have died in custody in China in the past 18 months.
The sustained violence and intimidation against Tibetan Buddhists is little short of a programme of ethnic cleansing.
A great country like China is surely sufficiently robust and forward-looking that it can give real freedom to all the peoples living under its authority.
It must show that it recognises the individual humanity of its citizens and will exercise the duty of good government by providing protection for all under the rule of law.
We urge the Council and the Member States to take strong note of the likely resolution of this Parliament and to support the resolution of the United States at the UN Commission in Geneva deploring the state of human rights in China.
Mr President, we are looking just now towards China in the hope that the incident involving the American aircraft will be resolved without too much rhetoric and political point-scoring.
Even setting aside this event, reports from China are, nevertheless, pouring in thick and fast.
They almost always concern acts of cruelty against its own citizens.
Commentators the world over are agreed that the human rights situation in China is becoming worse and worse.
We are talking here about the situation in Tibet and Sinkiang and about the widespread increase in the torture and persecution of dissidents, active trade unionists and representatives of democracy.
We are talking about the frequent use of the death penalty and the opposition mounted against freedom of expression on the Internet.
We are talking, in particular, about the arrest, torture and persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.
The Chinese rÃ©gime' s objective of breaking this movement will not succeed.
The persecutions must therefore be halted immediately and a dialogue entered into.
Parliament agrees about the situation in China.
I know that the Commission shares this view, and Commissioner Patten has defended human rights in China several times in this Chamber.
The world' s most populous country is systematically violating its citizens' rights.
Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen.
The signals coming from the Council are, however, conflicting and hypocritical and help weaken the international struggle to get the Chinese rÃ©gime to change its policy.
This lack of unity benefits none other than the Chinese rÃ©gime, and at the expense of the Chinese people.
The Council must therefore get its act together and show that all the talk about unity is not just idle chatter but can also be expressed in action. It must also support the resolution against China in Geneva in a couple of weeks' time.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would have liked to have seen the Council, in other words all the Member States together, submit a motion during the 57th sitting of the UN Human Rights Commission.
We had also asked for this earlier in the European Parliament.
But we did not get that far.
We are not too keen ourselves on co-sponsoring with the United States, and would have preferred to have our own European position.
We will be voting in favour of the resolution because, ultimately, we are naturally all agreed on the human rights situation in China.
That is why we are delighted about the fact that the European Member States have decided in the Council to vote jointly for a resolution after all, if it is submitted.
Apparently, it is not up to us to submit this resolution, but if the United States submits one, then we can support it.
That is an advance on last year, when the Member States were still divided.
Although he cannot speak on behalf of the Council, maybe Mr Lamy can give us this information here.
The exciting thing for both Europe and China is, of course, that we have an incredibly strong financial market.
We need a sound human rights policy to match.
Foreign policy and the economy must be consistent and, in a completely different way, this also applies to China.
China is extremely generous when it comes to giving free rein to economic processes.
At the same time, the country is incredibly oppressive and dictatorial in its political policy.
This will, of course, generate impossible tensions, fundamental also in terms of human rights.
They sign international conventions, which they struggle to implement and then contravene.
It would be extremely positive if we could encourage all those powers in China which inject more consistency into the fabric.
Any partnership which we as Europe can enter into with China in this respect is very welcome.
At the same time, we must continue to speak in clear terms on human rights and condemn as and when appropriate.
That is why this resolution is so pertinent.
Mr President, I realise that the questions on this point are addressed more to the Council than the Commission and that we are a poor substitute.
Nonetheless, the Commission is examining the problem in depth and we share many of the concerns which have just been voiced.
Broadly speaking, our position can be summarised as follows.
The living conditions of the bulk of the Chinese population have improved over the last twenty years as economic reform and liberalisation have given citizens a certain degree of economic and social freedom.
Unfortunately - and I do stress unfortunately - the same cannot be said of civil and political rights, and the human rights situation still falls considerably short of the commitments that China has entered into internationally.
As you know, back in 1996 we set up a bilateral dialogue with China, which provides a suitable forum for frank exchanges of views which I can bear witness to, having attended the last summit meeting between China and the European Union during the French Presidency.
A number of positive signs have emerged, such as the ratification of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights on 28 February and the signing, last November, of the outline agreement with the UN High Commission for Human Rights which, we hope, will now be implemented.
We are clearly concerned, however, to see more tangible results on the ground.
Our main preoccupations are the same as yours, the continued persecution of political dissidents, the restrictions imposed on religious freedom, the application of the death penalty, the ratification of the UN covenants and their implementation, especially as regards political and civil rights, the treatment of ethnic minorities, arbitrary detention and so on.
As far as the United Nations is concerned, during the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March, we decided to back the resolution on China tabled by the United States within the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, should that resolution be put to the vote.
We also agreed that the European Members of the Human Rights Commission would vote against any non-action motion that is tabled and would lobby to ensure the other members did the same.
We feel that the very notion of non-action is totally opposed to the spirit of dialogue that we have tried to establish.
We restated our position in Geneva on 29 March that we take the issue of the violation of human rights seriously wherever it occurs in the world.
As to the question of co-sponsoring the resolution, we feel that the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and China is a privileged channel of communication working to improve the situation in the many spheres of concern to us.
This is in fact the position which was endorsed by the Council, because we feel that it may have a positive impact.
As regards this year' s decision, namely that we will support a motion for a resolution which we do not co-sponsor, this does not mean to say that we rule out the possibility of returning to this mechanism at a later date.
Dialogue is clearly an acceptable option only if it leads to progress on the ground.
This is the position which was adopted in January on the EU-China dialogue and in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March.
We will therefore support this resolution if it is put to the vote.
We will not co-sponsor it since we think that direct dialogue still has potential.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Kyoto Conference objectives
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0267/2001 by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0270/2001 by Mrs Hautala and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
B5-0278/2001 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0287/2001 by Mr Moreira Da Silva and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
B5-0291/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;
B5-0295/2001 by Mr Davies and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group,
on the Kyoto Conference objectives.
Mr President, by refusing to implement the Kyoto agreement on climate change, the President of the United States is waging an assault not only on people outside the United States but also on his own citizens.
Mr Bush' s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol is an indication of his immense lack of responsibility regarding the future of humanity.
The Social Democrats also wish to strongly emphasise the fact that his attitude is, more than anything, irresponsible with regard to the developing countries.
The USA' s own emissions of carbon dioxide account for around a quarter of those now produced around the world.
The USA produces per head of population more than ten times the amount that would represent sustainable development if that were the average figure for everyone on earth.
The unilateral decision taken by the American President will tend to have an adverse effect on dialogue on either side of the Atlantic.
To avoid any greater confrontation Bush should reverse his decision and embark on an active dialogue with the EU and other parties to the agreement on climate to ensure that we can together take adequate action to prevent climate change.
However, in any event, the European Union must keep to its obligations.
Europe, and presumably the United States also, today have all the technical facilities to ensure that emissions from industry can be reduced by a third from the levels for 1990 by the year 2010.
Now enormous effort, greater than ever before, must be made in the energy production and traffic and transport sectors.
There is no economic justification either for abandoning the aims and obligations of Kyoto.
Sustainable development does not threaten economic prosperity, on the contrary, it promotes the rational use of natural resources and is an assurance of prosperity and jobs for generations to come.
Mr President, the Social Democrats in the European Parliament would like to make a strong plea in favour of strengthening the action to prevent climatic change, ensuring that it does not in any way weaken and that the Gothenburg summit will send a clear message regarding the wishes of Europeans.
Mr President, it is scandalous that President Bush is boycotting the Kyoto Protocol.
Major American oil concerns, such as Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have helped Bush into the saddle.
Their hand in this boycott is obvious.
Bush is not only thick, he is as thick as two short planks.
The EU must respond by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol before the summer of 2002.
More than 20 countries have already done just that.
The EU can and must ratify Kyoto, together with our Eastern European partners, Russia, Japan and countries such as Brazil.
These 55 countries combined account for 55% of emissions.
Even without the US, the Kyoto Protocol will be legally valid.
Worldwide negotiations have taken place for nearly ten years.
The time has come for action and deeds.
Europe must take the lead with energy savings and renewable energy.
The new technologies - wind power, biomass and solar energy - will also yield economic benefits for Europe.
Windmills are Denmark' s second export product.
European actions should persuade the developing countries to accept the climate objectives in time.
Those same developing countries already made it clear at the failed climate summit in The Hague that they did not want nuclear energy, even if it were subsidised.
European and American citizens can break Bush' s Kyoto boycott by boycotting fuel and diesel from Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.
The political pleas by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and the troika were to no avail.
The majority of MEPs refuse, on principle, to sign such a boycott.
But MEPs from Sweden and the Netherlands have in the past called for a boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa.
Citizens, show your anger and boycott Bush.
Boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.
Capital punishment in the US may be ethically unjustified, but in the final analysis it is a matter for the American people.
However, the demise of the climate which Bush is bringing about for the whole world is unacceptable.
Mr President, Mrs Myller is the rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for the 6th European Union environmental action programme, which is the environmental strategy for the next ten years.
And one of the objectives of this debate is to comply with the decisions made in Kyoto, which we consider to be an unavoidable objective for the European Union.
The European Union set an example when, in Kyoto, it asked for a greater reduction.
It is true that later, in the discussion and debate, this reduction ended up lower than we all thought, given that the European Environment Agency said that instead of the 8% reduction from 1990, it should be 30%, if we wanted to go along the right path.
I, therefore, share in the two amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that is, we have to tell the United States that it is immoral not only for it not to comply with the Kyoto protocol, but also for it to rely on developing countries, saying that only they need to reduce pollution.
It is immoral, and we have to say so here loud and clear, because while the annual average CO2 emissions of a European are 10 tonnes, the average for an American is 24 tonnes and developing countries are way below the average.
We need to use this argument in the transatlantic relations that we have with the United States.
We need to act unilaterally, not only on the basis that we need to look after the competitiveness of companies, but also on the basis that, from an economic point of view, the most reasonable thing to do is to support the Kyoto Protocol and take specific and clear measures aimed at implementing and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.
I think that in Europe we can once again set an example if all the European countries ratify the Protocol, if they start to take unilateral measures and if they force the United States, in transatlantic relations, not to continue acting in such an immoral way.
Mr President, there was palpable shock and disappointment at President Bush's recent announcement that the US will not cooperate with efforts to decrease carbon emissions in the endeavour to stave off the real threat of global warming.
The US, with 5% of the world's population, produces 25% of the world's greenhouse gases.
For President Bush to tell the EU delegation in Washington this week that he acknowledges both the problem and the need to find a solution is hollow rhetoric, when the US distances itself from the only solution on the table, and that a partial solution at best.
Kyoto is only the beginning of the way forward.
What is President Bush afraid of?
Many of the Kyoto signatories, including my own country, are failing to meet our agreed targets; but we must keep trying, we must keep talking - at Bonn next in June or July - and endeavour to reach the targets set for all the difficulties posed in the short term.
The longer-term consequences will be far more difficult to resolve.
It is not a question of the environment, or of employment.
The promotion and protection of economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to the protection of the environment.
Well-managed environments are themselves a source of wealth creation through agriculture, tourism and the maintenance of assimilative capacity.
Environmental protection is therefore a matter of enlightened self-interest for the future economic wellbeing and competitiveness of Europe, the US and the entire world.
Viewed this way, environmental protection becomes part of a virtuous circle whereby a high-quality environment is sustained by wealth, which in turn is sustained by competition, which in turn requires a high-quality environment.
Yes, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective.
What Kyoto requires of us all is just that: proportionate and effective responses to the global threat of climate change.
And developed countries and communities have a particular responsibility.
Great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed when it is proposed to apply the environmental standards of the developed world to the economies and environments of emerging economies.
We need to acknowledge the resilience of natural systems and their ability subsequently to recover once a plateau of economic stability has been reached.
This has been the pattern over most of the developed world.
Productivity and profitability are important prerequisites for environmental protection and enhancement.
I acknowledge the need for sustained economic competitiveness to provide the very resources required for a high-quality environment.
President Bush, there does not need to be any contradiction between these two objectives.
It is not jobs or the environment.
Please come back on board Kyoto, and be sure you do not mortgage all our children's heritage.
Environmental pollution, climate change, is no respecter of borders.
Mr President, I have requested the floor first and foremost to express my full support for the resolution that has been tabled by the various groups and for the battle which I hope the European Parliament and the entire European Union will wage firmly and resolutely on this matter.
It is with deep regret that the Europeans and all those who are sincere friends of the United States see a great country, which ought to be the leading light not just of economic progress but also of human civilisation in all fields, abandon one of the fundamental principles: the protection of the environment, of health and of the world that, in years to come, we will be leaving to our children and heirs.
However, the current problem is not just deciding upon a position which, it appears, has been adopted by these bodies with a very wide majority, but how to move forwards.
We must, in fact, ask ourselves whether a political position such as that we are adopting, a position putting pressure on the public, is enough in this matter, or whether more tangible action might not be required.
Now we come to the question we are already, at this stage, putting to the Commission, to the competent bodies.
Certainly, an initial recommendation has already been made: ratify Kyoto, in any case, and assume all our responsibilities before the world.
But will all this be enough to make it clear that, without the cooperation of the United States, the battle on the world stage is a difficult one?
As of today, therefore, I am posing a question. Will the European Union genuinely stand 100% firm on this issue, or, as I regret to say has happened on other occasions, for example, in certain matters such as the death penalty, will it put up a good fight and then fail to achieve the key objectives at the decisive moment?
This, Mr President, is the question we wish to put to the representatives of the Commission today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the worst scenarios involving ongoing climate change are not being depicted, it is the populations of the poorest countries of all that are hit hardest by these changes.
It is therefore extremely odd that the country responsible for a good quarter of the earth' s total carbon dioxide emissions should not be contributing to the reduction of such emissions.
It is dreadful and a big disappointment, but it is not exactly surprising.
It was hardly by chance that President Clinton did not establish the Kyoto Protocol firmly in the American Senate.
Time after time, and most recently at last year' s Climate Conference in The Hague, the United States has shown its unwillingness to negotiate about the American life-style.
Now, President Bush has spoken his mind and said openly that the United States does not intend to participate in the Kyoto process because the Protocol, as he puts it, excludes 80 per cent of the world and would seriously damage the American economy.
It is deeply shocking to see the world' s largest democracy knowingly sacrifice the long-term interests of the majority of the earth' s population on the altar of its own greed.
Mr President, I wish to express my support for the positions put forward by our fellow Member, Jorge Moreira da Silva, who led our delegation at the Hague Conference on Climate Change and who demonstrated enormous commitment to achieving the compromise that we reached, fortunately, on this resolution.
I wish to make four brief points.
First of all, I must strongly condemn the unfortunate unilateral decision rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, which warrants our criticism, announced by President Bush.
Secondly, although this is a serious development, it comes as no surprise; the Union should have forearmed itself a long time ago with alternative strategies.
Thirdly, we must not waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States.
My fourth and final point is that the European Union must now redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership, both within the European Union, by fighting against the increase in emissions that we are seeing today in most of our fifteen Member States and beyond the Union, by ensuring that Kyoto is ratified by as many countries as possible so that it can enter into force before 2002.
Mr President, since the Bush administration has taken up office, the entire world is being shaken up by his highly conservative policy.
His first action, abolishing aid to third-world countries in the field of birth control, was promptly followed by the transfer of social security in America to the churches.
You cannot get any food in America unless you say your prayers.
Subsequently, we witnessed America' s withdrawal from the Middle East peace process.
That is literally a life-threatening development.
And now, to cap it all, Kyoto.
Bush thinks he can afford not to adhere to the worldwide agreements on CO2 reduction.
The interests of the American oil industry thus apparently outweigh the environmental interest.
All these retrograde steps surprise progressive Europeans and people worldwide.
Our group is of the opinion, therefore, that it is of the utmost importance for all European institutions, but also the European Member States, to continue to take a firm stand against this development.
Mr President, Commissioner, although it was distressing to hear in The Hague of the failure of the signatories to the agreement on global warming to implement the Kyoto Protocol, we must nevertheless welcome the healthy political reactions condemning the shameful provocation by President Bush who, by trying to blow the commitments of the fight against greenhouse gas emissions out of the water, is simply rewarding the American oil lobby which financed his electoral campaign.
Commissioner, we must save the Kyoto Protocol.
The survival of the planet is at stake.
That is why we must set an example.
With or without the United States, the European Union must sign the Kyoto Protocol.
We must show and we must prove to the whole world that, as one of the parties responsible for currently polluting the planet, we are genuinely committed, in practical terms too, to combating greenhouse gas emissions.
Public opinion supports us in this.
We must convince the American public that its President is making an historic mistake.
Mr President, in the light of the unilateral decision made by the United States, I would like to remind you of the conclusions of the intergovernmental group of experts on climate change, which said that if nothing is done to put a brake on the current trend, temperatures may increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees by 2100, which will have disastrous consequences for the planet. Sea levels will rise; there will be more severe droughts and more brutal floods; islands, coastal regions and deltas will disappear; we will see famines and epidemics and entire species will become extinct.
The poorest populations will be most affected. And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario.
That is why Parliament must take a stand on this issue and express, in the strongest terms, its deep indignation at the decision taken by President Bush to reject the Kyoto Protocol.
At a time when populations are quite rightly apprehensive about the prospect of climate change, the consequences of which would be disastrous, the United States, the major consumer of energy in the world, has taken a decision which is totally irresponsible and dangerous.
Furthermore, I think that all honourable Members are aware of the fact that the United States has even gone so far as to authorise an oil company to drill for oil in an Alaskan nature reserve.
This attitude of allegiance to the interests of multinational companies shows total contempt for both humans and nature.
All nations must assume their responsibilities.
I welcome the protests made by the European Union, other major countries and Member States.
The United States, which signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, must be called to account.
We must reject any re-examination of the Kyoto commitments. We must ratify and apply the protocol even without the United States.
Commissioner, as we know from past experience that a verbal protest will not be enough, in order to apply effective pressure it would be judicious to include environmental clauses in international commercial negotiations.
It is the future of the planet and of our children that is at stake.
I do not think it is employment which acts against the environment.
Once again, it is the primacy of money that militates against humane and sustainable development, which is the undeniable ambition espoused by the European Union.
Mr President, naturally the blow dealt to us by the US President has affected us deeply.
The worst thing would be if we were now to cast doubt on our own objectives in Europe.
This must not happen.
I would like to remind you that we have a great many documents, such as the White Paper on Renewable Energies, and a great many directives which we have not fully applied and implemented.
The more credible we ourselves are, the stronger our arguments will be in relation to the United States.
We must also try, by bypassing the US administration, to convince the American intelligentsia of the benefits, especially the obvious ecological benefits, of reducing pollution.
However, there are also massive economic and social advantages.
If we open up this channel of communication we have the chance to prove that our economic future also lies in implementing ecological objectives.
Mr President, President Bush' s decision is deeply tragic.
For more than ten years, negotiations have been under way concerning measures to protect the climate.
The United States has participated the whole time and privately forced compromises, especially on the part of us Europeans.
Now that they are jumping ship, it is like throwing ten years of negotiations out of the window.
It jeopardises the whole of the international negotiation system in the environmental sphere.
President Bush states that the United States' s economy would be damaged.
At the same time, we know that the United States consumes more than twice as much energy per produced unit as is on average the case in the EU.
The potential for energy saving in the United States is enormous.
What has happened is deeply tragic.
The United States' s action means that we Europeans bear that much heavier a responsibility for taking the lead in climate work, for the work must continue, with or without the United States.
We must then hope that the United States' s political leadership will listen to reason, for positive cooperation on the part of the United States is crucial in the long run if we are to be able to stabilise the climate.
We must not therefore stop at merely criticising and condemning the United States, because we at the same time need a dialogue if we are to succeed in changing President Bush' s decision in the long term.
Mr President, here is the world leader, who has such an irresponsible attitude towards the environment and towards our future; it is completely unacceptable.
I would fully support any call for the boycotting of US oil companies right throughout Europe.
The only way we are going to have any effect on the United States is if we use bullying tactics.
It is clear that President Bush is only representing the interests of US industry.
He does not care about the planet, nor about the future for ourselves and our children.
Considering that the US is the world's biggest consumer of energy, it is completely unacceptable for it to take this totally irresponsible approach.
President Bush is not a world leader, he is actually a prehistoric monster because he cannot understand what is happening in this world.
If he does not understand, we are in big trouble because America is the biggest power in the world and, if it has such an irresponsible attitude, what is going to happen with the rest of the world?
It is completely unacceptable.
He is an absolute disgrace and I pity the American people.
The decision by President of the United States to reject even the cautious commitments of the Kyoto Protocol on emissions of six greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is clearly totally irresponsible from the point of view of the environment and the interests of humanity.
However, the verbal clashes on this subject between the United States and the other industrial powers are hypocritical.
The behaviour of America' s leaders is only the reflection of the behaviour of an entire social class which monopolises the means of production of the entire planet, in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere.
Mr Bush is just doing the dirty work for large US corporations in the oil and coal industry.
He is applying the philosophy of an economic order based on the quest for profit.
Were European governments, however, which, by the way, claim to be defenders of the environment, able to prevent the Erika disaster?
Were they able to prevent many continental rivers being turned into sewers?
Were they able to prevent Seveso?
Are they even able to force industrial companies to respect the working environment and the health of their own workers?
Just like the Government of the United States, their main concern is to create the political conditions which will enable large companies to maximise their profits and not to curb them, even in the interest of society at large.
For our part, while condemning the Government of the United States, we condemn the governments of all industrial powers and, beyond that, the current economic order, in which profit is everything and human beings count for nothing.
Mr President, it is clear that, like Parliament, the Commission is extremely disappointed by recently announced rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States.
As you know, we took the initiative of condemning this rejection.
Mr Prodi and Mr Persson wrote to President Bush on 14 March to voice our indignation.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and our Council colleagues spent some of this week in the United States with Mrs Wittman and Mr Armitage, who are the competent persons in the American administration.
We are not going to settle for these contacts, and we have also decided that this troika will hold talks with Canada and will initiate talks in the coming weeks with Russia, Iran, China and Japan.
We have decided to do everything within our power to keep the Kyoto process on track.
Be that as it may, the American administration has confirmed its unwillingness and hence its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It has given no indication of the content of the recently announced re-examination of its policies on climate change or the date on which this information will be made public.
The problem is very serious.
The only good news, if you can call it that, is that, up to now, nobody has challenged the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change, which is an achievement, and the United States has indicated that it will continue to be involved in future international negotiations.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m clearly pointed out to our American counterparts that abandoning the Protocol would be a mistake. To start from scratch would not only be a waste of time but would also risk breaking the fragile balance that the Protocol had succeeded in establishing between the industrialised world, which had greatly contributed to the problem, and developing countries whose emissions per inhabitant were far below those of industrialised nations.
At the same time, the European Union declared its intention to continue negotiations within the Kyoto framework, despite the fact that the United States had dropped out.
The Protocol could come into effect if the European Union, the applicant countries, Russia and Japan ratified it.
Like Mr de Roo, we believe that the impact of the Protocol will be lessened because of the absence of the biggest polluter on the planet, but we cannot, and we must not, wait for the Americans.
So we have clearly reaffirmed our commitment to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 at the latest and, to this end, preparations are under way.
This requires us to adopt a consistent approach, which means continuing our efforts to combat climate change.
The European programme on climate change that Mrs GonzÃ¡lez mentioned is now in existence.
It is under development.
We are going to make every effort to move the Protocol forward.
We will ratify it and we will ensure that we are consistent.
You can count on the Commission to continue to fulfil its role as the driving force in matters of climate change, which Mrs Isler-BÃ©guin called for. We will also continue to ensure that the European Union is the driving force at an international level both in terms imparting our values to other countries and also in terms of our own implementation strategy.
Like Mrs Myller, I am in no doubt that the two issues will feature on the agenda of the summit between the United States and Europe, which will take place in Gothenburg during the next European Council which, as you know, will be mainly devoted to the environment.

Abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus
SE). (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tsiakourmas has been wrongly accused of drug dealing.
As far as this accusation is concerned, allow me to read, in English, the report by the police stationed on the British bases, which are British sovereign territory, on the circumstances surrounding his arrest.
The British police investigated the matter and they say:
In spite of the statements of the Turkish Cypriot police to the contrary, all other available evidence indicates that Mr Tsiakourmas was taken from his vehicle.
The vehicle was abandoned well within the eastern sovereign base areas.
There is absolutely no evidence, forensic or historical, to indicate that Mr Tsiakourmas had or has ever had illegal drugs in his motor vehicle, or in his possession.
I think that if the Greek Government had said this, I would believe it, but others might not.
If the Government of Cyprus had said this, I would believe it, but others might not.
But these are the words of the British police.
I think that draws a line under the question of what happened.
As to the political significance of what happened, Mr Tsiakourmas was a building contractor who went into the British base, which is close to a Turkish-Cypriot village, and collected Turkish labourers for building work.
In other words, this was a man with contacts with both communities, which the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders wish to keep apart and at loggerheads.
It was because he was in the delicate position of dealing with his Turkish counterparts in Cyprus that he became the target of this criminal abduction.
May I say that it is a sorry spectacle to see an arbitrary power which has claimed to be a state for 25 years, which has not been recognised by the international community for 25 years, now trying to impose its de facto presence by engaging in gangster-type abductions.
Commissioner, I turn to you.
Concern for the fate of the individual is one of the most noble traditions of France, your country and homeland.
We need only think of the Dreyfus case, we need only think of Flaubert' s trial, we need only think of Zola' s 'J' accuse' trial.
Tsiakourmas is, of course, no Dreyfus, Zola or Flaubert.
But, in his own small way, he represents the very same problem.
Which is why I call on you and the Commission to evince an interest in his case.
Let me assure you that, in fighting and claiming his freedom, Tsiakourmas is claiming freedom, peace and reconciliation for the two communities in Cyprus.
Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with Mr Katiforis.
This is a really bad case of an unjustifiable seizure of a person outside the territory to which he was then taken and in which he has been illegally detained since 13 December last year.
We want to take account of the fact, do we not, that Turkey has advanced towards candidate status for membership of the Union and that so long as we have sores of this kind weeping in the corner of the Mediterranean and problems of this sort, Turkey puts itself outside of reasonable consideration.
This is a grievous attack on human rights, it is a totally unacceptable insult to a human being and we call for the President to let us put this resolution forward with the support of the whole of Parliament.
Mr President, the accusations against Mr Tsiakourmas are groundless to the point that they must surely be thrown out even by the kangaroo court in which he is being tried.
The question, of course, is where the illegal occupying regime in northern Cyprus finds the nerve to take such action, especially in an area under British sovereignty.
Obviously, if the so-called international community wished to put an end to the occupying regime, it would have the means to do so.
This comment applies even more so to the European Union, given that Turkey is a candidate country and Cyprus is already engaged in accession negotiations.
The European Union has the means to exert pressure and could use them.
At the same time, however, the European Union has huge economic, political and military interests in Turkey and it is obviously these interests that dictate its conduct.
Furthermore, it would appear that the very procedure to integrate Cyprus into the European Union is probably complicating the Cyprus question, rather than helping to resolve it.
In all events, we call on the European Union and on the Government of the United Kingdom to, at least this once, let Turkey feel the sharp edge of its tongue and ensure that Mr Tsiakourmas is released unconditionally.
Mr President, I should like us all to vigorously support the motion for a resolution on the liberation of Mr Tsiakourmas.
This is not the time to confine ourselves to polite recommendations to Turkey, whose forces illegally abducted him from inside the British base at Dhekelia in Cyprus and have been holding him in prison ever since, despite the fact that he is seriously ill and his life is in danger.
I honestly wonder how Great Britain can accept this breach of its sovereignty without reacting decisively and effectively, which it is perfectly capable of doing, if it so chooses.
Ladies and gentlemen, the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the incursion of Turkish occupying forces on to neutral soil in Cyprus, the claim on Greek islands and Turkey' s constant threats that, if the Republic of Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union, Turkey will react violently, as the Minister of the Interior, Mr Cem, stated a few days ago, prove that Turkey saw the decision by the Helsinki Summit as an expression of weakness on the part of Europe.
That is why, instead of falling into line with the terms laid down for it to become a member, it has become even more audacious.
It is time for the European Union to prove that Turkey cannot pour scorn on our courtesy, tolerance and efforts to help it become a true democracy based on the rule of law before we accept it into the European family with impunity.
Mr President, this is a straightforward case of illegal actions.
Mr Tsiakourmas should be released and treated properly and his case should not be a weapon in a propaganda war between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the latest manifestation of which is about which side has destroyed more of the other's culture.
I am pleased to represent both communities as residents of London, and both deserve equal respect for themselves and their culture.
I refuse to choose one side or the other.
Our interest is in a united European Cyprus.
The EU must get more engaged in the search for a political solution and it should press for mutual respect.
We could perhaps give some funding to the preservation of both sides' cultural monuments.
But in the meantime Mr Tsiakourmas must not be held hostage.
Illegal action is illegal wherever it happens and this case must be solved without it becoming a weapon in a propaganda war.
Mr President, the Tsiakourmas case should never have happened and it must quickly be brought to an end.
It involves infringement of British sovereign territory and the wrongful arrest of a vulnerable individual who has no record of wrongdoing.
It seems to have been an ill conceived tit-for-tat.
With some regret, therefore, I have to say that we will support the resolution and I call on the Turkish authorities to release Mr Tsiakourmas now.
I have also to say that it is a pity that the resolution contains some unfortunate language.
When I spoke to the Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister, Mr Kasoulides, last week, I said to him that now was the time to build bridges to Turkish Cypriots, to find ways of reducing the economic isolation of northern Cyprus and to use language that might encourage support for Turkish people for genuine bi-communal and bi-zonal Cyprus as called for in the United Nations resolutions.
I say to Turkish Cypriots: avoid stupid incidents and get into constructive dialogue.
I say to the Greek Cypriots: stop seizing on opportunities for confrontation and stretch out a hand of friendship.
Violence towards Catholic nuns
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the truth here is extremely painful.
The conspiracy of silence has been broken and it has come to light that Catholic priests and bishops are guilty of criminal acts against nuns in at least 23 countries.
The report, which was published in the American periodical 'National Catholic Reporter' , talks of rape, sexual abuse, contamination with AIDS, forced abortions and blackmail and persecution of anyone who has the courage to report these acts of violence to the officials in charge.
However much the Vatican official, Joachim Navarro Vals, has attempted to play down the issue or restrict it solely to Africa, sexual abuse and violation of the fundamental rights of women are a fact of life and, of course, neither bishops nor priests are above the law.
That is precisely why my political group is calling for the perpetrators to be handed over to the authorities and for the judicial authorities in the 23 countries in which these crimes were committed to deal with all the cases of violence against women.
For its part, the Holy See should release the five reports on the matter, strip those responsible of all official titles, work with the judicial authorities, restore the expelled nuns to their positions, give the victims the necessary protection and compensation and, above all, take measures to prevent similar situations from arising in the future and, of course, instruct priests in the fundamental rights of women.
Mr President, instead of standing in judgment as a politician, I would like to quote two paragraphs from one of the reports which speak for themselves.
Highly placed generals were extremely alarmed about the sexual intimidation to which nuns were subjected in certain regions.
One mother superior from a diocese where several nuns became pregnant by priests was unable to find a suitable solution.
In another community, 20 nuns had to be dismissed because they had become pregnant, in many cases by priests.
Secondly, nuns have been harmed in various countries.
When one sister became pregnant by a priest, she had to leave the community, whilst the priest involved could carry on with his calling.
Is this social justice?
The sister is being abandoned in a situation in which she has to raise the child as a single parent and is for the most part subject to considerable stigma in deplorable social circumstances.
Examples have been quoted of certain countries where they were obliged to become second and third wives in a family as a result of losing their social status in the local culture.
The alternative, in order to survive, is to walk the streets as prostitutes and to expose themselves to the risks of HIV, if they have not already been infected by the priest.
Mr President, I think that we were all shocked when both in the Balkans and in Africa rape was used as yet another weapon of war.
However, I must confess my surprise that an organisation respected across the world should have hidden for so many years what happened to the women that were working for it.
I am therefore completely in agreement with the resolution that we are going to put forward here today and that those responsible should be tried and punished like any other citizens who infringe people' s dignity.
I think that we all, both men and women, are sorry for what happened, but I also think that as women we understand the degree of pain, humiliation, powerlessness and indignity involved in being forced to keep quiet in the face of such an attack on human dignity.
Therefore, Mr President, I think that this resolution is necessary and that we should send it to all the bodies mentioned at the end of it.
Mr President, the Vatican is not immediately known for its progressive view of sexuality.
Not only does contraception give women throughout the world control over their own bodies, but condoms could also save the lives of tens of thousands of people in the African countries hit by AIDS.
The Vatican opposes such measures.
It is also trying to stop women who have been raped in Bosnia, for example, from having access to abortions.
Against this background, it is extremely shocking to study the report showing how Catholic priests have committed acts of cruelty and actually raped nuns and other women.
This is something the Vatican has known about since 1994, but it has tried to play down what has happened and silenced the women when they have tried to speak out or been forced to have abortions.
A number of them have also reportedly been infected with AIDS.
This is no isolated incident. It has happened in at least 23 countries, and there is only one word to summarise what has happened, and that - emphatically - is 'disgraceful' .
The Vatican must lose no time in punishing those responsible, apologise to the women affected, investigate properly what happened and publish the report in its entirety.
Mr President, our group has decided against supporting the present resolution.
In our opinion, sexual abuse of women is too serious to be used for political ends and for placing religious communities, in this case the Catholic Church, in a bad light.
We consider rape and sexual abuse to be violations of fundamental human rights and of human dignity.
We reject any form of aggression against women and are of the opinion that offenders need to be punished, irrespective of their profession.
We are united in solidarity with the victims.
Our group is expressing grave concern with regard to the sexual abuse committed by priests, medical doctors, politicians and others in positions of trust and moral authority.
The Catholic community of faith and the Holy See have always rejected violence and sexual abuse, both on the basis of Christian values and of international treaties and obligations.
Via its official representatives, the Holy See has acknowledged and condemned the actions, and has, in cooperation with the responsible bishops, superiors of religious orders and communities and other competent authorities, taken measures against the priests in question. This was done to support the victims and to prevent these eruptions of violence from being repeated.
Sexual abuse by priests must be condemned and penalised without delay.
However, we should not generalise.
There are more than 404 000 priests and nearly 820 000 nuns worldwide.
The fact that irresponsible members of the clergy have committed these acts of abuse, especially in developing countries where women often play a subordinate role culturally compared to men, does not mean that the majority of nuns and priests in the world are not dedicated: they are often the first to be self-effacing in the fight for peace and justice and against poverty.
Our group welcomes the open debate in this matter and we regret that the response to sexual abuse has hitherto been inadequate.
We want an effective response to all incidents and expect churches and other responsible organisations to step up their efforts to do everything in their power to prevent this from happening in future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal is seriously unfair, poorly thought out and out of all proportion.
It shows complete disregard for the victims and is nothing but inappropriate chicanery.
In these cases of rape, which are reprehensible, the catholic nuns' suffering was twofold: they suffered both as women and as nuns within a holy order. Their vocation to serve others was offended against, as was the God in whom they believe.
The Catholic Church has also been offended by the reprehensible actions of some of its members.
When reality is exaggerated, facts are distorted and attempts are made to attack not the rapists but the church to which the nuns belong, many nuns feel violated a second time, now by this grotesque act of political manipulation.
In dealing with this matter, understanding and respect for religion are required.
Clearly this is not the position of those tabling the motion.
This proposal attacks those who have attacked the problem, betrays a complete ignorance or scorn for the organisation of the Catholic Church itself, which is not the centralised European superstate that many people consider it to be. It is profoundly decentralised, both its Diocesan College and in its numerous institutes and religious congregations, as well as in other areas.
This resolution could have attacked those who have violated and betrayed the service of God.
But no, in an instant it passes swiftly over these, these few bad examples, and rains blows down on the Church as a whole.
It was the Church that discovered these cases, debated them and then dealt with them as soon the facts were known.
The Church deserves our appreciation for this as well as for everything else it has done for the communities it helps.
It certainly does not deserve this misguided attack.
Furthermore, it was the Church that brought these cases to our attention, not the frenzied proponents of a paradoxical text that attacks the solution instead of the problem.
I voted against the proposal.
It is completely lacking in humanity and is nothing but a monument to cynicism and hypocrisy.
I speak on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and, particularly on behalf of the Irish delegation, who expressly asked me to do so.
Mr President, the Catholic media are reporting on extremely harrowing incidents.
My heart goes out to the abused women within the Roman Catholic Church when I read about their plight.
I therefore sincerely hope that this debate will help put an end to these wrongs for good.
I assume that this is the intention of those submitting the resolution and that they are not being led by anti-religious feelings.
In my opinion, the resolution not only addresses the Vatican, it also appeals to all church authorities to act in line with Christian ethics.
The individual' s responsibility should not disappear in the anonymity of large institutions.
There are no mitigating circumstances for the behaviour of the African priests involved.
Neither their young age, nor different cultural notions regarding celibacy could justify these acts of violence.
Any Christian denomination based on the Bible knows that abuse of women cannot be covered by the cloak of charity.
We dishonour the name of Christ if we deal with these issues in this way.
The joint resolution calls for a judicial procedure to provide a full account of the events - and rightly so.
Based on my Christian faith, I should like to give my unqualified support to this appeal.
As to the extent of this problem, we can only guess at the moment.
The American magazine 'National Catholic Reporter' lists 23 countries where sexual abuse occurs.
In any event, it is more than a marginal phenomenon.
As long ago as 1994, there were reports of cases of abuse, but so far it has been unclear as to what action was taken to prevent violence against women.
The Vatican must recognise the relevant issue and must give a clear account of the measures which are being taken to ban such practices in future.
Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the scrapping of recital H from the original resolution.
If this had not been done, I would have had no option but to vote against the resolution.
However much I denounce the distressing cases of abuse, these should not simply be associated with the Vatican' s policy on women' s reproductive rights.
Bringing a pro-life approach to these issues into discredit in this way is inappropriate.
Mr President, naturally we condemn these disgraceful deeds, whoever perpetrates them.
But this resolution contains inaccuracies, distortions, lies and half-truths and so cannot be accepted.
I believe this issue is too serious to be used as a party-political and ideological football.
However, that is exactly what is happening.
The Vatican has neither a global police force nor a global court to pursue these matters.
But above all this is an issue for the state authorities.
Of course, we support the Holy See in its efforts to combat these practices.
We must be clear, however, about one thing. As Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m has stated quite openly, this resolution clearly aims to weaken the role of the Holy See in international organisations where it is used on behalf of the family, for the protection of life, and against sexual abuse.
This is often not the case with the governments of many Member States.
This resolution is hypocritical and unacceptable. I therefore consider it to be dangerous because this issue was all too often abused in the twentieth century by totalitarian powers in order to discredit the Church.
We must not go down this path.
The people of the Church who lend their support to other people do not deserve such defamation.
Mr President, I and everyone in this House condemns sexual abuse of women, or of anyone for that matter, and any delay in bringing to justice those who perpetrate it, whatever their creed, nationality or profession, should rightly be condemned.
I cannot, however, support this resolution which targets one specific church; a church which has acknowledged and condemned the cases in question and which has made clear it is taking measures in cooperation with the competent church representatives and civil authorities against the perpetrators involved.
It is also supporting the victims, as it does sexual-abuse victims, through its outreach programmes through the world and it is taking steps to prevent a repetition of these terrible incidents.
Regretfully, it must be said that resolutions of this nature suggest an ulterior motive for political reasons, which appears to be the deliberate discrediting of the Catholic Church and the Holy See on an international level and possibly forcing its removal from international forums, where it is actively promoting the dignity of women and mothers.
Mr President, the declaration by Mrs Martens could be mine entirely.
I would, however, like to add the following. This sensitive and appalling issue came to light thanks to the openness of the Catholic press and to Catholic researchers who had drawn up a report.
Eventually, the Catholic Church hierarchy reacted to, and condemned, these events.
I also remember bishops, from the Netherlands for example, making statements.
So why are we rubbing salt into the wound of the Roman Catholic Church?
As a Protestant, I must say that I am very surprised about this, to say the least.
I read an interview in the Dutch press with one of the people who started the ball rolling and in which the background was explained.
She says: "We are against the Pope visiting the European Parliament.
We must make it more difficult in this way.
Secondly, we would really like to give as good as we get with regard to all the Pope' s admonitions in the moral sphere."
If that is the background, there is so much false fire on the altar, to put it in Protestant terms, that it is absolutely impossible for me to back this resolution.
I also think that those nuns who suffered in the course of these events are now also being abused politically, something about which I am ashamed.
Mr President, on such a sensitive issue as that of the urgent subject under consideration, we are genuinely perplexed.
There is absolutely no doubt that the act itself is to be utterly condemned.
However, to use this to create a theory which is tantamount to a political attack, which, in effect, this is, on the Catholic Church and the Holy See is a wholly inappropriate action in respect of the moral authority exercised by the Holy See throughout the world.
What we find even more worrying is the way in which the concept of accountability is being used to state that what happens to a man must be considered to be the moral responsibility of the Holy See.
We are truly perplexed because, if such sensitive matters are exploited in this way, we will ultimately lose sight of one of the tasks that the Church is carrying out with such difficulty in the world, the safeguarding of human dignity.
Mr President, I would like to make it quite clear that the way this subject is being exploited for political ends is totally unacceptable, particularly the attempt to undermine the role played by the Catholic Church and the Holy See in those international bodies from which some would like to see it removed in order to further lobbies such as those behind this motion.
I would like, first of all, to point out that the Holy See is one thing and the individual people belonging to the Catholic Church are another.
The Holy See is not a State of which every Catholic is a citizen; the Holy See serves the universal community through its authority but it cannot be held responsible for every action of all the Catholics in the world, whether priests or lay people.
This must be clearly understood to be a fact when we form opinions in a delicate matter such as this.
Therefore, when the motion makes several explicit references to the responsibility of the Holy See, it is entering the realms of political exploitation, which must be totally rejected.
Pakistan
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, when the SAARC was established, the South Asian countries and the European Union laid the foundations of an ambitious partnership of development and freedom of expression.
The recent arrests of politicians in Pakistan are, unfortunately, a cruel statement of failure.
These mass arrests of more than a thousand people are a good illustration of the determination of the regime of General Musharraf to quell the democratic aspirations of the Pakistani people and to prevent political parties from carrying out their legitimate activities.
In 1999, a few months after the coup, in my capacity as Vice-Chairman of the South East Asia delegation, I met the ambassador of Pakistan, at his request, who ensured me that the military junta which had just snatched power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would quickly prepare the ground for a democratic Pakistan.
We are now, however, witnessing the intolerable radicalisation of this regime and the words 'democracy' , 'human rights' and 'political pluralism' are being written in letters of blood in Pakistan.
The inspiration born of democratisation - that we had longed to see - quickly gave way to intolerance and arbitrary arrests.
The European Parliament cannot remain silent when faced with a situation which holds sway in a country with which the European Union has cooperated for so long.
We owe it to ourselves to make it clear to General Musharraf that respect for human rights and democracy is what makes a policy of cooperation meaningful.
We owe it to ourselves to ask him to organise free, pluralist and transparent elections as soon as possible, which the Supreme Court of Pakistan has also called for.
Mr President, Commissioner, as we heard from our fellow MEPs, such a long time after the military coup in Pakistan, we are further removed from real democracy and rule of law.
We also note that the Pakistani military junta is providing active support to the inhumane Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
Following Commander Massud' s visit to the European Parliament, the Pakistani Embassy addressed the President of our Parliament with a plea for a negotiated solution in Afghanistan.
We too call for a political solution to the Afghan conflict.
We too realise that the sanctions against the Taliban regime could end up harming the population and could bring about streams of refugees.
We value Pakistan' s condemnation of the destruction of the cultural heritage by the Taliban, but we expect more.
The Pakistani Government should put an end to its support for the Taliban regime and the fundamentalist groups.
It has to help Pakistan on its way to the rule of law and strive towards a sustainable peace in the region.
Mr President, what an undignified national day it is when the incumbent ruler of Pakistan calls on his own people to actively support the social model when, on the eve of this event, thousands of citizens were incarcerated.
The police arrested the very people who fight for solidarity and justice and, instead of arresting activists who have gone underground, they arrest their family members.
Among those arrested was Nasrullah Khan, the leader of the democratic renewal movement.
The behaviour of the military regime in Pakistan is absolutely unacceptable.
Credence can no longer be given to the reassurances and declarations of intention given by its ruler.
Pakistan must fulfil its obligations as a member of the United Nations.
These obligations include securing freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
The position of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that it is no longer enough for the international community simply to complain.
We call on the Commission to exert all its political clout and fight for the early release of the prisoners.
The leader of the military regime, General Musharraf, is responsible for continuing to obstruct a return to democracy and humanity.
The stability of the ruler of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan both at home and abroad is just for show.
It will only be for real when the ruling of the Supreme Court to allow free national elections is implemented.
The deadlines for these elections to take place must be adhered to.
Independent parties must be allowed to field candidates. They must stop being exposed to constant pressure.
These elections must take place under the supervision of international observers.
In the sphere of human rights, the European Union must be active in Pakistan and must involve people who often risk life and limb in campaigning on behalf of human rights issues, namely the NGOs.
We are obliged to do this.
This would be our contribution to a great national day in Pakistan.
Commissioner, we hope we will succeed.
Mr President, thanks to General Musharraf' s rule, the Pakistani population is jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.
There is nothing left of democracy, and the prospects are gloomy.
The announcement of elections appears to be no more than a diversion to mislead the international community.
Active party members of the opposition are being apprehended.
Election campaigns have been rendered impossible, and the independence of the judiciary has been compromised.
Whilst the World Bank is agonising over economic reform in Pakistan, the military regime is wrecking democracy.
No democracy means no stability, and no stability means no economic recovery.
Pakistan is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage.
The financial and military support granted by the military regime to the Taliban barbarians in Afghanistan is repugnant.
According to the Afghan opposition leader, who is on a visit here today, only political reform in Pakistan can lead to the downfall of the Muslim extremists in the neighbouring country.
The European Union was right to halt the negotiations with Pakistan.
As long as democracy has not been fully re-established, there cannot be any hope of a cooperation agreement.
The political dialogue can only be continued on an ad hoc basis and, in this connection, the regime has to be put under great pressure to hold fair elections soon.
The Pakistani population must not be left in the lurch.
European development aid must remain focused on education and other social programmes.
Aid for elections can only be granted if it contributes to a fair course of events.
The chance of that happening appears extremely remote for the time being.
Pakistan is an important country in the region but, unfortunately, its Government appears to alternate between corrupt regimes and military juntas.
The population must be freed from this.
It deserves sunnier prospects.
Rights of homosexuals in Namibia
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to read you a newspaper report: Today, President X from country Y has called on that country' s regional authorities to point out Jews and black people in their regions so that they can be arrested.
According to this President, Jews and black people have to be arrested, gaoled and exiled.
End of quote.
You probably wonder which country this report is about, and the timeframe in which it is set.
After all, we are only too aware of the historical examples.
Replace Jews and blacks by homosexual men and women, and you will realise that I am referring to the very recent statements by the President of Namibia where it appears, not for the first time, that a witch-hunt is being launched.
Namibia' s President made his appeal to cleanse his country, as he said, of homosexuals, on 19 March.
Despite numerous protests, both from Namibia and elsewhere, he repeated this appeal earlier this week.
It is thus not a slip of the tongue but a deliberate campaign.
On previous occasions, the anti-homosexual rhetoric uttered by the Namibian President could be laughed off.
It seemed to be a personal hobbyhorse of a frightened man who was desperate to hold on to traditional village life.
The President' s statements conjure up an image of a community which seems to be losing the battle against sexual promiscuity.
However, the criminalisation of homosexuals, mixed in with a generous portion of xenophobia, and the call on Namibian women to know their place, do nothing to address the problem.
On the contrary, exploiting the fear of AIDS in this manner is playing with fire.
Straightforward advice and the distribution of condoms would be a better solution.
Namibia' s anti-homosexual campaign forms a threat, not only to the physical well-being of the potential victims, but also to democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
Amnesty International has declared that it considers people who are gaoled on the grounds of their sexual preference or for exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly to be prisoners of conscience.
Namibia must be reminded of its international obligations, which signify that human rights apply to everyone and are universal and indivisible.
It is crucial, therefore, for the European Union to ask Namibia, in no uncertain terms, to halt this witch-hunt.
Let Namibia follow the lead of its neighbour, South Africa, where the rights of homosexuals are explicitly guaranteed in the constitution.
Surely, a country which has fought for its own freedom and against racial discrimination and apartheid cannot embrace sexual discrimination and apartheid.
Mr President, as Mr Swiebel asserted a moment ago, the statements by the Namibian President, Sam Nujoma, regarding homosexuals in Namibia, are nothing short of a witch-hunt.
Sexual orientation towards people of the same sex is of all times and all cultures.
Discrimination against, and persecution of, people with this orientation who openly acknowledge it are no longer of all times and all cultures.
Fortunately, there is a steady decrease in discrimination in a large number of countries.
Incitement to exclude, and use violence against, people of this orientation is increasingly becoming less acceptable.
A good example is South Africa.
After the apartheid regime was abolished, a clause was included in the constitution which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
The argument used by the Namibian President that homosexuality is a Western phenomenon, an aberration of the West, is a nonsense argument.
He only needs to look at his South African neighbours, something which, in fact, his colleagues Mr Mugabe and Mr Museveni should also do.
Mr President, Europe is not only an economic union, it is also a union of standards and values.
According to my group, the protection of human rights inside and outside Europe forms an integral part of this.
Homosexual rights are human rights.
We in Europe must, therefore, take a firm stand against any development, wherever in the world, which encourages slander against, or the exclusion or persecution of people, on the basis of sexual orientation.
I am for that reason proud that my group is one of the initiators of this resolution which is directed against Namibia this time, and which clearly states that the developments in that country are unacceptable in our eyes.
Mr President, while the Netherlands allows homosexuals to marry, Namibia despises them.
This is the year 2001.
Mr Lagendijk was right to point out that, unfortunately, Namibia is not the only African country which is taking things to such extremes.
President Mugabe of Zimbabwe terms homosexuals and lesbians, in his own words: 'animals which have to be exterminated' .
His henchmen will take care of the rest.
It is, of course, unacceptable that people should be discriminated against simply on the basis of their sexual preference.
However, I appreciate how very delicate and difficult this debate is.
In Africa, I found out that many people consider homosexuality as something which goes against their culture.
Respect for culture, however, comes up against its own boundaries when fundamental human rights are at risk.
Homophobic actions, largely orchestrated by the Government, must be unequivocally condemned.
However, this should not be all that is done.
In the spirit of the new Cotonou Agreement, I believe that the persecution of homosexuals should be taken into consideration in the assessment of our cooperation with developing countries.
After all, the persecution of homosexuals is often not the only violation of human rights in the countries concerned.
Despite their elevated ideals, certain SADEC countries have recently been repeatedly showing their less attractive sides.
It is high time that a fresh wind blew through Windhoek and that the homosexual wall in a number of frontline states was razed to the ground.
As regards the first item, which is the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the Commission is familiar with the circumstances surrounding the arrest of this Greek Cypriot citizen last December.
It has emerged that Mr Tsiakourmas was abducted on the sovereign territory of a British base in Dhekalia.
The British Government raised the issue on a number of occasions both with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and with the authorities in Ankara.
The General Affairs Council is going to look into this case when it meets next Monday.
For our part, we in the Commission are still keeping a watchful eye on developments in the situation from our delegation office in Nicosia.
According to our information, the proceedings which were opened against Mr Tsiakourmas resumed this week in Famagusta and a verdict is expected shortly.
Like Mr Katiforis, I think that this case, like many others, must be seen in the context of the political situation in Cyprus.
We are taking every opportunity to contact the parties involved in order, as you know, to try to promote a political solution to the partitioning of the island.
As regards the Turkish side, which Mr MacCormick and Mr Alyssandrakis mentioned, you can rest assured that this topic is amongst those we will be dealing with within the framework of the political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey, which was strengthened by the European Council in Helsinki.
Coming to the second item under the heading of human rights, which is your motion for a resolution on violence against nuns, we feel that the case of the Catholic nuns constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental rights of women and is a dreadful example of violence against them.
As those who have taken the floor know, the European Union is firmly committed to combating violence against women.
In all the institutions we are firmly committed to upholding the principles contained in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and, in particular, to working to ensure that the commitments entered into in Beijing not very long ago during the fourth women' s conference are respected.
As far as human rights in Pakistan are concerned, the Commission shares the view of the honourable Members who tabled resolutions on this subject when they state that the recent arrests of so-called political activists belonging to the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy are a major concern.
During talks with the Pakistani Government last November, the EU troika called on the administration to lift restrictions on the activities of political parties, in particular, the ban on public demonstrations.
Political parties cannot and must not be excluded from political life in Pakistan any more than elsewhere, since it is clear they are called upon to play an important role in the country' s future.
We are expecting to see tangible progress in the restoration of representative democracy at all levels, beginning with the holding of elections in provincial and national assemblies on the basis of a clear and credible timetable.
The Pakistani authorities have given a firm commitment to the EU troika that it will respect the timeframe, which was established by the Supreme Court, of three years following the military coup until the organisation of these elections.
Although the Government has confirmed that the political parties will be authorised to take part in provincial and national elections, as a number of you have said, it is clear that only the rapid lifting of the ban on public demonstrations will boost confidence in the process to restore democracy in Pakistan.
As far as the last item is concerned, which is the situation of homosexuals in Namibia, like the authors of this resolution, we were amazed and concerned to read the recent statement on homosexuality which was given by the Namibian President, Sam Nujoma, calling for the persecution of people identified as homosexuals.
We have always upheld the position that all individuals are entitled to benefit from human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We believe that all nations must protect and promote these rights and actively contribute to abolishing any form of discrimination on grounds of race, gender, political opinion, religious beliefs and so on.
Our position also reflects the position which was publicly adopted by the Government of the Republic of Namibia, evidence of which can be found in its constitution and in all the international conventions on human rights which this country has ratified.
As a result, we are in favour of any overtures made to the Namibian authorities to try to clarify this matter and to express the wish that these recent statements do not constitute a repudiation of Namibia' s existing constitutional provisions, which ban such discrimination.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
I would like to take this opportunity to announce to our visitors that on Thursday the European Parliament always takes two and a half hours to discuss acute problems and acute violations of human rights around the world.
We naturally also discuss many European issues.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Mexico
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0262/2001 by Mr Seguro and Mr NaÃ¯r on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0275/2001 by Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s and Mr Lipietz on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
B5-0283/2001 by Mr Marset Campos and others on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0289/2001 by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and others on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
B5-0297/2001 by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm and others on behalf of the ELDR Group,
on the situation in Mexico.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak in this debate in order to express my agreement with the entire resolution that has been tabled by various political groups and on which I have worked, to say that, on this matter, the European Parliament has followed developments in political relations between Mexico and the European Union very closely.
Parliament did so because it approves and welcomes the conclusion of a global agreement, and I think it is time that the European Union concluded a decent agreement with Mexico, not only on trade issues but also in the fields of cooperation and, most importantly, political concertation.
We have maintained good relations with all the non-governmental organisations in Mexico, which is an ally of ours.
Obviously, we are paying close attention, as we have always done, to developments in the situation in Chiapas and last year, as chairman of Parliament' s delegation to Central America and Mexico, I myself led a European Parliament delegation that visited Chiapas.
We had also hoped to hold a meeting with representatives of the Zapatista movement, which we were not able to do.
I wanted to hold this meeting because I feel that, one of the basic principles of this Parliament is to hold dialogue with everyone and, whilst respecting national sovereignty, making our contribution to a positive solution and to an end to disputes.
It is in this context that we welcome first of all the attitude of President Fox of Mexico and the way in which he has made himself available. Secondly, I welcome the correctness, the action and the willingness to enter into dialogue demonstrated by the Zapatista movement in the person of Commander Ester in the Mexican Congress.
What I particularly want to say for the moment is that we are encouraging and supporting this dialogue, because dialogue undertaken in accordance with the rules of democracy is the only instrument that can help to find a solution to problems.
I will say once again that we respect the sovereignty of the Mexican people and that our message is one of support for this dialogue.
I shall conclude by saying, with an appeal that I think is important, that talks must continue to persuade the Mexican Congress to support the law on indigenous peoples reached in the San AndrÃ©s Agreements.
Lastly, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say that only yesterday, the delegation which I chair was bound, after deliberation by the Conference of Presidents, to issue an opinion on a possible visit to this Parliament by representatives of the Zapatista movement.
Unanimous approval was given, with all the main political groups present, to this Parliament, through its delegation and as a follow-up to what it did last year, restating its willingness to enter into dialogue within the rules of procedure of this Parliament, with all organisations, including the Zapatista movement.
Mr President, I would also like to highlight the words of Mr Seguro, in that President Fox and the Zapatistas should be congratulated for the dialogue that they have undertaken.
The other day I was in the sitting of the Mexican Congress, an historic sitting - and I should point out that it was also brought about by the votes of a sister group of ours, The Green Ecologist party of Mexico - and a vote that gave rise to a calm, respectful and I would say historical dialogue which demonstrated the maturity of the Mexican people and legislators and also the maturity of the Zapatista movement, which offered peace for peace.
This agreement opens the way for dialogue and understanding.
It was a great day for Mexico, for the indigenous people within and outside Mexico, and for the establishment of a culture of dialogue, understanding and cooperation between all the political and social forces as a means of solving conflicts.
Our group would also like to make it clear, in line with what was expressed yesterday in the delegation, that we have no hesitations about the indigenous Zapatista movement being present in this House.
And it is possible that some of our colleagues in Parliament will throw up their hands in horror, and even say that we need to keep up appearances, and that they are against hooded men and women appearing in Parliament.
But let us see if we can end the great hypocrisy that prevails in international politics, because the same people who go to see Mr Putin, or who sing songs to the Chinese after they have invaded Tibet, cannot throw up their hands in horror.
It is not a case of discussing appearances or whether or not they wear hoods.
There is no greater hood than that which has been imposed on a people, on the indigenous people in and outside Mexico.
They have had more than a hood imposed on them.
Millions of people and human beings have been under a yoke of repression, which we are now going to begin to see lifted.
Finally they are going to have their rights and they are being recognised in the constitution.
Mr President, an event of such importance for Mexico and Latin America as the presence of the Zapatista commanders and the members of the National Indigenous Congress in the Mexican Congress, with the aim of setting out the reasons for adopting the 'Cocopa Law' and the appropriate constitutional reform, should be supported, without any doubt, by the European Parliament.
This was the reason why last week three MEPs, Mr Sami NaÃ¯r, Mr Gorka KnÃ¶rr and I were present in Mexico to support this event by our presence.
This joint resolution that we are putting forward is positive, important, encouraging and also represents support for the actions of President Fox and the ZNLA.
We also think that it goes in the direction of the agreement between the European Union and Mexico to promote a series of greater democratic freedoms and support for the political culture in Mexico, which is very important.
We therefore think that this resolution would be improved if two amendments that we propose were accepted: on the one hand, recognising that it is important that the Members from the ZNLA appear in Congress and, on the other hand, inviting representatives of the Zapatista movement to come here, through the delegation for relations with Central America, or also through other committees, such as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy or the Committee on Development and Cooperation, according to our customs, and to explain their points of view.
In that way we can support a great hope for Mexico and Latin America.
Mr President, I join my colleagues who have welcomed the fact that we have come to a time when there is recognition of an indigenous people that for a long time has been isolated and, what is more, in a complex situation, because there were people who considered themselves to be their representatives and who actually were not.
I think that we must congratulate President Fox, his political group and all the Mexican political forces that have been capable of understanding that there needs to be direct understanding with minorities because democracy requires representatives and direct spokespeople and, at the same time, the acceptance of a culture of diversity, something that Europe is defending and which is part of our identity.
I would also like to say in this vein that I think that the climate of dialogue that has been created is one that Europe should generously join in with and, in this respect, I think it is right and proper that whoever necessary should be received, that the Zapatistas should be received, that they should be welcomed in Europe and that we should offer them our hand.
Now what I would not like at all would be for us to understand that we are creating a parallel relationship.
I think that the democratic openness that the Mexican Government and the Assembly have shown by receiving the Zapatistas in their symbolic building, Parliament, is an institutional triumph and we should therefore understand that the Zapatistas should also be included with the invitation that has already been extended to President Fox. This is because we consider that we are in favour of strengthening institutions - because without strong institutions there is no democracy - and, at the same time, of the presence of all minorities, groups and associations who wish to knock on our door to ask for our help, to tell us about their specific characteristics and diversity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the motion for a resolution that we are presenting today is positive from a political point of view, because it fosters the process of integrating more than 10 million Mexican citizens that belong to the indigenous community and who represent 10 % of the population, into the social sphere of present-day Mexico.
We therefore trust that living together peacefully will now become the norm for social behaviour, and also that there will be standardisation in Mexican political life.
We must agree that the recent meeting between the indigenous communities and the Mexican politicians is a good example to follow in this political phase which began in July 2000, in which progress is being made, overcoming old contradictions.
On these shores, on the old continent of Europe, many of us are pleased to see this political change that is taking place in Mexico in terms of recognising this minority, which has been historically marginalised.
This attitude means that we should thank President Fox and his Government, as well as the Zapatistas and obviously the indigenous communities.
Mr President, the Commission fully supports the opinion of those Members of Parliament who have signed the resolutions you are considering on the recent events in Mexico.
The new Mexican Government and the Zapatista National Liberation Army have confirmed that they are committed to finding a political solution and we believe, as you do, that they have opened up the way to finding a peaceful solution to this conflict.
In this context, we obviously welcome the fact that the new global agreement which was signed by the European Union and Mexico has recently come into force.
As Mr Seguro reiterated, this agreement will enable us to continue to support the process that has recently been initiated in Mexico.
As you know, this agreement goes well beyond objectives that are related purely to trade and cooperation.
This agreement includes a clause entitled 'human rights' , which now stands at the heart of EU-Mexico relations, and also includes a clause on respect for commitments, which enables us to take into consideration developments in the human rights situation in Mexico and its states.
In addition, this agreement puts in place a mechanism to allow the parties to take action if the objectives set out contractually are breached.
In addition to cooperation on human rights, democracy and the proper management of public affairs, this agreement also provides us with a legal framework for cooperation in cultural matters, education and training, and which pays particular attention, as is the case given Mexico' s needs, to the most disadvantaged sections of society.
We also have a framework of regional cooperation and, last of all and most importantly, we have a spotlight on social affairs and poverty, which includes vulnerable groups such as the indigenous population, whilst taking into account the need to respect the fundamental rights of these indigenous Mexican people as distinct groups.
Out in Mexico, in order to apply all this in practice, and in line with the Country Strategy Paper for Mexico, which has now been adopted, we are working on an important project to develop the Lacandonia forest, in the state of Chiapas, and the practical aim of this project is both to work with the communities involved, and to seek to enlighten them on the concept of sustainable development, that is, by combining both action to sustain the environment and social action.
This is an example of the practical measures we are taking at the moment.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Somalia and attack against "MÃ©decins sans frontiÃšres
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0263/2001 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0276/2001 by Mrs Maes and others on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
B5-0284/2001 by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0290/2001 by Mr Van Hecke in behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
B5-0292/2001 by Mrs Muscardini on behalf of the UEN Group;
B5-0301/2001 by Mr van den Bos on behalf of the ELDR Group,
on the situation in Somalia and attack against "MÃ©decins sans frontiÃšres"
Mr President, I am happy to say that the remaining two hostages, two humanitarian workers, British citizens, were released yesterday.
They had been captured on 27 March last together with a further seven westerners and a Somali by the warlord Musse Sudi Yalahow.
Of course, we are reassured by their release, but it does not diminish our concern at the failure to respect human rights and our condemnation of the continued acts of violence and banditry perpetrated by the armed militia in Somalia.
It is vital that the temporary Somali Government does everything possible to initiate constructive dialogue working towards peace, stability and national reconciliation with all the parties involved, Somali community leaders and the authorities of Somaliland and Puntland.
We all need to renounce the use of arms in order to be able to address the country's serious political, social and economic problems, so that all the parties tackle the issues of the management of aid, education, health and the economy together.
The donor countries must all step up humanitarian aid and cooperation activities, ensure that the embargo on arms is fully respected and require all the parties concerned to cooperate to re-establish peace.
The European Union, in particular, must provide all the financial and technical assistance necessary to guarantee the success of the peace initiative of the Intergovernmental Development Authority and Djibouti, but, in particular, it must, as it did in the case of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, undertake a coherent political initiative and speak with one voice to promote dialogue and negotiation to resolve the country's most urgent problems.
Civil society, the local communities and the non-governmental organisations, which are fighting for national reconciliation and peace, must be supported.
We must disband the armed groups which have caused the death of at least 20 civilians in recent weeks and step up mine-clearance operations. We must also show our complete solidarity with and support for the organisation "MÃ©decins sans frontiÃšres", which, as I said, was attacked on 27 March last.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 March, ten humanitarian workers from the United Nations and MÃ©dicins sans FrontiÃšres were taken hostage by a militia leader in Somalia, which should give the international community some idea of how far into the abyss this country has fallen.
When banditry or acts of war - I am not sure how to distinguish between them in this case - afflict missionaries, even those working for peace and charity, which these Westerners are, and when these become bargaining chips for the warmongers, civilian populations are using this type of violent action to make the most desperate appeal for help to the international community.
What sort of situation can this anonymous mass of people be in, if even those who are helping them are harmed in this way?
What can be the cause of their complaints?
Were these people not able to contact us in any way other than by kidnapping 10 UN and MSF workers, who are exemplary in their commitment but subjected to intense media coverage simply because they are from the West?
The hostages have now all been released, but this appeal must not be allowed to fade away and we must give the most effective and committed reply in response. In other words, we must take immediate action to ensure that humanitarian workers can work in safety in Somalia, this long-suffering country, and provide a long-term policy of support to democracy and human rights against a background of national reconciliation.
Somalia, which is in a desperate situation, must be put at the core of the European ideals of democracy and solidarity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although, as Mrs Isler BÃ©guin has said, the hostages have been released, I think that what we must consider here is that we can in no way regard the taking of hostages as a political act.
I believe that this is above all an act of cowardice, of barbarism, which is unacceptable.
The message that should have been given when the hostages were taken must remain exactly the same one now.
Therefore, Mr President, we must continue to give our solidarity, with the same conviction, to all those working behind the scenes, to all the NGOs which are easy targets for one simple reason - and that is because they often work in a non-partisan manner.
Their members bring relief to all those in need, regardless of their political beliefs, and I think that this is what makes them extremely easy targets -vulnerable targets.
We must therefore continue to give them our unwavering support.
Next, Mr President, I believe that we must appoint a permanent representative for this affair who can monitor the situation in Somalia, as we did during the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Initial progress has been made with the appointment of the interim democratic Government, a Government that is recognised in the international courts and which has managed to quell the unrest throughout the region.
I believe that we must now go further by also forcing this Government to take its place around the negotiating table with all the parties, all the political parties, involved in this conflict.
Most importantly, we, be it the European Union, the UN or the Organisation for African Unity (OAU), must ensure that there is a total weapons embargo and that this embargo is strictly complied with.
We must condemn in the strongest possible terms any supply of illegal weapons.
Somalia is unfortunately experiencing a period of great instability due to all the fighting between various factions, which has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
It is the people who are paying the price.
Violence is bringing about famine, famine brings about wars, and wars are bringing about disease, against a background of general indifference.
We must send an equally powerful message.
Mr President, for years, Somalia has been left to fend for itself by the international community.
After all, there was no credit to be gained.
Today, Somalia is a fragmented country ruled by a fragmented Government.
The warlords are those who now wield power.
The Arta peace talks brought renewed hope.
A national transitional Government was installed, but it struggled to establish any authority.
The European Union - and I believe Mr Sylla is right - has no choice but to give its emphatic support to this Government, without, however, misjudging the reality in Somalia.
A constructive dialogue between the Government and the other leading figures is the only realistic solution.
The Governments of Somaliland and Puntland must also be involved in this, and third countries, such as Ethiopia, must be warned against disturbing the peace process in any way.
To be able to play a leading role, the Union must, in my opinion, appoint a special envoy for Somalia as a matter of urgency, just as it has now already done in the cases of Ethiopia and Eritrea.
In fact, as far as I am concerned, this could be one and the same person.
Now that there is at long last a prospect of sustainable peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia, we must avoid an unstable Somalia at all costs.
We must employ all available means to stop the balkanisation of Somalia, and the Union can play an important role in this.
Mr President, I would like to begin what will be a brief speech by clarifying that the Commission roundly condemns all attacks against any member of humanitarian staff and this condemnation is made in similar terms as those used by Mr Sylla.
Having clarified this issue, we are relieved to have learnt, as is Mrs Ghilardotti, that the two remaining hostages have been released.
Nevertheless, we believe that these kidnappings highlight the need to bring an end to the violent tensions in central and southern Somalia, as each of the previous speakers have also stressed.
You may rely on the Commission to take prompt action in offering aid to help to rebuild the country in every aspect, and God knows that this needs to be done.
We are doing this and shall continue to do this in close collaboration with all the other parties involved, whilst making use of aid coordination by the Somalia Aid Coordination Body, which also includes United Nations agencies.
The Commission has granted substantial amounts of humanitarian aid for rehabilitation to Somalia.
The aid receives the full support of all the political authorities of the European Union, and the troika mission that the European Union recently sent to Somalia enabled us to witness the extent to which Commission aid is both indispensable and appreciated in the regions that were visited.
We have decided to continue to support rehabilitation in all the areas of Somalia where peace has more or less been established, and, in particular, Somaliland and Puntland, by applying the approach that was adopted and which is known as 'dividends of peace' .
At the same time, we are supporting the transitional government in its efforts to establish an environment of peace and security in the area of the country that is still affected by the conflict and where there are no administrative structures.
There are regions in Somalia where rehabilitation is not possible under the current circumstances, and in these regions, we shall continue to provide humanitarian aid in the form of ECHO, which is working with the NGOs and United Nations agencies.
The European Union has adopted a policy, in particular in the statement made on 8 September 2000, and this policy, I would reiterate, urges the transitional Government to enter into immediate dialogue with the current authorities - I mentioned Somaliland and Puntland earlier - in order to avoid losing the momentum created by the Arta process, in line with the resolutions made at the Summit of East African Heads of State.
We would also stress the importance of including all those who did not take part in the Arta conference in this process of national reconciliation, with a view to trying to re-establish national unity.
In any case, and I would reiterate this as far as we are concerned, we shall not support any attempt, from any quarter, which seeks to establish the authority of a government in Somalia through the use of force and which would threaten the situation of peace and stability, albeit fragile, but real nonetheless, that has been attained and which is present in various regions of Somalia.
We cannot accept a peace process that leads to further conflict in regions where peace has been established with the active support of the international community, and on this issue, we support the speakers who have called for this resolution.
Thank you, Commissioner Lamy.
Today the Commission was very disciplined and spoke for less than normal.
That is why we must have a 20-minute break. According to the agenda, the next two items are to be taken at 5.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.10 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Fishing accidents
The next item is the report (A5-0087/2001) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on fisheries: safety and causes of accidents (2000/2028(INI)).
Mr President, this report that I am presenting today to this House on safety in fisheries and the causes of fishing accidents analyses, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons for the high accident rate in this sector, and examines aspects such as the European legislative framework, the problems surrounding the work of fishermen and preventing risks.
Although the initiative to deal with this issue in Parliament came from the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, the work that is being presented to you today is the fruit of the work of many, including that of my colleagues, members of the Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament, who worked very hard with me, and who finally adopted this report unanimously.
There was also the hearing with experts in September, the invaluable contributions that I received from officials from the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs and the European Parliament Directorate-General on Research and also the contributions made by the Advisory Committee on Fisheries.
Everyone agreed on describing the job of fisherman (270 000 in the European Union) as a very dangerous profession, and also largely on the analysis of the reasons why fisheries has an accident rate that is up to 25 times higher than other economic sectors, and that one fisherman in seven in the European Union is involved in an occupational accident each year.
This very high rate is due to a combination of very different causes: bad weather, long, very intense working days, payment systems, such as the so-called 'catch-share payment' , which are not very comparable, a lack of collective negotiation, difficult working conditions, bad living conditions on board, isolation, separation from families and from the social environment, the remoteness of fishing grounds, the age of the fleet, etc.
I reject the sceptical position and fatalistic view of those who think that fishing accidents are inevitable and that the victims of them are a price we have to pay to the sea.
I think that we need to look for the causes of these accidents and deal with them.
We need to make safety a priority.
We have unacceptable accident rates and we need to step up controls, raise awareness among ship owners and fishermen and, if necessary, encourage legislative changes in order to reduce them.
We need to consider the social and labour conditions of seafarers and improve their working conditions, as they endure irregular rest times and working patterns based on working days of more than 14 hours.
This sector needs to be given a right to constant weekly and daily rest and, if necessary, the public authorities should intervene in order to impose what is the fundamental right of any worker.
These hard working conditions mean, for example, that young people do not want to join the industry, which prevents the new generation from taking over.
We need to establish social dialogue in the sector, at European level, in order to reach collective agreements incorporating these issues of safety at work, consult more with the sector, provide those working in fisheries with social protection similar to that of other workers and develop a culture of safety among employers and workers.
The European Union does not even have statistical data; only five countries provide figures and they are not comparable.
This issue should be taken into account when launching the third phase of the 'European statistics on accidents at work' project so that the Community can have reliable and complete data, harmonised at European level.
My group has always thought that in this House we should talk not only about issues associated with fishing resources, but also about the human problems that affect seafarers.
Therefore, my report asks that the conclusions reached should be included in the regulations on the reform of the CFP, so that the triangle made up of legislation, training and social dialogue can be included.
I also urge the Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the international conventions and improve the Community directives which at this moment in time do not cover up to 90% of the fleet.
I also point out in my report that flags of convenience do not provide work or safety guarantees to their crews, which entails serious risks for fishermen working on board these vessels.
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report about an issue that has not been dealt with so far.
It is the first of these reports and will possibly be followed by second and third reports on accidents in fisheries.
I hope that, as it is the first one, you will look tolerantly upon its defects and support it.
Mr President, our Dutch colleague, Mr Maat, is shadow rapporteur for my political group for the report by our distinguished colleague, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
He apologises for his absence and has asked me to step into the breach.
I will make his statement in English:
'Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report.
It is a very important initiative, because safety is a subject of great importance to the fisheries sector as a whole.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos says that each year worldwide a great number of accidents take place and many are fatal.
In the European Union alone more than 2 000 accidents occur every year.
It will be impossible to decrease this number to zero due to the special features of the sector, but at least we should try and decrease the number of accidents as much as possible.
This could be accomplished by improving some preconditions: first of all, better control on working conditions and safety on the fishing vessels that operate in the waters of the European Union.
Furthermore, it is important to improve harmonisation and coordination between Member States as a whole.
Regular controls on safety and working conditions should take place on all EU fishing vessels regardless of whether they are small, large, old or new.
Besides this, further awareness regarding safety in the fisheries sector is necessary.
Information campaigns and education are important tools to achieve this.
Taking into account the increasing difficulties experienced throughout the EU in attracting young people for jobs at sea, the aspects of safety and working conditions should be given full attention.
It is highly necessary to create a safety culture in this sector, so that all the interested parties know about the situation, which is very special, and respect their responsibilities.
I, Albert Jan Maat, hope that this initiative report will be integrated in the discussion about the Green Paper and in the proposals for the new fisheries policy after 2002.'
I would like to add a few personal comments. I agree with all these statements.
Recently I was on board a shrimp trawler in Greenland.
The icy polar wind was blowing and many small one-man boats were lying in the harbour in thick ice.
I respect the fishing profession and admire fishermen who go about their daily business under the most impossible and most difficult conditions.
Fishermen need our active moral and legislative support especially in the area of safety at work.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, the fisherman' s profession or vocation, call it what you will, has always been one of the toughest and most dangerous in the world.
History, chronicles and the literature of all maritime and fishing nations are full of references to acts of heroism, to suffering, to tragedies and shipwrecks at sea involving both small and large fishing boats.
Fishing communities keep alive the memories of tragic events, which they pass on from generation to generation.
Today, fortunately, modern technology can substantially reduce the danger, the uncomfortable conditions, accidents and shipwrecks.
We now have the means to act, as long as there is the desire to act in this field.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos' s report is one of the most useful, appropriate, intelligent and well-drafted own-initiative reports that I have had the task of reading and studying amongst the many own-initiative reports that abound in this Parliament.
This is not an empty rhetorical exercise. It is an exemplary text and the rapporteur deserves our utmost praise and gratitude.
I therefore support not only her diagnosis, but also all the proposals, recommendations, encouragement, suggested measures and warnings contained in the report and I fully agree with its motives.
If the Commission and the Council give a favourable welcome to the content of the report and put it into practice, in a few years we will have fewer accidents, fewer deaths, fewer shipwrecks and less risk at sea.
We will not, of course, be able to eliminate risk entirely, but the accident rate will be greatly reduced, fishing will take on a more human face and its workers will be given more dignity.
Congratulations, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
Mr President, I would like this report to contribute to the Commission giving up once and for all its obsession that a modern fleet runs counter to the protection of resources.
Protection of resources is a priority objective of the CFP, which can under no circumstances be put before any measure that promotes the safety of fishermen, because this is a fundamentally false approach.
There are many measures for maintaining and even reducing the fishing effort, while at the same time enabling living and safety conditions for crews to be improved.
The report that we are debating today, like all those that have been drawn up regarding safety, shows that the fact the fleet is so old is the main cause both of accidents on board and of sinking, and that sinking often has very serious consequences.
The Commission' s plan to reserve the structural measures for the fleet almost exclusively for destroying it, while the surviving fleet is condemned to sail under increasingly precarious conditions, is therefore ridiculous.
The only thing that is unfortunately achieved through this policy is that the Community fleet features more strongly in terms of accidents than in terms of savings.
Also, there is no point in having a battery of safety standards if it is not required that they are complied with.
This is doubly concerning because the fact that this compliance has to be monitored and required makes us wonder what perception the sector has of its own safety.
The last FAO report on the world state of fisheries and aquaculture says that a safe working environment is not something that can be imposed easily and that measures for improving safety can only be effective if there is the will to put them into practice.
We therefore need to remember the responsibility that we all have as politicians, governments and fishermen, to end the fatalism that seems to surround this sector, a responsibility that cannot of course be escaped by the Commission or its narrow view on the modernisation of the fleet.
Mr President, admittedly, we owe this report to the determination of Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries but also to the tenacity of Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos who has been able to convince everyone on this subject, because the Committee on Fisheries is often, if not always, obsessed with protecting fishery resources; we should not forget about the lives of our fishermen.
I would reiterate that, according to the International Labour Organisation, 24 000 sea fishermen die every year throughout the world - we do not, admittedly, have a global responsibility - as a result of accidents at sea.
As a result of this report and also because of the timetable set out by the new fishing policy, we now have the opportunity to include this point in the Green Paper and we will later be able to include it in the common fisheries policy.
This has been mentioned by numerous speakers and I think and hope that the Commission will include it.
Since we obviously have no commitment to achieve specific results, we cannot do this, but we do have a commitment to resources in this matter, and we can make use of many of them. For example, I am thinking of direct legislation in the area of fishermen' s safety and safety at work, ship and equipment design or introducing rules for managing resources, which may have, and can have, implications for fishermen' s safety.
We must also urge ship-owners to make use of technological developments.
We must always be at hand to help Member States and the fisheries sector to include these requirements in both initial and in on-going vocational training.
Lastly, I shall conclude by repeating the simple terms that Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos suggested, that is, the safety culture - it should be used to the maximum.
In this sector, there is a tradition of fatalism, which is related to the natural elements.
We must fight against this tradition, in the name of the safety culture, because there is no reason why, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we cannot reduce the number of accidents at sea and the number of deaths amongst our fishermen.
Mr President, fishing is an activity which takes place in a naturally hostile environment, and is clearly associated with risk-taking.
Risks are inherent in almost every decision made by a skipper or individual fishermen: on when and where to go fishing, what gear to use, when and where to land the catch, and so on. The level of marine accidents is unacceptably high.
In the UK, for example, the fatality rate among fishermen is 20 times higher than that for workers in the manufacturing industry.
Fishermen work in an unpredictable environment and are confronted with daily challenges from bad weather, fires on board, loss of power, poor vessel construction, poor communications and sometimes out-of-date navigation equipment.
Casualties at sea have, unfortunately, become an integral part of the fishing profession.
But the accident toll could undoubtedly be reduced if the fishing industry and individual fishermen, national authorities, the EU and international organisations faced this vital issue with enough thought, consideration, political will and economic means.
I welcome this initiative, I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope that the Commission will follow up the recommendations in this report with positive action to improve safety and to reduce the number of accidents.
It is also important that safety be one of the key priorities in the forthcoming review of the CFP.
It is essential that we do not create a management regime which forces fishermen to go to sea when the weather is bad, for example, in complying with days-at-sea restrictions or attempting to land fish in a designated port cut off by bad weather.
High prices in periods of bad weather may also drive fishermen working under quota systems out on risky fishing trips, which may be the only way to obtain the best prices for what they land against their quotas.
Such risks are preventable if safety forms an integral part of fisheries management.
I welcome the recent developments in Scotland, where changes in fishermen's safety training mean that an age exemption for older catchers will be a thing of the past and that basic sea survival, first aid and survival training will soon be mandatory for all fishermen.
Finally, although a gradual ban on vessels more than 20 years old can be supported, the latter part of paragraph 4 in the report says, and I quote: ". . . except for those proven to be in perfect condition".
It would be better if that section read: ". . . except for those that have passed annual safety tests".
It is more practical to use that language than to open up a variable definition of perfect conditions.
I therefore urge Members to support Amendment No 6.
Mr President, can I also congratulate Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos on this own-initiative report.
When you read the frightening statistics at the beginning of her report which indicate that some 24 000 fishermen die each year throughout the world, the huge risks involved in working in this industry become apparent.
This report calls for some radical proposals such as the call to introduce a gradual ban on vessels of 20 years of age or over, which my colleague Mr Hudghton has just mentioned, except where they have passed stringent annual safety checks.
I support this proposition.
Indeed such a policy might encourage participation in scrap-and-build programmes amongst those Member States which have traditionally refused to take advantage of cofinancing for such schemes, and the UK is a case in point.
The UK fleet is now approaching an average age of 30 years and our fishermen are being forced to put to sea in vessels which are becoming increasingly risky and accident prone.
I would also like to raise a couple of additional external factors which are not covered by the report but which the Commission may wish to consider.
Too often recently, we have seen lives lost when fishing vessels engaged in a trawl have snagged their gear on undersea cables and other foreign objects on the seabed.
There must be much more stringent regulation concerning the laying of undersea power and telecommunication cables or any foreign objects on the seabed where the lives of our fishermen might be endangered.
Also there have been many cases of fishing vessels being dragged under or rammed by submarines.
Only recently we had the tragic accident involving a US submarine and a Japanese training vessel where seven students lost their lives.
There have been similar cases in Scottish waters in recent years.
There must be better coordination between fishermen and naval personnel to ensure that such accidents can be avoided.
Finally, many fishermen think that learning to swim is a bad omen.
Can I suggest that as part of the rigorous training qualifications that are being called for by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos in this report, swimming qualifications would be necessary and would save many fishermen's lives every year.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would first of all like to congratulate the Committee on Fisheries, its chairman and, in particular, you, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, as rapporteur, on this initiative.
The Commission entirely agrees with you.
The safety of our fishermen must be given top priority.
In the Green Paper on the future of the CFP, which I will shortly be presenting to Parliament, we have not forgotten this matter of concern and have thereby met one of your objectives, which you presented under paragraph 32 of the report.
Since 1989, on the initiative of the Commission, the European Union has made every effort to improve the health and safety of workers in the fisheries sector.
Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, together with the associated specific directives, offer a solid legal base.
The following specific directives have also been issued: Directive 92/29/EEC on medical treatment on board, Directive 93/102/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels and Directive 97/70/EEC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.
According to your report, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, there are problems above all in two areas: firstly, the correct maintenance of vessels and, secondly, the working conditions, hygiene and the organisation of work on board.
The framework directive and the specific directives cover both these spheres of action.
Having said that, we must note that more and more accidents are occurring in the fisheries sector.
Just in the last few months, accidents have occurred which have led to a number of deaths. I would at this point like to express my deep condolences to the families affected.
The Commission can agree with you fully.
First of all, the Member States must also implement the provisions of the directives.
As far as your conclusions are concerned, Madam Rapporteur, I feel there is a need to act in the following areas.
The first area has to do with the legal framework, which is covered in paragraphs 1 to 3 and paragraph 27 of your report. The applicable directives are essentially adequate but they are just minimum requirements, and there is nothing to prevent the Member States from issuing stricter rules or establishing special requirements for specific cases.
Moreover, the directives contain a reporting duty for the Member States with different timetables.
With the help of these national reports, in 2002 the Commission will compile a summary report and, where necessary, table amendments.
In preparation for this, we have started to amend Directive 97/70/EEC to ensure the harmonised interpretation of the Annexe to the Torremolinos International Convention.
The second area relates to the vocational and continuing training of workers, which is covered by paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 26 and 30. The directives already contain articles on the vocational training of workers.
Here too, however, we are dealing with minimum requirements.
It therefore once again lies with Member States to see to it that they are implemented and, if needs be, to bring about higher standards.
I can assure you, however, that the Commission will make the vocational and continuing training of workers in matters of safety one of the central issues in its forthcoming report.
However, the best rules are useless if they are not complied with correctly or at all.
Monitoring and control are the main problems.
But these fall exclusively within the remit of the Member States.
We must therefore urge them to apply the provisions correctly.
Moreover, objective, reliable and comparable data on the causes and circumstances of accidents are a prerequisite for successful prevention.
In this regard, there is already an initiative on the harmonisation of data in the competent departments of Eurostat and also in the Commission' s Directorate-General for Employment.
As regards fleet renewal, I would like to remind you that one of the objectives of all the structural programmes in the fisheries sector is to modernise fishing vessels.
In the context of the financial instrument on structural assistance in the fisheries sector, there are abundant resources available to improve safety on board.
Finally, as regards the international part of the CFP, the Commission has always insisted on compliance with the rules in force.
Safety and health on board vessels are part and parcel of our overall strategy both in the bilateral agreements and in the regional fisheries organisations, as well as in the fight against illegal fishing and flying flags of convenience.
By way of conclusion, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, I can agree with you fully.
All of us - the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Member States and international organisations - must do our outmost to ensure that the risk for our fishermen is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Your initiative is an important step towards achieving this goal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Professional fees
The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission (B5-0164/2001) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on compulsory tariffs for certain liberal professions, in particular lawyers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one normally never gets this amount of time.
I have no idea how I am going to fill the seven minutes allotted to me.
But this is a very serious matter.
Europe is becoming increasingly concerned with the role of the liberal professions.
As they are part of the single market it is clear that issues concerning freedom in the single market are also extremely important for the liberal professions.
Unfortunately, what one hears in European institutions is not always easy to understand, to interpret properly and to elucidate.
We do know that, a few months ago, the Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, made a number of statements in this connection.
Mr Monti was attending an international conference when he said that, in his view, setting tariffs for liberal professions, which up to a point is done according to the law in some Member States through such mechanisms as fee scales for lawyers, is not without its problems under competition law.
He also announced at this conference that the Commission would look into this problem.
We also have the situation in which an Italian court submitted a request to the European Court for an advance determination in relation to which a hearing took place last autumn, and now the European Court will have to rule on the admissibility of Italian fee scales for lawyers under European law.
We have liberalised markets in many areas of the European Union.
However, we have not normally liberalised them in such a way that we said from one day to the next, that' s it, we are now releasing you into a world of completely free competition.
Usually there are transitional periods, statutory regulations for adjustment and so on, for example in energy policy and many other sectors.
Only in the specific area of the liberal professions does it seem that there are no, or not enough, political considerations of this kind at the level of the European Union.
I think it is extremely important that, in the future, the Commission takes a closer look at the liberal professions and starts to deal with their specific demands.
They must deal not only with the people who work in the liberalised professions but, most decisively, with consumers as well.
Fee scales were issued by national legislators in the Member States in order to provide reliable protection for consumers when they made use of the services provided by the liberal professionals.
I think this aspect is gaining increasing influence in the policy of the European Union and must be integrated into any strategies that are developed.
We know that the Commission has just presented a paper on the services sector and the problems posed by the single market.
This is very much to be welcomed.
It just strikes me that this paper follows a completely horizontal approach and does not deal with the specific interests of the individual branches in the services sector, which is very big.
In my view, the medical and legal professions, for example, cannot be dealt with according to the same criteria as the supermarket round the corner whose social task is quite different.
We must not forget that the liberal professions are largely subject to specific special provisions attached to their profession in terms of competition, advertising, standards of behaviour and other obligations.
Today at midday, we voted in second reading on the money-laundering directive which dealt with such obligations.
That is why I believe that a specific political approach for the liberal professions is appropriate.
We want Parliament to deal with this issue and we want to force the Commission, by means of this oral question, to tackle the issue of the liberal professions head on, which it has so far failed to do.
That is why we have introduced this oral question with the text you have before you, which you are all familiar with and which I do not intend to go into any further.
I would now like to say a few words about the task my political group feels we have to take on, which is the reason why this resolution was introduced.
It is not enough just to talk about it; we must take advantage of this part-session to announce our demands in a brief Commission resolution. From our experiences in committee, the Commission normally complies with such requests.
On the basis of this resolution, therefore, I expect the Commission to make concrete proposals and statements on the development of policy with regard to the liberal professions.
I also expect it to answer the question of how, from a political viewpoint, it intends to deal with the modern developments that society entails. The liberal professions cannot ignore progress; they must of course bear in mind that times change and the world moves on.
I have one final comment. Most liberal professions are also small and medium-sized enterprises.
That is why there is special interest in protecting these groups and also a special obligation on the part of the Commission to deal with this issue.
I have now spoken for six minutes.
I will forego my last minute.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, promoting competition amongst the liberal professions in the interests of consumers is one of the avowed priorities of my colleague, Mario Monti.
I welcome this opportunity to be able to present our policy to Parliament on his behalf and to comment on it.
The Commission agrees with you that guaranteeing the quality of services is of the utmost importance because customers, that is, consumers, are often in a weaker position than those who provide these services.
A rule which is solely targeted at guaranteeing top quality services without distorting competition is clearly in the interests of consumers.
This holds true regardless of whether the rule is introduced by the state or by a professional organisation.
The Community' s competition rules do not therefore apply to purely professional rules.
Whether a rule is a purely professional rule must be determined from one case to the next.
In so doing, account must be taken of the impact of the rule on the freedom of action of members of the profession or of professional organisations as well as consumers.
As far as determining compulsory tariffs or rates of charges is concerned, it depends, firstly, on who determines the fees or rates of charges and, secondly, on what interests are taken into consideration.
The determining of uniform fees by members of a profession is a fundamental violation of competition rules.
Justification on grounds of professional ethics is not recognised.
At the same time, Member States only have the right to determine compulsory tariffs if these fees are objectively justified on grounds of the general interest.
The Commission is of the view that this requirement is met if the mandate and the power of the authority issuing the rule in question is sufficiently clearly and unequivocally expressed in the rule itself and if there is no room for unlawful agreements to be reached between members of the profession.
The Commission does, however, have certain reservations concerning the interpretation of the case law referred to in the question, if this interpretation leads one to believe that only fees which are determined by professional bodies or associations of all members of a given profession can be subject to competition law.
What is important however is that the existing, clear, objective and justified criteria of general interest, which are determined by the state, are met.
These criteria must include consideration of the interests of consumers and not only consideration of the interests of the profession.
The quality of services should be guaranteed through other, less restrictive, means than the determining of fees.
It is therefore not enough that a fee agreement is approved or confirmed by the relevant authorities in order for it to be exempt from the applications of competition rules.
A price agreement reached between members of a given profession, that is, between competitors, is a fundamental violation of competition rules.
Moreover, a Members State can violate its obligations out of the EC Treaty if the rule in question removes the effectiveness of competition rules.
This is the case, for example, when a state obliges the profession to determine uniform fees without specifying the criteria of the common good which have to be met.
A breach of contract takes place if a Member State transfers its power to determine fees to a professional association without reserving the right of supervision.
For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out that the Commission does not support the determining of compulsory tariffs but at most tolerates it under certain circumstances.
In areas in which compulsory uniform tariffs apply, competition must result from quality.
It is therefore important for members of the profession to publicise their special fields and to be able to advertise.
The Court of Justice just recently pointed out that advertising on every market is an important competitiveness factor since, in this way, the advantages of individual market participants, the quality of their services and tariffs are conveyed more clearly.
The Court confirmed the Commission' s opinion that a ban on comparative advertising seriously affected the ability of the most competitive members of the profession to expand their services and also had a negative impact when the customer base was confined to the single market.
Finally, on the question of the country-of-origin principle, it must be noted that this principle helps to bring about a single market.
It is anchored in the Parliament and Council Directive 98/5/EEC facilitating the permanent exercise of the lawyer' s profession and guarantees, among other things, that lawyers can establish themselves using the professional title of the Member State in which they completed their training by simply registering in the host country.
The directive aims to enable layers who practice under the title given by their country-of-origin to establish branches and subsidiaries.
In general, the Commission continues to ensure that the advantages of freedom of movement, which can be achieved through the country-of-origin principle, are weighed against the general interest, which is protected in the host country and recognised under Community law.
The Commission is currently looking into how it can make further progress concerning the conditions for the cross-border provision of certain services.
Mr President, first may I say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Lord Inglewood, who is an expert on this topic and who has had to return to London at short notice.
As a liberal professional myself, in this case a doctor, rather than a lawyer, I have to say that my British experience of fixed professional fees - fixed in this case by government - such as cremation fees and attendances at coroners' courts, is that they are artificially low and have tended to benefit the state rather than the professional concerned.
Politically I have recently been involved with asking the Commission to examine the restrictions applied by British health insurers in only paying the medical fees for treatments provided within the UK and refusing such benefits to British residents who wish to avail themselves of treatment in, for example, France.
Last year I lobbied on behalf of a British lawyer wanting to register in France as a notaire, as non-French notaires are currently prohibited by French law, and this is an activity governed in many Member States by fixed fees.
Currently I am my group's shadow rapporteur on EMAC on a proposed directive for a single market and free movement for insurance mediators, whose commissions are often fixed.
Therefore these concepts apply to a number of different professionals other than lawyers, as I have already mentioned.
The single market is one of the major achievements of the European Community and for that market to be complete it must include services as well as goods.
I entirely agree with Commissioner Bolkestein that the services sector in Europe offers huge potential growth for competition and employment which must be to the benefit of all of Europe's citizens.
The Commission's initiative in this area is therefore one that I strongly support and in accordance with the so-called single market principles, it should be possible to introduce in one Member State business models providing services pioneered successfully in another, and of course they should be subject to examination under the Treaty rules on competition.
I am conscious of the need for proper consumer protection across a single market, but I also suspect that many practices which have grown up over the years, through tradition and usage, may have outlived some of their original usefulness.
It is very important, therefore, that a thorough inquiry be conducted which will lead to a comprehensive debate so that special privileges and practices and exemptions which may be attached to the exercise of the liberal professions - and not just the lawyers - are properly scrutinised.
It is necessary to ensure that they will provide a real benefit to the citizen, and are not merely privileges supporting the vested interests of all the professions concerned.
Mr President, having heard Commissioner Fischler' s answer it gives me the impression that at the moment on this matter the Commission is completely unprepared.
I think that it is only starting to see the outer layer of the problems.
Because I was thinking a moment ago that in the last part-session, Commissioner Reding, sitting where Commissioner Fischler is sitting now, gave us a detailed explanation of the agreement that had been reached between the Commission, FIFA and UEFA.
That is a business worth many billions of euros and in that case it seems that competition gives way to quality.
At times it seems that quality is very important, and I agree with this interpretation.
We are talking about a profession, that of a lawyer, which is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world - they say that there is another profession that is older, but I am not going to mention it to avoid being accused of sexism.
The law profession is very old and the danger of that is that lawyers deal with quantities.
Using the words of Karl Marx, here quality becomes quantity, or the reverse, if you like, because lawyers are defending interests that can be quantified.
In the different countries of the Community, or at least in some of them, there is a system of protection through professional organisations, which is not perfect and could be improved but which at least establishes some guarantees, as there are too many unscrupulous lawyers who, left to the free interaction of supply and demand, could be tempted to act and abuse their position.
I have the impression that the Commission is currently at a very immature time and therefore that we should look at this subject with a degree of calm.
I think that we need to start seeing what is happening - I think that Mr Tannock was referring to this - in the different Member States, what makes it difficult for someone to go to a lawyer and, above all, why people are afraid of going to a lawyer.
That is to say, I think that there are real problems, but that those real problems cannot be solved by mathematically applying the rules of Community competition and much less by focusing solely on the criterion of prices.
I think that the ideal would be for us to have a professional lawyers' organisation covering the whole Community, not so much in order to protect lawyers but to protect consumers.
We have to think about moving towards an area in which there is protection for people who go to lawyers, protection for consumers, protection for clients, and I think that the conclusion that we could therefore draw here is to invite the Commission to continue to look at the issue and, perhaps with the cooperation of Parliament, to see what the sectors involved say, including, of course, the clients, the people who would like to go to a lawyer, but who normally do not go out of fear.
I suppose I should start by declaring an interest as a member of a liberal profession to whom this question applies, being a lawyer.
It seems to me that this week in Parliament we have been lobbied hard by lawyers' organisations supporting their professional position.
In contrast, last week in the UK we saw the publication of a report by the Office of Fair Trading looking at competition in the professions, the very issue that we are looking at today.
That report was based on two premises: first, that the professions are entrusted with the delivery of services of considerable public importance; but second, that any restriction on the supply of professional services will tend to drive up costs and prices and will limit consumer access and choice.
That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this Parliament has tabled certain amendments.
