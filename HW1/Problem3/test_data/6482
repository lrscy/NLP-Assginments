I welcome the generally positive tone, the good progress of the economy and all the specific advances that you have mentioned and which demonstrate the Rumanian Governmentâs determination to fulfil its commitments.
The information provided today also makes it clear that there are areas of concern in which efforts must continue or, better still, intensify; for example, in the fight against corruption, rigorously applying the legislation in force.
This is one of the most serious problems afflicting Rumania, and on which this Parliament, and my political group as well, incidentally, have repeatedly insisted.
I know that the Rumanian authorities are also aware of this serious problem, since President Basescu made the fight against corruption one of the key issues during last yearâs presidential elections.
Another important area, and one to which the Rumanian authorities must apply more energy, as the Commissioner has told us, is the proper operation of the control of borders through enhancing personnel and providing them with better training; the Accession Treaty also stresses the importance of this area.
In fact, this is a key point since it relates to participation in a single space and a single market which, furthermore, must face serious and heavy migratory pressures at its external borders.
Very notable progress has also been made, however, as Mr Rehn has stressed.
I do not have time to go into specific areas, but I would like to stress that the priority attention paid by the Rumanian authorities to the issue of competition and State aid has yielded very good results.
This is an area to which the Treaty attaches very great importance, as well as the effective date of accession.
I am also pleased that progress is being made, as you have said, Commissioner, on the reform of the judicial administration, a particularly important area, to which attention must continue to be paid.
Ladies and gentlemen, during the months between now and the final report that the Commission will produce next spring, the Rumanian Government must attach absolute priority to compliance with the three outstanding tasks; during this year, the new government has made much progress, but there is still work to be done.
The progress made must serve as a stimulus.
The report presented to us today by the Commissioner will be read carefully, in a constructive but vigilant and demanding spirit.
We must all be aware that the decisive moment for this process will be the report that the Commission has promised for April, including the possible presentation of the safeguard clause.
In any event, the document being presented to us today is very important.
I trust that the Bucharest authorities will react quickly and positively to the warnings that it contains.
They will have our full support in this task.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if I may remain with Mr Lagendijkâs footballing analogy, the Commission may well have shown both Romania and Bulgaria the yellow card, but that certainly does not prevent the Romanian and Bulgarian teams from having a chance of completing accession in 2007, provided that they play well enough and fairly enough.
The Commission was quite right to point out that they have made progress in many areas, but that a number of issues are still outstanding.
Further to what Mr Wiersma said about Romania, I hope that political debate in that country will tend more towards a common European position and that the temptation to divide the country will be resisted.
This is where the opposition, the government and the President need to be singing from the same hymn sheet.
Turning to Bulgaria, I am persuaded that past omissions will be made good in the course of the process of forming a government.
Some of this has already been done and some remains to be.
We will, quite obviously, be carefully observing what the two countries and their governments do to remedy the deficiencies that remain, including not only the major problem of corruption, but also the issue of the situation of the Roma, to which reference has already been made, and to which we, not only in this House, have returned time and time again, with â as I see it â progress being made.
There are, of course, anxieties on this score about the possibility that it will not be security being exported to these countries, but rather problems imported from them, if great strides are not made in helping this disadvantaged group of people in the country itself.
All these things will need to be monitored if it is to be possible eventually, in 2007 or 2008, to come to a decision, and one that must take into account these countriesâ well-being, for what matters, after all, is that they be enabled to take the right steps.
I would like to invite you, Commissioner, to work with this House over the coming months, not only in the countries themselves, but also by improving the way in which the enlargement issue is communicated generally within the European Union.
People are, of course, to some extent, weary of enlargement, and that is hardly surprising in view of the past debates and disappointments, but we cannot simply give in to weariness and say that we are not interested.
This debate is about how to persuade people of how important this enlargement is.
I would like to see the Commission give us an assessment of the 2004 enlargement, for it might well have been said today that it took us to the limits of what was feasible, but I am convinced that it went very well.
That is not to say that there were no problems, but it does, in fact, have the potential to make the European Union stronger, if we work through it together.
That too must be debated.
Something else we, of course, expect of the new Member States is a strong commitment to Europe.
When the newly-elected President of Poland says that his first two visits must be to the USA and the Vatican, that is something I have to accept, for I am certainly not going to interfere in his travel arrangements, but it is not surprising that there are those who wonder whether Europe, the unity that Poland joined, is not actually more important.
This morning, we had a debate on social standards and social models in Europe, and it is in that area that there are fears that the standards that we have established with a great deal of effort will simply be broken asunder.
It is surely not acceptable â and, in saying this, I know that I have my groupâs unreserved backing â that we should, now that we are in a process of enlargement and integration, cut ourselves off again and leave our neighboursâ workers, capital or interests standing, so to speak, at the gate.
We have to be reasonable about the way we plan the transitional process and try together, in so far as possible, to come up with a new social standard, rather than leaving the door wide open to social dumping.
Presupposing that we succeed in persuading our people of how important this enlargement is to the European Union, I hope that we will take the right decision early next year and that we will be able to set 2007 as the date of enlargement.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although last year, Romania and Bulgaria once again took the necessary and important steps, there is a great deal left to be done by both countries in the short time that remains, namely until 1 January 2007.
With regard to Romania, on the basis of the progress reports over the past six months, reports I have received from Romania and my own observations, I have to admit in all honesty that there are still a good deal of major concerns left, many of which have been mentioned by other Members.
I should like to touch on three of those.
Firstly, there is the independence of the judiciary, which, according to the Commissionâs progress report of September 2005, is put at risk by the major budget restrictions imposed by the Finance Ministry.
I would like to know what the latest is on this score.
Secondly, as has been stated before, there is every evidence to suggest that corruption is still rife among the police, in the justice system and in the corridors of power.
To what extent does the Commission think it can solve this by introducing more rules and regulations?
Is it not, above all, a question of awareness, mentality, and therefore time?
Finally, there are serious shortcomings in psychiatric care, which is not considered a priority, or at least that is what I gather from the recent developments in Romania.
How does the Commission intend to press home the urgency of this problem?
I would also like to hear from the Commission what, precisely, it regards as crucial if it is to be able to come out with a positive recommendation this coming spring and thus to recommend accession on 1 January 2007.
As I have told the House before, I do think it of really vital importance that we should adhere to the conditions and criteria that were once so carefully formulated.
Candidate countries or countries with an ambition along those lines not only join an economic area, but also choose to take part in the political union, the European legal community.
The Commission takes a critical line, and that is something that I value.
The question is whether the Council will seriously consider the Commissionâs reports.
It certainly did not do so in December 2004, when it was decided to round up the negotiations formally.
As I see it, the Councilâs absence from this debate is once again telling, whether it has other priorities or not.
Let there be no doubt, though, I am in favour of both countries joining, but regard it as vitally important that this be done on the basis of what we have agreed to.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is good news from Bulgaria, but also alarming news.
Since Juneâs elections, Bulgaria has had Ataka, a neo-Nazi party, in its Parliament.
It obtained 8Â % of the votes in June and now has 12Â %.
This party denies the Holocaust and, on its website, you can find discussions about how to castrate Roma and receive congratulations from the Klu Klux Klan.
Behind this promotion of racism and xenophobia are the former Communist agents who are building a shadow economy through fake privatisation and manipulations.
Their strategy is to divert peopleâs attention from high-level corruption by raising anti-Roma, anti-Semitic and anti-minority sentiments in Bulgaria.
Bulgaria has democratic politicians who want to fight corruption and poverty, but they lack support from us in the European Union.
The EU has an obligation to fix the problems in Bulgaria because it has cooperated with the wrong partners for 15 years already.
How does the Commission view the recent cases of violence between Roma and Bulgarians provoked by anti-Gypsyism?
Secondly, do EC grants help put a stop to racism, or do they stimulate corrupt political structures?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the previous speakers have forgotten to tell us what the real situation is in Bulgaria and Romania during the accession procedure.
Real unemployment in Bulgaria and Romania is terrifyingly high.
Huge industrial and livestock units are closing.
Traditional crops, such as vines and tobacco, have fallen apart or are on the road to destruction.
Even infrastructure works such as irrigation works have fallen apart.
Almost all the irrigation pipes, water channels and irrigation stations and their equipment have been destroyed.
In Bulgaria, for example, overall agricultural production has fallen by more than 50% so that the products of the multinationals of Europe, whose interests you defend, can be sold.
With the restoration of the right to own land, the average size is 1.5 hectares or 15 decares, a very small allotment with, hence, zero margin for efficient cultivation.
Thus, you will buy them for nothing, for a loaf of bread.
The multinationals of Europe will buy up land in Bulgaria and Romania.
However, you do not say as much, so that the invitees from Bulgaria and Romania can hear you, although of course they know all this.
The health and education system is breaking down.
The Romanian Government, Commissioner, has the objective today of achieving the standard of living of 1989, which you condemned.
You talk of democratic freedoms, of rights, but you say nothing about the legislative ban on the action of the communist party in Romania.
You say nothing about the unprecedented prison sentence being served since February 1999 by the president of the Confederation of Romanian Miners' Unions, Miron Cosma, who was imprisoned for defending the interests of the miners being made redundant by the thousand.
This situation also has consequences for Greece.
As wages are very cheap, this precise situation results in companies relocating to these countries, especially from the area of northern Greece, in order to increase their profits.
Thus, the Bulgarian and Romanian workers, faced with the spectre of hunger, are forced to work for slave wages and, at the same time, there is pressure on workers in Greece.
So welcome to the European Union, the land of promise, of 20 million unemployed, of 50 million in poverty, the European Union that crushes the rights of the workers so that big business can make untold fortunes.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the June List will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as Members of the European Union in the same way as we shall welcome Turkey, the countries of the Western Balkans and, in time, Ukraine and, hopefully, Belarus.
What, however, is at issue is the timetable, for this is important.
I wish to sound a warning about the problems that will be faced by the EU if, over a very short period, we accept as Members a large number of countries that are poor and economically undeveloped, that have little experience of democracy and of government under the rule of law and that have major problems involving corruption.
Even the enlargement involving 10 countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List has been a strong supporter is giving rise to problems.
To now accept poor countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into an EU that continues to be encumbered by an absurd agricultural policy and a badly managed structural policy and that is grappling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project.
We must ask ourselves at what stage a country should become a fully-fledged Member State.
Is development quickest when a candidate country is making efforts to obtain approval or after it has become a Member?
I believe that the pressure to improve democracy, human rights, the judicial system and public administration and to set up a functioning market economy is strongest, on the one hand, before membership negotiations have begun and, on the other, before the country has been accepted as a Member.
The Commissionâs report on the state of things in Romania and Bulgaria is unconvincing on these different points.
We find a key sentence to the effect that developments have been inadequate in a number of areas, and the Commission provides long lists of what has not been done in terms of infrastructure, organised crime, tax systems and the treatment of minorities.
In this situation, membership for both countries should be postponed until a later date.
This would be in the long-term interests of both the European Union and the two candidate countries.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only in early October, the Romanian Prime Minister, Mr Popescu, stated that the enormous increase in organised crime in Bulgaria is at risk of jeopardising the accession of both countries in 2007 and that the safeguard clause will have to be applied to defer their accession until 1 January 2008.
Popescuâs statements have now been corroborated by the Commission, whose report states, in black and white, that corruption in both countries â not, therefore, only in Bulgaria â has taken on such dimensions that it is putting at risk the future of the EUâs internal market and the programmes funded by the EU.
With regard to reforming the judiciary and administration, there are very few improvements noticeable, which means that corruption is running riot.
Bulgaria and Romania are European countries that, just like the other Central and Eastern European countries, are entitled to join the Union, but they do need to be ready to do so.
We cannot admit countries that have no rule of law to speak of.
The Commission itself admits that countries that are, partly at least, in the grip of organised crime could damage the European internal market.
They should certainly not join in 2007, nor, probably, in 2008.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to thank you personally for your continued openness in handling our proposals regarding accession issues.
The inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the EU is a historical moment.
But let us leave the historical significance aside for a moment, and face the bare facts at last.
A key issue of the current debate is whether the country report reflects the realities of Romania, and if it does, to what extent.
On this occasion, I would like to concentrate on Romania.
We would have to examine a number of areas, and not only in light of the official statistics, but based on everyday reality.
The report of the Commission does stress some of the serious issues, such as the internal market, animal health regulation and food safety, or it remarks on the absence of institutions that would make agricultural assistance available to Romanian farmers.
At the same time, significant measures have been introduced in respect of the reform of the judicial system.
The Commission is appreciative of these measures, and Mrs Macovei, the Minister, is to be commended for them.
But while we are hearing about resounding achievements in the area of political criteria and are informed that the situation of the 1.6Â million Hungarians living in the country has been resolved, there have not been any actual changes.
Like in the case of the Minority Act, none of the partial solutions have actually been accepted.
Although the report still mentions it as a positive development, I must inform the Commissioner that the Romanian Senate rejected the Minority Act yesterday.
And in the course of the debate there was hate talk and discrimination that would not bring credit to any democracy in the world.
Hungarians living in Romania must have heard similar things at the beginning of the 90s.
In light of the shocking vote yesterday, there does not seem to be any possibility of cultural or any other type of autonomy that would actually provide a solution for the large Hungarian community.
To quote the chairperson of the competent expert committee of the Romanian House: âSuch a thing is an impossibility in a rule of law state!â
My question is, what kind of a rule of law state is this?
The legal framework for returning church property has been put in place.
However, in practice, the return of church property is made impossible, the reclaimed buildings are being privatised underhandedly or the privatisation process is slowed down by successive lawsuits.
Proprietary rights cannot be enforced.
What kind of working market economy are we talking about here?
First of all, we must spell out the problems, because naming the problems may help find a solution.
Our task here in Parliament is to name the problems, and it is a considerable task.
This is the most effective way of helping people living in Romania. By a willingness to see the real situation, together with and for those who ought to see it in Brussels and in Romania.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by telling you how pleased I am to be able to speak here in our Chamber in front of the Romanian and Bulgarian observers.
It is truly a first important stage towards Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession to the EU.
I should also like to testify to the progress that I, as a member of our Parliamentary delegation, have observed take place in Bulgaria in the space of six years.
A great deal of progress has been made, including progress shared by a large part of the people.
However, achieving such progress has been very difficult for the people of Bulgaria because a great deal of effort was required of them.
I believe that, in the West, we cannot appreciate the culture shock represented by a shift from a centrally-planned Communist economy to a market economy.
You have all noted that a large number of European have been adopted, an action that has resulted in obvious progress being made in economic and political terms.
Yet, you have also highlighted a large number of grey areas.
Like you, I have to admit that the integration of minorities is a very difficult problem in these countries.
I am thinking about the Roma community, disabled people, women and their role, and homosexuals.
However, are we in a position to tell anyone what to do when we are encountering similar problems in our own countries?
Bulgaria has problems with corruption, property rights and security.
In order to overcome these problems, it needs to carry out a real reform of its judicial system and to start to implement this system effectively, which will give democratic guarantees to the entire population.
There is a need for Bulgaria and Romania to step up their efforts before the next progress report, and for them to do so in the space of a few months.
Yet, there is also a need for the EU not to waver in continuing to contribute its help, its technical assistance and its budgetary support.
Finally, I should like to say that, while we must be rigorous and demanding in our dealings with these two new countries, we must also realise that their arrival in the EU will add a new dimension to Europe and that, at last, we will together be able to turn the page on Yalta.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now one year since the vote on the Moscovici report on progress by Romania and Bulgaria towards accession.
We said âyesâ but with reservations, invoking the safeguard clause stipulated in the Treaty which allowed for a one-year deferment if there were delays or unsatisfactory results in achieving the Community .
I have followed the Romanian situation more closely as a member of the interparliamentary delegation, and I believe that, today, a cautious approach may help us to gain a better awareness of the situation in that country, where the educational system is still inadequate, corruption is still widespread, environmental, energy and economic policies still require strengthening, there is still no real answer to discrimination against minorities, and the average income of the population is too low.
The question of international adoption is also still unresolved and, after the moratorium and approval of the new law, it has now been blocked, with unfortunate and extremely damaging consequences for the children, those with the least protection, who should be the main beneficiaries of what we all refer to as âhuman rightsâ.
The victims are the children who got to know their families but who today are unable to embrace them and live with them.
The European Parliament must keep this problem under close scrutiny and ask Romania to comply with its institutional promises.
Then there are the areas of justice and border controls in relation to prostitution, which needs to be contained, and we must avoid the arrival of under-age girls in neighbouring countries, exploited by local organisations.
Enlargement is a process we cannot halt, but it cannot and must not merely be an economic process: it is also a cultural and democratic phenomenon to ensure peace.
That is why I agree with the prudent comments of the Commission on the definition of accession for Romania and Bulgaria.
The months remaining before the accession of these two countries to the Union will give them the chance of joining Europe without being at the bottom of the class, and will allow us to have the necessary and prudential assurances that accession will occur with full consciousness and on an equal footing.
Naturally, this is our ambition, in order to achieve the dream shared by Romano Prodi with the citizens of Europe when, as President of the Commission, he strongly supported enlargement and expressed the wish for a united Europe able to offer a robust political project, to restore confidence to those looking nervously at the major changes taking place in our time, and thus enable us to be the architects of an international action with a human face.
That, in my view, is the Europe to which we all aspire.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen from Romania and Bulgaria, I will confine my remarks to the subject of Romania.
In mid-July, we received a visit from some particularly anxious Romanian farmers.
They explained to us that the Romanian authorities had lost all control over GMO crops.
No one, not even their minister, knows how many thousands of hectares are covered by these crops.
On the other hand, it turns out that Romania is the country in which GMO crops reign supreme, with soya, maize, plums, potatoes and so on.
The directive on GMOs, Commissioner, is categorically not enforced and has been passed over in your report.
I have not seen the Rosia Montana gold mine mentioned anywhere in the report either.
The present Government, however, took a stand against this project, which violates the very concept of sustainable development, one of the pillars of our European policies.
However, Romania also possesses the jewel in Europeâs environmental crown in the shape of the Danube delta.
Its approach to managing the delta had succeeded, until now, in striking the right balance between promoting the various activities taking place in the delta and protecting its fabulous biodiversity.
However, the way in which the delta is being managed today gives us cause for concern.
Thus, the start of the hunting season, on 15Â September, is harmful to the preservation of these natural surroundings, and this demonstrates that, as far as the environment is concerned, Romania is really not on the right track.
On the other hand, I entirely support Romaniaâs accession to the European Union but, in doing so, I call on the Romanian authorities to get to grips with the environment and to undertake effectively to protect it.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is because our political attitudes are often shaped by imagery in constant use that I want to object to the use of the âyellow cardâ analogy, which is so frequent nowadays.
The Commission has not, today, shown Romania and Bulgaria the yellow card, for that would presuppose that they were already on the pitch, but they are not â yet.
That they are European players is not in doubt, but they are not yet in the stadium.
What are they saying among themselves, and where are they in the league?
Reference has been made to the NGO âTransparency Internationalâ, which has also stated that corruption in Bulgaria has, indeed, become more widespread, and has recently moved Bulgaria down its Index, not only in terms of ranking, but also of points.
What that means, if you agree with Baroness Nicholsonâs view that corruption is humanity's enemy number one, is that Bulgaria is on its way off the EU pitch.
As regards Romania, let me quote its newly-elected President, who has said, âI do not hesitate to say that almost every state institution is affected by corruption.â
Romania is not prepared for the European Unionâs standards, and we should act accordingly.
Â Â  â Mr President, during the past months, Bulgaria has made positive steps towards membership in the European Union.
The country is slowly recuperating economically and most probably it will meet the objectives by the date of accession.
An increase in trade with Member States bears witness to this positive factor.
However, one should look at Bulgariaâs judiciary system, a system which still has to make many changes because among many other most crucial factors, there is the fact that it still does not conform to the charter of human rights.
Organised crime is also an important worrying problem which the Bulgarian Authorities must tackle.
For example, the resignation of five high officials within the office against organised crime, makes us ask a lot of questions and the Bulgarian Government should take immediate action before more harm is done.
The proposals for a reform in the national service against organised crime should be revised so that the system will start operating with the least possible number of problems.
It is also disturbing to discover that a criminal gang has, for example, been exporting babies to Europe.
This is because this vile trade is becoming frequent in recent years.
The authorities should therefore continue working to break this vicious circle and it should be assured that the strictest measures are taken so that all those involved in this clandestine trade are caught.
Yes Mr President, fundamental rights are indispensable so that the Bulgarian people live as they deserve after long years of Communist rule.
If Bulgaria does not adhere to these basic principles, I and a number of others in this Chamber will find it difficult to accept Bulgaria as a member of this Union.
Here, there is no need for a transitional period, for we are not talking about economics or politics, we are talking about fundamental human rights.
Thus I hope that the Bulgarian authorities will overcome these obstacles so that they can join the European Union by 2007.
Â Â  â Mr President, I, too, would like to greet the observers, in particular because they are here with us today as a result of the insistence of the Socialist faction that following the signing of the Accession Agreement on 25 April, they should also be allowed to study the work of Parliament, alongside that of the other EU institutions, to facilitate a smooth accession process.
Both the Enlargement Commissioner and my colleagues have already listed the shortcomings found in the two countries, and I am not going to repeat them, as I am certain that the observers will pass them on to their countries.
However, I welcome the fact that following the elections on 25th June the new government of Bulgaria is headed by Socialists, because Socialists have always been pro-enlargement both in the new Member States and in the pre-accession states.
In Bulgaria an agreement has been reached both among governing parties and opposition parties to support a successful implementation of the EU accession.
As the Commissioner has mentioned, legislation has been speeded up in the past two months, and thirty laws have been introduced with a view to accession, regarding matters that had been criticised by the Commission, in areas such as the fight against corruption, judicial system reforms and organised crime.
The introduction of these laws is still not sufficient, as the emphasis should now be on the enforcement of these laws, and I therefore invite both the Bulgarian and the Romanian Government to use the remaining period of time for this purpose.
As a Hungarian, I would like to use this opportunity to say a few words about Romania, as well, as many of those present in this auditorium are aware of the fact that there is a Hungarian minority of a million and a half living in Romania.
Their only possibility of joining the EU is together with Romania, and accession would enable them to live happily with us in a common Europe without borders.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the enlargement and unification of Europe will not of course be complete without our friends Romania and Bulgaria.
They have a natural place in the European community, and we look forward to their becoming Members before long.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are delighted to have our colleagues here in the form of observers.
In that way, we are able to get to know them, and we shall be able to prepare each other for Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs forthcoming membership.
We are impressed by the progress made in both countries but, at the same time, we must of course examine this progress, the implementation of the relevant measures, and any remaining problems.
The Commissioner indicated a number of these problems: areas requiring further measures as a matter of some urgency.
We need to be vigilant in the area of human rights, which is an area to which Parliament in general and the ALDE Group in particular always devote additional attention.
We owe this to the people of the candidate countries, and we owe it to ourselves if we are to be able to defend European values.
Corruption is a big worry, and the Roma â Europeâs largest minority â are marginalised in Romania and Bulgaria just as in many other European countries, with high unemployment, high figures for ill health and large and serious social problems.
Unfortunately, discrimination and racist violence still occur, and too often it is on the part of the authorities.
This is naturally unacceptable.
Another storm cloud mentioned by certain colleagues has to do with children, especially those children cared for in institutions, among them children with mental disabilities.
There are worrying signs that these children are being openly neglected, and that is of course unworthy of a Member State.
I hope that the Commission will increase its efforts to support Romania and Bulgaria in order to help them to cope successfully with these and other problems and to do so â as I still believe and hope it is possible for them to do â within the time frame for accession in 2007.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Rehn for a well-balanced report.
Unfortunately, I do not believe that the debate on enlargement is always balanced.
Those who wish to put the brakes on enlargement talk about the danger of accepting poor countries and about the referenda on the EU Treaty having changed the mood in the EU which, they say, has become chillier.
They say that the referenda were really not about the Treaty itself but about other matters.
That is true, moreover.
They were about other matters because we European political leaders did not show enough political leadership and because we did not manage to explain that it really was the Treaty, and nothing else, that the referenda were really about.
Let us now make sure that we do not make the same mistake.
Let us ensure that the current debate about Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession to the EU really is about that alone and not about anything else.
We must show that we have visions and plans regarding enlargement.
Enlargement is not about aimlessly accepting new Members whenever we want and whenever public opinion in our countries allows us to.
Enlargement is about democracy and freedom in Europe but, above all, about European security, something I am surprised no one mentioned today.
To see Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession to the EU as an isolated phenomenon would be a mistake because many challenges await us over the next few years, such as the debate on Kosovoâs status, the referendum, Montenegroâs independence, continued discussions with Bosnia and Serbia and Macedoniaâs application for membership.
To postpone Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession unless it is absolutely necessary to do so would be a mistake in this very uncertain situation where the politics of security are concerned.
No one, either in this Chamber or in Romania and Bulgaria, believes that we should accept any country unless it fulfils the criteria, but nor should we disqualify any country in advance.
If it is the case that, following the referenda, Europe has become chillier, it is our task to warm it up.
If Europe has become more selfish and closed in on itself, it is our duty to make it more generous and open.
That is what differentiates those who represent public opinion from those who create it.
That is what makes us European political leaders who accept our responsibility.
Â Â  â Mr President, as so many footballing metaphors have been laboured, perhaps I might be allowed to make a few comments on the rules of the game.
This is not a second debate about whether or not Bulgariaâs or Romaniaâs accession should go ahead.
That decision has already been taken and I am glad to see the observers here today.
I would, though, like to make two observations, which are addressed to us ourselves and to the two countries in question.
Let me start with us ourselves: Mr Van Orden has called for tough action aimed at combating corruption and crime.
In some of his press releases he has specifically referred to trafficking in people and drugs.
He also, though, more or less openly stated that deferment of accession beyond the envisaged date of 2007 is absolutely out of the question.
I would remind the House that, if we were to put the two together in the way in which he has, it would be to declare bankrupt the theory that accession to the EU provided an incentive for more domestic reforms.
What incentive for reform is left, after all, when the pressure is taken off, if it is guaranteed that accession is going to go ahead anyway?
So let me make it perfectly clear that the date has not been decided in advance.
That they will join is a given, but the date on which they will do so remains undecided; it is dependent on what is done by the countries in question during the time that remains, and by nobody else.
There can be no input on the part of the European Union, nor can any kind of discount be given.
I get the feeling that not every aspect of the is equally important.
I do believe that the EU publicâs need for security may make the combating of crime and the securing of the external borders more important than the number of cars with insurance cover, although things might well look rather different from the motoristâs point of view.
There are, though, or so I believe, different hierarchies of problems, and that is why every country will be judged separately.
It used to be very comfortable to travel in convoy, with one countryâs weaknesses being compensated for by anotherâs strengths, but those days are no more; from now on, every country will be judged separately.
Â Â  â Mr President, we, the Liberals, support the accession of Romania on 1 January 2007.
This is still possible, even in light of the report presented by the Commissioner.
But serious efforts are required, indeed.
The Romanian Government deserves to be commended for the efforts made in recent months to meet the requirements.
The government has done a lot, but a lot more remains to be done.
The reform of the judicial system is stalling; action against corruption is tentative and unsuccessful.
Neighbouring countries are seriously concerned about the condition of the environment.
The opening of the gold mine at Rosia Montana has raised further worries.
In this respect we expect the implementation of the strictest environmental protection standards.
We find the rejection of the Minority Act by the Romanian Senate yesterday particularly worrying.
We hope we can count on the promise of Prime Minister Tariceanu that the House will accept this Act soon.
In any case, we will hold him to account for this promise.
We hope that members of the Hungarian minority will soon be able to choose to study at mother-tongue universities, we hope that there will be a perceptible change in the situation of the Roma, and we admit that the Romanian Government has made efforts in this respect.
It has done more than its predecessor, but there is still a great deal to be done.
Therefore, Romania has a real chance to join in 2007.
We would like Romania to join in 2007.
We, the Liberals, and I believe all factions of Parliament, will give her all the support in this respect, but most of the work must be done by Romania.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, firstly, to extend a warm welcome to the observers from Bulgaria and Romania.
I should also like to underline the sterling work of Commissioner Rehn and to remind all Members that the method of comprehensive monitoring reports we are adopting is the same approach used for the other 10 States which joined the Union on 1 May 2004.
If we compare the degree of readiness of those 10 countries fourteen months prior to accession, we can see that the level of preparedness of Romania and Bulgaria is not dissimilar; indeed, compared to some of those 10 countries, Romania and Bulgaria are probably more advanced today.
Moreover, Commissioner Rehnâs work has been thorough: he mentioned 140 areas investigated out of 29 chapters of the .
Where has he found real grounds for concern?
In 10% of these areas.
They are important issues, such as food safety, border control and the much-discussed prevention of corruption.
Commissioner Rehn himself spoke of the energetic way in which Bulgaria has managed to recover the time spent on the elections, and Romaniaâs impressive catching-up on issues such as legal reform, competition and, in general, all those sectors in which they were requested to achieve alignment.
It is precisely because of what has just been said that, in my view, we should have confidence in Bulgaria and Romania, which still have fourteen months to go, and we must avoid any preconceptions â of which there is a hint from time to time in comments by some of the speakers â that we should already be making up our minds on the efforts of these two countries, their populations and governments.
I really believe that the words with which Mr Moscovici ended his speech, namely âfriendship, confidence, but also rigourâ must be taken to heart.
Rigour, Commissioner, certainly, but also support for the efforts of the two countries concerned.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by reiterating what we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have been saying for months: we are entirely in favour of Rumania and Bulgariaâs accession to the European Union, and we maintain our commitment and hope that their accession may become a reality in January 2007.
We must state equally clearly that, having been carefully monitoring developments in each of the countries, we are concerned about whether their respective governments still have time to carry out the reforms and fulfil the requirements for their accession on the scheduled date.
It is time to encourage our partners to give new impetus to the said reforms in order to ensure that they are complete by the date in question.
We will not accept imposing any new demands on either of the two candidate countries, nor shall we ask more of either of them than was required of our countries when we entered in our day, but neither will it be acceptable to relax any of the conditions agreed.
Henceforth, Bulgaria and Rumania are two different situations that we must assess separately according to the merits of each.
It is clearly their respective governments, rather than us, who hold the key that will open up the doors of the European Union to their people.
During this final phase of the process, we in Parliament and the Commission want to help rather than to hinder.
Finally, we note a differing tendency between the two countries.
In Bulgaria, the political forces have been able to put together a government of national unity and everybody seems to be joining forces in order to move forward in the best possible way towards Community integration.
On the other hand, it is very worrying to see in Rumania that the government appears to have embarked on an operation to harass the opposition, with a change of rules that interferes with the democratic workings of the institutions.
Without evaluating the situation any further, we shall merely state that we believe that arguments amongst the countryâs main political forces does not appear to be the best way to make progress on the consensus for reforms and for the negotiations with the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania have formally closed the accession negotiations, but before they become Member States with full rights, they must eliminate the deficiencies pointed out in the last European Parliament resolution and the new European Commission report.
The situation of Romania is more complex.
The young government of the country is making serious efforts to eliminate the deficiencies and deserves to be commended for this.
But they still have a great number of problems to tackle, in areas like the judicial system and internal affairs, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and environmental protection.
Another crucial issue is that of the gold mine at Rosia Montana, although Foreign Minister Ungureanu had promised back in spring that he would solve this issue within six months.
Another heavy burden is the Roma issue.
The new government endeavours to develop an effective system, but there are still many irregularities to be eliminated, things that are completely unacceptable to the EU.
When Bulgaria and Romania join the EU, the number of Roma people in the EU will rise by approximately half, and this means that a long term strategy must be developed.
The situation of ethnic minorities has improved considerably in the past decade, but it is still far from being satisfactory.
For instance, why is the acceptance of the Minority Act such a huge problem?
The rejection of the draft law by the Senate yesterday is a very serious negative development.
I would just like to warn Romanian politicians to avoid making statements to the effect that Romania already extensively guarantees all the rights of ethnic minorities.
Romania is still a long way from this.
It is true that the largest ethnic minority community, that of the one and a half million Hungarians, has seen considerable development.
Hungarians are present in the government and in public administration, and can therefore have their say in the internal and foreign policy of the country.
As the representative of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, I would definitely like to see the Hungarian community in Romania join the EU as soon as possible, to live as Eurocitizens and enjoy the opportunities offered by the Union.
It is the task of the European Parliament to inspect all of this consistently, but at the same time it must also provide maximum assistance.
I trust that the safeguard clause included in our resolution will not have to be applied.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, I should like to start my speech today by warmly welcoming the observers from Bulgaria and Romania to the European Parliament.
On the whole, these two countries meet the political and economic criteria for membership of the European Union, and they have both made enormous progress towards democracy and a market economy over the past 16Â years.
In order to gain a full picture of this progress, we should remember their point of departure in 1989.
Over recent years, we have seen a consolidation of democracy and a move from an electoral to a liberal democracy.
As members of the European Union, Bulgaria and Romania will bring greater security to the European continent.
In particular, they will help stabilise the political situation in the Balkans.
Being in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union does not mean turning a blind eye to the problems that both countries must resolve before they join the EU, however.
At present, these problems mainly relate to the implementation of the EU , judicial and administrative reforms and the fight against corruption.
The Bulgarian and Romanian Governments must accelerate reforms in these fields and take effective measures to promote good governance in order to ensure that accession can take place on 1Â January 2007.
The constitutional crisis faced by the EU Member States must not spread to those countries outside the EU that are on their way to becoming members.
No country has ever been entirely ready for membership, and the EU cannot make demands of Bulgaria and Romania that it did not make of the 10Â Central and Eastern European countries two years ago.
The Romanian and Bulgarian Governments must now step up their efforts to tackle the problems they currently face.
The citizens of the two countries must be made aware of the need for reform, and public opinion in the EU itself must be in favour of further enlargement.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am not a football fan so I am probably not good at football rules, but I take it as my personal political duty, as a Member of the European Parliament from the Czech Republic, to add some comments on the subject of Bulgaria and Romania.
First, regarding the findings on political criteria, in my opinion the report should give necessary public administration reform, prosecution of high-level corruption and the fight against trafficking in human beings a lower profile.
All the members of the public in this Chamber observing the debate must believe that Bulgaria and Romania are countries totally based on corruption, which is obviously not true.
In my opinion we should do something about our European public administration reform and almost legendary EU red tape.
I recommend that the high-level corruption wording, as used in the report, be only used in a very careful and limited way.
The part of the report concerning economic criteria is exceptionally sensitive.
When we compare economic performance in the eurozone and the economic performance of Bulgaria and Romania, we can only envy their courage in undergoing deep economic reforms with stunning results.
However, what is worth mentioning in the reform is the labour market.
Unfortunately that is not so much a debate about Romania and Bulgaria as a profound debate about the unwillingness of the western European labour markets to open up to the free movement of labour from Eastern and Central Europe.
In my opinion, that is a message for the citizens here in the visitorsâ gallery: the European Union does not have the keys to Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, the valuable report submitted by the Commission gives an objective and realistic picture of the situation in the two countries.
It is a fact that Bulgaria and Romania have made significant efforts, since the last Commission report, towards the integration and full application of the .
It is a fact that no one can contest and no one can disparage.
However, it is also a fact that serious shortcomings are noted in the Commission report.
Amnesty International has already pointed out certain problems with the protection of human rights, just as the Commission report has pointed out serious shortcomings in combating corruption, in reorganising the public administration, in modernising the judicial system, in combating piracy and infringements of industrial property rules, in integrating the , in farming as regards plant health protection and the protection of animal health, in controlling the external borders, in state aid in the steel industry, in the environment and in nuclear safety.
These are important shortcomings which not only affect the progress of the two countries towards their accession, but also affect neighbouring countries and the Member States of the European Union.
Issues such as the protection of the health of animals, plant health protection, the environment, nuclear safety, state aid and tax, insurance and labour dumping also cause serious economic and social problems in the Member States of the European Union.
I believe that it is in the interests of the European Union and the peoples of the two countries to remain firm in defending the strategy of enlargement and to make every possible effort to complete the procedure of the timely integration of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union.
The Balkans face serious developments and the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will contribute to peace and to the strengthening of stability and security.
However, the message must be clear.
The accession procedure will proceed without discounts, but also without new terms and with the constant objective of the full integration and application of European principles and the .
To close, I should like to point out that what is urgently required is the contribution of the European Commission to the full appropriation of preaccession financing aid for Bulgaria and Romania in the direction of the full application of the .
It is the responsibility of the Council to adopt the proposals of the European Parliament on the 2006 budget.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his extensive introduction, which gives a balanced picture of the progress that has been made in a number of areas since we last considered them, yet also of the various problems that remain.
In my speech, I should briefly like to focus on Romania.
There is no doubt that the Basescu government means well and tries to work hard on further reforms, so credit where credit is due.
Even so, there are still a number of recurrent problems. First of all, there is the continuing corruption.
Since honesty by decree is impossible, the government will need to do more than spell out its opposition to corruption time and again.
If further confidence is to be gained, it will, in particular, have to tackle the people in the higher echelons of the civil service and prosecute former politicians who have been corrupt.
Needless to say, the judiciary has its own role to play in this, but the government should make every effort to show the first emphatic signs of change as a matter of urgency.
Then there is border control, the fight against cross-border crime, not to mention people smuggling.
Progress will definitely need to be made on that score too, also given the fact that Romania will soon have one of the most extensive external borders, if not most extensive, both in terms of land and sea.
The third point has to do with food safety and genetic modification, and my Dutch fellow Member, Mr Lagendijk, has discussed it in detail.
The fourth point may seem less significant on the surface, namely the position in hospitals of people suffering from mental illness and the situation in orphanages.
There is certainly a need for more progress to be made in those areas too.
Both in his speech and in his documents, the Commissioner has spoken in no uncertain terms.
There are still major problems with 10% of the .
We will need to see improvements if we are to commence proceedings on the planned date.
Both now in the autumn, but certainly also in April, we will need to join with the Commissioner in examining whether it will be necessary to defer accession.
We hope that it will not be, but if we have to defer, then so be it.
We should also check whether, after a possible accession, certain chapters should be put on hold if the level of implementation is inadequate; the Council will need to look into this in detail and it is unfortunate that the Council is not present here.
On a final note, I should like to say to Romania that we are strict where the criteria are concerned.
We are not against Romania; it is not a yellow card, but rather a push for further reforms, a push for more freedom for the Romanian people and guaranteeing our values as Europe, to which we must very definitely hold fast during each enlargement round if we want to keep our credibility intact.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I too should like to start by welcoming the observers from Romania and Bulgaria to the European Parliament.
The Czech Social Democrat Party, on behalf of which I am speaking, has always backed the accession of these two countries to the European Union, and one need look no further than the votes held in this House for proof of this.
I believe that my party will continue to back the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union in 2007. The reason for this is that we believe this accession to be the next step in a historical process, namely the gradual enlargement of an area of peace, prosperity and stability to cover the eastern parts of the European continent.
I believe the Commission report that we are debating here today to be extremely well-balanced, and I should like to thank the Commission for having drafted it.
It gives details of the progress that both countries have made in the fields of human rights, civil liberties and the political system, without of course forgetting the unquestionable progress they have made in economic terms.
At the same time, however, it also highlights the problems that are still faced by both Romania and Bulgaria.
Previous speakers have already mentioned many of these problems, which include corruption, food safety and other agricultural issues, border protection and public administration.
The latter problem obviously also involves the capacity of these countries to absorb EU funds, to administer such funds in a democratic and transparent manner and to monitor their expenditure.
Further problems include the protection of minorities, for example the Roma minority, which has been the subject of much debate.
I am quite sure that it is still feasible for both Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU in January 2007, but there is one point I should like to stress, and I hope that the observers will take my recommendation, which is based on my experience of the Czech Republicâs accession to the EU, back with them to their own countries.
I believe that if the two countries are to succeed in joining the EU, cooperation must be established there between all European political parties, irrespective of whether they form part of ruling coalitions or are in opposition, and of whether they represent social democratic, liberal or conservative views.
If such cooperation can be achieved and efforts are made in this direction, then I am sure that in sixÂ monthsâ time, when this House holds a debate on the final report, we will come to the conclusion that it will be possible for the two countries to join in JanuaryÂ 2007.
Â Â  â Mr President, the speakers before me talked about what Romania and Bulgaria had promised prior to the closure of the accession negotiations, and what they have actually delivered on their promises.
I would like to talk about a different matter: the fate of the EU directives prepared in the period between the closure of accession negotiations and the actual accession.
The Mining Waste Directive is currently in the reconciliation phase.
This is the directive initiated by the Commission following the mine disaster involving cyanide in Romania in 2000.
The disaster resulted in serious drinking water contamination and environmental pollution in Romania, the Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary.
We prepared this directive to avoid the possibility of a similar disaster in the future. The directive is expected to be issued in December.
Commissioner, is it possible that the Commission and the Council may give Romania any concessions in respect of compliance with this directive?
What guarantees can they give that this will not happen?
Why do I ask this question?
Because in spite of the fact that the Romanian mine disaster took place five and a half years ago, to this date none of the damage claims have been settled by the courts.
The negotiation is stalling, as well, but the company that had caused the damage continues to operate undisturbed in Romania.
Neither the injured parties, nor nature have received any damage compensation, in Hungary or in the other countries affected.
One of the reasons why I support the EU membership of Romania is because membership would ensure that Romania is bound by EU regulations, and we would be able to enforce their implementation.
Environmental protection, prevention of damage or the settlement of any damages caused is a basic right and obligation in civilised European countries.
This is not happening in Romania yet.
Whether it will happen or not, it depends on the Council and the Commission.
This is why I ask the Commission and the Council: can they guarantee not to allow Romania and Bulgaria to evade the effect of the new Mining Directive, even temporarily?
Â Â  â Mr President, the quantitative accession criteria are simple and measurable.
However, it is difficult to measure the qualitative criteria, the criteria at the core of the politicisation of the enlargement exercise.
This is the fault of Europe, for failing to clarify the qualitative criteria in an objective, reliable and functional manner, for failing to lay down the political geography, its political limits, and for failing to define the dialectic ratio between deepening and enlarging.
If these major questions had been answered, we would not have the dilemma of Turkey, there would not be the uncertainty of the prospects of the Western Balkans and there would not be the speculation about Bulgaria and Romania.
The crucial time for evaluating the readiness for accession of the two countries was when the accession acts were signed.
Since then, the special transitional time for political, institutional and administrative adjustment has been correctly granted and extended.
The remarks in the report about the state of accession readiness of the two countries presented today by the Commission are also correct.
In all events, we must not overlook the fact that the rate of acceptance of the in Bulgaria and Romania has been stepped up.
Under no circumstances must it be the Union that disappoints the citizens of the two countries.
The principle of there being no automatic link between candidacy and accession, to which I subscribe, cannot be a belated claim, an claim.
Bulgaria, Romania and the Union of the 25 must up the ante, step up efforts and demonstrate a convergent and creative political will to make the Europe of the 27 a reality on 1 January 2007.
If nothing else, the geopolitical and geo-economic restoration of the historical unity of Europe so dictates.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our rejoicing at the positive steps that Romania and Bulgaria have taken on the road towards the European Union make us all the more entitled to talk about the things that cannot be seen in a positive light and deserve some measure of criticism.
According to the Commission, the political criteria have been met; I do not believe that they have been in every respect.
The law on minorities, to which reference is made in the Commissionâs report, was yesterday voted down in the Senate, as Mr Duka-ZÃ³lyomi has already said.
These rules in relation to minorities were, in practical terms, absolute minimum requirements, and even they were rejected.
I regard that as shameful and as a flagrant about-turn on the road towards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
I have to tell Commissioner Rehn that, although I take a very favourable view of the large amount of space devoted to the Roma in the report, I do believe that the one and a half million Hungarians in Romania would have merited at least as much attention in it, and that it would have been better if their situation had been considered in rather more detail.
Although the report discusses higher education, it fails, for example, to mention the fact that higher education is privately funded from abroad, and that the Romanian state therefore makes no money available for it, or that its failure to pay anything towards higher education in Hungarian constitutes a failure to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, and one that has as a consequence the fact that, of the 6.6% of the Romanian population who constitute the Hungarian minority, only 1.6% have completed college education.
What this means is that the education system is keeping an ethnic group, and one comprising more people than some Member States of the European Union, at the bottom of the pile.
Let me conclude by saying that this House, in the Moscovici report, called for better protection for minorities.
We therefore need, âwhile maintaining the principles of subsidiarity and self-government, to ensure the protection of the Hungarian minorityâ.
The Romanian Parliament and Government have, so far, voted to reject the initiatives the Commission has taken to this effect; here, too, action is needed, and I ask Commissioner Rehn to use what influence he has to this end.
Â Â  â Mr President, we Greek MEPs in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats vigorously support the prospects of accession to the European Union of both Romania and Bulgaria, because we believe, among other things, that it will result in the strengthening of stability and security in southeast Europe.
The Commission report refers to the progress made in both these countries; and a great deal of progress has been made.
At the same time, however, it notes that delays have emerged in certain sectors.
The battle against corruption, the reorganisation of the judicial system and guarding the borders are some of the problems which need to be resolved more quickly.
Particular attention also needs to be given to respect for human rights and minority rights, while the situation in the orphanages and psychiatric hospitals in Romania is far from satisfactory.
We are closely monitoring the reports by the competent bodies and hope that the necessary legislative reforms will be made more quickly.
We also hope that Bulgaria will keep the promises it has made, especially about the nuclear power station in Kozloduy.
However, I consider that the application of legislation â its practical application on a daily basis â is more important than its reform.
The Commission needs to monitor this matter closely.
I trust that these weaknesses will be rectified over the next 14 months, so that we can welcome these two countries as new members of the European Union on 1 January 2007 with open arms.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the Commission for its report.
This is a very important day for Romania and Bulgaria, and I welcome the observers here today.
It must be difficult for them, because here we are pointing out some of their faults. However, we do it not in a mean-spirited way but to offer them some help to improve the situation.
I would accept the premise of the report that progress has been made by both countries but that more is required.
I want to talk about Romania in particular and, even though others have dealt with the subject, specifically about the situation for young children, babies and adults with handicaps in institutional care.
As Baroness Nicholson pointed out, while very good progress has been made on childrenâs rights â indeed, it is a model â it is disturbing that there are difficulties in practical terms.
For example, many babies are abandoned in maternity hospitals; they cannot be put into institutions so they languish in maternity hospitals for months and, indeed, years.
Recently, I met a toddler of 18Â months in a maternity hospital.
We need emergency fostering situations in those cases.
In relation to young people with handicaps, there are examples of pilot projects working to close down institutions and to put up sheltered accommodation, but the implementation is erratic.
There are huge difficulties in some counties: for example, only yesterday, some of the staff in Giurgiu County had not been paid.
If these people are not paid, who will feed those who cannot feed themselves?
That is something we need to address.
In relation to agriculture, there are huge difficulties for both countries: they need investment and modernisation, and we must assist them with that.
The uncertainties over the financial perspective are a worry.
I would urge Mr Blair, the President-in-Office of the Council, to come to us soon with a resolution to that.
Overall, I am not obsessed with dates, but I am obsessed with delivery.
What I am trying to do today is to highlight for those who do not have a voice that their issues are heard here in the European Parliament and that we will watch to ensure that we deliver for them.
Â Â  â Mr President, this House is discussing many issues, but without paying sufficient attention to the big issue, which is the European Union itself.
What is in the interests of the European Union and its citizens?
Firstly, that the process of Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession, which we wholeheartedly welcome, should actually be completed successfully.
What I object to about it is the obsession with different accession dates.
It is of course in our interest that Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia should become Member States of the European Union before the end of the life of this Parliament, that is to say before the 2009 European elections, but whether it is to happen half a year earlier or later strikes me as less important than the actual implementation of that which constitutes the .
Mr HorÃ¡Äek is perfectly right to point out that what counts here is not what is in black and white, but what happens in reality.
Over the coming months, the Commission, Parliament and the Council will be obliged to join with our Romanian and Bulgarian friends in observing how things actually develop in those countries, and passing judgment after they have done so, and not on the basis of this or that sentiment or resentment.
The second important issue has to do with the Copenhagen criteria, which were devised expressly for the last round of enlargement and are supplementary to the .
We must not allow them to be softened up, for if they are, they will have a detrimental and dangerous effect on future enlargements.
My third and final point is that, although we should, of course, recognise the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia as an important step, we should, once the deed is done, stop conferring candidate country status willy-nilly. Over the coming years, although we should, of course, hold out the prospect of eventual accession, no more countries should be recognised as candidates for it.
South-Eastern Europe must have the prospect of membership, but the first thing we have to do for the moment is to consolidate the EU.
Nobody, after all, stands to gain anything from joining a union at the same time as it is dissolving itself to the point of evaporation.
What is needed, then, is the definite consolidation of this EU of ours, and Romania and Bulgaria will, without doubt, make their contribution to it.
They are European countries, but they can make that contribution only on the basis of facts and of law.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this excellent, high-quality debate, well worthy of this issue.
I appreciate the responsible way in which Parliament is handling enlargement policy, and I would like to continue the close, concrete and very viable partnership we have.
Unfortunately, I cannot answer all the numerous questions that have been put in connection with this matter.
I hope that we will be able to continue the dialogue in the Committee, and bilaterally in the form of urgent questions and oral debate.
I will concentrate for now on two or three of the most important questions which have come up in this discussion.
There has been an emphasis in several of the speeches on how important it is for the legal system to function properly, and in fact the practical implementation of the legal system, which is to say the reform of the prosecution and court systems and specifically the effective adoption of these reforms, is absolutely essential for the preparations for accession.
This is directly linked to the fight against corruption and organised crime.
These reforms must therefore take absolute priority, be the first priority, not least because the influence they have will extend to all areas of life and society, whether it is a matter of access to health services or the corporate business environment.
I would like generally to stress the importance of implementation with regard to legal systems as well as other areas.
The time for devising strategies and drafting action programmes is over.
They are in quite good shape.
Now we need practical results: it is time for actions rather than words.
The most challenging questions in the area of Community policy are agriculture and the treatment of animal diseases.
Both countries need to achieve standards that guarantee food safety throughout the EU.
Inspections at external borders also need to be improved.
On the other hand, there are also examples of good practice in this area: the reaction of the authorities to avian flu in both Romania and Bulgaria was positive. It was swift, efficient and professional, and was therefore encouraging for the future.
Some Members asked about genetically modified organisms.
I am fully aware that genetically modified soya is grown in Romania.
On the other hand, we have to consider that EU legislation will be applied in this area from the time of accession.
As this soya production is not strictly on European Union soil at present, it is not a matter of contravention of EU law.
If, at the point when Romania joins the Union, the EU has not permitted the production of genetically modified soya, Romania will simply have to obey EU legislation and destroy the soya crop.
The Commission will be following this closely, and I can assure you that the situation will be under control.
The monitoring mechanism that we adopted in its improved form a year ago is yielding results.
A good example is the reform of the legal system referred to and competition and state subsidy policy in Romania.
These have moved from the category of serious matters of concern to one where work with a clear objective is still needed.
The Commission will continue its close monitoring of Bulgarian and Romanian preparations.
Before the report is drafted in April or May, the Commission will undertake tours of inspection with experts from the Member States to assess the most worrying areas of dissatisfaction.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the best service we could do Bulgaria and Romania and the citizens of these countries is to keep to the terms of accession.
Accordingly, these reports will point out not only the progress that has been achieved but, first and foremost, the flaws that are still apparent, thus ensuring that these countries and their governments receive support for their reform policies.
Conditionality policy therefore acts as a force to change society, and that lies at the heart of enlargement policy.
Comparisons to football have been made in this Chamber.
MrÂ Lagendijk started this and, as he thinks of himself as the incarnation of Johan Cruyff, no doubt for very good reason, I could probably say finally that, instead of a -type hedgehog defence for Bulgaria and Romania, it is now worth putting some effort into an aggressive, all-embracing soccer match in the reform policies of both countries.
Now is not the time for passivity, but for activity and determination.
Â Â  The debate on this item is closed.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0332/2005).
We shall be taking a series of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, the regulation cited by MrsÂ McAvan in fact lays down common rules for compensating and assisting passengers in the event that they are denied boarding, their flight is cancelled or they face a long delay.
Since the regulation entered into force on 17 February 2005, the Commission has been watching closely to ensure that it is being enforced by the Member States and has been monitoring the airlines to check that they are enforcing it.
In order to ensure that the regulation is being enforced uniformly in all parts of Europe, the European Commission has started infringement procedures against several Member States that have not yet taken the necessary steps to set the penalties to be imposed on airlines if they do not comply with the legislation in force.
Furthermore, on the basis of the complaints that it regularly receives, the Commission has noticed certain practical difficulties in effectively implementing the regulation and in monitoring its enforcement by the Member States.
This is particularly the case as regards the obligation placed on the national bodies to take the necessary steps to safeguard passengersâ rights and to investigate the complaints lodged.
In this context, the Commission is currently working with the national authorities in order to arrive at a harmonised interpretation of the role that these bodies have to fulfil in terms of monitoring, and dealing with, complaints.
Â Â  â Commissioner, surely the problem with this legislation lies in the fact that it depends to a large extent on the information given to passengers, and the problem arises when there is nobody to give passengers any information.
In June, a constituent of mine, Mrs Underwood, was stranded overnight in Alicante with her family, which included a ten-month-old baby; there was nobody there from the airline to give any information.
In fact, they rang the airport of destination themselves, which was also unable to give her any information.
The family had already checked in; they could not get their luggage back; there was no provision for babies nor any baby food.
They eventually left at 4 a.m., although they were supposed to have left at 7Â p.m. on the previous day.
She wrote to the airline but was given no compensation; the national body also said that the airline had acted properly.
We have a piece of legislation here.
I am pleased you are going to review the role of these national bodies because, at the moment, I am not convinced that this legislation is practical and workable for citizens.
Â Â  . MrsÂ McAvan, I have listened carefully to the example you have just given.
The national bodies are there to intervene in the event of the airlines shirking their obligations.
I have said to you, and I will repeat what I said: we did not adopt this regulation for it not to be enforced.
Consequently, we are going to look carefully with the national authorities at the practical conditions in which these complaints are dealt with.
As your example has clearly demonstrated, the national authorities have to fulfil the provisions laid down in the regulation precisely to avoid the need to resort to legal action to deal with airlinesâ conduct.
The spirit underlying the resolution was a desire to avoid having constantly to resort to the law.
Thank you, MrsÂ McAvan, for having pointed out to us this one example, among others.
It strengthens my determination to see this regulation enforced.
Â Â  â I welcome the Commissioner's reply.
Some airlines seem to be doing everything they can to avoid their obligations.
I, too, have had letters from constituents, one where the airline in a case of lost luggage said of course they would refund the items in the luggage, provided the customer could provide the original receipts.
As if we all keep receipts for everything we buy!
Another airline refused compensation for a flight cancelled because of the weather, even though a rival airline was able to fly ten minutes later on the same day, from the same airport and to the same destination.
There are numerous examples.
Please be vigorous in chasing them up.
Â Â  . I can confirm to you that the Commission has started an infringement procedure against a number of Member States.
I note 12 Member States against which we have started an infringement procedure.
Of course, I personally want this extra-judicial protection, which is included in the regulation and which offers Europeans a transparent and flexible solution, genuinely to be enforced.
A meeting between the Commission and the national bodies will take place â we hope â before the end of the year.
Our services already reply to some 500 letters a month.
This proves that there is still work to be done, but I assure you, MrÂ Corbett, that I personally am paying a great deal of attention to this matter.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are airlines that make it a point of principle to set out to be taken to court.
If you try any other approach, your complaints end up in the wastepaper basket.
What would appear to be urgently necessary is the introduction of a sort of third-party certification, so that the refusal to pay out on the grounds of or for some other reason would have to be confirmed by a third-party organisation.
Â Â  . I will repeat what I said, MrÂ RÃŒbig: in each Member State, there has to be a body that is responsible for investigating complaints and, if need be, it has to impose penalties on airlines infringing this regulation.
This needs to become a regular practice.
Furthermore, I believe that, insofar as these complaints are handled well, the way in which they are handled will also have a deterrent effect.
By that, I mean that airlines will increasingly be encouraged to comply with the regulation and to pay compensation, if need be, because they will know that, if they do not do this, there will be an appeal and, undoubtedly, a penalty.
Everything comes down to enforcing this regulation.
MadamÂ President, I believe that that was the last question. I therefore thank Parliament for having seen fit to emphasise this point in order to make it understood that we are doing everything possible to ensure this regulation is enforced effectively.
Â Â  . The Commission believes that the degree of concentration in the energy market of many Member States is considerable.
At the same time, energy markets have seen some new entrants in many Member States, either in the form of start-ups or through companies established in other Member States setting up subsidiaries.
Therefore, consumer choice has increased in many parts of the Community.
A high degree of concentration may negatively affect the level of competition in these markets.
The price level of energy may be one indicator for this; however, it has to be borne in mind that the price of energy is also influenced by many other factors: oil, gas and coal import prices, prices of CO2 emission allowances on the carbon market, additional expenditure for the support of renewable energies, and increasing internalisation of the external cost of energy.
That is why the Commission is monitoring the competitive dynamics of the markets at issue very carefully and why it recently launched an inquiry concerning the European energy sector.
We await the findings of this inquiry.
As far as energy mergers are concerned, their possible impact on the level of competition has to be evaluated on the merits of each case.
The Commission is strongly committed to carrying out this assessment with great attention in order to protect European consumers against the risk of reduced competition and unjustified price increases.
The Commission would like to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that it is currently carrying out phaseÂ II in-depth investigations into the E.ON/MOL merger in Hungary and the DONG/E2 merger in Denmark.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I should like to thank you, first and foremost, for reiterating those principles, which are key principles.
The fact is that the Commissionâs legal inquiry into the Gas Natural/Endesa merger could â although I do not think it will â find that that this merger does not have a Community dimension and that it would in turn have to be assessed by a national competition authority, under the auspices of the government concerned.
Against this backdrop, and in light of the Commissionâs decision of 9Â December to block the EDP/ENI/GDP merger, I wish to ask the Commission how it can stop a merger that has cross-border repercussions and considerable implications for competition at a time when the prevailing desire is for an integrated Iberian energy market and a more complete internal market in Europeâs energy sector.
Â Â  . I can be brief, because the decision has not yet been taken.
As soon as the decision is taken, Parliament will be informed and those closely involved with the whole dossier will of course be informed first.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is evident that, on the European Power Exchange, European electricity customers are currently being charged for the most expensive form of electricity generation, that being lignite-fired gas turbines with the highest proportion of their costs accounted for by CO2.
Do you have any plans to carry out an investigation into the European Power Exchange on the basis of competition law in order to prevent this concentration?
Â Â  . That is an interesting question.
I can assure you that we are aware of the importance of that aspect.
It is one part of the inquiry into the energy sector.
We are looking forward to the results and you will certainly be informed of the outcome.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would like to return to the issue raised by Mr Pinheiro, the Gas Natural-Endesa takeover bid.
This takeover bid has raised serious doubts in Spain in terms of its effect on competition and on its compatibility with the Treaties.
My question is very simple: what are the regulatory time limits for notifying an operation of this nature?
Has any government or any competition body of any Member State asked the Commission to intervene so far?
If so, when did it do so?
Â Â  . I repeat that I am trying to give a clear indication of the state of play to the honourable Members.
The decision has not yet been taken.
At this point, Gas Natural is of the opinion that it should be dealt with by the national competition authority in Spain.
That depends not only on figures and on turnover but also on a number of other technical aspects, and at this stage I am unable to give you information about the final decision.
As soon as that information is available, I promise that you will be informed.
Â Â  Mr Masip Hidalgo, which point of order do you wish to raise now?
Â Â  â Madam President, I simply want to ask the Commissioner about this same issue again.
Â Â  That, unfortunately, is not possible.
The rules specify that there is always one questioner and that two other Members can put supplementary questions.
You are the third, and I cannot permit that.
Perhaps you can sort this matter out later in a discussion with the Commissioner.
Â Â  . I should like to emphasise again what the situation is today.
There is no doubt that this is a very important matter.
We all agree.
Within the energy market, we have a great responsibility as a Commission for looking at competition, prices and the possibilities of a guarantee not only for today, but also for the future.
Having taken that into account, we have to take our responsibilities and decide who has to deal with this.
That is the situation today.
We have not yet been able to draw the final conclusion as to whether it is a matter for the national competition authority or the Commission in Brussels.
As soon as that has been decided, you will be informed.
Â Â  . I have taken over from my good friend, Commissioner Piebalgs.
As you are aware, he is unable to be here today because he has to sign a very important agreement.
The Commission is very concerned about the sharp escalation in oil prices over the last two years.
While the impact on our economy of this increase in oil prices is currently less severe than in the 1970s, it is nonetheless having serious repercussions, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens and oil-intensive sectors.
The Commission is actively responding to the challenge of high and volatile oil prices and is following a five-point plan in this respect.
The main elements are: to manage our demand for energy by measures to increase energy efficiency and energy savings; to increase the use of alternative forms of energy; to improve the transparency and predictability of oil markets; to increase the supply of oil and gas by promoting an increase of investment in production and refining capacities and, finally, effectively to manage energy disruption.
In addition, the Commission is actively increasing cooperation with the European Unionâs main external oil suppliers through initiatives such as the European Union-Russia Energy Dialogue and the European Union- Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) dialogue.
The Commission is also planning a proposal to implement an EU-coordinated system for security oil stocks.
The Commission does not have the competence to regulate the price of crude oil or petroleum products, particularly given that the oil market is a global one.
Nevertheless, the Commission intends to continue to work in close collaboration with all the parties concerned to increase the level of transparency in the market in order to reduce speculation.
Â Â  â Madam President, for the first half of 2005, the 70 biggest oil companies expect to make profits this year of USD 230 billion.
In the face of this profit frenzy, the European Commission and the governments, anticipating the wave of anger from the workers about the unaccountable action of the multinational oil companies, issue warnings from time to time to the companies, which continue to reap huge profits.
Basically, and with your reply today, it must be concluded that this is a question of collusion on the part of the European Commission, the governments in the Member States and the companies at the workers' expense.
The governments make use of oil to increase taxes, given that every consumer, out of one euro paid for petrol, pays 70 cents in taxes, while at the same time the companies' profits are increasing.
What specific measures does the Commission intend to take in the run-up to winter?
Â Â  . The question is quite clear: what can be done to stimulate and increase investment in alternative sources of energy or for other purposes?
In this respect, it is worth mentioning that some have voiced their perplexity at not seeing the authorities take measures to capture part of the oil companiesâ windfall profits resulting from the latest oil price increases.
Oil companies should behave in a responsible manner and ensure that a significant share of their profits are reinvested in increasing the capacity of the sector to cope with the growing demand, thereby laying the foundations for more reasonable prices in the future â and, by the way, creating business for themselves.
That is, investing both in the production of crude oil and in the refining business.
Indeed, oil and energy companies should be strongly encouraged to develop new energy sources with a view to dealing with the future scarcity of oil.
The Commission has continued to make efforts through its contacts with the industry to increase the awareness of oil companies of the appropriateness of reinvesting part of their profits in activities that allow for more sustainable economic growth, such as the development of alternative energies and energy efficiency.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Commissionerâs work is very important and we in this Parliament would therefore like to know whether it relies on results audited and registered in companies or on creative accounting and also whether it listens to experts in its department or whether it is going to make up new theories.
Â Â  . The question is a very interesting one.
The Commission is aware of the great responsibility in the energy sector.
I can assure you that we in the Commission, in particular Commissioner Piebalgs and myself, are aware of our great responsibility where competition policy is concerned.
Â Â  . Madam President, the honourable lady Member has submitted a series of questions.
The first question is the extent to which there is a binding obligation for the Member States to collect waste by category.
The directive on hazardous waste bans the mixing of different categories of hazardous waste and the mixing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
Other legislative acts of the European Union relating to specific waste flows supplement this obligation regarding the separate collection of waste.
In addition, the Member States can take additional measures in accordance with their national policies.
The second question is the extent to which the Commission considers that the practice, especially as regards collection, destruction and so on, is or is not successful.
The Commission believes that more correct application of legislation is required without fail; we have major problems in the application of the legislation and it has undertaken to improve its application.
Consequently, the policy on waste constitutes a priority sector of environmental legislation and, of course, there are directives for various waste flows, such as the directive on lubricants, the directive on batteries, which is being debated, the directive on electrical and electronic waste, the directive on end-of-life vehicles and so on, which lay down specific separation and collection and destruction methods.
The lady Member also asked a very important question about heightening awareness; in other words, the extent to which heightening awareness and publicity help to deal with the problem.
Of course they help, because publicity and maximum awareness-raising among citizens are important elements in finding optimum waste management solutions.
I should also like to say that the 'polluter pays' principle must be applied as a preventive measure in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
In addition, it is the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to comply with Community legislation in the waste sector.
Then there was a question about funding.
The European Union funds the combating of waste; this is, in fact, one of the priorities of the Cohesion Fund.
This funding may be provided through the European Regional Development Fund and through the Cohesion Fund and of course it concerns the disadvantaged areas and less wealthy countries of the European Union, which are entitled to the corresponding funds in order to apply the in the environmental sector.
This aid is expected to total approximately EUR 2 billion in the period from 2000 to 2006.
There are, of course, various other sources of finance, such as LIFE, and a new LIFE+ is in the pipeline for various actions, such as raising citizens' awareness about environmental issues, especially waste.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, my interest in the matter reflects the concerns of civil society.
Is it possible to estimate over time, in parallel to the ecological consequences, the economic and social consequences of failing to comply with the relevant Community legislation and to find a more effective compliance procedure than that of referring the Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Communities?
Â Â  . The question is that we need other methods on the basis of which we can combat the huge problem of waste without taking recourse to the Court.
To be honest, my greatest pleasure will be not to go to the Court and not to have procedures of this sort, but through cooperation, through awareness-raising among citizens, through better understanding and exchanges of experience by the various countries, through the application of modern technology, for us to be able to find solutions and answers to the problems which concern the various countries in the waste sector.
Of course, I must tell you that, within the framework of the thematic strategies which the Commission is presenting at the moment, in a few days â if I remember correctly during November â we shall also present the thematic strategy on preventing, limiting and recycling waste.
This is a particularly important strategy which is horizontal and holistic, which deals with the problem of waste as a whole and, of course, will provide answers to many of the problems which exist and which, due to disputes, often lead to the courts.
I hope that, in this way, waste in the European Union will, firstly, be limited.
This is the main objective; in other words, for us to produce less waste and, secondly, will be recovered and recycled and, only if these possibilities do not exist, will it either end up in incinerators, preferably with energy recovery, or in sanitary landfills, about which I should like to say, because this interests Greece in particular, that we hardly even know how many there are, while in numerous cases they even constitute a source of contamination and reduce the quality of life of citizens and, at the same time, create problems both for biodiversity and for climate change because they release methane, which is one of the gases that helps to create the greenhouse effect.
Â Â  â An example of where the Commission might assist Member States is with the introduction of the WEEE Directive in Ireland, which this year caused utter confusion and consternation because people really did not know what was happening.
Maybe you could answer this question.
Many people saw this as an additional cost to the consumer, yet we are being told by the government that it was not an extra charge.
Can you clarify if this visible recycling charge which is now itemised on all our electrical goods is indeed additional and perhaps why consumers are being asked to pay VAT on top of it?
Â Â  . The problem concerns not only Ireland, but other countries of the European Union too.
This is a very important directive that aims at collecting in the best possible way the waste from electrical and electronic equipment, either for partial re-use, recycling or safe disposal.
Because problems exist, we are preparing guidelines that will soon be available.
Â Â  â Would the Commissioner agree that one of the best ways to manage waste is not to create it?
Is he aware, for example, in Ireland again, that a 5Â pence â as it was then â charge on plastic bags in supermarkets in particular simply resulted in people not taking plastic bags away from supermarkets and going back home to bringing bags to supermarkets to collect goods?
This had a huge impact on waste management in Ireland.
There may well be other practices in other Member States from which we could learn.
Would the Commissioner see it as his role to benchmark for Member States best practice in other Member States so that we could use that as a resource?
Â Â  . I agree that it is best to prevent the creation of waste, and plastic bags create problems.
It is much better to have paper bags, for example.
Certain Member States have introduced paper bags and have banned the use of plastic bags.
The exchange of best experience is what we are doing, trying to get best experience from various Member States.
We organise seminars and visits to Member States to inform them of what is happening elsewhere and how they can deal in the best possible way with the various environmental problems, giving them guidance and sometimes even financing for eligible projects.
Â Â  . The Commission is aware of the concerns raised by the honourable Member with regard to sewer overflows into the River Thames.
A number of complaints were registered following events in August 2004, which saw large quantities of untreated raw sewage entering the Thames.
The Commission has drawn the attention of the United Kingdom authorities to these concerns in a letter of formal notice issued under Article 226 of the European Community Treaty, which was sent in March 2005.
The letter of formal notice stressed the need for Member States to ensure the adequacy of their collecting and treatment systems under the Council Directive concerning urban waste water treatment.
A reply has been received from the United Kingdom, and this is currently being assessed.
That assessment is being carried out together with that of cases raising similar concerns about excessive storm water overflows in other parts of the United Kingdom.
If I remember correctly, two are in England and one is in Scotland.
The Commission hopes to be in a position to decide what steps to take next in this matter before the end of the year.
The Commission is unable to comment on the legal advice given by the UK Department for Environment referred to by the honourable Member, as it was not aware that such advice existed or that access to it had been refused.
Â Â  â The last comment was very interesting and one that I should like to follow up.
The Environment Agency, which is the UK regulator, believes that there is a breach of the directive.
Could I just say to the Commissioner that it is not just a matter of storm overflows: it does not need unusually heavy rainfall to have these outflows; they happen on average once a week.
Only one of the 57 outflows is screened and so I have to leave to your imagination the sewage solids that go into the river.
I am particularly worried about the run-up to the 2012 Olympics.
For water sports and for the image of London, this is a terrible situation, and the athletesâ village will overlook one of these overflows.
I am amazed that the UK Government, as well as the Mayor of London, is content to put up with that situation.
Â Â  . I shall do whatever I can within my remit, which is to see that the requirements of the directive are met.
Of course, I shall work with you in order to help London, as you stressed in your question, avoid the embarrassment that this pollution from overflows of raw sewage would cause to the 2012 Olympics.
It is interesting to know that, if the problem is not resolved by then, the site of the proposed athletesâ village will overlook the overflow at Abbey Mills, with its associated smells and unsightly mess.
It cannot be ruled out that athletes may be allowed to practise on the Thames or that events may take place on the river itself.
The Commission is unable to take a position on the arrangements being made in London for the 2012 Olympics.
I must repeat that our only involvement is to ensure that the requirements of the directive concerning urban waste water treatment are met.
You are right to say that these spills occurred not only during the very heavy rainfall in August 2004.
According to an Environment Agency press release, these spills occur about 50 to 60 times a year.
The Environment Agency, which is an adviser to the UK Government, has also reached the conclusion that the system of collection and treatment is inadequate.
There were some suggestions on how to solve this problem. One was an interceptor tunnel underneath the river Thames, which would be about 20 miles long and would take about ten years to construct.
The Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment is a results-based directive and so it is not my business to suggest what method the British Government should choose to solve the problem.
That is a matter for the Government.
But there is a problem and we have therefore started infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom.
In December we will see whether we should proceed with the reasoned opinion in order to persuade the United Kingdom authorities to take the appropriate measures to carry out the infrastructure works necessary in order to treat the water in an acceptable way.
My final point is that, if untreated sewage is discharged into the river, then the Thames estuary, which is an important wetland, will be endangered.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr Papadimoulis has tabled several questions on this issue and I am always in the happy or unhappy position of replying.
The Psyttalia station has been operating fully since December 2004 and takes care of third-level treatment of urban sewage discharged into the sensitive area of the Saronic Gulf.
During the construction and upgrading of the station, complaints were submitted to the Commission about the handling of the sludge â the sewage sludge â produced.
In October 2002, the Commission instituted infringement proceedings against Greece in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, on the basis of the fact that the Greek authorities had not made provision for the disposal of the sewage sludge in a manner which was compatible with Community environmental legislation.
The infringement proceedings brought about results, in that in August 2003 the Greek authorities finally decided to construct a drying unit on the island of Psyttalia, at which the sludge would be converted to solid matter of adequate calorific value for subsequent incineration in suitable installations.
There are similar applications in other European countries.
It should be emphasised that, in December 2004, the Commission decided to cofinance the project within the framework of the Cohesion Fund.
The project must be completed by the end of 2007.
This is expected to resolve definitively the problem of sewage sludge management.
However, despite all these positive developments, there is still the problem of the management of the sewage sludge already stored on the island and of the sewage sludge which will be produced on a daily basis until the proposed drying unit is commissioned.
One solution is to transport large quantities of untreated sewage sludge by ship and lorry to the sanitary landfill site in Ano Liosia, on the mainland outside Athens.
However, this solution presents certain environmental problems: possible contamination of the waters due to the discharge of sewage sludge into the sea, repercussions due to emissions from the transportation of waste over a distance of 21 kilometres through a densely populated area and danger of contamination due to spillage of waste during transportation.
In addition, the disposal of the treated sewage sludge in the sanitary landfill site at Ano Liosia is considered to be a factor which will lead to the saturation of the site.
Consequently, the Commission considers the method of disposal of the sludge referred to above to be incompatible with Community environmental legislation.
The national authorities are responsible for the selection and implementation of a suitable method for the temporary treatment of the sewage sludge, pending the completion of the proposed drying unit.
The Commission is evaluating the temporary solution proposed by the Greek authorities, a sort of soilification procedure, in conjunction with the operation of the sanitary landfill site at Ano Liosia and, if necessary, it will not, of course, hesitate to institute judicial proceedings against Greece, because this is required not only by Community legislation, but also by the need to protect citizens' health and the environment.
Within the framework of its powers, the Commission is taking â and shall continue to take â all the necessary measures in order to safeguard compliance by the Member States with Community legislation.
Â Â  â Commissioner, the Greek authorities, as you know, have promised to stop the unsuccessful transportation and soilification of the sewage sludge in Ano Liosia in December.
Does the Commission know if this promise will be kept and what alternative solution is being proposed?
In Greece, we hear various rumours without there being any official information.
Perhaps you can enlighten us?
Have you examined and evaluated this famous alternative post-December solution which is a secret from the Greeks?
Finally, the contractor for drying the sewage sludge in Psyttalia has still not been selected, even though it is two years since August 2003.
Do you believe that the deadlines set by the Commission will be kept?
Â Â  . To be honest, the minister has not told me what the solution is that has been promised for the end of the year.
I assume that, if that is what he says, he has something in mind and, of course, a minister and a government do not make this sort of promise unless they have something specific; in other words, a planned method of disposing of the sewage sludge during the period up to 2007 when the drying unit on the island of Psyttalia will be finished.
The problem, therefore, is in the interim period and what will happen with the sewage sludge which is currently being dumped at the Ano Liosia landfill using a partial soilification procedure, which is at the pilot stage at present, whereby the material produced can be used either to cover the landfill or to reinforce the ground in certain areas.
Of course, I repeat that the way in which the sludge is transported through a densely populated area to the landfill is not right.
That is why the government, from December onwards, as announced, will have an alternative solution which undoubtedly, I too believe, will be much better from an environmental point of view.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Commission is an important institutional factor, both in the lawmaking process on environmental issues and in the sanctions process on infringement issues.
It is quite right to be strict within the framework of this institutional sanctions chain.
However, I have a feeling that there is a contradiction between strictness, between being justifiably strict on issues of infringement of European environmental legislation, and the acceptance of acceptable waste management standards.
The Community bureaucracy, the Commission bureaucracy should indicate waste management standards in a strict and binding manner.
It has huge technical know-how, it has experience, and methods should not be left to the discretion of the Member States.
In other words, we should move to acceptable European waste management standards.
Â Â  . I should like to start by referring to how strict or less strict we are.
In particular for Greece and for me, what I can say is that I am neither more nor less strict with the country of which I am a national.
I try to be objective and to do what is needed in order to protect the health of the citizens in the European Union and, of course, in Greece, and to protect the ecosystems and the environment.
Consequently, we deal objectively and with an effort to improve conditions for health and the environment and questions of recourse to the Court and, I repeat, I always try to ensure we avoid going to the Court and find other ways of dealing with issues.
The honourable Member said that the Commission should have even more competences and should indicate specific methods.
What I can say to you is that, depending on the conditions which apply in each country, the best method is applied.
The method of waste management in northern Europe is not the same as the method in southern Europe or in one country in relation to another or even in areas within the same country.
There are reasons why one country prefers incineration and recycling and another country prefers landfill in order to reinforce the ground and, of course, our basic objective is always to try to prevent the creation of waste.
On the specific question of Psyttalia, the European Union has intervened in the financing of the first project, which was third-level treatment of waste, and now the drying unit.
That being so, as for what happens about the problem created by the Greek Government by collecting all this sewage sludge on the island, that is not the European Union's business to say what should be done with this sewage sludge.
It is a problem which was created by neglecting to build the drying unit at the right time, ten years ago, with the result that all this sludge has collected.
However, it is not our job to say what should be done with this sewage sludge and how the government should address the problem.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, does the Commission know whether all the Member States have transposed the Community environmental legislation in force on the treatment of waste, whether they have incorporated it into their legislation and whether they are applying it properly?
Does it know whether all the States are doing so?
Â Â  . There are differences between the various Member States.
Most of the legislation has been transposed, but not all.
I cannot list just now which countries have transposed all and which only some of the legislation, but we are trying to work closely with the authorities in each country on its transposition.
We send teams of experts, often legal experts, and we use the IMPEL system in order to encourage and facilitate the transposition of the environmental legislation in general and the waste legislation in particular.
Â Â  As the speaking time allotted to this subject is exhausted, Questions 53 to 59 will be answered in writing(2).
Â Â  . The European Union will continue to collaborate very closely with the international partners in the Quartet, as well as with its partners in the region, working with both sides to restore the political process and return to the roadmap.
We believe that dialogue with Israel within the framework of the political arrangements set out, on the one hand, in the association agreement and, on the other hand, in the European Neighbourhood Policy is the most effective way to impress upon the national authorities the Unionâs concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law.
The threat of sanctions, and the suspension of any part of the association agreement, is likely, we think, to diminish rather than bolster the Unionâs ability to bring its influence to bear on Israel.
In this critical period following Israelâs disengagement from Gaza and parts of the West Bank that we and the whole international community wholeheartedly welcome, the Union has agreed to help provide very strong support for the reconstruction of the Palestinian infrastructure and institutions and to promote economic reform and governance.
Thus, we think that improving the life and lives of the Palestinians is the best way to stabilise the situation in Gaza and to further the prospects for peace.
The Commission remains committed to that end.
Â Â  â Commissioner, thank you for your response.
Of course, I endorse what you say, but we must recognise that, despite early optimism after Israelâs unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, the picture today is much bleaker than hoped.
Only last week, Israel broke off diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority after three young settlers were killed; these are the real politics of that region and are the things that we must concentrate on.
What I ask, in specific terms, is how does the Commission plan to bring Israel and the Palestinian Authority back to the negotiating table, and ensure that those early feelings of optimism are not entirely wasted?
Â Â  . I can tell you that we are working very closely in the Quartet, which has a special envoy, MrÂ James Wolfensohn, with whom I am in very close contact.
What we want to do is to bring the two parties together on the different points. These include the âsix plus three pointsâ identified by Mr Wolfensohn.
The parties have not yet found a consensus on all of these. There is the Rafah crossing and the link between Gaza and the Left Bank; there are the greenhouses and many other issues.
I was in Washington last week, along with President Barroso.
I saw President Bush and Condoleezza Rice. We spoke about that.
I saw Mr Wolfensohn before that meeting.
At this stage we want to follow these events very closely.
We have also said in a communication that we are even ready to double the means that we have been giving to the Palestinians this year, if both parties make progress and other donors participate.
Â Â  â Commissioner, your comments about the activities of the Quartet and the offer to increase aid to Palestine are all very welcome.
However, I wonder if you would agree that the long-term security of Israel and the Middle East will be guaranteed by making Israel more integrated with its neighbours to ensure that trade and movement between the neighbours develop.
Will you use the Barcelona process to try to encourage Israel and its neighbours to see communication between them as a solution and not as a threat to their security?
Â Â  . I completely agree that the long-term perspective has to be one where Israel can work in peace with all its neighbours: above all with a Palestinian state, as set out in the roadmap, but also with all its other neighbours.
I will also go to Barcelona, where we are working specifically towards a new set-up for the next ten years, trying to focus more on education, on cooperation in the economic and commercial fields â not only with the Agadir process, which is a south-south process, but also as a whole, meaning investment, agriculture products, and high-level products and services â and on the question of democracy and human rights.
Indeed, I am travelling around many countries, trying to stimulate them to do more and to implement the action plans we have at the moment.
Â Â  â Many EU citizens who travel to Israel are exposed to very brutal and degrading treatment, especially if they are of Arab origin or if they show active solidarity with democratic development in Palestine.
Recently, a young Swedish woman who travelled to Israel was subjected to very violent treatment.
Her life was threatened by the Israeli border soldiers, and she was refused entry in the most brutal ways because she had worked for a democratic and free Palestine.
In your dealings with the Israelis, are you addressing the issue of how they treat EU citizens entering Israel?
Â Â  . If cases such as this are brought to us, we will of course give them our attention.
I was not previously acquainted with this case, but it goes without saying that human rights â those of every traveller as much as of every other person â must be upheld everywhere.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 61 lapses.
What specific strategy is the Commission employing with a view to stepping up EU cooperation with the three States of the South Caucasus and with the States bordering on the Caspian Sea?
Â Â  . With regard to the South Caucasus and the states bordering the Caspian Sea, this region and its development have become increasingly important issues since enlargement.
I am therefore very happy to say that this has now been included in our Neighbourhood Policy.
This was done last June and since then we have been preparing proposals for draft action plans with each of the three countries concerned.
The partner countries themselves are developing their own priorities for such action plans.
The Commission will start consultations on those action plans very soon.
An EU troika is visiting the region as we speak, from 24 to 28 October, and its assessment will indeed be very helpful as we start our discussions.
Strengthening democracy, the rule of law, improving business and the investment climate for sustainable economic development, and encouraging people-to-people contacts are matters of utmost importance. These are key EU priorities for the whole region.
Further priorities under the ENP include regional cooperation and conflict settlement.
The EC countries will, in the meantime, provide substantial support to the partner countries of the South Caucasus region and, by way of example, I could cite our deep involvement in the reform of the judiciary in Azerbaijan and Georgia, our support for institutional, legal and administrative reform in Armenia, or our rehabilitation efforts in those parts of Georgia especially affected by frozen conflicts, such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
We also hope to encourage greater cooperation between and with the countries bordering the Caspian Sea.
Let me give just a few examples.
We regard the process of EU-Black Sea/Caspian Basin energy and transport cooperation, launched at the Baku ministerial meeting late last year, as a very important vehicle for encouraging broader regional cooperation.
We are also giving due attention to the environmental situation in and around the Caspian Sea, because it is the largest saltwater lake in the world but also one of the richest oil reserves.
So this is a region that will be an increasing focus of our attention under the Neighbourhood Policy.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for that very good and exhaustive reply.
I would like to put a supplementary question: you have already referred to one of the two problems specific to the region, namely energy and the minorities, which brings in its train expulsion, separation and much else.
What I would like to know is whether the Commission or the European institutions are still planning to hold a conference devoted specifically to the energy problems, and, secondly, whether you are giving specific attention to the issues relating to minorities, particularly in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia?
Â Â  . As I have already hinted, I can tell the honourable Member that energy policy does indeed, and naturally so, play a very major role and that we are at least open to the idea of more conferences being held.
I am unable to say whether my fellow-Commissioner Mr Piebalgs is planning another conference in the immediate future, but I can say that we are keeping a very close eye on developments, which are, of course, becoming more and more important.
What this means is that this will be an ongoing issue for the Commission throughout its term of office.
Turning to the subject of minorities, these issues are dealt with by the OSCE, with which we are working quite closely.
I myself chaired the OSCE in the year 2000, and took these matters very seriously.
The European Union will continue to monitor these issues as part of the action plans that have yet to be negotiated.
As democracy and human rights always have a prominent place in these, minority rights fit into them as well.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to ask the Commissioner something about Georgia.
Over recent years, this country has seen significant changes, by which I mean reforms relating to democracy, the economy and human rights.
It is well known that Georgia is making certain efforts towards moving closer to the EU.
How do you assess its chances of accession at some future date?
Â Â  . Mr Paleckis, the neighbourhood policy has now, so to speak, brought these states, like all other countries in the Caucasus, close to the European Union for the first time.
What that means is that the neighbourhood policy quite deliberately refrains from addressing the issue of membership of the European Union.
That is never, of course, generally prejudicial to future developments, but it is quite essential that Georgia, and its two neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan as well, should now do everything in their power to push through reforms on the domestic front.
That is quite essential, and much that will bring them closer to the European Union still remains to be done.
We regard these countries as future important friends, and will, to some degree, be prepared â provided that they carry out these reforms â to include them in the internal market and to open up options for them in the spheres of energy, transport and education policy.
We do, of course, also expect these countries to give priority to action in relation to democratisation, the rule of law, and the prevention of corruption and many other scourges that currently afflict them.
Â Â  . I can tell you that of course we are aware of difficulties and obstacles to the European Union, especially the funding of civil society activities in Tunisia.
We are devoting a great deal of attention to trying to resolve these issues.
I myself have just visited Tunisia, on 12 and 13Â October, and I took the opportunity to raise these issues with all the people I spoke to: the Prime Minister, the Minister for Cooperation and International Development and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
I have also met civil society representatives in Tunisia, notably the associations that are encountering difficulties in receiving support from the European Union, the Tunisian League of Human Rights and the Association of Women for Research and Development.
I must say I strongly encouraged the Tunisian authorities to rapidly unblock the four projects that are still currently blocked, representing a total of EURÂ 143Â 000.
I have also made it clear that the problems with the implementation of our civil society and governance projects will have very negative consequences for our future financial cooperation with Tunisia.
I hope that these talks will have an effect and that we will be able to unblock the projects very soon.
The future financial envelope for partners including Tunisia will, of course, specifically take account of progress on the current projects.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for your explanation.
I also visited Tunisia last month and that is why I put this question, but I would like to say that personally I would like to see more energy and precision in your reply â since the questions were sufficiently precise â what specific measures?
In Tunisia talks were held and there was the feeling that those in power appeared rather dismissive of the European Unionâs capacity to influence human rights conditions in talks with Tunisia.
That is why I would like to see more energetic action from the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr Kristovskis, I have just stated that I myself was very much involved.
It is not just a case of my staff constantly having dealt with these issues and addressed these questions at every level; we have also made it perfectly clear that, if these projects are blocked and cannot be completed shortly, then there will be no funding for them.
That means that there very definitely are conditions attached.
Â Â  As the speaking time allotted to this subject is exhausted, Questions Nos 64 to 72 will be answered in writing(3).
Questions Nos 73, 74 and 78 lapse, as the authors are not present.
Â Â  . The Commission negotiated the new fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco, which was initialled on 28Â July.
The agreement follows the new partnership format which the Community has developed for relations with third countries in the field of fisheries.
This new approach includes, among others, a clear commitment from the Commission side to promote the general principles of conservation and sustainable management of fishery resources.
The new agreement paves the way for a permanent policy dialogue on fisheries between the European Community and Morocco and envisages initiatives and measures in support of responsible fisheries policy.
The previous fisheries agreement with Morocco, which covered the period 1995-99, did indeed provide for fishing possibilities for sponge fishing.
In fact, it included the provision of five licences, which were never used.
The new agreement establishes different categories of fishing possibilities for Community fishing vessels, covering a total of 119 fishing vessels and a quota of 60Â 000 tonnes for industrial pelagic fisheries.
The Commission is well aware of the Greek interest in sponge fishing, since, as part of the preparations for the negotiations on a new fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco, Greece pointed out on several occasions its interest in including sponge fishing in the new agreement.
During the negotiations, the Commission took account of the Greek interest and presented to the Moroccan side a request to include sponge fishing in the agreement.
Unfortunately, however, at this stage, sponge fishing cannot be covered in the agreement.
The scientific evaluations available do not provide sufficient data with respect to sponge fishing to allow us to cover this type of fishing in the agreement.
However, were a favourable scientific assessment of sponge stocks to become available in the future, the Commission could propose to the Moroccan side the inclusion of this type of fishing in the agreement.
This inclusion could take the form of a decision of the joint committee that is provided for in Article 10 of the agreement.
Having said that, I wish to emphasise that both the Community and Morocco have agreed to the possibility of carrying out certain experimental fisheries under Article 5 of the Protocol.
In this context, experimental sponge fishing can be envisaged.
Experimental campaigns could facilitate the preparation of a scientific assessment of sponge resources in the Moroccan fishing zone.
Â Â  â Commissioner, your reply, as it comes from a person with a great deal of sensitivity, partially satisfies me.
However, what I should like to emphasise is that we believe in the sustainability of the sea, which is why we feel that the five fishing vessels we are asking for is a very small number of vessels which will not cause any imbalance.
We are therefore asking, as you promised, for you to speed up your scientific studies so that they can continue to fish for sponges, because otherwise these family businesses will close.
Â Â  . Let me say first of all that we will be looking into establishing experimental fisheries under Article 5 of the protocol.
That would provide scope for an almost immediate assessment of the state of health of sponge stocks within the areas covered by the agreement with Morocco.
Once we have a scientific evaluation of the state of health of the stocks, then we will negotiate with Morocco the inclusion of this type of fishery in the agreement.
In fact, there is an understanding with Morocco to this effect.
I will see to it that the experimental fisheries and scientific evaluation are carried out as early as possible.
Â Â  â Madam President, if an honourable colleague has been unfortunately delayed and is not in the Chamber for his or her question, but then arrives three questions later â there are, after all, very few colleagues present â would you, in your personal capacity, please take question number 72?
Â Â  I cannot do that, as we have strict rules on Question Time and each Commissioner is allotted 20 minutes.
I would have been quite happy to take the honourable Memberâs question to which you refer, were it not for the fact that it is intended for Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who is no longer here, and so your question will be one of those answered in writing.
Â Â  . The Commission and the Member States are following closely all the particularities of the management of salmon stocks, an important element of which is the regulation of salmon fisheries at sea, ensuring a sufficient number of returning salmon reach the spawning grounds upstream.
No less important are the regulation of river and estuarial fisheries and the maintenance of rivers in good ecological condition to ensure appropriate spawning success and the survival and growth of young salmon.
But other aspects fall outside the direct competence of the common fisheries policy.
An important drawback of the management of salmon fisheries at sea is that these do not target single stocks of salmon.
In fact, salmon caught in these fisheries can belong to a mixture of stocks in unpredictable proportions.
Another important aspect of these fisheries is that they are deeply rooted in the tradition of coastal communities of fishermen and their consequent social importance.
The challenge is then to establish a balance between the conditions by which fishing may be allowed to continue and to ensure that such fishing does not undermine the sustainability of stocks in need of recovery.
Member States with sea salmon fisheries have developed management strategies to address that difficult problem.
Measures taken range from total prohibition to the regulation of fishing gear, in order to target better the stocks of salmon in good condition and preserve those in need of recovery.
The Commission has undertaken to review the situation and examine the success of these management strategies and subsequently report to the Council and to Parliament.
This work is in progress and will be completed during the coming weeks.
Following the result of the above-mentioned report and the discussion both with the European institutions and with other stakeholders, the Commission will consider proposing management measures within the framework of the common fisheries policy.
With regard to the reference made by the honourable Member to the use of driftnets, the Commission should clarify that the salmon driftnet fishery within the Irish 12-mile limit is not covered by the 1998 ban on the use of driftnets for highly migratory species such as tuna.
The Commission would also add that the question at stake refers to stock management issues but does not directly relate to the type of gear concerned.
It should therefore not be confused with the 1998 prohibition on the use of driftnets because of cetacean by-catch and which, in the Atlantic area of interest, applies only to the catching of tuna and some tuna-like species.
The decision taken by the Council last year, with the full support of the European Parliament, for a progressive phasing-out and a total ban on using driftnets in the Baltic Sea as from 1 January 2008, which shall apply without any distinction on target fish species, including salmon, is aimed at protecting the extremely endangered population of harbour porpoise that remains in the Baltic Sea.
Â Â  â Thank you for that answer.
You will be aware that in Ireland there is a great deal of debate about driftnetting and whether we should introduce a compulsory or voluntary buy-out of driftnets.
You said we need to get the balance right, do you think we have the right balance at the moment between management practices and preserving our stocks?
I am interested in your review.
Can you be more specific as to when it will be available and will it make firm recommendations?
We need to protect salmon stocks, which are in grave danger in Irish waters, and there are economic consequences arising from that.
Â Â  . With regard to your point on the right balance, the Commission has undertaken to carry out a review of the situation and to examine the success of the management strategies in order to see whether the balance is right between sustainability and the continuation of traditional fisheries for salmon.
The study will be completed by the end of October, which is next week.
We will be looking at the results of this study and then coming to Parliament and the Council with our own proposals in order to see to it that there is proper management of these fisheries.
Â Â  â I come from Scotland.
As you may know, Scottish wild salmon is the best in the world.
We are worried about the future of salmon stocks.
You give a very factual and clear answer in terms of the current situation, but I should like to ask you personally, as Commissioner: do you feel that driftnets, with their indiscriminate catch, can continue to be used in European waters?
Has the time not come to end the use of driftnets in fishing?
Â Â  .
It is very difficult to make a blanket statement; obviously we have a ban on driftnets with a very large span because of the negative effect they can have on the sustainability of fish and their impact on bycatch cetaceans.
There we have a total ban on the use of driftnets.
With driftnets that are much smaller in size and where there is no risk of cetacean by-catches, the Commissionâs position is more open.
If, on the basis of scientific study, it can be concluded that driftnets do not create undue pressures on the sustainability of salmon or any other fish stocks and there is no risk of by-catches of cetaceans, then we take a more open approach.
That is why, because of the reports and criticism in Ireland, we have commissioned the study to see what the situation is and how the management of the stock is proceeding.
If we see that there are undue pressures on sustainability then we will take the necessary remedial action.
Perhaps it is somewhat misleading to point the finger at one particular type of net.
There could be other types of net that are not classified as driftnets but that, in particular circumstances, could have an even more negative impact on the sustainability of fisheries.
Therefore the task of the Commission is to restore sustainable fisheries where they do not exist and where we are fishing sustainably â which is the exception, not the rule â to maintain sustainability.
Â Â  . It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure effective control, inspection and enforcement of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, which include a prohibition on the use of driftnets targeting highly migratory species.
It is, on the other hand, the responsibility of the Commission to evaluate and monitor Member States' compliance with this obligation.
For a number of years, the Commission has monitored Member States closely to ensure they are taking the necessary measures for proper control and enforcement of the driftnet prohibition.
Although in the Atlantic the situation has proved to be satisfactory, in the Mediterranean serious problems persist.
The last inspections carried out by Commission inspectors this summer confirmed that driftnets were currently being used in Italy, France and Spain.
The Commission has already launched infringement proceedings against these Member States.
Reasoned opinions were addressed to Italy and France and a letter of formal notice to Spain.
The opinions and the letter from the Commission challenged the lack of proper control and enforcement by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned as regards the prohibition on driftnets.
The Commission is also examining closely, on the basis of the information at its disposal, national legislation which is not, or seems not to be, in conformity with the Community probation on driftnets.
To cite an example, in the infringement procedure against France the Commission challenged the compatibility with Community legislation of a French decree allowing the use by French fishermen of the thonaille, a driftnet targeting bluefin tuna.
This legislation was recently annulled by the French Conseil dÂŽÃtat, which, in its decision, used the same arguments as the Commission had used in its reasoned opinion.
I would also like to stress that, although the Commission is aware of the assertion that Almeira's surface longliner fleet has suffered a 40% reduction in catches, as stated by the honourable Member, there is no scientific evidence that such a reduction has actually occurred and that this is caused by the unfair competition attributable to non-Spanish fleets.
Representatives of the Spanish fleet concerned have been asked to provide the data to support their allegation.
In any case, I can confirm that the Commission will take all necessary steps in accordance with the rules of the EC Treaty and of the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that Member States comply with the Community legislation prohibiting driftnets.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his sincerity.
It is clearly well-known, as the Commissioner has demonstrated very well, that driftnets are still being used in the Mediterranean.
The fishermen who conform to the Regulation have a sense that they are not being protected, but there is something more serious than all of that.
It has come to light this summer that, of 37 vessels found with driftnets prohibited by ecological organisations, 18 had already received subsidies for their restructuring.
I do not believe that this problem can be left solely in the hands of the Member States.
I believe that the Commission must act and it has done so in relation to certain States, but that is clearly insufficient.
We cannot allow non-compliance with the Regulation and we cannot allow certain practices to take place while subsidies are being paid.
We are eagerly awaiting a response to their comments.
Â Â  . Firstly, I wish to underline the fact that the whole question of control and enforcement is the primary responsibility of the Member States.
If the Commission receives information that there might be a breach of the i.e. of the regulations concerning the common fisheries policy, then it will investigate whether the Member States are effecting controls.
The Commission carries out enquiries and it is as a result of these enquiries that infringement proceedings are initiated against Member States.
This is exactly what has happened with regard to the infringement proceedings against France, Italy and Spain.
It is important to underline that we were hoping to have the Mediterranean regulation adopted in the Council last month.
This would have included a definition of driftnets, which are banned by the 1988 regulation.
Unfortunately, the Council did not adopt this regulation last September.
We will be trying our luck again soon, in the hope that we can secure a long overdue regulation governing fisheries in the Mediterranean, which would give the Commission increased powers to ensure that fisheries are carried out properly and within the limits of sustainability.
Â Â  Since the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions NosÂ 79 to 126 will be answered in writing.(4)
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are prepared to give more consideration to patents.
That bodes well for the future.
That is exactly what we have done, and we have come to the conclusion that it is our firm belief that the human body and all of its parts are not patentable, since their functioning is not a human invention, but rather a discovery, and, as such, not patentable. This applies just as much to embryos, stem cells, germ cells and the genome, on which we cannot claim right of ownership.
Although, in the second 16C report, the Commission is right to state that the totipotent stem cells are not patentable, it remains vague about the patentability of pluripotent stem cells.
These are also parts of the human body and are, in accordance with Article 5 (1) of the directive, excluded from patents.
The patent that has fuelled this debate concerns human gametes.
The fact that this patent has been granted flies in the face of the principle that the human body and the parts thereof are not patentable.
It would be preferable if the groups were able to spell this out more clearly and unequivocally, particularly in the common resolution.
Parliament should take its monitoring task seriously.
This means lodging a firm objection with the European Patent Office.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that it is not good enough to come up with grand policy statements setting out our ethical position on European values if, when a clear, specific challenge to those values is brought to light, we just say timidly that it might be an infringement.
Today we are faced with an unambiguous case.
The European Patent Office has granted Edinburgh University a patent, number 125Â 7167, covering human cells. It also, ironically, involves a process of sex selection, at a time when we in Europe have firmly committed ourselves to the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of sex.
The precautionary principle must apply.
If there is any risk of human material becoming a commercial commodity, this Parliament must stand up and be counted and register a formal legal objection to this illegal trafficking in human body parts before it is too late.
This resolution is important, because there is not much time left for us to register our objection to help strike down this patent. I therefore ask my colleagues to vote for this resolution and Mr Bloklandâs amendment.
Â Â  . â Mr President, personally speaking, I believe that organised crime is the cancer of our society and, like cancer, it is very difficult to cure.
Mr Newton Dunnâs report is an excellent one, but is it enough?
I would just mention two aspects that should, I feel, cause us to consider reviewing our strategy further. First, fighting organised crime using the classic police and judicial methods has proven largely futile.
We need to look at new, fresh methods of dealing with it.
For example, much organised crime is connected with drug trafficking. By adopting a more liberalised stance on drugs, we could help drug users deal with their sickness and at the same time eliminate drug traffickers.
Secondly, in some cases organised crime thrives because it has the backing and cooperation of corrupt politicians or corrupt policemen.
Do we have in place in all Member States the necessary effective means to correct this situation, or do we just pretend that this corruption does not exist?
Unfortunately, this piece of legislation, although it contains many fine things, does little in respect of the two points I have just mentioned.
That shows, in my view, that neither the Commission nor Parliament is yet ready or brave enough to cut deep and remove the cancer of organised crime from our society before it is too late.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, what is it that is happening here?
We are being asked once again for non-binding advice on Council framework decisions in a key area of internal security, of judicial and police cooperation, which 25Â parliaments are ultimately supposed to transpose into national law.
In practice, that means that what we are concerned with is purely and simply a kind of ratification process under the pressure of the difficult task of reaching agreement between 25Â governments, without the consultation being binding, without codecision, without Community law, without comprehensive rights of scrutiny, and without any extension of the competence of the European Court of Justice.
A continual deepening of police and judicial cooperation is taking place here that, although necessary, does not take sufficient account of the issues of the degree to which the guarantees of fundamental rights are binding, of parliamentary legitimacy, and of legal and parliamentary control, and disregards the conflicts with regard to the rule of law.
This report demonstrates once again that we have reached the upper limit of the legitimacy of intergovernmental cooperation in this field.
The report contains a number of vague legal terms, which is surely the most dangerous thing possible in such an explosive field. Promotion of criminal organisations: what is that, what does it mean, what is the legal definition?
Particular investigation methods are demanded, and appropriate instruments, infiltration methods and techniques proposed, without the rapporteur actually taking the trouble to clarify the problems regarding the rule of law that these vague legal terms entail. We shall not be supporting this report, therefore.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is the duty of the Presidency of Parliament to uphold the honour of its Members.
It has been claimed that in this Chamber there are political exponents and representatives of institutions with links to criminal and terrorist organisations. I believe claims of that kind are unacceptable and I therefore call on the Presidency to take precautions to prevent speeches of that kind and to adopt whatever measures are needed to uphold the honour of the Sinn FÃ©in delegation, which belongs to our group.
I consider all that to be unacceptable and believe that the Presidency of Parliament should also intervene to penalise speakers who fail to respect the honour of the European Parliament and its Members.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, this would appear to be a popular theme among the Polish Members of the House, and I shall continue the trend.
The Commissionâs new principles governing the granting of financial aid for the trans-European transport networks are a prime example of price dumping. They are intended to encourage the Member States to take measures that are in the interests of the European Community as a whole.
Put briefly, these interests boil down to two key issues.
The first of these is the need to eliminate transport bottlenecks in the old Member States.
The second is the need to link the transport systems of the 15Â old Member States to those of the 10Â new Member States. There is cause for concern, however, that one of these goals will take precedence over the other if the above principles are implemented.
By this I mean that there is a better chance of the first goal being achieved than the second. It goes without saying that the reason for this is that the new Member States, in particular those such as Poland, are facing lengthy delays in the development of road infrastructure.
As well as finding solutions to the problem of how to link their transport systems to those in Western Europe, these countries are confronted with the challenge of constructing the very systems themselves. One answer could be to allow double Community funding for priority routes.
The Commission proposal makes no provision for this possibility, however, since the new principles exclude funding for sections of routes covered by the Cohesion Fund. This could mean that the dumping I mentioned at the start is entirely ineffective.
AmendmentÂ 22 should be adopted in order to ensure that such funding is not excluded, and I am very much in favour of this amendment.


Of course, the effectiveness of the new financial instrument in the old Member States will also be limited if cuts to the total funding available are made in the budget, and indeed this issue has already been touched upon several times today.
Such cuts would be absolutely disastrous, and would render a valuable initiative by the Commission completely meaningless.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, MrÂ Mauro, as well as MrÂ BÃ¶sch, who has been of great assistance to us in this work. I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I would like to say that this regulation is long awaited.
It contains many innovations for better managing the funds that are going to be invested in the trans-European transport networks, such as multi-annual programming, which is necessary and which is attached to each project, automatic decommitment, so that the funds do not remain unused indefinitely, the increase in rates of intervention, the establishment of European coordinators or the new loan guarantee instrument.
This is therefore a regulation of very high quality, but it contains a significant mistake: we have considerably increased the rates of intervention, we have considerably extended the geographical scope of the trans-European networks, we have doubled the number of priority projects, and we do not yet have any budget! In other words, though we now have the key to the coffers, the coffers are empty.
I believe that we must avoid the loss of credibility that we suffered in relation to the big Essen projects. I therefore believe that it is extremely important that we pursue the budgetary battle to its end, because otherwise we will suffer a very considerable loss of credibility, which would be a very great disappointment for all of the regions of Europe.
Furthermore, it seems to me that the spending adjustment variable is what are being called projects of common interest, which are not priority projects.
In this regard as well, I fear that many regions and many local authorities in Europe are deluding themselves.
The regulation is deceptive: it says that it funds everything, not just priority projects, but also projects of common interest within countries. We are very well aware, though, that we do not have the resources for that and that we will focus solely on cross-border projects and the big priority projects.
I therefore believe, Commissioner, that it needs to be put differently. In the absence of the resources to cover everything, we must explain that we will intervene wherever there is Community added value, that is to say, essentially the great cross-border projects.

Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ DrÄarÂ Murko, and Commissioner Kyprianou for the desire for mutual understanding they have shown in the course of this work.


The Socialist Group in the European Parliament obviously welcomes the Commissionâs proposal to limit the use of those substances in what are known as jelly mini-cups that have led to tragic accidents involving choking.
We also welcome the Commissionâs proposal to establish the level of nitrates and nitrites on the basis of added values in, for example, meat products instead of, as at present, on the basis of residual levels. We believe that this will lead to safer monitoring for consumers.
We want these restrictions to enter into force as quickly as possible, and we have therefore been anxious to reach a rapid agreement with the Council. We are also pleased that, under the agreement with the Council, the use of soybean hemicellulose is to be limited so as not to make life more difficult for allergy sufferers.
We should, however, have liked to have seen lower upper limits for nitrates and nitrites.
We should also have liked to bring about a ban on the use of antibiotics in foodstuffs since such use may lead to increased resistance, and we should have liked to have seen a more thorough investigation of the risks associated with the sweetener aspartame, but on these points a majority of the committee was opposed to us.
Now that the Commission has, both in writing and orally here in the Chamber, stated that it takes our concern about the long-term use of aspartame and antibiotics in foodstuffs seriously, we shall support the compromise with the Council and so vote against the other amendments. We wish, however, to call on the Commission to return as quickly as possible to these issues, thoroughly to revise these directives on the basis of the need to limit the use of additives in foodstuffs, and to take greater account of the situation of vulnerable groups.
More and more people are rightly expressing concern about the level of additives in food and about the long-term consequences of their use. We in the EU must take this concern extremely seriously.
Â Â  . â Mr President, although this is a very lonely debate, it is nevertheless a very important piece of legislation because it deals with what we knowingly â or in many cases, unknowingly â ingest.
It is also a somewhat complicated and controversial piece of legislation in places, and therefore much credit should go to the rapporteur for achieving a valuably balanced report.

I wish to pick up on a couple of aspects that I feel need to be noted further.
First, it is right to ban jelly mini-cups with gel-forming food additives in order to prevent choking in children, but the banning of gel-forming food additives in general is unwise because these substances are only hazardous when used in jelly mini-cups.
If used in other products, they are perfectly safe; so I fully support the principle that we should not place a blanket ban on all substances, and should only ban unsafe products.
Secondly, with regard to the newly authorised sweetener erythritol, I agree with the rapporteur that its laxative effect, even if at very low percentage levels, should be made known in the form of product labelling.
As a matter of principle, I believe that it is an unquestionable right of the consumer to know exactly what he eats or drinks.
That right surely supersedes any marketing tactics or side-effects.

I thank the Commissioner for staying so late with us.
The use of antibiotics is very unwise in any foods because of the danger of microbial resistance and allergenic reactions.

Mr President, I should like briefly to correct an omission.
I did not thank the rapporteur. She did an excellent job and I second the congratulations expressed by the honourable Members.
It is true that this is a technical subject, but it touches upon many sensitivities. Mrs DrÄar Murko did an excellent job in dealing with this issue and reaching the compromise that we have before us today.
I am optimistic that we will have an agreement at first reading.
Â Â  We shall begin with the joint debate on the budgetary procedure for the financial year 2006.
We shall examine
