It is exactly because of these three facets that we have to be so much more careful about drafting a sound regulation.
This is why I give my full backing to Mrs Schierhuber' s report.
The amounts which have been mentioned guarantee that cultivation remains profitable and also ensure sound processing.
What we need is tighter control on processing to ensure that malpractices are prevented in future.
I would like to end on a historical note.
My country suffered an eighty-year war at the hands of Spain, which was eventually settled with the Peace of MÃŒnster.
The people who met round the table came from the southern Netherlands - Belgium as it is known today, - the northern Netherlands - the Netherlands as we know it today - and Spain, and all three wore linen jackets, most probably made in Flanders, the linen being grown in Northern France and Belgium.
An eighty-year conflict failed to destroy the cultivation of flax along the North Sea coast.
Surely, we cannot afford to let the current regulation go under on account of a minor derailment in Spain which has meanwhile been rectified and which has led to crops being cultivated there over an area reduced to 50 000 hectares.
I would like a new flax regulation for Europe to reflect this historical awareness that was achieved with the Peace of MÃŒnster.
Mr President, we agree with the objectives pursued in the Commission' s proposal on the new regulation on flax and hemp: to regulate and balance the markets, simplify the common agricultural policy and prevent fraud.
However, we do not agree with the chosen method. This is because we consider that this proposal, since the amendments improving it, which were presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have not been accepted, may lead to the total disappearance of hemp and flax crops in small- and medium-sized holdings, and as an alternative crop in certain areas of the Union.
We believe, Commissioner, that it is unacceptable that, in order to put an end to fraud, we should seek to end cultivation within a certain sector.
This is a good time to point out that the best way to combat fraud is through the total transparency of public aid and of the investigations into fraud that are under way, and publishing the names of fraudsters, as the only way of preventing all farmers and the whole of the sector from having to pay for the consequences of fraud on the part of a few speculators.
The inclusion of flax and hemp within the general regulations on herbaceous plants requires the establishment of a single yield for all areas of the European Union.
The existence of different yields in northern and southern areas, in the different regions of the Union, may lead to real discrimination in payments per surface area with regard to this crop.
Therefore, we request that the inclusion of an average yield be accepted for all regions of the Union, and that this be the average yield for cereals.
With regard to aid for processing, we feel that it is completely inappropriate that there should be transitional aid for the processing of short-fibre flax, as the Commission proposes, which would end in 2006.
We believe that it should be long-term aid and that it should be brought into line with the aid for the processing of long-fibre flax, which is the only way of guaranteeing the commercial production of short-fibre flax in an industrial sector which provides a genuine alternative to synthetic products.
Commissioner, we are in complete agreement on the need for stabilisers with regard to this crop, but we completely disagree with the national guaranteed quantities established in the Commission' s proposal, since we feel that they are absolutely inadequate and represent quite the opposite of the actual situation in each of the countries.
We therefore also ask you to consider the proposal presented by the Committee on Agriculture.
Lastly, we absolutely agree with the existence of controls in this sector.
Therefore, the existence, in every single case, of the sales contract between the farmer and the processor, seems to us to be essential.
We are therefore voting against the report with regard to the disappearance of these contracts.
The existence of a contract is the best way of proving that the crop has been sold and processed.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, for this report, not least because it takes into consideration processing in those countries in particular, which, as Members of the EU, have also taken up the cultivation of flax.
It is quite natural that they have considered the market and consequently also the support for and emphasis on processing to be matters of paramount importance, particularly in the case of short-fibre flax, which can be used for buildings and as insulation.
I would also like to say I agree with the previous speaker, Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, regarding average yields.
The average yields of flax and hemp are very similar across Europe, in the North as well as the South.
There are no great differences between them.
As far as cereals are concerned, however, the differences are considerable.
Such being the case, it would be unreasonable if the fringe areas - i.e. the areas around the Mediterranean and the North - were to be placed in an unequal position with regard to aid payable on the basis of area in the case of hemp and flax, which represents such small-scale production in the context of agricultural production as a whole.
Amendment No 38 is therefore particularly sensible; I endorse it and hope that it will receive wide support, expressly in order to prevent the Mediterranean and Nordic countries from being placed in a position of disadvantage in comparison with the central regions of the European Union, as far as this area of production is concerned.
Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address Parliament on this very important issue.
The main thing to stress is that misuse of funds in one place should not prevent innovation continuing in other areas.
Excellent schemes are already being developed and should be supported.
In an unstable agricultural industry, the opportunities offered by flax and hemp in a developing market for natural fibres should not be lost.
It will provide farmers with the opportunity to diversify - something that they have continually been urged to do by respective Member State governments and by the European Parliament - to produce new employment possibilities.
In my own nation, Wales, flax processing plants are already being established using European Union aid.
The report from our Agricultural Committee also includes amendments to extend grant aid for producing flax and hemp to non-arable land, thus providing opportunities to diversify areas of the European Union unable to obtain monetary support under the present regime.
This is a crucial matter as it affects thousands of hectares of European land with low productive possibilities.
For example, 80% of the land mass of my nation, Wales, is non-arable.
The higher than average incidence of rainfall there makes it ideal terrain for growing short-fibre flax and yet it could not apply for European Union support under prior regulations.
Its peripheral location, something which has already been stressed here from other areas, and its small family farm units having to compete in a wider market, coupled with the high value of sterling, has meant that it has lost 80% of its income in less than three years.
The importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the European Union cannot be overemphasised.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard.
We also reject quotas and a ceiling for this production, as this would limit the possibilities to develop diversification and employment possibilities in disadvantaged regions.
We also believe there should be a balance of support between farmers and processors.
The rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, has agreed to put a limit of EUR 600 per hectare to farmers directly, provided that the farmer proves to the competent authorities, within 18 months after having applied for the subsidy, that he has delivered the fibre to a processor.
We also agreed if this proof could not be provided to the competent authorities within that period, the subsidy should stay at the level of the premia for set-aside land.
I congratulate the rapporteur and call on the European Parliament to support the Agriculture Committee's report.
Mr President, first and foremost I would like to thank Mrs Schierhuber for the work she has done, the main merit of which is the fact that it introduces some sensible elements into a proposal which makes no sense whatsoever.
It is true that the regulation in force is deficient in terms of control, and some people have taken advantage of these deficiencies in order to obtain aid which stretches the bounds of legality.
These situations obviously required modifications which logically should have concentrated on strengthening controls.
Nevertheless, we have seen another example of the unique way in which the Commission fulfils its function of producing legislative proposals.
The Commission' s proposal takes an extraordinary approach: instead of strengthening the control mechanisms, it abolishes aid for short-fibre flax.
To be honest, the Commission is behaving here like the doctor who proposes decapitation as a cure for a headache.
Furthermore, the Commission' s proposal, if put into practice, would lead to the disappearance of the crop in some Member States, which would have a negative affect on many farmers who had found an alternative crop which did not produce surpluses and which was destined for non-food use.
In Spain, for example, practically all flax grown is short-fibre flax, since the heat and the lack of rainfall restrict the growth of the plant.
Furthermore, the dryness of the ground in summer makes it practically impossible to pull up the plant together with its roots in order to obtain long fibre.
Furthermore, short-fibre flax is perfectly suited to dry conditions, there is a certain market for it and, at least in theory, it is the type of production which we are intending to promote.
The elimination of aid for short-fibre flax would hinder the innovative non-food use of agricultural products, fundamentally affecting regions with low rainfall and more difficult conditions.
The Commission is therefore proposing to concentrate aid in the areas with the best conditions and deny it to the least-favoured ones.
I would like to remind the Commission of Article 158 (ex Article 130A) of the Treaty, which lays down that social and economic cohesion must be strengthened, and the differences in levels of development between the different regions and the underdevelopment of the least-favoured regions, including the rural areas, should be reduced.
Lastly, I think it is essential that the Commission' s proposals are not accepted; however, in any event, the inclusion in the regulations on herbaceous crops would lead to unfair situations as a result of the use of yields conditioned by drought.
Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' amendments therefore seem to me to be a good solution to the problem.
Mr President, over the past couple of years, we have seen a sharp increase in the acreage of fibre flax and hemp as a result of subsidy-hunting in Member States such as Great Britain and Spain.
Producers in those countries destroyed their harvest, whilst they pocketed the subsidies for the crops.
It is only right that the Council clamped down on this type of misuse of Community funding by amending the flax regulation.
The original objective of production support was to bolster the traditional fibre flax crops which are mainly grown in Belgium, France and the Netherlands.
It is vital not to lose sight of this objective.
We therefore reject the proposal that the Committee on Budgets outlined in its opinion, namely to pitch the support granted to short- and long-fibre flax at the same level.
The production costs for long-fibre flax are higher than those for short-fibre flax and for hemp.
It is precisely with the short-fibre variant that farmers fiddled the system.
We can go along with the proposal to bring the cultivation of flax under the general support regulation for arable crops.
But the cereal support level is too low for long-fibre flax and therefore acts as a disincentive to producers to grow this flax variant.
This is why we have made our approval of this report dependent upon whether the support level for producers of long-fibre flax will be double that for cereal.
As long as support for processors continues to be varied according to whether the crop concerned is short- or long-fibre, we can do away with this differentiation in the support for producers.
An increase in support should, however, be accompanied by the following three control measures.
Firstly, a compulsory contract with processors who, in turn, must prove that the flax has been processed.
Secondly, a certain quota per Member State, shared between long-fibre and short-fibre flax and hemp.
Thirdly, the use of certified seed.
Finally, I would point out that, as it is late in the season, this regulation will not be able to come into force until the 2000-2001 season.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing a Commission proposal on the reform of the COM on flax and hemp in two respects.
Firstly, the Commission is explaining the need for the reform in terms of an increase in budgetary cost.
I do not believe that that is the best way to try to justify the need for a reform, although I agree that it is needed.
Amongst the objectives which this reform should have, as well as simplifying and updating the regulations, is also improving control, which is something we always forget about later on.
The Commission proposal offers a good, coherent and precise analysis of the sector in the European Union.
It explains the importance of flax and hemp production from both an economic and an ecological point of view.
However, it seems to me that the Commission' s considerations with regard to hemp fibre and short-fibre flax are not very realistic, either as regards its future viability or its range of uses.
However, the thing that seems least appropriate to me is the proposal on processing aid.
In this case I would like to draw your attention to the increasing number of uses for this type of fibre, as several speakers have already pointed out.
If we were to follow that route, the European Union, which already falls short in terms of using this type of fibre, would cease to use it altogether, at least in some countries.
Today I read in one of my country' s newspapers that one of the autonomous regions has abandoned more than 95% of its cultivation of short-fibre flax.
These were the words of the local Minister for Agriculture for that region.
This type of situation will become inevitable if this amendment is put into practice.
With regard to payment for processing, I cannot agree with the Commission' s proposal, either in terms of the distinction between short- and long-fibre flax or its proposals for hemp.
It appears to me that they have not made any precise calculation to justify the different amounts for the premiums.
Neither does there appear to be any precise calculation to justify the maximum guaranteed quantities, either at European level or on the different national levels.
Consequently, these quantities are going to hinder development in the European Union with regard to short- and long-fibre flax and hemp.
In addition, it also seems to me to be problematic to apply these regulations during this, the 2000-2001 season, since we are already at a late stage.
I believe that Mrs Schierhuber' s proposal is a balanced one. It has been approved by a majority in the Committee on Agriculture and we should adopt it as a basic regulation.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her handling of what is a very complex matter where both producing and non-producing Member States have serious reservations regarding the Commission proposals.
In very broad terms, I welcome the Commission proposal to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payments scheme.
A single area payment is in line with the view that growers should respond to market demands rather than be driven by CAP subsidies.
However, I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned.
We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops.
Compared with mainstream crops such as oil seeds and cereals, they require low levels of chemical and fertiliser treatment.
They also produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources.
We should welcome, therefore, the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification.
However, I wish to raise the question of land eligibility, which appears to be a particular problem in the UK.
Most of the flax and hemp grown in the UK is on land ineligible for arable area payments.
The Commission proposals, as I understand them, threaten the UK growers and would leave UK processors with no domestic supply of raw material.
It has been suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp so that any land could be used for those crops, but without an increase in the base area.
This would allow expansion, should market conditions encourage growth, and allow new growers to enter the market.
It would be helpful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber.
I have a feeling that this type of subject matter is right up her street.
I can only say that I agree with the thrust of her report.
I think it is indeed time that the Commission intervened in a support regulation for flax and hemp.
Large-scale fraud, misuse and so forth can only give agricultural policy a bad name, and this must be avoided.
That is why the Commission was right to intervene.
At this stage, however, there is another reason why the Commission would do well to devote special attention to this subject matter, as I am still of the opinion that it is necessary to develop agricultural crops other than the traditional crops grown at present.
Flax and hemp are typical crops which could help us find new markets for new agricultural products.
'Agrificatie' (agrification) is the correct Dutch term for this and I will have a look in due course to see how this has been translated in the different languages.
Encouraging initiatives have been taken in this field and large investments have been made in various countries.
In my opinion, the Commission should, more than anything, ensure that investments already made in factories and processing materials are used to the best effect.
I am thus not persuaded that it is absolutely vital to tie certain quotas to certain countries.
Instead, they should be tied to certain user capacities.
There is one aspect, however, not covered by the regulation, which works out quite well for Commissioner Fischler, namely that it will not cost him a penny.
Could he not consider making the use of these products made from flax or hemp compulsory?
It could be laid down in the law, in the interest of the environment, that dashboards for cars should be made of such and such products.
Maybe this could culminate in excellent relations with the Environment Commissioner, because I have the impression that she has a habit of hampering agriculture in other areas of the environment.
Perhaps this initiative could help us to turn the corner.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the Commission appears to have made a sound proposal, but in actual fact, this is not a sound proposal.
It may possibly prevent fraud because there is no longer an incentive for farmers to pocket the higher flax premium instead of set-aside or cereals premiums.
The only problem is that if you cut the flax premium to the level of the cereals premium and the set-aside premium, then no more flax or hemp will be cultivated in the EU and that will be that.
But if you introduce processing aid, where, in your view, fraud cannot be committed - and incidentally it can actually, but let us assume for now that it cannot - then the result might be that the raw material is grown outside the EU and imported.
If we want to ensure that flax is cultivated here, then we need to do precisely what we have proposed here, what the rapporteur has proposed, namely to go back to the level of the cereals premium.
When proof is then furnished that processing has taken place the amount is doubled, and this proof will not require very many checks because it has to be provided by those who wish to have this premium.
I should like to make the following comment on the maximum quantities: the fact that the budget has expanded because of fraud - and here the Commission has not distinguished itself in terms of controls - is not something of which we can approve.
Obviously, we have to push back the tide of fraud and the money which has been lost because of fraud needs, of course, to be traced. But the overall budget for this important, environmentally-friendly crop needs to be increased, and that is why the quotas which are now being laid down are inappropriate.
Mr Fischler, I am curious to hear whether you are going to accept the proposals made by the rapporteur - and I should like to thank her for her report.
You know what procedure this is.
If you say that you cannot accept them, we will react tomorrow and then we will have to negotiate this sound proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at another level.
Mr President, the aid scheme for flax and hemp has turned into pure subsidy-hunting.
It is almost criminal how grossly the scheme has been misused, and we must put a stop to this.
For a number of years, aid for hemp has been much higher than that for other crops.
Per-hectare aid for hemp is more than twice as high as that for cereals.
This means that, even though there are almost no legal uses for hemp, the area used for hemp cultivation has quadrupled in the course of the last year.
The desire to retain the high per-hectare aid for hemp is, in reality, a result of the very odd collaboration between, on the one hand, those who want to see cannabis legalised and, on the other hand, speculators in EU subsidies, for it is, in actual fact, impossible to see any difference between cannabinol-free hemp and the hemp which is used to produce hashish.
The Commission proposes that aid for hemp should be reduced in three phases to the level of aid that has been set for cereals.
I should ideally have liked to see aid reduced immediately to the aid level for cereals, but I can happily live with the Commission' s proposal.
It gives farmers time to adapt.
I cannot, however, live with the recommendation from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
It cannot be in accordance with modern, forward-looking and enlargement-oriented agricultural policy to propose that the transitional arrangements should be further extended.
That would be "far out" of place! Moreover, it is something I shall be voting against.
Where flax is concerned, the Commission also proposes to limit the opportunity for subsidy-hunting and, here too, the Committee is in favour of improving the scheme.
I take the opposite view, namely that the aid should be limited.
It should be the market and consumers who decide what should be produced, not sky-high EU subsidies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my particular thanks go firstly to the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, for her comprehensive survey of the situation and her excellent report.
The debate on reforms in the sphere of flax and hemp grown for fibre has been going on now for almost five years, if you take 1996 and the proposals which the Commission made then as the starting point.
In place of the reform proposed by the Commission at that time, however, the Council simply stepped up controls.
This certainly increased administrative expenditure considerably, but largely failed to achieve the desired, and necessary, effect: subsidy-hunting continued and the area under cultivation increased from around 100 000 hectares to 240 000 hectares, with the result that budgetary expenditure on this sector was, virtually, more than doubled.
The proposal before you today has three main objectives.
It is intended to put a stop to subsidy-hunting once and for all.
The Commission wishes to foster rural development by supporting traditional cultivation and production methods, and it wants to help farmers over a limited period of time to find profitable new sales outlets and to increase their sales potential.
You see we are not under any illusions!
In the light of budgetary constraints - with which everyone is familiar - the sector has to be more market-oriented.
An even more important point is that, following the Berlin decisions, no new money is envisaged for the promotion of new products.
Such new products may be perfectly interesting for agriculture, but our message must be honest here: the overriding objective with innovations of this kind has to be profitability.
The Commission has carefully examined Parliament' s amendments.
Many of them are acceptable to us, at least in essence; others are not acceptable in their current form but prompt further reflection.
Then there are others which, I am afraid, we cannot accept.
I now turn to the first proposal on including flax and hemp grown for fibre in the arable crops regulation.
I am prepared to accept Amendment No 2, which concerns the formulation of the objectives, and Amendment No 1, at least in spirit.
The idea of doubling aid per hectare when proof is provided that the straw has been processed into fibres seems, at first sight, to be very tempting, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
However, in my opinion, it is doomed to failure.
This is because, by introducing it, we would de facto be creating first and foremost fresh incentives for renewed subsidy-hunting, and ultimately we would again have to rely on controls which have hitherto already proved to be insufficiently effective.
Consequently, I do not agree with Amendments Nos 3, 9, 10 and 12 nor, for similar reasons, with Amendment No 38.
In Amendment No 4, however, fears about the rules on land eligibility are expressed which were addressed in particular by Messrs Adam and Wyn.
I agree with them that we need a sensible solution here, and that is why I can agree in principle to Amendment No 4.
The same goes for Amendment No 37 which is along the same lines.
Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 15, regarding derogations from the provisions for arable crops in respect of surface area and set-aside, are acceptable to the extent that they are in line with the agreement on Agenda 2000, but only within this framework.
In my opinion, they are actually no longer necessary because there is land all over the place within the surface area on which flax and hemp can be grown without limiting the amount of other crops that are cultivated.
Nevertheless, problems could arise in some areas.
We will try to find a solution here, so as to reduce the possible constraints which might arise.
I can accept Amendment No 6 on hemp.
However, irregular plots cannot simply stop being subject to checks altogether, as is recommended, at least implicitly, in Amendments Nos 5 and 16 and I cannot therefore agree to these amendments.
There could be room for a certain amount of flexibility, however, where it is a question of achieving high control levels.
That is why I can state my agreement with these amendments and with Amendment No 14 at least in this respect.
It is because of the risks for the image of hemp that the Commission is proposing a ban on hemp and hempseed being used in food, despite the fact that the varieties which have to be used in Europe do not contain any psychotropic substances.
This is a highly political issue which we can certainly discuss further.
However, at the present time, I do not wish to agree to Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 32.
But the actual objective is clear.
I now come to the second proposal, on the regulation on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre.
Processing aid has to be in reasonable proportion to production costs and take account of the market value of the products.
It is a fact that processing long-flax fibres entails higher costs.
A distinction must therefore be drawn between processing aid for long-flax fibres and aid for short-flax fibres and hemp fibre.
Maximum permitted impurity levels also need to be fixed because the aid is intended to promote the production of high-quality fibre and not of the waste entailed in fibre production.
Our policy for the sector has to be unambiguous.
We can only accept investment in products which are profitable under market conditions.
This principle also applies here.
That is why I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 18 and 34, even though they definitely contain further food for thought.
I do agree, however, with the ideas underlying Amendments Nos 23, 25 and 26, that is to bring the aid payable for long and short fibres more closely into line and to make the granting of aid dependent on the result of checks.
Nevertheless, the limits given in the budget cannot be exceeded.
The second important subject is the national guaranteed quantities.
In view of the well-known difficulties with checking harvest results, these are absolutely indispensable.
The Commission proposal mitigates the risk of abuse at the processing stage without quotas having to be set for the individual processing plants, and thus without the disadvantages which quotas of this kind would have on an expanding market.
A maximum guaranteed quantity for the whole Community would not be a solution.
Experience shows that this only leads to disputes between Member States and makes it more difficult to find a real solution.
Dividing the maximum guaranteed quantity between the Member States annually, on the basis of processing capacity - which cannot be verified - is not really a practicable alternative.
That is why I cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 21, 27 to 30 and 35.
But the idea of introducing a kind of newcomer quota and dividing this each year between those Member States where there is only very little flax and hemp production at the present time, or none at all, is, I believe, definitely worth exploring.
I can accept Amendments Nos 24 and 33 for those instances when the farmer and the primary processor are one and the same person.
As far as the import of hemp and hempseed is concerned, I agree that we need a practicable solution.
However, I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 22 and 31 in their current form because they implicitly say that no further controls need to be carried out.
Turning, in conclusion, to the timetable, I am also prepared to accept Amendments Nos 17 and 36, in accordance with which the new rules would only enter into force on 1 July 2001.
But this would mean that the aid per hectare for the next marketing year would have to be set this year in accordance with the system currently in force.
In this case, I would be bound by the figures in the 2001 budget.
A reform of this sector is absolutely essential!
I think that you agree with me on this.
We need to make the fibre flax and hemp sector more market-oriented so that it is able to make an effective, indisputable and useful contribution to the economy and is no longer the target of public criticism.
Under these circumstances, I would have thought that you would have attached great importance to adopting the resolution this week, so that the Council can also take a decision as soon as possible.
In this way we can avoid the market disruption which would ensue in the 2000/2001 financial year if the level of the aid was not settled by 1 August.
For all that - as I have told you - I can accept 13 of the amendments and, as regards many of the others as well, I have specifically emphasised that, although I cannot accept them as they stand at the moment, some of them definitely provide further food for thought and material for debates which I will initiate in the Council.
However, because the market really will be severely disrupted if we do not have a scheme in place in time, we would either have to adopt temporary preventive measures - which would have to take account of the initial budget estimates for 2001 - or we will have a harvest where the producers will not know what payments they can expect to receive.
We really should not allow this kind of situation to develop.
It would be simply unthinkable to have to explain to the producers and also the processors why they should have to suffer because we cannot manage to decide on a proposal which, after all, has already been on the table in this House for eight months.
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.
Commissioner, you mentioned the controls which will need to be carried out in connection with the processing premium, and these must indeed take place.
Now if you combine our proposal to double the aid per hectare when proof is furnished with the proof for the processing aid, which also has to be provided, and if you join these two things together - of course this is not elaborated upon in the report - then the controls which need to be carried out for both kinds of premium are guaranteed and farmers do not lose out.
If you implement your scheme, as proposed, you will be depriving European flax and hemp growers of land and that has nothing to do with controls.
Mr President, with your permission I should like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question.
I fully agree with you that we must not let it reach such a point that the poor farmers and processors do not know what lies in store for them or what their prospects are for the future.
That is why I should like to ask you this specific question, Commissioner: can you envisage - and I am referring here to Amendments Nos 27 and 28 and to my previous comments - that the Commission might, after all, consider rethinking its proposal on quotas and restructuring it?
Perhaps I will begin with the second question, which was asked by the rapporteur.
If I have correctly understood what this is about, you are referring first and foremost to the so-called newcomer quotas.
In this regard, I have said that we are prepared to accept a quota of this kind.
I now turn to the first question, which was asked by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
I am sorry, but what you are proposing is still based on an assumption, namely that this check is carried out.
It is simply the case that the current system is not working and that is why I believe we have no choice but to change it.
And so I do not want us to turn the system completely on its head.
If we go back partly to the old system again then I do not see how we can make it work and why it should work any better than it has in the past.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Civil liability and motor vehicles
The next item is the report (A5-0130/2000) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, adopted by the Conciliation Committee, on a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and amending Directives 73/239/EEC and 88/357/EEC (Fourth Motor Insurance Directive) (C5-0111/2000 - 1997/0264(COD)).
Mr President, I must, and can, be brief.
This week we are able, for the first time, to adopt a European Union legislative act which has been drawn up on the initiative of the European Parliament and on which, thank God, the Commission and the Council have cooperated positively.
It is about improved protection for accident victims in the European Union.
This directive resolves a large number of the problems which usually arise when people are involved in an accident in another country.
First of all, however, and before looking back, I wish to take a look into the future.
Commissioner Bolkestein, a draft fifth directive already exists.
I have drawn it up and it will soon be put before Parliament.
I very much hope that we will also be able to cooperate closely on this issue.
The fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline.
At the beginning of June - this is also part of our glance into the future - we will be holding a conference at the Academy of European Law in Trier on another important issue, the reform of personal injury, and this may give rise to a further parliamentary initiative.
As you can see, we wish this debate on improved protection for accident victims to gain a certain momentum.
I would be very grateful to you in particular, Commissioner, if we could achieve this together.
I would be grateful to you because you made an important contribution - and this is where I start to look back - to the debate on the fourth directive.
You see there was the major problem of deciding whether this directive ought to apply when the accident had taken place in a Member State of the European Union.
I have never understood why the Commission initially fought against this so stubbornly; its stance could not be justified from a logical, political or legal point of view.
Then, thankfully, when we discussed this in Parliament at the end of last year, you prepared the ground for us to make this possible.
This directive will now apply in all countries which are members of the green card system, meaning that approximately 90% of all accidents in which Europeans might be involved will be covered.
And while I am on the subject of figures, we are talking about approximately 500 000 accidents a year in the European Union alone - not counting third countries - where we will be able to settle claims much more easily in the future.
In the past there was the problem that people had to cope with a foreign language, foreign laws and so on. Sometimes the process dragged on for ages.
When I look at the petitions which have been sent to the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle, I am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward.
Obviously, we cannot in any way change either the law which has to be applied or the legal jurisdiction, but by now proposing a system whereby each insurer has a claims representative in every other country, we will probably be able, as far as the accident victim is concerned, satisfactorily to settle the claims arising from 90% of all traffic accidents which take place in another country.
That is a very big step forward.
When we debated this, some questions were still open.
I did, and I would just mention this point, rather regret the fact that the compensation bodies - and these were, after all, the Commission' s idea - were gradually watered down during the political consultation process.
Nevertheless, at the end of the day, we did find a solution which is satisfactory, but in three to four years' time we will review what this directive has achieved and, if necessary, propose improvements.
In conclusion, I should like to say that thanks to your intervening, Commissioner, important progress has been made on this directive, and I should specifically like to thank you for that.
You overcame resistance from within your own Commission.
This was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it.
I hope that, where the protection of accident victims and its improvement is concerned, we will also enjoy fruitful cooperation in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Rothley for his work, for this measure will put an end to a series of worrying and embarrassing situations which have arisen in our Community.
The joint draft adopted by the Conciliation Committee certainly represents great progress for our Community.
Nevertheless, although I will vote for the motion, I have to say that I am very perplexed by the response I have received from the Commission to my question on an issue which is not completely related to the question of accidents which take place abroad but which nevertheless concerns the insurance sector, a sector in which, as far as I am concerned, in Italy, truly unimaginable events occur, which leads me to suspect that Parliament' s inspection system is, indeed, defunct.
I tabled a question to the Commission, calling upon them to do something about the genuinely appalling issue of those insurance companies which set high premiums and then do not pay citizens from certain parts of the Community what they are entitled to.
A conference, sponsored by the 'Automobile Club d' Italia', was held in Naples and attended by leading lawyers, because insurance companies, as was also the case in the past, are making Italian citizens pay different premiums according to where they live, claiming that they have to recoup their costs in the areas where there are a greater number of accidents.
So I wonder, and I put the question to Parliament, whether this could be an example of blatant discrimination among the citizens of a single State and among citizens of the European Community.
Although it is true that in certain areas a decidedly larger number of accidents is recorded, it is also true that, when people belong to the same state and the same Community, events are shared by citizens who live in the same district, the same area, the same country and the same Community.
With regard to the payment of premiums, absolutely incredible, unbelievable things happen: in a town such as Alexandria, for example, premiums are less than half the level of those in a town such as Naples or Catania.
Therefore, I feel that, like Parliament, in addition to developing this type of measure, such as that presented in the Rothley report, we should endeavour to take further steps to avoid blatant discrimination against citizens of the same country, and also extend an invitation to the insurance companies: while it is mandatory to be insured, it is also mandatory for the insurance companies to insure the citizens.
In certain regions of Italy, the fact is that insurance companies refuse to insure the Italian citizens, which is an extremely serious offence.
In this regard, I would like to repeat the question I tabled, to which the Commission replied that the European Parliament has no competence in this sector.
Nevertheless, although we are competent when it comes to regulating the matter, as the Rothley report is doing in relations between the different Member States, I feel that we ought to challenge the insurance companies to avoid blatant discrimination, to set the same premiums for all, to pay claimants what they are actually entitled to and to ensure that this sector is improved, or adapted in some way to the changing requirements of our society.
In making these statements, I would like to declare that I particularly support this report and, once again, I thank Mr Rothley and the Commission for their endeavours on behalf of our citizens.
I urge them to take action to resolve this matter as soon as possible.
Mr President, I wish to express the heartfelt thanks of the Commission to Mr Rothley, the rapporteur, who has had a considerable intellectual and political input into this fourth motor insurance directive.
Mr Rothley was extremely kind in thanking the Commission for what it has done.
The Commission has perhaps been constructive in the formulation of this fourth motor insurance directive. However, as Mr Rothley said, it was in response to an initiative from the European Parliament.
The Commission is duly thankful to him for that initiative.
I wish to say that the Commission welcomes the adoption of this fourth motor insurance directive by Parliament.
As Mr Rothley pointed out, every year there are more than 500 000 car accidents involving vehicles from different Member States.
However, the current system of compensation for people involved in an accident outside their home country does not work satisfactorily.
The new directive will provide for improved information, easier procedures and quicker settlement of claims, and these are things which concern the citizens of all our Member States most directly.
This is also a measure which will bring the European Union closer to the citizens of the Union.
As I have just said, the Commission's proposal was a response to a parliamentary resolution in which Parliament made use of its new powers under Article 192 of the Treaty on European Union.
I should again like to thank Parliament explicitly and, of course, Mr Rothley, but also the competent committee and its chairperson, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, for the constructive discussions in the first and second readings of the directive and the subsequent negotiations in the course of informal trialogues.
Mr Rothley has announced a fifth directive.
He said that there will shortly be a conference in Trier on that directive and he has asked the Commission to help steer it through its legislative process.
Perhaps it is a bit early to discuss the fifth directive now but I should like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Rothley that in any further legislative work in which this Parliament would like to engage, the Commission will take the same constructive attitude as it took with the fourth directive.
Lastly, Mr Bigliardo draws attention to the fact that the premia for motor vehicle insurance in Italy vary from region to region, according to the number of accidents.
He objects to that differentiation in premia according to the frequency of accidents in the various parts of Italy and he would like the Commission to intervene.
I have to tell Mr Bigliardo that this is a matter which does not concern this directive.
Strictly speaking, I could end my response there but his comments deserve a fuller answer.
Therefore, I should like to say that if the situation had been that motor insurance premia were different for Italian citizens as compared with French or German citizens living in Italy, the Commission would be able to object.
You cannot ask French or German citizens living in Italy to pay a different premium from Italian citizens.
That is a clear case of discrimination.
But that is not the case.
The premia differ according to the number of accidents in each region and are therefore the same for Italians and non-Italians.
They relate to the different areas of Italy.
I do not think that the Commission can intervene on that point.
It is a matter of how insurance companies calculate their premia, and if there are objective reasons for charging a higher premium for a particular region then the Commission is powerless.
If Mr Bigliardo would like to substantiate his claim in more detail, I should be pleased to receive his letter and answer it. But if he would like a straightforward answer now, then it has to be that the Commission cannot intervene.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Development cooperation with South Africa
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0114/2000) by Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on development cooperation with South Africa (C5-0100/2000 - 1999/0070(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago the Committee on Development and Cooperation unanimously approved the recommendation which is today being considered by Parliament.
It had previously made a considerable effort to speed up and rationalise the negotiation of the issue, believing that voting on the new European Parliament and Council regulation on development cooperation with South Africa was an important and urgent matter.
It was important because South Africa is one of the countries which receives the most funding from the European Union for its development process.
It was urgent because the regulation which forms the basis of this cooperation and which has been in force for five years expired on 31 December 1999, from which date the different procedures in operation were left without a proper legal basis.
It is very worrying that we should find ourselves in such a situation.
In fact, in the first six months of 1999, our Parliament considered the first text proposed by the Commission, adopting six amendments and forwarding them to the Council for their consideration.
This is where the delay occurred, since the Council took no less than eight months to present their position to us.
This took us past the expiry date and led us to the legal vacuum which I just mentioned.
The Council finally presented its proposal.
Their text adopted most of the amendments which Parliament had approved on first reading and, in particular, the Council put considerably more emphasis on the references to combating poverty and achieving the international development objectives, agreed on the basis of United Nations conventions and resolutions.
Having examined the Council' s proposal, the Committee on Development and Cooperation considered it necessary to try to prevent the negotiation being prolonged by a third reading.
In other words, we intended to accept everything that seemed reasonable and limit our amendments to things which were absolutely essential, and even then in a spirit of great moderation.
There only remained two questions which appear in the amendments and which, in the form of a recommendation, our committee is submitting to the plenary.
The first question refers to commitology.
The Council wanted the Committee of Experts to control all cooperation projects relating to South Africa with a budget of over EUR 3 million.
However, we believed that this committee should guide and monitor the broad approaches to development cooperation with South Africa and only directly control larger projects, leaving the smaller ones to the normal procedures, which are the Commission' s responsibility.
Having considered all the main issues, the amendment we are presenting today finally raises the Council' s proposal from 3 to 5 million, and this committee, whose members represent the various Member States, will therefore have fewer projects to deal with and will therefore be able to concentrate more on a global view of such an important field of action.
The second proposal concerns the budgetary framework for development cooperation between the European Union and South Africa for the 7-year period, including 2000, which is referred to in the regulation under discussion.
During the previous five years the budgetary framework had been EUR 125 million per year.
The Council, with a view to budgetary restriction, decreased that allocation in its proposal and set it at EUR 112.5 million per year.
For our part, while we are signing an important Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement with South Africa, it does not seem politically acceptable to send a message of financial cuts.
On the contrary, we should at least maintain and, where possible, increase these contributions, if only as a token gesture, although we share the concern with regard to the available resources.
Finally, the proposal approved by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I am speaking, was extremely reasonable: the EUR 123.5 million already allocated for 2000 and the EUR 127 million for each of the subsequent six years, amounting to a budgetary framework of EUR 885.5 million for the seven years laid down in the regulation.
Both amendments seem well-considered.
The aim is to avoid a third reading, put an end to the current intolerable legal vacuum and provide significant political impetus to our development cooperation with South Africa.
By asking you to support our proposals, we hope that the common sense and moderation which Parliament is showing will be understood by the Council.
We also hope that these proposals are acceptable to the Commission, despite the fact that theirs - 25 million for the commitology question and 850.5 million for the budgetary framework - are somewhat different to the ones that we are presenting.
If we are not understood, it will be entirely down to the Council or the Commission that we become involved in a third reading, with the consequences which the lack of a proper legal basis may have on the projects in operation in our development cooperation with South Africa.
The figure for the budgetary framework suggested by the Commission, which is very close to our own proposal, should in any event have arrived at the Committee on Development and Cooperation on time, so that Parliament could have approved it and above all with the certainty that, in the event that we had adopted it, the Council would also have accepted it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report under discussion here on the Union's development cooperation with South Africa, on which I particularly congratulate the rapporteur, is, leaving aside its content, a striking example of the Council's delaying tactics towards the European Parliament.
This is actually an unproblematic regulation and also, in fact, an unproblematic report.
That the Union should support development cooperation with South Africa, bearing in mind that it is one of the more successful countries on the subcontinent, has never been called into question.
This is therefore predominantly about renewing the legal base for this cooperation, as the preceding regulation expired in December 1999.
Our former fellow-MEP, Mr Fassa, presented the report for its first reading in Parliament in May of last year.
The Council accepted nearly all of the amendments.
Nevertheless, I do wonder why the Council's common position was officially only sent to Parliament in March of this year.
Of course, the rapporteur also referred to this.
Delays of this kind, which might perhaps be explained by the trade agreement being negotiated in parallel, never fail, however, to amaze me.
No doubt people in South Africa itself are also asking themselves what conclusions they should draw from the Council's behaviour.
This is why I should specifically like to thank the rapporteur for making it possible, thanks to the fast-track procedure, for this report to be on the plenary agenda now, as early as May, thus allowing us to avoid any potential problems caused by a lack of legal bases in our development cooperation.
As far as the content is concerned, some areas of uncertainty had been clarified in preliminary informal consultations with the Council, which meant that this report could restrict itself to two points, the first of which is increasing the total budget to EUR 885.5 million for the period for 2000-2006, a customary parliamentary request and a necessary one.
Secondly, the threshold of EUR 5 million, which has now been settled on, constitutes a good compromise in my view.
Small projects can be planned and implemented efficiently by the institutions and organisations on the ground.
The limit of EUR 5 million gives sufficient room for manoeuvre.
In making these efforts, the rapporteur has, for his part, done everything within his power to present a proper report on the regulation.
I very much hope that we will indeed still be able to avoid the danger of a third reading, Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez.
For the time being I offer you my warmest congratulations on this.
The full significance of this report is, however, only appreciated when it is seen in the context of the other efforts being made to intensify cooperation with South Africa, first and foremost the trade agreement already mentioned.
The Union continues to attach great importance to stable development in South Africa, not only for the sake of the people there, but also because this is in the interests of the development of its neighbours north of the Limpopo.
The South Africans have already managed to put an end to legal discrimination against the majority of the population and to hold democratic elections.
Today it is a question of anchoring the rule of law more firmly in the State.
All sections of the population and all civil servants must feel a duty primarily to this State, which is under the rule of law and no longer, as they did in the past, only to their own section of the population or even to their personal associates of whom they need to take care.
From a political point of view, the Union' s adoption of this new regulation is not only an acknowledgement of the results achieved by the reform process hitherto.
It comes with definite expectations for the future, including securing law and order in all parts of the country.
I read with concern reports about the misuse of tax revenue at provincial level.
I hear with unease that corruption is also gaining ground in the police force, and that in rural areas and in townships there are police no-go areas where the poorest of the poor are left at the mercy of gangs.
Conversely, those who have something to lose wall themselves in and for their own security hire those who previously had professional roles in the army and the police.
Thus a two-tier society again emerges, and, what is more, this is in the sensitive area of internal security.
Since law and order were de facto suspended in neighbouring Zimbabwe, the morale on commercial farms south of the Limpopo has hit rock bottom.
This illustrates another decisive expectation which we have of South Africa: to set an example and be a stabilising influence on its neighbours to the north.
I expect the South African Government to take on its regional responsibilities. President Mbeki should adopt just as clear a stance as has the former President, Mr Mandela - whom we all hold in high esteem - on the events in Zimbabwe.
Standing by and letting it happen or talking up the situation helps neither the farmers nor the hundreds of thousands in Zimbabwe who are dependent on the farms for a functioning infrastructure.
Food, housing, and sometimes clinics and schools are made available to farm workers and their families.
The situation is similar in large areas of South Africa.
Obviously these are not exemplary structures, but before they are abandoned we have to ensure that those who ought to be benefiting from them receive something better in their place.
South Africa must now, in its own interests too, exert massive influence on Mugabe; otherwise it too will soon be threatened by waves of starving refugees if seed cannot be sown on the farms there now.
In its own country, not only would the rand come under increasing pressure, but the faith in the government shown by important sections of the population who would normally supply the nation's food would be severely shaken.
This cannot be in the interests of South Africa and it cannot be in our interests either!
By adopting this regulation, the Union is showing that it still backs the economic, political and societal reform process in South Africa.
The South African Government needs all sections of society to have lasting confidence in the development of the country.
I hope that this expectation too will be taken seriously in Pretoria.
The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the report.
Mr President, I also warmly congratulate the rapporteur who has shown enormous commitment to this report.
We thank you very much for it.
We are clearly in a very serious situation.
The regulation for South Africa expired on 31 December 1999.
It is clear, as the rapporteur has suggested, that we need to proceed with some urgency in order to provide a legal base for our essential work in South Africa.
This budget line is the work of the European Parliament.
I was the budget rapporteur in 1994 when the Development Committee established the line.
That was because we wanted to see practical and tangible assistance for South Africa's peaceful transition to a free and democratic country.
Surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history.
Now the Republic, with its new President Mr Thabo Mbeki, faces new challenges which, in my view, require sustained partnership with the European Union.
This is not the time, as others have suggested, to have the kind of mean-spirited delays that we have seen from the Council; neither is it the time for political point-scoring by other institutions of the European Union.
Indeed, it is my view that the Council has rather cynically orchestrated the eight-month delay in response to the first reading in order that it could better manage its negotiations on the South Africa trade and development agreements.
This has put life-saving programmes at risk and any delay now would exacerbate the existing impression in South Africa of a European Union which seeks only to serve its own interests first.
Coming as this does after ouzo and grappa, we are in danger of sending a very bad signal to South Africa.
Decisions need to be made.
We cannot risk delay.
For example, I am very familiar with the South African Human Rights Foundation. That would be endangered.
The Foundation for Cultural Initiatives programme, the South Africa Labour Development Trust, policing in the Eastern Cape - all these programmes would be very seriously threatened by delays.
If there is delay, if agreement is not reached on the regulation, then new programmes will be affected too.
Even the 2000 budget of EUR 1.54 million would not be committed.
Let us be clear what we are talking about.
We are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas.
We would endanger the SADC HIV/Aids Programme, regarded by all as being one of the most efficient the European Union operates.
We risk jeopardising economic developments in the Eastern Cape and work in the Eastern Cape with the Ministry of Education.
We risk jeopardising support for social housing programmes in South Africa.
In this Parliament we have to make every effort now, as the rapporteur has said, to make it possible for this money to move as speedily and as efficiently as it can to the people of South Africa.
The European Parliament position is, and always has been, realistic and morally right.
However I must express my grave concern about the possible misery which would be caused were we to delay.
As usual we should make it very clear that we in the Development Committee regard the budget figure that we have here before us, as purely indicative.
We see it as a reference point only, not as anything that we will not seek to change when it comes to our committee.
It is the first year of the South Africa Trade Agreement.
How does it look in our first year if we do not fully commit the funding and meet our obligations?
We must continue our commitment to supporting South African efforts to overcome the legacy of apartheid.
To do that we have to have a regulation sooner rather than later.
I hope that after we have heard the Commissioner we will have the opportunity to discuss his views further and to discuss the very deeply worrying issues which delay on this regulation raises.
Mr President, apartheid in South Africa may have been abolished but it has not yet disappeared.
For example, the disparities in income between the population groups are still shocking and deprived areas in terms of housing, education and health care have not caught up by a long way.
Frustration is mounting, as is evident from the unprecedented crime rate and outrageous violence both indoors and outdoors.
They may want to escape their past, but they are compromising their own future in the process.
The key goal of development strategy should therefore be to correct the imbalance in growth created by apartheid.
If not, that country will not be able to enjoy stability, will deter foreign investors and will remain poor when it could be rich.
Needless to say, it is South Africa first and foremost that has to set its own house in order, but Europe can and must make a substantial contribution to the development process.
We therefore lend our support to the cooperation agreement, on the basis of the EUR 885.5 million, as proposed by our excellent rapporteur.
The Council has sat on the regulation for far too long.
All the signs are there that its association with the negotiations regarding the trade agreement was spurious.
The involvement of the Member States via the committee should focus more on the strategy and the indicative programme rather than on the individual projects.
A maximum of 5 million seems very reasonable to me.
This does not, however, relieve the European Union of its task of monitoring all projects well, down to the tiniest, and to evaluate them at regular intervals.
The Commission delegation must be sufficiently equipped to be able to do this independently and to a professional standard.
Mr President, South Africa has enormous potential.
There is so much there which so few have enjoyed.
Economic growth is a necessary but not an adequate condition for development.
What is needed is for resources to be better distributed and correctly allocated to meet all social needs.
The apartheid regime has been abolished, all that is left to tackle now is apartheid itself.
Mr President, I would like to start by adding my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur.
I strongly support his aim of getting this regulation brought into force as quickly as possible with no third reading.
The rapporteur has been very generous in his interpretation of the Council's inexplicable 8-month delay in responding to Parliament's six amendments during the first reading.
If there were any evidence that the Council was deliberately holding back this regulation to give it greater leverage during the negotiations of the broader trade and development cooperation agreement, that indeed would be extremely worrying.
To come to the substance of the issue, on the budget it is completely unacceptable that the EU should be offering a budget cut in comparison to former years, particularly at this moment in our relationship with South Africa.
There is a very real risk of this triggering an even greater loss of faith by South Africa in the EU.
Let us not forget that this follows hard on the heels of the protracted and frequently bitter negotiations of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement where the EU acted very dismally indeed.
On numerous occasions, it was EU reluctance to improve access for South African agricultural goods which nearly blocked the whole deal and to follow this up with yet another dishonourable act would be extremely unfortunate.
Perhaps there is an image abroad that South Africa is an increasingly developed country and does not really need these funds.
Let us not forget that in spite of the great leaps forward that South Africa has taken, the life of many South Africans is still one of extreme poverty without work or land or a decent home.
An estimated 42% of black South Africans are jobless as compared with just 4% of whites.
A quarter of schools have no water within walking distance.
Half of South African households are classed as poor.
65% of adult South Africans are illiterate and 10 million South Africans live in informal shacks or on land they neither own nor rent.
Let us not forget either that the Commission and Council turned down the idea of a separate new financial instrument to give support to neighbouring countries which need to adjust themselves to the new framework resulting from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
I am not as reassured on this point as the rapporteur and I would have preferred to see a separate budget line which could have been seen and monitored more easily.
It is quite clear that substantial funds are going to be needed to ease these countries' transition.
The loss of customs duty alone is extremely high in some cases.
In Swaziland for example, this accounts for up to 40% of all government revenue.
In spite of its own challenges, South Africa is already demonstrating its commitment to support its neighbours in the region.
For example, in its agreement to a highly asymmetrical liberalisation agreement with the other SADC countries which will benefit those countries.
The European Union needs the same generosity of spirit.
It should honour its initial financial pledges to South Africa and provide significant support to the neighbouring countries during their transition period.
Mr President, it has taken a year, but we have finally reached the point where we can discuss the regulation on development cooperation with South Africa at second reading.
This is not a day too soon, because the European Programme for the Reconstruction and Development of South Africa has been without a legal basis since late 1999.
In the light of this, the continuity of the development connection has been in the balance.
Accordingly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the drive he has displayed in dealing with this subject matter.
I share his criticism regarding the eight months which the Council deemed necessary to formulate its position.
He is right in claiming that a distinction must be drawn between this regulation and the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between Europe and South Africa.
Although development cooperation and trade are very much interrelated, they should not be played off against each other.
The deliberate delay in approving these regulations would seem to suggest that there is little real involvement with South Africa.
This is irrespective of how fair the European negotiating position is in terms of trade.
Moreover, such a stance does not fit in with the Commission' s strategy in terms of South Africa which it has outlined in its 2000-2002 Country Strategy.
This document addresses both the fight against poverty and improvement in infrastructure.
I did wonder, however, why it only mentions the European Union' s development instrument in passing.
Would the Commission be able to answer that?
I would also like to know from the Commission to what extent South Africa' s qualified LomÃ© membership overlaps with the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development.
I am, by the way, very grateful to the Commission for the large amount of information on South Africa which is available on the Internet and which has been laid out in a readily understood format.
This is an example to draw on when it comes to determining the strategy for other countries!
I would like to finish off with just one remark for the rapporteur.
I can imagine that he is intent on keeping the EUR 910 million budget for development cooperation with South Africa.
I, however, attach less importance to this, given the limited financial resources for foreign policy and the major challenges in other parts of the world.
What counts is the quality of cooperation with South Africa, which, in my opinion, is sound at present, particularly on account of the regional projects which have been financed over the past couple of years.
This is why South Africa' s neighbouring countries can also benefit from European development projects.
It seems that coherence and consistency are gradually gaining ground in the EU' s development policy.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur not only for the work he has put in to produce this report but also for the rather unique way he has had to handle the situation that the Development Committee and Parliament found itself in.
It is perhaps a sad indictment on the European institutions that, five months after the expiry date of the legal base to this Council regulation, it has only now come before Parliament, thanks, as the rapporteur and almost every other speaker has said, to an 8-month delay by the Council in responding to Parliament's first reading.
Surely we cannot continue to work in this way.
It is interesting to note that half this report is taken up by the procedural points the rapporteur has had to work his way through.
Now it has returned to us it is particularly pleasing that the Council has adopted the thrust of most of our amendments.
Most welcome is the fact that the Council has made poverty alleviation a top priority.
This should strengthen the partnership between South Africa and Europe.
I have just spent a week in South Africa and there is much appreciation for all that the EU is doing to stabilise their fragile democracy.
Only by rapidly improving living standards, particularly in health, education and employment, will stability remain.
There was much resentment against some nation states at the hold-ups there had been over the new trade agreement with particular reference to spirit names.
We are doing much for South Africa and I hope, in return, President Mbeki will work for peace in the region, with particular reference to Zimbabwe.
The implication in the rapporteur's report that this regulation may have been delayed because it was being used as a bargaining chip is very worrying.
The Commission might like to comment on this particular point.
I would also like to hear from the Commission on how we can streamline the system.
In the last session in Strasbourg we had another regulation that had also run out last December and this should not happen.
I must strongly support the rapporteur and his suggestions that the Commission should be tackling the issues of major topics, such as the importance and the overall impact of the programme in relation to the agreed objectives rather than individual programmes.
I would also like to see delegate offices strengthened with more and better staff to be able to cope more efficiently with monitoring and evaluations.
This regulation is bound to have an impact on neighbouring states and I hope the Commission will take this into consideration.
The rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future.
My group supports this regulation but asks for a speedy conclusion to the vacuum we are in.
We would not like to see any disagreement on budget amounts hold up ratification.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years South Africa has made a historic leap forward by abolishing the apartheid system and establishing a new political order based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and democracy.
If the people of South Africa have regained their freedom, this is, of course, for the most part thanks to their persistence and courage, as well as to that of their leaders, but also, it must be said, to the political and financial support provided by European Union Member States for the reform process in South Africa.
Quite clearly, the cooperation agreement signed on 10 October 1994 was a strong message that we sent this people treated so badly by history.
I must confess that the slow progress in Council negotiations for its renewal leaves me rather puzzled.
Our duty to show this country legitimate solidarity must not and cannot be sacrificed on the altar of national trading interests.
On the trade agreement, which, need I remind you, we endorsed by a large majority in this very Chamber last October, we must avoid disagreements which obstruct the adoption of this cooperation regulation.
Such an attitude would be tantamount to appalling blackmail on the part of Europe and would not be true to the spirit behind the new development and cooperation agreements with the ACP countries, i.e. establishing contracts which respect the identity, culture and dignity of each partner.
With regard to the regional cooperation aspect of this regulation, I should like, in turn, to draw the Council and the Commission' s attention to the risks of economic destabilisation which may be engendered by the regulation, and even more so by the trade agreement with South Africa.
We shall have to be particular attentive to the effects that these agreements may have on the ever vulnerable balance within the Southern African Customs Union.
I am also thinking of Namibia and Swaziland, and even Lesotho and Botswana, which are a long way from receiving the same amount of aid from Europe.
I feel that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, take steps to arrive at an agreement with the authorities of these countries in order to compensate for any losses.
Finally, in conclusion, acknowledging our rapporteur for his clear-sightedness and for his talents as a negotiator, I should like to express my complete agreement with him on the need to remedy the existing legal vacuum to enable these agreements to come into force.
We must put an end, as a matter of urgency, to these long months of hesitation and delay, seen as so many negative signs by South Africa' s fledgling democracy, which expects more from Europe than narrow calculations in order to safeguard limited interests.
Mr President, I am apparently not the only one who hangs her head in shame when it comes to South Africa.
For years, we supported the fight against apartheid and welcomed the new South Africa with excitement.
In 1995, it became our key partner in development cooperation.
The fact that that country received most support from Europe was justified.
After all, South Africa had to be - and still is - the driving force behind development in Southern and Central Africa.
But it took too long for programmes to get underway and, when the date for the legal basis lapsed, we did not have a new regulation in place for our development cooperation.
In his eminent report, the rapporteur emphatically referred to the expiry date of 31 December 1999.
The Council needed no fewer than eight months to determine its position.
This was, of course, not down to fundamental differences of opinion, but, as many of the delegates have already hinted at here, because the development money was used as a means of exerting pressure to secure European trade interests and to exact a trade agreement, in which our much talked of alcoholic beverages had to be protected once again.
We are deeply ashamed about such a state of affairs, which resembles a cattle market.
There is another reason to feel ashamed.
A proportion of the money which we want to spend in the European countries to reconstruct Kosovo is being taken from the development cooperation with South Africa.
Instead of increasing the funding by 1%, in line with inflation, and reaching the amount of EUR 885.5 million, as is also suggested by our rapporteur, we will be proposing a 10% reduction.
I think this is disgraceful.
Eventually, Commissioner Schreyer proposed EUR 850 million, or 121 million annually, 5 million less to invest in the fight against poverty which we deem so important.
Mr President, Commissioner, we will naturally assent to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Cooperation and Development.
Poverty is an injustice.
We want the reconstruction of Kosovo.
We are happy to finance it, but not with money intended to combat poverty.
This is unethical.
We also support the second amendment.
It may seem less important, but I think that the resources for the procedure should be retained.
If we oblige our committee to address the individual programme points, there will be considerably less time and energy for tackling the efficiency of the programme as a whole.
This is why we give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur.
Mr President, I want first of all to thank Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez for all the hard work he has put into this regulation.
The European Parliament cannot possibly support cutting development aid to South Africa by ten per cent.
Of course, I deeply regret the fact that the Council sat on this urgent matter for eight months so that there has been no legal basis for cooperation work since the beginning of the year.
Relations between the European Union and South Africa must not be damaged.
South Africa ought to - and must - be the European Union' s greatest and best friend in Africa, for South Africa will play a quite decisive role in the whole continent' s future.
In times of large-scale conflict on the African continent, for example in Congo, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Rwanda and Algeria - not to mention the intense unrest of recent months in Zimbabwe and the hatred which President Mugabe has been stirring up there - South Africa and the country' s remarkably strong democratic institutions constitute a constructive and stabilising factor in leading Africa towards a brighter and more peaceful future.
South Africa has a vigorous constitution with a clear commitment to human rights and freedoms. The country has a constitutional court whose judgements are respected by the president.
Free elections have been held. There is freedom of the press, and the office of president was in a peaceful and orderly state when the country' s great reconciler and nation builder, Nelson Mandela, left it.
The Truth Commission, led by the Anglican bishop, Desmond Tutu, has demonstrated its willingness to strive for genuine reconciliation in South Africa.
Sweden' s prime minister called the Cairo Conference, held earlier this year between the EU and Africa, "the start of something new and great" .
A democratic and reconciled South Africa is the prerequisite for this "something new and great" , in which Africa and the countries of Europe meet on a new and equal footing and look forward, instead of remaining stuck in the old colonial period.
South Africa is a necessary engine of democracy for the whole of South Africa and for Africa in its entirety.
It can show that it is freedom, together with democratic and strong ethical and moral values, through which Africa can advance furthest.
- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is due to state its position at second reading on the regulation that forms the legal base for the general framework of cooperation between the European Union and South Africa.
In the meantime, as you will remember, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation last September on the basis of the Kinnock report, whose trade component was implemented in January of this year.
One of the fundamental components of the trade agreement concerns wines, and South Africa committed itself, under the terms of the agreement signed at the Berlin Summit in March 1999, immediately to cease using certain Community designations of origin, such as, specifically, "Port" and "Sherry" , which it had been using illegally for twelve years.
Following a few incredibly intricate episodes, successive adjournments and time-wasting manoeuvres by the South African negotiators in accepting a regulatory text for this agreement, both parties finally agreed that a new draft of the regulations for this agreement on wines, which is due to enter into force by 1 September, is to be laid down by the end of June.
I have, however, received information to the effect that the South Africans are still raising problems with regard to a draft which faithfully reflects the Berlin Agreement.
They are trying to have these wine-producing issues covered by the WTO TRIPS dossier, which the European Union feels does not adequately protect Community designations.
Furthermore, it appears to be a position that has been reached in conjunction with other New World wine-producing countries, given that the South Africans were negotiating bilateral agreements on wines with the European Union and then they suddenly changed their minds and wanted to postpone everything.
In view of these issues, I cannot agree with the rapporteur when he asks Parliament, as proof of good faith, to approve this framework regulation as a matter of urgency, without linking it to the trade aspect of the General Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation.
I do not agree because all the European Union' s behaviour up until now has been nothing but a huge demonstration of good faith, to the extent that, contrary to what had previously been laid down, we accepted the commercial implementation of the agreement without the regulations for the agreement on wines being established.
The time has come to say enough is enough!
Cooperation requires a positive attitude of good faith and responsibility on the part of both cooperating parties.
As this has not been the case, I cannot, in all conscience, support the rapporteur' s position.
Mr President, the Commission is appreciative of the rapporteur's excellent work and welcomes the recommendation on the Council common position which reflects Parliament's commitment to assist the new South Africa.
We too are worried about the delays in the adoption of the regulation and share the view that quick adoption of the regulation on the European programme for reconstruction and development is now becoming essential and critical.
It would be a signal to South Africa of our dedication to the effective entry into force of the agreement on trade development and cooperation and would prevent new tensions arising around issues still to be discussed concerning wines and spirits or fisheries.
If, however, the Community is unable to adopt the regulation in time, our development programme for this year will be jeopardised and confidence undermined.
We also totally share the rapporteur's view that the Council common position contains useful improvements to the Commission's proposal.
However, on commitology and the financial framework, we also consider that the common position is inadequate and cannot be followed.
Indeed, as regards Amendment No 1, on Article 8(5) and (6) on commitology, your proposal for a EUR 5m threshold is, to be frank, somewhat disappointing compared to the level of EUR 25m we had proposed.
We proposed such a level in order to use the committed resources in a more efficient and useful way and to deal with strategic issues rather than the details of individual projects.
But in the South Africa case, we are ready to accept the EUR 5m threshold simply in order not to delay a decision.
It appears from our programming discussions with the South African Government that we will have a limited number of major sectoral programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the Member States.
The EUR 5m level gives us enough room to proceed quickly with some small projects, for instance preparatory actions or pilot operations.
But we definitely need to make clear that no precedent should be created for the Council to impose low commitology thresholds.
I should like to retain the possibility of increasing this threshold for the South Africa budget line in the future, if need be.
Regarding Amendment No 2, Article 10(1) on the financial framework: the Commission has been aware on the one hand of the need to respect the political commitment in the trade and development cooperation agreement to maintain assistance to South Africa but, on the other hand, we have to take into account the very difficult budgetary situation caused by the new commitments made for assistance in the Balkans.
As a result, the Commission has agreed on the necessary budget adjustments to accommodate new needs.
This exercise has been very complex: it has required a very sensitive balancing of the political priorities across the EU's regional programmes.
But we envisage stabilisation for South Africa at the average level of around EUR 122m per annum, with a global figure of some EUR 850.5m in the period 2000-2006.
This is below your proposal of EUR 885.5m but it is significantly higher than the EUR 787.5m the Council proposed.
The South African programme is in fact one of the least affected by the proposed changes within heading IV and the adjustment will not affect the nature and scope of the programme as envisaged.
I understand your determination not to reduce the financial amounts for development aid to South Africa.
However, I find it absolutely necessary that the regulation is adopted in time to ensure uninterrupted implementation of activities in South Africa.
This situation is indeed very critical and not a normal, routine situation - but unfortunately it is what we are facing - and I feel an obligation to do my utmost to secure agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the proposed approach.
I am therefore anxious both to discuss the matter again with the Committee on Development and Cooperation in Parliament and before that to seek a response from the Member States.
Bearing that in mind, I should welcome it if Parliament would consider whether the vote on Amendment No 2 could be postponed so that these discussions can take place.
This is the safest way to reduce the risk of a much more serious and longer delay threatening the credibility of our cooperation with South Africa.
Mr President, you have heard the Commissioner' s request that the vote be delayed, that is, that it should not take place tomorrow.
I must say that this situation disturbs me, because we are all working very quickly and the Commission seems to be saying that, since we are in a hurry, we must drive the car very slowly.
On principle, I am always willing to discuss issues again.
Firstly, I must thank the spokespeople of the different Groups for their support, although I believe that they are lending their support to a very modest position by the committee, almost a critical type of support, because the Committee on Development and Cooperation should have gone much further than it decided.
I repeat: in principle, I would not be opposed, but I do not believe that Parliament is in favour of delaying the vote.
I do not feel at the moment that Parliament wishes to delay the vote.
That would mean inviting the Commissioner to the Committee on Development next week and postponing our decision until June.
I would not be opposed to that and I do not reject that possibility.
But I must say, Mr President, that it worries me profoundly that Parliament should have to take responsibility for prolonging something which, in fact, has been prolonged by all parties. Everyone has prolonged this process: the Council and the Commission.
Now the pressure is on Parliament because we have been told that, if we do not accept the positions of the Council and of the Commission, the development programmes will come to a standstill, which would be terrible.
I agree that it would be terrible if the cooperation programmes came to a standstill. However, Mr President, we should take note of who is being pressurised and who really bears the responsibility for prolonging this process and taking it to a third reading.
Therefore, Mr President, I would ask you to examine whether it would be proper to consult Parliament tomorrow on whether or not to vote on our positions.
If we do vote on them tomorrow, it will fall to the Council and the Commission to ensure that the situation is not prolonged, which would create serious difficulties for South Africa and our own dignity.
We must ask ourselves whether we are here solely to accept, at any time and under any kind of pressure, what the Council or the Commission proposes.
If that is the case, then Parliament is unnecessary and all our dignity as an institution has been lost.
I am therefore not opposed to the vote being delayed for another month.
I believe that it would be very dangerous to prolong this process, but, in any event, we must not take responsibility.
The responsibility falls to those people who have dragged it out until now and who seem to want it to last even longer, perhaps because the issue of the designations of origin of wines and alcoholic drinks is being negotiated.
There has been a misunderstanding.
The Commissioner can speak for himself but the Commission was not requesting postponement of the vote.
The Commission was simply making a point on Amendment No 2, as I understand it.
Perhaps the Commissioner would like to explain the point he was making on the amendment.
As the President said, it is perfectly correct that I am not in a position to request anything, and it would be out of line with my own feeling and understanding of the relations between the Commission and Parliament if I did so.
I said I would welcome it if a postponement of the vote were considered as a possibility.
It is totally in the hands of Parliament, as it should be.
However, I feel I have a responsibility vis-Ã -vis Parliament to make it totally clear that I see a real danger of this ending up in a long, difficult postponement - something that will create delays in our current activities in South Africa.
It is simply in order to minimise that risk that I am expressing my views as I have here.
The decision is, of course, totally in Parliament's hands.
That concludes the debate.
Any motion to delay a vote would have to be put to the House immediately before the vote which will be taken at noon on Tuesday.
(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
Mr President, the Committee on Industry considers that this is an extremely important issue and should be dealt with as a matter of great urgency.
We all know the reasons why the situation affecting Montenegro is a complex one and we should not, for obvious reasons, delay this matter any further.
I therefore propose producing a simplified report so that we can vote on urgent procedure.
Mr Wynn, chairman of the Committee on Budgets, asked for an opinion, has the floor.
Mr President, we are in a strange situation because a decision was taken in the groups before the Committee on Budgets had decided on this issue of Montenegro.
Also, I have not had a chance to speak to my good friend Mr Westendorp.
I believe that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is sympathetic to the position of the Committee on Budgets, which I am about to state.
However, since I have not spoken to him directly, do not quote me on that - it is only second-hand information.
Firstly, I should like to make it clear that the Committee on Budgets supports any aid to Montenegro.
It has done so in the past and will do so in the future.
On this occasion there is no urgency for this to go through now.
The monies will not be made available until August for the first tranche and the second tranche will be paid at the end of the year.
We are of the opinion that the relevant committees need to study the details of this proposal.
Whichever the lead committee is - Foreign Affairs or Industry - we would merely give an opinion, but those committees and Parliament need to evaluate these proposals.
We should not be bounced into a decision because the Council deems it to be necessary.
As for budgets, our main concern is where the money is coming from.
It is great to make proposals but we feel this urgency should not be agreed upon until we know where the money is coming from.
We should leave it until next month.
The committees can debate it and we can vote on it at the June part-session.
Thank you Mr Wynn.
That is a very sensible opinion.
Mr Newton Dunn, vice-chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has the floor to explain his committee' s opinion.
Mr President, we have not discussed it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but my personal view is that we should not accept urgency now.
Mr President, in my opinion, this proposal has been submitted under rather strange procedural circumstances.
Despite this, as speaker on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I am of the opinion that the urgency is such that we need to take it extremely seriously.
Accordingly, regardless of the mistakes in the procedure, I have to say on behalf of my group that we would like to support this request for urgent procedure after all.
I also have a feeling that other groups in this House from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy share the same view.
It might be helpful to verify this.
Mr President, I am in favour, although I take the view that it is not quite as urgent as the Council makes out.
However, it would be an insult to the people of Montenegro if we rejected this urgency today.
Montenegro is in great danger, especially from Belgrade, and I think we should send out this signal.
However, we should wait until the Commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money.
It cannot take it away from Bosnia.
It cannot take it away from Kosovo.
It needs to tell us where it intends to find the money and if we reach a decision on this today, we must carry out an evaluation half way through and say what has happened to the money and where the second tranche is to come from.
Mr President, firstly, I am against the urgency for the reasons expounded by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
There is, in fact, no urgency because the money would be released for August.
Secondly, if we look carefully, in the line which has been applied until now, there are still EUR 20 million which have not been used.
Therefore, there is no uncertainty and no urgency and we can study this issue again, calmly, at a later date.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
2001 Budget - Parliament' s estimates
The next item should be the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft budget for 2001.
Unfortunately, the Commissioner has not yet arrived, although she is on her way.
I therefore propose that we examine the next item on the agenda.
The next item is the report (A5-0121/2000) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates for the European Parliament' s income and expenditure for the financial year 2001.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would truly have been a great honour to speak directly after the Commissioner' s presentation of the Commission budget 2001.
Instead, I have the honour of presenting Parliament' s budget before the Commissioner presents the larger budget to us.
As rapporteur for Parliament' s budget, I am in a position to submit a proposal to you which, in my view, has three main features. First, and I set great store by this, the budget which we have prepared for you is a highly economical one.
Secondly, we have learned our lessons from the justified complaints of the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, for which we are all to blame.
Thirdly, and this is a particular matter of concern to me, we have strengthened the European Parliament as the institution which represents the interests of the citizens of Europe.
What have we focused on in Parliament' s Budget 2001?
I should like to outline this briefly with reference to five main points.
First: in the area of buildings policy, and this is an extremely important point, we must draw the right conclusions from the objections raised by the Court of Auditors.
In other words, first, we must make the remaining payments in Brussels as quickly as possible - and we are putting the conditions in place for this - so that we can reduce costs - that is particularly important to the taxpayer - and, secondly, we must solve the problem of Strasbourg, of this building here, in a way which does not give cause for complaint.
Both are provided for by figures in the draft budget.
Secondly, we must also exercise extreme restraint in the area of staff policy in the coming year.
We cannot allow Parliament' s staff numbers to increase exorbitantly just because there is some financial room for manoeuvre.
And we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions.
Thirdly, we must prepare ourselves for the enlargement of the European Union and this applies to Parliament even more than to the other institutions.
However, this does not mean - and this is a particularly important point - that we will decide as early as next year on which new languages we can offer in our interpreting services and therefore which countries will be allowed to become members of the European Union in the first round and which will not.
That is the wrong way forward.
It is not the job of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions.
They need to be taken elsewhere; in other words, we do, of course, need to talk to language schools in the candidate countries and we must develop and build up programmes, but we must also, of course, be clear that we cannot anticipate decisions which need to be taken at a political level first.
I am pleased to see the Commissioner is now with us.
I have taken over your role insofar as we are discussing Parliament' s budget first and shall then move on to the Commission' s budget.
No I do not want your job, only you can do it, the role reversal does not stretch quite that far!
Fourthly, we must take account of the increase in the responsibility of the European Parliament since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force.
The current Members of the European Parliament have more responsibility and more work in comparison with all their predecessors than ever before and naturally that also makes itself felt when it comes to preliminary work and technical equipment.
I should like to thank everyone who supported me in this matter of concern.
My fifth point is that this increased responsibility must also find expression with regard to groups in the European Parliament.
I want to see a political parliament fighting for just causes and that means widening the basis for group work; it also means - and I make no bones about the fact - limiting the official services of the European Parliament.
That is the only way of achieving a parliament with an enduring public profile.
I was pleased to note that the Bureau of the European Parliament is thinking along the same lines and that one of the vice-presidents from my group is preparing a report on the subject.
That is the right way forward.
I have taken note of the amendments to my report proposed by my fellow delegates with a great deal of interest.
I hope you will understand that I can support very few, because they no longer follow, in fact, they abandon the line which I presented in the Committee on Budgets and which was adopted by a majority in the committee.
We must prepare for enlargement, but we do not need to start recruiting interpreters from the candidate countries as early as next year.
Even the buildings policy must be considered with a view to enlargement, but I see no need to do so in the Budget 2001.
We need to be a bit more realistic in our approach to the important question of enlargement.
We moved into a new building in Brussels three years ago, we moved into a new building here in Strasbourg a year ago and if we tap the taxpayer on the shoulder again so soon after and say we need more buildings, more office space, he is only likely to agree to so much.
We need to take account of that in our calculations.
A budget with EUR 987 million is not very much in comparison to the budget of over EUR 90 billion which the Commissioner will propose shortly, but this is the taxpayers' money and we must take our decision as the trustees of that money.
The taxpayer expects us to take a prudent approach not only when we draw up the budget, but also when we implement and carry it out.
We shall have to discuss this again in September during the first reading of this budget, once all the documents from the budget discharge procedure have been submitted.
I should like today to thank the Bureau of the European Parliament, especially the vice-president responsible for budgetary questions, Gerhard Schmid, for their constructive cooperation, especially during the conciliation procedure between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets.
My thanks also go to the corresponding departments of Parliament' s administration for their prompt and conscientious preliminary work, without which this set of figures could never have been drawn up.
However, I should also like to extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for their fair cooperation.
Bringing divergent opinions together to a consensus, mostly with too little time to spare, is not always easy.
So my compliments to all my comrades-in-arms and finally, of course, a heartfelt thank-you to the secretarial staff of the Committee on Budgets for having prepared everything promptly and reliably in these difficult times.
I think I can present you with a budget which has earned Parliament' s confidence.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he is doing for our House in terms of getting value for money out of our budget.
It is not right that we should be expecting the Commission to do a whole range of things in putting their House and their budget in order unless we also take the same kinds of rigorous steps.
The approach which has been taken is absolutely correct, not only in making sure that we do not simply give money away if we have a little spare in the budget, but also where we have asked the Secretary-General of Parliament to come forward with a number of reports: for example, in paragraph 6 of the resolution where we have asked the Secretary-General to look at and identify job needs in the same way as the Commission so that we can match job needs to the staff which we have available in the longer term.
That quite clearly is a way of long-term planning which is very sensible at this stage of Parliament's life.
There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001.
The first is a plea from an individual parliamentarian that we should make sure that we have a date firmly fixed for the second network computer in our offices.
It is a matter of frustration for many of us that our staff can access the net with their computers, of course, Parliament's computers, but if we as parliamentarians bring in our own computers, we do not have a place to plug them in and work effectively.
It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us.
Secondly, on a matter of communication, under paragraph 21 of this resolution, I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that we have on many occasions in these debates called for all Commission and Parliament offices in the Member States to work together within a European House framework by 1 January 2000.
As we have now gone past that date and there are still one or two Member States, in particular my own, where Parliament and the Commission have different offices and where in terms of financing Parliament's office well over 70% of the expenditure goes on bricks and salaries, it does not leave much for communications.
The sooner we can make sure that the image of the European Union is reflected by one European House, the better it will be.
The last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement.
I would like to support what our rapporteur has said that we cannot suddenly leap into beginning to authorise posts for preparing enlargement if a political decision has not yet been taken; all the more so, because in Parliament's estimates, as I have understood them, we have in front of us an assumption that we are going to have more languages as a result of enlargement.
Yet we have had no debate in this House to know how we are going to handle not a limited enlargement but an extensive enlargement following the Helsinki Summit late last year, with potentially 12 or 13 new countries, that is 27 - 28 countries with over 20 different languages.
How, Secretary-General, are we going to handle this if we do not have some thinking from the Administration as to where we are going to put them all?
Are we going to have rooms which we are going to have to adjust for over 20 languages so that in every room where there is a discussion in this Parliament every person has the right to use their own language?
We are aware that in the last Parliament a lot of work was done on this by Vice-President Cot.
His report was never released to Members.
We never saw it as a report on suggesting how the hub and spoke system should work - the relay system for interpretation - nor, indeed, did we really have any thinking about the freelancing possibilities with modern communications where we can dispatch a large amount of our translation material to people who are in the Member States, rather than recruiting a whole range of people to come and work in Luxembourg as fixed and permanent employees of Parliament.
Therefore, I strongly support the compromise which has been put forward by our rapporteur asking, by first reading, for the Secretary-General to come up with a strategy of how to handle the whole question of languages in Parliament and enlargement.
I suspect the Commission might wish to do that as well, because it is a problem which rightly, in this amendment, relates to interinstitutional matters.
I very much hope that the Socialist Group will change their mind, get their heads out of the sand and realise that this is the problem which we have to tackle and that it is better to do it now rather than later.
Mr President, let me also start by congratulating Mr Ferber on a comprehensive estimate of Parliament's revenue and expenditure.
I support the thrust of this report, which is in line with the policy of budgetary rigour, because the major challenges that this Chamber needs to address are greater accountability and transparency which will involve embracing institutional reform with vigour; secondly, the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and thirdly, a drive towards improving efficiency through effective budgetary control and better use of resources.
Our main priority has to be to explain to European citizens what we are doing, why we are doing it and how we are doing it.
We must win the confidence of the European taxpayer and we can only do this by improving accountability through simplifying - not mystifying - the work of Parliament, by reducing jargon, by improving the process of approving legislation and improving the legislative machinery and by making a clear connection between what we do here and how it benefits the individual.
We are going a long way towards achieving this transparency through the introduction of activity-based budgeting and the proposal we have in this report to put appropriations for political parties in separate budget lines will contribute significantly to achieving this.
These virtues are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the EU at the moment of enlargement.
We in the Socialist Group strongly believe that the European Parliament should be giving every encouragement to candidate countries in their preparation to joint the EU.
I have the impression that there are those in this House who appear to be frustrating this process of enlargement by placing unnecessary obstacles in the way and often using spurious arguments to limit the preparation for enlargement: for example, the rejection of the proposal to fill the 35 vacant posts in the language reserve between 2001 and 2002.
The reason given, and also outlined by my colleague Mr Elles, is that we believe that this will pre-empt discussions with accession states.
Do we seriously believe that this small step will influence all the institutions as to which countries are in the first tranche and which are in the second tranche?
Do we really believe that by committing less than half a per cent of Parliament's language budget the political decision will be made and taken out of our control?
I am somewhat confused and if I recall correctly, the rapporteur agreed previously and argued vigorously for setting up an interinstitutional recruitment agency in his last report.
What is the point of approving a joint operation whilst at the same time we are preventing any recruitment of people?
I strongly favour planning properly for enlargement because experience has shown that there is a long lead-in time for the training of interpreters and translators.
It is necessary if the admission of the new Member States into the Institution is to run smoothly from a language point of view.
Of course I agree that we should not at any stage prejudice political decisions which have to be taken at a later date.
On the other hand, we should avoid giving out discouraging messages to the applicant countries that are currently making great efforts to get themselves in shape to join the EU.
I reiterate that we should not pre-empt any political decisions to be taken on enlargement.
We need to plan and to be imaginative and to be creative as to how we prepare for enlargement because nothing will be more damaging to the EU if we make a bad job of enlargement.
What we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement.
Very recently the President of the European Court of Justice warned that it would be unable to cope with enlargement of the EU.
The average time that it takes for a case to be heard has risen from 17 months in 1988 to 23 months last year.
That is a very long wait.
What we need to do is to have reforms, not just in the areas of staffing and procedures, but we also need to have a new approach in terms of buildings policy.
It is vital that the preparations are made during the coming financial year to ensure that Parliament's buildings are able to accommodate new Member States of an enlarged EU.
It is also important for provision to be made to set up information offices in the countries which have applied to join the EU.
It is widely acknowledged that the systems that we have at the moment were set up for the EU when we only had 6 Members and they are creaking at the edges in terms of the Union of 15 Members.
How are they possibly going to be effective with 25 Members?
It is important that we plan and prepare.
I am a relatively new Member of Parliament and while I see a lot of good work going on in the committees, I am acutely aware that as a result of the new responsibilities in the Treaty of Amsterdam there is a need not just for individual support for Members but also scientific support for committees.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force Parliament's workload has increased very significantly and it is important that this is taken into account in this budget.
The Commission's Work Programme now incorporates a very large number of codecision procedures and these procedures have significantly increased our workload.
If we are to convince the people of the EU of the importance of the European Parliament's work and persuade them to take it more seriously, we need to improve our systems of working.
That is why I welcome the report's emphasis on the common statute for Members and assistants and I hope that we can adopt this as soon as possible.
I have been disappointed by some aspects of the report's focus.
It focuses too much on the minutiae of detail in sometimes preventing administrative changes in staffing and frustrating strategic vision.
I am concerned at the wisdom of putting 30% of the appropriation into the reserve for security services as the rapporteur proposes.
There is a contradiction in the rapporteur's argument.
He has always focused on outsourcing of Parliament's services.
Here we have an example of outsourcing that is not working.
Rather than reducing the budget we should be looking at how we improve security services, and the question we should be asking is: should we have our own security services or should we be retendering it rather than just reducing the budget?
I am also disappointed that the report ignores one of the biggest inefficiencies we have.
Members of the European Parliament are the only parliamentarians who have no say in the location of their seat.
A seat on three sites is the most incredible waste of time, money, travel and transport.
Surely, when we are looking at budgetary rigour we have the right to address this issue because until we do so the general public will be confused about what we are doing in so many places.
It also confuses the roles of the organisation.
Mr President, Mr Markus Ferber has produced an excellent report, on which I wish to congratulate him.
The Parliament Budget is essentially an administrative budget, since wage costs constitute the largest item of expenditure.
We are currently experiencing a significant period of change in administration, as we are aiming to introduce activity-based budgeting, to emphasise greater personal accountability and to improve the reallocation of resources.
This is why, last year, Parliament approved an appropriation of EUR 300 000 for this year' s budget for the investigation of the efficiency and improvement needs of parliamentary administration.
Mr President, this is why it is somewhat surprising that already at this early stage, i.e. before the investigation has even started, important decisions are being made on administrative development.
In the Budget, appropriations for wages are being increased by an enormous 12.2 %.
This increase is so huge that no other institution could even contemplate an increase of administrative costs of this magnitude.
Already, at this early stage, the intention is to spend this increase on the creation of 33 new posts and, apparently, 12 more will be created as a result of the amendment by the Bureau.
For the sake of comparison, I would like to refer to the 1995-1999 period, during which Parliament established a total of only 11 new official posts.
It is worthy of special mention that in this proposal, a new post is even being created for the Financial Control Department, despite the intention to abandon prior inspection altogether.
In addition, the Budget contains a significant number of new staff promotions.
Such being the case, I cannot agree with those who claim that a policy of budgetary discipline has been observed in the drafting of this Budget. On the contrary, this Budget is uncommonly slack, and this will make it difficult to gain the approval of the general public.
Mr President, it is necessary in this context to address the issue of the policy of the European Parliament in its capacity as an employer.
Administrative reform, activity-based budgeting and downward delegation of accountability require consultation with the staff.
Reallocation of resources is necessary, and consequently also reform of staffing regulations.
Thus it would have been proper to save for the future such tools and opportunities for negotiation, with which these reforms are supposed to be furthered, and to refrain from granting new benefits before there has even been an opportunity to negotiate comparable administrative reforms with the staff.
Mr President, I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for his report and for facilitating open communication.
Mr Ferber' s report does not just contain political aspects but is in fact largely composed of administrative aspects.
I will start by quoting and commenting on a number of political statements.
My group wholeheartedly agrees with the line taken in the report that the Council and Parliament should draft a statute in the short term and should do this in joint cooperation.
They should compile a statute for the Members of the European Parliament, and, independently of that, a statute for the Member' s assistants.
We support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year.
The report also contains a political comment regarding the separate budget lines required for the parliamentary groups on the one hand and the European political parties on the other.
We must avoid hidden subsidies for European political parties at all costs.
We all know that it will be some time before a statute is drawn up for the European political parties and I welcome the fact that, in the meantime, the Secretary-General has been asked to establish transparency in the use of appropriations by the parliamentary groups and the political parties.
Quite apart from this, the report also covers many administrative aspects.
For example, we have been asked to pass judgement on the fact that the Directorate for Committees and Delegations must comprise five A posts, two B posts and one C post, and that one A post and two B posts must be added to the Directorate-General for Personnel.
It is not because I am new, I think, that I have great difficulty in passing judgement on this.
In my opinion, it is mainly up to a manager to take responsibility for the precise detail of personnel policy.
It is also very difficult for the groups if it is decided in the plenary how many additional posts are to be created within the political groups.
Surely, a great deal depends on the organisation of your group and maybe not every group wants to work in exactly the same way.
I think that we should really re-think the system.
I understand that during the reform of Parliament, consideration will also be given to allowing groups to take responsibility for their own affairs and I wholeheartedly support this.
I would also like to comment briefly on the support which has been requested for the parliamentarians.
We have agreed that a study will be carried out which will also be linked in with a study commissioned by Mr Rothley into what exactly it is that the parliamentarians need in the way of support for their work.
I struggle somewhat with the fact that we are running ahead of this study' s conclusions because we do not give our verdict on the Bureau' s conclusion in Mr Ferber' s report.
The Bureau concludes that expenses for assistants should be increased by 20%. In failing to pass judgement on this, we are giving the impression that we have accepted it.
I am not against this increase, in principle.
What I do object to, however, is running ahead of the report and I am also opposed to it because I am sure that in September, it will transpire that we will need to prioritise various issues.
For example, the rent we pay for the buildings may increase.
We will need to decide whether we want to inject more funding into other institutions in preparation for enlargement.
We will no doubt return to these points of criticism in September when we will have the precise figures in front of us.
As such, it is not really a criticism but I do object to running ahead of a decision.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a report on the European Parliament, and I am astonished first of all not to see one of Mrs Stauner' s letters appended to this document because, as you know, she likes to get involved in our business even though her own activities are concerned with something completely different.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that the rapporteur is a member of her own group and, for once, she is therefore confining herself to making observations rather than sending a letter.
I find this rather strange, but perhaps she has not yet said her last word.
We shall see, in time.
What I want to say is quite simply this: the situation is nonetheless rather surprising. On the one hand, we have engaged in a policy of rigour resulting in all our budgets and discharges being obstructed by a Parliament that is rigorous to the extent of obstructing discharge to the Commission, and even obstructing discharge to the European Parliament itself, out of fear of problems, lack of endorsement or money wasting attributable to the duties of officials who are required to shuttle back and forth between Luxembourg and Brussels, costing the taxpayer a fortune.
Yet on the other hand, in the Ferber report, Members of Parliament are awarding themselves fortunes.
We are awarding ourselves a second computer, claiming that one is not enough.
We are awarding ourselves a 20% pay rise from a zero-growth budget.
We are awarding ourselves a 20% increase to the budget heading for funding for our assistants because we are more than anything afraid that the rules will stipulate that this contract will have to be accompanied by a statute which would specifically require welfare contributions to be paid, and so, as insurance against the worst case scenario, we are increasing this line by 20%.
After checking up, I have not found a single budget item in the Community, whether in the field of humanitarian aid, research, or agricultural expenditure where there are plans for an increase.
Moreover, generally speaking, the objective is to reduce the budget.
But not in this case!
Within the European Parliament a second computer is being awarded, 20% additional expenses and, as the Court of Auditors was particularly tough on the political groups, a paragraph is included, which, I quote, "Underlines emphatically the increased workload and the particular responsibilities of the political groups."
This paragraph does Parliament no credit.
If we adopt an attitude, we cannot express any indignation at waste while at the same time putting forward a budget of this type.
On behalf of the radicals in this House, I must inform you that I shall be voting against Mr Ferber' s report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry that my good friend, Mr Dell'Alba, is not in agreement with the draft budget by Mr Ferber.
We are in agreement and we are very happy.
I believe that the rapporteur, in drawing up this draft budget for 2001, has been rigorous, has made optimum use of resources and has, at the same time, been imaginative and looked to the future.
We congratulate him wholeheartedly.
Ultimately, we are talking about a European Parliament for the 21st century, when we will have to face three fundamental challenges. We will have to respond to the MEPs' new obligations, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, incorporate new technologies into our work and react immediately to the huge administrative, organisational and political obligations presented by enlargement of the European Union.
These three challenges faced by the European Parliament should be set in a context of great budgetary rigour and complete transparency in the use of public funds.
We must consider - and the rapporteur has done this - what kind of Parliament we want in the future. Do we want a more administrative and bureaucratic Parliament or do we want a more political one?
Do we want a European Parliament that is centralised or do we want one which is compatible with a European Union which is becoming increasingly federalised but at the same time more subject to subsidiarity and decentralisation?
I believe - and I agree with him on this - that the rapporteur wants a Parliament that treats the MEPs' political work, both in Strasbourg and in Brussels, as well as in their individual political constituencies, as a priority.
In this case it is necessary, as he says, for there to be new information points, new IT resources and new staff - if necessary - to help MEPs carry out their bureaucratic tasks.
I hope that in September new appropriations will be provided for these lines.
I am very glad that Mr Ferber has reacted to the report of the Court of Auditors on the funding of the political groups.
An independent budget line will allow us to present a clearer and more transparent public image until we finally have a statute for the European political parties.
Let us not forget that these parties are the cornerstone of European democracy and there must be no doubts as to whether they are being funded in the correct manner.
We fully agree with the rapporteur' s view concerning the linguistic staff necessary for enlargement.
We must initiate the preparatory administrative measures.
Six new countries - with at least five new languages - in 2004 means that we will have to make a great effort to adapt.
In order to fill these vacancies, we will need to know the exact order in which the candidate countries will join the Union, and that is something that cannot happen now or in this budget.
We therefore support all Mr Ferber' s amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressly welcoming Mr Ferber' s report in its broadest outlines.
We have enjoyed extremely positive collaboration over recent weeks and months, cooperation marked by the fact that we expressed our opinions in no uncertain terms on the points where we diverged widely, but when you can reach a common line, then that is the path you should take.
The challenge which faces us has been described.
One can in fact do no more than repeat it.
In the wake of Amsterdam - and I say this now in anticipation of what is yet to come in relation to this Parliament - we must reconcile the powers which Parliament now has with its potential, because at present they do not stand in a very balanced ratio.
We must ensure that we can achieve equality in arms with the other legislative authority, namely the Council, both in respect of the scientific service and scientific research.
We cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directly-elected Parliament to lag behind what the Council can do.
If we take our work seriously, if we take ourselves seriously, we must operate under the same conditions so that we really can stand up for ourselves.
There is no point in the President of our Parliament just putting her mark at the bottom of the page.
That is not enough; it is the work beforehand which is crucial and it needs to be carried out seriously and it needs to be carried out well.
In this respect it is both right and important - and I expressly disagree with Mr Dell'Alba here - that we prepare ourselves properly.
Nor can there be any question of exorbitant cost increases now.
Mr Dell'Alba knows full well that, thanks to a clever buildings policy - let there be no mistake about that - we have been able to release considerable funds over recent years.
Having scrimped and saved this money ourselves, we then need to use it to good purpose.
To good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this Parliament.
We are still within the 20% margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it.
At no point do we go over Parliament' s 20% share of administrative costs.
I think that shows that our approach is very serious here and we do not want to promise any cloud cuckoo land.
Another challenge before us - admittedly we have been pushed into action here by official discussions in various quarters - is the need to bring some transparency into this Parliament.
We shall accept this responsibility and take up this challenge.
Not because we are afraid of being forced to do so.
No, we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here.
We are endeavouring to create a serious basis for what we do here, i.e. financing for the groups, and we want a set of rules so that the European political parties and party organisations can raise funds.
You cannot call for this sort of development at European level without financing the basis commensurately, that is quite right.
The basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where.
We shall do everything we can to make progress on this point and to bring more transparency into the process, so that everyone can see what money is going where and can judge if it is appropriate or unsuitable and criticism can then be levied where criticism is needed.
And it is needed.
However, we must head off criticism on procedural grounds or because we have accommodated certain sums under various budget headings.
Transparency is needed here and, as we said last year during the budget debates, we have our work cut out here.
Allow me to comment now on the question of enlargement, because that is the only point on which we disagree with Mr Ferber and, above all, with our colleagues in the PPE group.
What worries me here is that Mr Stoiber' s visit to your group last week had a greater impact than we all feared.
My next comment is addressed to my honourable friend, Mr PÃ¶ttering: it was you who said at a European Union conference "onwards and upwards" , and that enlargement should be speeded up for political reasons, because we cannot afford to put it on the back burner.
But, when we are specifically called upon to move forwards, we should do so decisively.
I know that the issue of when and how enlargement should take place can be the stuff of first-rate political debate, a debate which could set the axe at the very roots and I call for extreme caution here.
As far as specific preparations are concerned, we need, for example, to make preparations for more buildings.
And if you do not start looking for buildings, for example in the candidate countries, until things are so far down the road, you will be faced with prices which make your hair turn grey.
So we need to get our act together and make preparations which allow for sound financial management.
As far as preparing for new languages is concerned, if you read the Cot report, called for by the honourable Member of your group, Mr Elles, you will see that we shall have an additional 460 language combinations in the future.
According to one estimate, this will mean another 500 translators and interpreters.
Do you expect us to believe that you are suddenly going to jump up like a jack in the box with a list of people who are highly specialised in Estonian, Latvian, Czech, in all these new languages which we shall have?
No, preparations need to be made now.
And in order to avoid falling into the trap, as Mr Ferber rightly explained, of taking administrative decisions which anticipate political developments, we must, of course, ensure during the course of the year that we have a precise discussion on the distribution of these posts between the various languages.
We shall support the release of the Cot report - that is one part of Mr Elles' motion.
We are in favour of discussing this during the course of the year, but we are expressly against saying as of now that we refuse to fill the 35 posts.
That would be frivolous and would send completely the wrong signal to the Member States and to the people who hope to become an integral part of the Union.
Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for the good work he has done.
There is a lot in this report which has been well thought-out and which it is very easy indeed to support.
I want to talk about an issue which, in the long term, will be very important for Parliament and for the EU as a whole and which many Members have already touched upon here today, namely the language question.
Rarely perhaps is the linguistic diversity of Europe seen so incredibly clearly as in a debate in this Chamber in which eleven different languages are being interpreted between.
Naturally, this is expensive and time-consuming. Yet it has been assumed without question, throughout the history of the EU, that whoever is present here should be able, if at all possible, to speak their own language.
A good deal in the report under discussion is based on the assumption that the EU will be enlarged by six new Member States in 2004.
What is more, that may be an underestimate.
A few days ago, the Commission said it was its own objective to be able to welcome ten new Member States by the year 2005.
I am among those for whom the greatest challenge for the EU is an enlargement whose ultimate goal is the reunification of a Europe which has always been divided by artificial borders.
I nonetheless believe that it is more realistic to proceed on the basis of the somewhat lower figure quoted in the report by the Committee on Budgets.
Even that figure is awfully large, bearing in mind the number of new languages involved.
Proceeding on the basis that there will be "5+1 countries" in the first round of negotiations - a lot can obviously happen during the next few years, but these six countries nonetheless have a two-year head start in terms of the negotiations - this means that five new official languages will be added to the eleven we already have at present.
There is no question of these newly welcomed countries and their languages being treated any differently from the way in which the existing Member States are treated.
It must equally go without saying that Hungarian, Polish or Estonian Members of this Parliament should be able to speak their own languages, just as we existing Members are entitled to speak ours.
Nor can we put ourselves in a situation whereby a country with access to trained interpreters and translators can become a Member State of the EU, while another country which does not have professionals of these kinds cannot.
That is precisely why it is so important that the issue is highlighted right now.
That is what the rapporteur is doing, and I think it is excellent.
We must not, in a few years' time, find ourselves in a situation in which the issue has still not been resolved.
We should also be clear about the fact that things are happening very quickly right now.
We are dealing with countries which are developing very rapidly, which means that we too must act quickly in order to have settled the language question by the time these countries join the Union.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Ferber on his report.
These types of reports are never easy and he has done a good job.
My only criticism is that Amendments Nos 4 and 5 should have been tabled in someone else's name for the PPE Group.
By saying that I am being consistent: I said the same to Mrs MÃŒller in the Green Group when she did that.
I shall explain why shortly.
Parliament demands that the Commission and the other institutions are prudent with taxpayers' money, and we think the same should apply to the European Parliament.
As chairman of this committee, I have discovered that your loyalties are spread very wide.
I have a loyalty to the committee, and when the committee takes a decision I feel duty-bound to defend that decision.
I have a loyalty to the rapporteur, and that is why I have made the comments before because the rapporteur should reflect the opinions of the committee.
I also have a loyalty to my political group which has given me this speaking time.
This sometimes leaves me bereft of my own loyalties to myself and what I want to say.
I was somewhat sympathetic to what Mr Dell'Alba was saying because we have to be careful of criticising everybody else if, at the same time, we are giving the impression that we are ignoring that prudency and just doing what we want to do.
I am not saying that we have done that.
However, if that is the impression we are going to give, we have to be very careful and realise the consequences.
Having said that, the Ferber report has tried to balance the needs of Parliament coming into a new millennium - new needs, enlargement on the horizon - and to make it function effectively.
Not all the decisions will be taken when we vote this report through.
The first reading will be time when the final decisions are taken, and cognisance has been taken of that.
When they see a budget of EUR 965m, the newspapers will easily deduce that is over EUR 1.5m per Member.
The British newspapers will be full of GBP 1m per MEP - that is what they cost!
However, we are trying to reduce those costs, especially on buildings.
If people would look at what is being done with the buildings: we are trying to reduce the payments over the shortest possible time, thereby reducing the total burden on Parliament's budget.
One only has to look at paragraphs 15 to 18 to see how serious we are about the buildings policy.
The policy of ramassage has been a great success for this Parliament.
What we have done with the Belliard building may not be ideal but at least it is a step in the right direction, and it is now off our backs.
Finally, one of the great problems in our institution is that we have no statute for Members, assistants or political parties.
What is being proposed is to try to make some headway towards resolving those factors.
- (PT) Mr President, the proposals put forward in the report that we are now considering interpret - or should interpret - the will of the European Parliament to prepare itself to meet the challenges facing the European Union.
It has to be this way, as we have been through a tricky time, and there are permanent tensions and glaring contradictions.
It seems that we expect everything and, at the same time, we expect nothing at all from the European Union' s priorities, as we can see from the level of budgetary transposition - or lack thereof.
It is our ability to take advantage of something that could potentially transform tensions and to reduce the amount of contradictions which will make the difference between the stagnation and the consequent decline of the project and the dynamism that its implementation requires.
Have the competences of the European Parliament increased substantially with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the consequent extension of the codecision procedure to further areas of policy, for example?
If that is the case, we would have to provide Members of the House with a greater ability to carry out their mandate, more and better information and we would have to ensure that the political groups are more accountable and that the staff of the European Parliament is more efficient.
Does enlargement require subtle changes in the membership and functioning of this Parliament?
If it does, then we need to prepare for them, anticipate the challenges and how to respond to them and not fall into a situation of 'wait and see' , which would leave us trailing in the wake of events that we can neither prevent nor influence.
This applies to the European Union as a whole.
We are at a turning point and, now that we have reached this point, nothing will be the same as it was before and things will not remain as they are now.
Now that economic and monetary union has been achieved, the euro cannot be a point of arrival but a starting point, which, in time, will bring about and require further changes.
Now that the process of enlargement has been launched, fundamental changes are required as well as renewed ambition.
The need to make the economic sphere correspond to the political sphere is becoming increasingly clear.
We are swinging between deepening and dilution, solidarity and selfishness, decisiveness and delay, coherence and contradiction and convergence and divergence.
By increasing the influence of core principles, amongst which I would highlight subsidiarity and social and economic cohesion, we will be able to launch and see through new initiatives.
I congratulate Mr Ferber on the care he has taken over this work.
Mr President, as other colleagues have said, dealing with Amsterdam and preparing for enlargement are major challenges for this institution.
As far as I am concerned - and we should be very clear about this - new challenges require new resources.
As the rapporteur has indicated, you start by looking at existing resources and see where staff and resources which are under-utilised or no longer appropriate can be transferred.
Once that has been done, in the new situation in which the European Parliament finds itself, there is no alternative but to expand our budget.
I hear what Mr Wynn, the chairman of the committee, has said about prudence.
Prudence is in danger of becoming a false goddess: if we put too much emphasis on prudence it will be at the expense of the efficiency and the effectiveness of this Institution.
There is a delicate balance to be struck, and I know that in his report the rapporteur has striven towards it.
I broadly welcome Mr Ferber's report.
However, there are three fronts to which Parliament needs to pay more attention between now and September.
The first, as other colleagues have mentioned, is the issue of languages.
I had the honour of sitting on Mr Cot's working group on multilingualism.
Frankly, if this institution wishes to continue to practise multilingualism - and perhaps that is a debate we should have - there is no alternative but to start recruiting now.
If we leave it any longer, once we start enlargement we will not be in a position to continue multilingualism.
The decision will be taken for us.
We were almost in that position with Finnish at the last enlargement.
As Members will notice, the Finnish interpreters do a good job speaking English and other languages because we could not recruit Finnish-speaking English interpreters.
We shall find ourselves in that position again come the next enlargement unless we take hard decisions now.
So I want Parliament to rethink the 35 language posts.
The second area where we still have much to do as an Institution is informatics.
We have come a long way, but there are further benefits to be obtained from informatics.
In particular the President of the Bureau is looking at how to reach a position where every Member has a portable computer with access to the European Parliament's computer system so that, no matter where they are in the world, they can get their own committee reports, agendas and so on. That does not require a massive increase in investment but it does require new money - an increase in Parliament's resources.
