In short, this new compromise directive may not give all political groups all of what they want, but it will remove many barriers to cross-border trade and services and reduce the red tape that businesses encounter when they try to expand into other EU countries.
A balance between the protection of employment law and collective agreements within the EU Member States and opening up a more efficient market for services has been achieved through compromise.
I hope this Parliament will give a strong mandate to the Commission to carry this directive forward with renewed momentum following Thursdayâs vote, and I look forward to seeing a further improved version of this directive before Parliament in the not-too-distant future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it probably goes without saying that the adoption of this directive will be a highly important political event.
If Parliament adopts the directive by a large majority, however, the political signal it sends out will be even more significant, since it will once again confirm the role that we play in the legislative process as mediators between the bureaucracy of Europe and the individuality of each of the Member States.
As mediators, we have a duty to balance the demands for liberalisation of the market with the rights of the weaker sections of society.
I consider the compromise of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to be valid in leading towards the liberalisation of a sector that accounts for a very great part of our economy, a sector that the Treaty defines as a fundamental freedom.
We certainly could have gone further towards liberalisation, but one cannot have everything all at once.
The five-year revision clause will enable us to improve the text and continue the process of liberalisation.
With regard to the economic aspect, we have set ourselves ambitious targets in terms of growth and employment.
I should like to comment on certain amendments that have been tabled, especially Amendments 13, 72, 73 and 86.
Not only do they exclude services of general interest, but they leave it to the discretion of each individual Member State to define the concepts and the public service requirements to which such services are subject.
Amendment 13, moreover, excludes the obligation for Member States to liberalise such services or to privatise public bodies and existing monopolies, such as lotteries.
Amendments 17 and 80 also propose again to exclude games of chance.
I believe that we should examine these amendments during the general debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner will be relieved that we are getting very close to the end. I am the third to last speaker.
It was last April, in the heat of the run-up to the French referendum vote, that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted Mr Chatzimarkakisâ opinion on the Services Directive.
That opinion challenged the then prevalent hostility to this directive, with the absurdly exaggerated claims about Polish plumbers and social dumping that were then being thrown around.
From its very first directly elected plenary in 1979, this Parliament has championed the cause of a truly free and open single market, as envisaged in the original Treaties.
Out of an internal subcommittee of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of which I was proud to be a member, came the Kangaroo Group and the 1992 single market programme under the Single European Act of 1985.
I find it difficult to understand or justify why services were left out of that enterprise.
Now is our opportunity to emulate the courage and foresight of our predecessors and make sure that a real single market in services is implemented.
Trade unionists, French ânoâ voters, French plumbers: truly there is nothing to be afraid of.
Just as a single market in goods has provided new, more and better jobs, so will the Services Directive, if we vote through a strong and liberal version.
It can provide the opportunities that everyone seeks, especially in SMEs, as an essential element of a successful, competitive and prosperous European economy.
The opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which took a liberal line, was supported by 34 votes to 6, by conservatives, liberals and even most of the socialists.
I hope we can look to Parliament as a whole to adopt a similarly courageous and far-sighted position.
Adam Smith was right: freed-up trade works; a really free and open market in services will work and get more and more Europeans back into work.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like warmly to thank Commissioner McCreevy and the members of my group, MrÂ Harbour, Mrs Thyssen and others, who have been fighting to defend a directive and who have had to watch what we considered to be the best aspects of it disappearing before their very eyes.
I must say that we politicians and people in power sometimes fall behind society, and I say this because there are two aspects of the directive that are of great interest to me and that are unfortunately not going to be taken up to a great extent: on the one hand, the recognition of qualifications and freedom to work for skilled people and, on the other, the issue of health.
I believe that in Europe, when people go to another country to work, it is much easier for them to work in manual jobs, in under-recognised jobs, even if they are highly qualified, because corporate egotism does not allow anything else.
We have not been able to remove this obstacle.
I would like to talk, secondly, about health.
The directive included the facility or obligation to return funds to those residents of one country who receive medical assistance in another.
The Mediterranean is packed with millions of Europeans who have gone South in search of sun and a new life, but their right to reimbursement of the funds relating to the social services â and, in particular, health services - they receive is not recognised.
They are in a situation of uncertainty and they are in a difficult situation, but, above all, they have been abandoned by the politicians.
And I would say the same with regard to private medicine.
I therefore support the inclusion of private medicine, because we have hundreds of clinics that are treating and assisting the Germans, the British and the Swedes who are in the South and in the Mediterranean.
These citizens have the right to speak in their own languages, to be treated in their own languages and to have services provided in their own languages.
This situation exists; society has created it, and we do not want to recognise it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of the Services Directive is to foster economic growth and employment in the European Union.
Currently a large number of administrative obstacles impede the effective functioning of the EU internal market.
The most negative impact of administrative obstacles and the costs associated with them is on the ability of the SME sector to offer services outside their own countries.
The services sector makes up about 70% of the EU economy, and so the removal of administrative obstacles in this sector would give a significant boost to its development.
Analysis by the European Commission shows that in the period from 1992 to 2002 measures taken to improve the EU internal labour market and to open up the EUâs internal borders increased the EUâs GDP by 1.8% and created two and a half million new jobs.
This increase was mainly achieved by ensuring free movement of goods and liberalising the telecommunications and energy sectors.
The European Commissionâs analysis also shows that a properly functioning EU internal services market could bring about equal growth in the economy and jobs.
It is therefore important to vote for a strong Services Directive which includes the country of origin principle, at least in the variant voted for by the European Parliamentâs Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, maintaining those articles of the directive that lay down the rights of service providers regarding the posting of workers to a country where services are being provided, and also restricting the list of exceptions.
Leaving out these principles would considerably distort the meaning of the Services Directive, and opportunities for additional EU economic growth would be missed.
Some of the European Parliamentâs Members are trying to seriously distort the significance of the Services Directive and to implement a protectionist policy in relation to service providers from the new Member States, without taking into account the economic losses which that would cause to the European Union as a whole.
The vote by the European Parliament will demonstrate whether the majority of Members see the future of the EU economy as a dynamic and open EU internal market or as a protectionist jungle of 25 Member States.
Â Â  .
Mr President, we have had a lengthy and lively discussion. You certainly do not need caffeine to keep you alert during such a stimulating debate.
I would like to thank all participants for their contributions representing various perspectives.
We have heard all the arguments for and against this proposal.
What is clear to me is that despite the divergences there is a strong body of opinion in support of a services directive, a common wish to arrive at a broad understanding of how we should go forward.
I welcome that.
It demonstrates the vital role that the European Parliament can play in reconciling the many different opinions expressed in this House.
On the basis of todayâs debate, I feel confident that Parliament can lead the way forward in building the consensus that this proposal needs if it is to be adopted.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and group leaders for their constructive approach.
I said that the Commission will take full account of those amendments that find a broad consensus here.
I believe we are close to that consensus, particularly with regard to the scope of the proposal and the freedom to provide services as set out in ArticleÂ 16.
I was heartened to hear so many speakers say that they wanted a services directive with real added value.
That is why we should keep any further sectoral exemptions from the scope to a minimum, and we need to pay particular attention to the wording of ArticleÂ 16.
There can be no going back on Treaty provisions or court jurisdiction.
In reply to Mr Watsonâs criticism of our efforts to help build bridges on ArticleÂ 16, it is a pity he did not check the source of the draft text that he found fault with.
It did not come from my office, but then I am used to being accused of many things â good and bad â for which I have no responsibility.
Turning to the substance of todayâs debate and the posting of workers, I have much sympathy for those who are concerned about what they see as unnecessary administrative burdens placed on workers who are posted to another Member State.
There is Community law and court jurisprudence which must be respected.
If you vote by a large majority to delete ArticlesÂ 24 and 25, then the Commission will come forward quickly with guidance on that key initiative.
It is important that the message that comes with this debate and the vote on Thursday is one of Europe moving forward in proposing a framework for a better services directive which will provide the incentives and confidence necessary for businesses, entrepreneurs and consumers to take full advantage of our internal market by investing in new opportunities and developing and buying new services which will create more jobs and growth.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The services directive, which will be put to the vote on Thursday in Strasbourg, provides a chance to demonstrate to the 450 million European citizens that Europe and especially Parliament are listening to the peopleâs demands and concerns and are trying to reconcile them with a strategy of growth and development that only harmonisation and a real opening-up of economic activities can provide.
The text that I hope will come out of this plenary will be a watered-down document, with grey areas that will need clarification.
However, in a diversified context like Europe, with new countries seeking opportunities and old countries trying to protect themselves, with small and large enterprises and 25 different legal systems, compromise is the only way to proceed.
We must therefore welcome the commitment shown by all the political groups and players concerned to reach an agreement.
It is an important opportunity for Europe to recover its confidence and to relaunch its bid for a kind of economic growth that will not damage our social model; that bid has unfortunately lost credibility in recent months.
We need growth and we need to revitalise our economy, and the services directive is an important initial measure, provided that the welfare and rights of our workers are not called into question.
Â Â  â The directive on establishing an internal market in services was proposed by the Commission when its President was the social democrat Romano Prodi, and has now been taken on by the current Commission under Mr Barrosoâs leadership.
This proposal plays a central role in the onslaught of capitalism in the EU.
It is a proposal that panders to the interests of the large multinationals by paving the way for them to exploit the workers and dominate further economic sectors.
What is being proposed is the total liberalisation of services, including public services, which will have detrimental consequences for the workers and for the sovereignty of individual Member States.
If it is adopted, this proposal would act as a lever, a kind of âTrojan Horseâ to undermine salaries, collective work contracts and workersâ rights.
It will also act against the Member Statesâ ability to provide effective protection for public services, and, in general, to control how those services are provided.
It is impossible to âreformâ this proposal, as the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking to do, in an attempt to retain the core negative elements of the directive and, at the same time, to save face.
As the workers have been demanding and as we have been calling for from the outset, this directive must be rejected.
Â Â  The existence of barriers in the European market in services leads to higher prices, restricted economic growth and fewer new jobs.
Are lower growth, fewer jobs and higher prices really what Europeans want?
I do not think so.
Above all else, Europeans want more jobs.
Why should politicians obstruct this?
Certain self-styled defenders of working people want to emasculate the directive, and to render it toothless.
It could be argued that these individuals are in favour of liberalising the services market or even against doing so.
I certainly agree that the directive impacts on sensitive issues.
We cannot bury our heads in the sand, however.
I wonder if the directive's opponents have given careful consideration to competitiveness and the future of service providers, and whether they really do want a single market.
There has been a lot of talk about equality, but it seems to be an Orwellian equality, just for those that are 'more equal'.
There has also been talk of protecting social achievements, but this seems to mean protecting them in the rich countries only, not in the whole of Europe.
Small and medium-sized enterprises create the most jobs.
Services make the greatest contribution to Europe's GDP.
Let us give entrepreneurs a chance.
Let us give the 20Â million unemployed Europeans a chance.
Let us give the entrepreneurial spirit a chance.
We have an opportunity to do good. We must not waste it.
That is why we must vote against the amendments that would water down the directive, hamper its implementation and threaten the achievement of the desired results.
Let us choose real freedom.
We cannot allow national egoism and protectionism to harm Europe.
Â Â  â The report by Mrs Gebhardt on the Bolkestein directive has come to plenary today for debate and vote.
In essence, this is a reworking of the shadowy Bildeberg Club to impose the steamroller of globalisation and the rules of the new order.
As an elected member of the European Parliament (and not elected by some party power controlled by the persons of the new order), I am absolutely opposed to the philosophies reworked in the directive in question, which executes in cold blood decades of workers' rights.
As chairman of the Popular Orthodox Rally in Greece, I shall encourage all the groups attacked by the directive to engage in full resistance.
I did not take part in the debate, simply because the presence of all those who are ideologically opposed legalises the extreme positions of the person who inspired the directive.
I voted against the directive and I wish this statement to be entered in the Minutes.
Â Â  Seventy per cent of Europeâs GDP is now based on services.
The biggest gap in completing the Single European Market is in the Services sector.
If we could create a dynamic single market for services, around 600Â 000 new jobs could be created in the EU.
Removing the administrative and technical barriers to companies operating outside their own country is therefore a desirable and important objective and opens up the sector to fair competition.
However, driving down workersâ rights, wages and health and safety measures has no part in creating a dynamic service sector and that is why I will be voting for amendments that exclude labour law and free collective bargaining from the scope of the directive.
I also believe that certain services such as health, social services and aspects of education are so sensitive that they should not be covered by this particular measure.
Â Â  Mr McCreevy, I was once lost in the rural roads of your home county.
Asking directions of a gentleman I passed, I was told âwell, I wouldnât start from over hereâ.
I pass this piece of advice to you, Commissioner: if you want to smoothly facilitate free and easy movement of services throughout our 25Â countries, I wouldnât start from here.
âHereâ being a vague and incomprehensible mess that will be defined in our courts.
âHereâ being a recipe for chaos, creating a situation where we will potentially become 25Â different systems of regulation and business moving to the country with the most regulatory advantages, creating a crisis in which the only solution will be complete federal harmonisation, and who wants that?
Â Â  â The next item is the Commission statement on the new financial instrument for development in connection with the Millennium Goals.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission was asked last week by the European Parliament to make a statement on innovative sources of financing for development cooperation.
Commissioner Michel cannot be here tonight as he is travelling to eastern Africa to previous engagements which could not be rescheduled.
He is extremely sorry not to be able to share with you the Commissionâs views on this topic and has asked me to step in for him.
Aid needs to be substantially increased if the Millennium Development Goals are to be achieved.
The European Union has not shied away from its responsibilities towards its partner countries.
Quite the contrary: the European Council of June 2005 forcefully restated its support for the Millennium Development Goals with ambitious commitments on both the quality and the quantity of aid.
In particular, the European Council has committed itself to increasing official development assistance with the aim of achieving a target of 0.7% of gross national income in 2015.
To that end, a collective target of 0.56% of GNI has been fixed for 2010.
However, more aid will not be enough.
We need to ensure that current and promised increases in financing are provided in ways which actually help countries meet their commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
In the recently approved joint statement by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the European consensus for development, the European Union commits itself to the more predictable and less volatile aid mechanisms.
The Commission believes that innovative mechanisms for financing development have a useful role to play.
For this reason during 2005, at the request of the Council, the Commission produced a series of staff working papers providing technical analysis of innovative sources of financing for development.
In addition, in April 2005, the Commission adopted a communication to the Council and the European Parliament, âAccelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals â Financing for Development and Aid Effectivenessâ.
Amongst other things, this communication discussed innovative sources of financing and new delivery aid mechanisms and invited the Council to âagree to accelerate work on the most promising options for innovative additional sources of financeâ.
The Commission noted that any innovative sources of financing must be assessed in light of a number of criteria.
For example: how much would each proposal raise?
To what extent would the funds be additional to existing commitments?
How stable and predictable would they be?
What are the competitiveness and sectoral impacts?
What would the launch and administration costs be?
Which proposals can go forward fastest?
Is universal support required or can proposals be implemented at regional â that is EU â level?
The Commission notes Franceâs readiness to start implementation of one of the proposals emerging from that debate, namely, the imposition of a solidarity contribution on all air tickets sold in France as of July 2006.
This initiative may have a positive effect on other countriesâ readiness to carry forward initiatives in the area of financing for development.
The Commission would also like to inform the European Parliament that, to support the debate and preserve the momentum on these issues, a technical workshop between the Commission and Member State representatives was held on 9Â February 2006.
The workshop touched upon the existing initiatives, as well as possible alternatives with respect to innovative financing.
The Commission, however, also looked at ways in which existing aid arrangements could be modified and complemented so as to deliver resources in more predictable ways.
Finally, the Commission would like to note that, during the workshop, the French representatives gave an update on the high-level conference to be held in Paris on 28Â February and 1Â March. Representatives of the Commission will be present at that event.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, the European Union must play a leading role in ensuring that the Millennium Development Goals are attained.
Ever since the Monterrey Conference in 2002 and the United Nations Summit in September 2005, the international community has recognised the need to rise to the challenge of development by executing a common policy integrating the Millennium Goals.
At a time when the gap between the North and the South is ever widening and when the growing prosperity of industrialised countries is plunging many countries of the South back into poverty, it is high time the involvement of the international community took the form of practical measures.
While the European Union is the main donor, it must do more today; it must work more effectively and it must move more swiftly.
The European consensus on development and the new strategy for Africa are steps in the right direction, as was the recent announcement of the creation of a European fund to finance African projects, and I am delighted at these breakthroughs.
Despite the increase in traditional public aid, the current figures show that the attainment of the Millennium Goals hinges on the adoption of mechanisms of complementary funding.
On the initiative of several Member States, innovative and complementary financial instruments are being created.
The European Union must work on implementing these instruments so as to produce stable and predictable resources needed to meet the unfulfilled requirements of developing countries, particularly in the health care sector.
Several Member States already support these initiatives.
Commissioner, you pointed out that some of these countries, including France, committed themselves to implementing international solidarity contributions, for example on flight tickets.
At the next ministerial conference, the Member States will strengthen the international consensus on the need to introduce innovative and practical sources of funding.
This meeting must provide the opportunity to build on the momentum generated in New York during the last United Nations Summit.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to talk about the potential offered by the International Financing Facility proposed by the UK Chancellor Gordon Brown.
The IFF leverages money from international capital markets by issuing bonds which can potentially raise USDÂ 50Â billion each year from 2005 to 2015.
The advantage of this, referring to some of the points you raised in your introduction, Commissioner, is that this money is frontloaded, it is long term, it is stable and it is predictable money.
It raises one billion a year, which can be used to get children into school and to abolish the fees that jeopardise the education of millions of children in developing countries, especially little girls.
The IFF has already put in place a pilot scheme for immunisation, which is searching for vaccines for malaria and for HIV/AIDS â the scourge in Africa and many other parts of the world â for which there is no cure.
The agreement is to provide a global advanced purchasing scheme to make sure that life-saving vaccines are commercially produced at affordable prices and that these are produced in ways of which we in this Parliament should all approve and which we should find essential at this time.
We acknowledge that meeting the Millennium Development Goals, which is part of the purpose of this debate, is difficult, but if we can put the money in place â predictable money â then we will get every child into school and we will prevent the needless deaths of 30Â 000 children every day.
That is what we are talking about; that is about us trying to translate hope into reality.
When he heard about the IFF, Nelson Mandela said that it was an absolutely necessary and timely initiative that deserves an active response from the international community.
I very much hope that the European Union will support this initiative firmly and in a very committed way.
Â Â  . Mr President, my group welcomes this resolution.
There is broad consensus that under-financing and under-investment, in Africa in particular, have played a significant part in holding developing countries back.
Economists like the American Jeremy Sachs admit that development assistance to Africa to date has been peanuts when measured against the scale of infrastructure investment that is required.
The title of this resolution is somewhat restrictive and mentions a new financial instrument as if there were only one solution to the problem, but the text is fortunately much broader.
The nub of the problem is that we have to find ways to finance development over and above the national commitment to 0.7%.
The resolution floats the idea of a solidarity contribution on air tickets, but that should not be the only avenue, and like Mrs Kinnock I should like to suggest other possibilities.
Firstly, Member States can simply decide to accelerate the timetable for reaching the 0.7% GDP target and indeed go beyond it.
In Britain the Liberal Democrats have pledged to reach the 0.7% by 2011, two years ahead of the deadline set by the present UK Government.
Secondly, there is a role for foreign direct investment.
No country has ever been lifted out of poverty by aid alone and countries which have enjoyed the most spectacular rates of development, such as China, have enjoyed high levels of FDI.
The problem is that when foreign investment is negotiated via bilateral investment treaties or as proposed by the WTO at CancÃºn, it can involve exploitation of the weaker partner and the waiving of environmental and social protection.
What is needed is a new international investment agreement under the auspices of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development.
In conclusion, we should explore as many ways as possible for levering extra investment into development, but the methods we choose must have public support and they must never be covert.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
One of the reasons why we are discussing this issue tonight is because there is an international conference in Paris at the end of this month, a key opportunity to make progress on the subject of innovative sources of finance for development.
My group particularly welcomes the fact that this meeting looks set to agree an air ticket levy with proceeds going to benefit some of the worldâs poorest people.
Of course there are a range of other tools and instruments as well.
MrsÂ Kinnock has already spoken very eloquently about the benefits of the IFF.
However, I believe that the air ticket levy is also important because it marks a turning point in the quest for the introduction of global levies for the financing of global development needs.
It deserves our full support.
I would stress, however, that the new finances must be genuinely new: in other words, additional to, and not a substitute for, existing development budgets.
I am very glad that the Commission will be represented at the meeting in Paris, but I would like to know whether it has plans to encourage the other Member States to go, whether there will be a mechanism for feeding back to Parliament the results of the meeting in Paris, and whether there are plans to share the contents of the workshop that took place on 9Â February between the Commission and the Council.
I am sure that many of us would be very interested to know.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party and as a member of the Committee on Development.
The data and figures on poverty send this House a deafening appeal for help.
Over a billion people in the world live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than a dollar a day.
Millions of children still die each year through lack of appropriate health care, clean water, decent dwellings and adequate nutrition, while 20Â 000 people a day die of causes linked to a shortage of food.
In the current state of technological development and agricultural production, the fact that this situation persists is economically irrational, politically unacceptable and morally shameful.
We are therefore eagerly and hopefully looking forward to the work of the forthcoming Paris conference, although we are well aware that not only are greater resources needed, but also other kinds of resources, which must be diverse, innovative and also, perhaps, predictable and stable.
The biggest scandal is not that there is still hunger in the world, but that it persists even though the international community has the means to eliminate it.
The time really has come to turn words into action.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the international debate on substantially increasing development aid from the leading industrialised nations had intensified â and that is a comforting situation â because it is highly likely that we will fail to reach the development goals set by the international community at the turn of the millennium.
There is international consensus that a significant increase in public development funding is needed if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and thus halve poverty in the developing countries.
In its 2004 report, the OECD development centre emphasises the importance of the speed with which the additional funds can be made available.
Time, and the growing poverty in many developing countries, is therefore pressing.
The European Parliament must use the decision to continue to exert pressure on the Member States to achieve the 0.7% threshold for funding provided for development cooperation and to press those Member States â including my own â that do not yet have a plan of how to achieve this by 2015 to draw up such a plan as soon as possible.
It is also important for us to emphasise that these innovative funding methods always involve additional resources.
We must not find any forms of funding that are financed by commitments we have already made.
It has already been mentioned that the international financial facility is a method of doubling the necessary development funding.
However, I think it is a shame that the compromise on the table does not take into account other methods that will be required if we are going to provide enough money in the future.
Perhaps we could improve it further tomorrow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, for 30 years now, the wealthy countries have been unable to fulfil the commitment they made before the UN to increase their development aid to 0.7%.
This is a scandal, and we are all here to search for new ideas.
I find it very regrettable that the Commission should have so few of them, and that the communication that you have been asked to read should be so flimsy.
You did not even mention the British idea of a tax on the movement of capital.
You only mentioned a French idea of a tax on the movement of aeroplanes.
In this quest for new ideas, allow me to propose another one to you.
I believe that it was in its document issued in April 2005 that the Commission proposed the idea of a global lottery.
Mr Michel, whom I myself questioned during a sitting in this very Chamber, acknowledged that this was an option.
You did not even take it up.
Commissioner, I think that the option of a global lottery is easier to follow through than many other options.
The World Food Programme, which took up this idea with the aim of looking into it further, concluded that, on the basis of an estimated minimum of 1% of our countriesâ turnover being spent on each draw, four draws per year would raise an annual sum of USDÂ 400Â million, which the World Food Programme proposes allocating to the measures aimed at preventing children in the world from starving.
Why did not the Commission put its own stamp on this idea?
I take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets: our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do, but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises, this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted, if, in each of the Member States, it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the World Food Programme instead of to the local State authorities.
Setting up a global lottery is an easy thing to do.
I therefore suggest to the Commission that it take the initiative in setting up the lottery and firmly encourages our Member States to implement it.
Â Â  â I have received five motions for resolutions under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to talk about our agenda.
The issues that we are going to discuss this morning are absolutely essential, and I am delighted that our House is able to do so calmly and in a spirit of mutual understanding.
Nevertheless, other subjects had been proposed for inclusion on the agenda, in particular the analysis of the impact of Mittal Steel's hostile bid for Arcelor on the European Union as a whole.
I believe that it would have been appropriate for our House to have given its opinion on that subject.
Â Â  MrsÂ BerÃšs, this is not a point of order.
I appreciate that you wish to talk about this issue, but if you have risen on a point of order, I am afraid that the Presidency must inform you that this is not one and that unfortunately I cannot allow you to carry on speaking.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the controversy we have seen in recent weeks over the caricatures that appeared in a Danish newspaper undoubtedly represents a most regrettable development, in that it touches on something the EU Member States and the EU itself have been striving for over many years: mutual trust and constructive cooperation among the various religious communities in our countries.
The trust and goodwill seen in all the Member States and also expressed by the institutions of the European Union in recent years seem to have been badly shaken.
We have seen violent demonstrations that have even claimed lives.
EU representations and other Member State institutions in various countries have been attacked and damaged.
Threats have been issued and boycotts imposed.
This is a deeply regrettable development, which must prompt us to ask ourselves what has gone wrong and what can be done to prevent such events in future.
A number of principles of our co-existence are at stake and should be discussed in conjunction with this issue.
Firstly, there is a consensus that any form of violence, any violent reaction by militant groups, is to be condemned, as the Council Presidency has explicitly done from the outset.
We also expect the governments responsible to be aware of their responsibilities, including under international law, and to take appropriate preventive measures.
It is now important to help calm and defuse any violence or violent confrontations.
The Council Presidency has been exercising its own political responsibility since the very start of these events.
As early as 30Â January, the Council assured Denmark, Sweden and all the other countries concerned of its complete solidarity, whilst the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in the Council also emphasised the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, which represent a cornerstone of the values championed by the European Union.
Freedom of expression is an important asset, one we must defend and, indeed, for which we have fought long in our societies throughout European history.
At the same time, however, the exercise of the right of free expression, as of any right, entails a great deal of responsibility, on the part of both individuals and institutions.
Early on, the EU, and also the United Nations and other organisations, a notable example being the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued statements attempting to clarify the principles that must be adhered to in the course of this debate.
The joint statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of 7Â February was very important in this regard, putting particular emphasis on responsible conduct where peopleâs religious convictions are concerned as well as on freedom of expression, which entails responsibility â a personal responsibility â on the part of the press.
Our societies do not permit governments to dictate what the independent press may say or may not say, provided it is within the limits set by the legal systems; which is a good thing.
These legal systems must conform to international standards, in particular to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The statement of 7Â February I referred to also rejects and condemns violent attacks and calls for dialogue.
On 8Â February, Ursula Plassnik, Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs and President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, had a telephone conversation with Abdullah GÃŒl, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Our involvement of Turkey in the endeavours to calm the situation has been a conscious decision, as that country is particularly well placed to play a very active, constructive role in promoting dialogue between Europe and the Islamic world.
Austria has also, therefore, invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations â which is under the auspices of the United Nations â to hold its next meeting in Austria.
Austrian Chancellor SchÃŒssel, President of the European Council, issued a statement, also on 8Â February, expressing his consternation at images on the website of an Islamic emigrantsâ organisation in Antwerp and at the call by the Iranian newspaper for a Holocaust-cartoon contest.
We must also take a clear position condemning and rejecting such initiatives and calls.
As you know, the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, is currently in the Middle East.
On 13Â February, he met with the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, to discuss the possibility of a targeted dialogue between Europe and the Islamic world.
The Secretary General and the High Representative will continue this discussion with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States and with representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Israel.
The Council, and also individual Member States, will actively promote the dialogue with the Islamic world and continue along this path of dialogue between civilisations, and between religious communities.
Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Tuomioja, too, has already announced that dialogue will be a key preoccupation of the Finnish Presidency.
Our Presidency will also take further steps to help calm the situation.
The possibility of enhanced dialogue between the EU and the Islamic world will be an important topic at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27 and 28Â February.
The present crisis calls for leadership on the part of the elected political representatives of the EU.
Of course, this leadership cannot and should not consist in attempts by the state to impose a code of conduct on the media.
I have already emphasised the importance to EU values of freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and on no account should this hard-won freedom from censorship be put at risk.
As the European Court of Human Rights has made clear in very many fundamental rulings, this freedom also extends to permitting new, controversial ideas and any kind of discussion, and also entails the freedom to both make mistakes and sharply criticise the mistakes of others.
As the European Court of Human Rights stated in a fundamental ruling 20Â years ago, freedom of expression also extends to potentially offensive or irritating material.
The Court has also stated, however, that this freedom of expression must of course be subject to limits; that is, where the feelings â particularly religious feelings â of others could be offended.
The EUâs political leadership must now take the form of our conveying credibly that freedom of expression and respect for other cultures and religions do not contradict each other, but rather complement and are compatible with each other.
We believe that the response to the present crisis should not be less freedom of expression, but rather credible commitment by a democratic, pluralist Europe to dialogue between cultures and civilisations.
We must convey to the worldâs Muslim communities that we wish to continue to work alongside them in developing a relationship built on trust.
We must communicate to our Muslim fellow citizens in the EU that this Union is a good place, where they and the adherents of other religions are respected and can feel at home, and where they have the opportunity of democratic participation.
It is important that our response to this challenge be based, in particular, on the trust that has been successfully built up in all Member States in the past years, both among religious communities and between politicians and religious communities.
I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to a number of activities that have taken place in my own country, Austria, as this situation very much calls for Member States, too, to assume their responsibilities; and, of course, the Council is also dependent on the activities of the individual Member States in its role as spokesperson on its own behalf and that of the EU as a whole.
One of the most important conversations Austriaâs leading representatives have held in recent days in an attempt to defuse the situation is the one that took place on 7Â February between Foreign Minister Plassnik and Anas Schakfeh, President of the Islamic Communities of Austria.
This emphasised the importance of peaceful co-existence among the various religious communities in our countries and stated that the important thing now is to stand side by side and ensure that our ongoing discussions, which have proved valuable in practice, are also outwardly visible.
This is a culture of dialogue that Austria, like all other Member States, has built up over the years, and which now has to prove itself in a crisis.
In recent months, Austria has seen some very important events, such as a major conference on the subject of âIslam in a pluralist societyâ, attended by large numbers of religious and political leaders: the President of Afghanistan, the President of Iraq, the former President of Iran, religious dignitaries from all religious communities.
Two days ago, the Austrian Chancellor invited all the leaders of the large state-recognised religious communities in Austria to a meeting, at which all participants were unanimous in emphasising that peaceful coexistence, and peaceful â including critical â dialogue, is the only way to prevent developments of the kind seen in recent weeks.
It is important to continue this dialogue, therefore; but also to defend our values, such as the right of free expression.
Â Â  . Mr President, the publication of cartoons in Danish and other European newspapers and the reactions to this have revealed sensitive and fundamental issues.
The cartoons have aggrieved many Muslims all over the world.
We must respect these sensitivities and the expression of them through peaceful protest, which is a fundamental right in any open society.
I share the views expressed by Prime Minister Rasmussen, where he made clear that his government respects Islam as one of the worldâs major religions and that it has no intention of insulting Muslims and does not support activities in this sense.
Today, I should like personally to emphasise my deep respect for Islamic civilisation and the contribution it has made and continues to make to Europe.
The Commissionâs concern is not with the peaceful response of the majority to the cartoons.
It is with the violent reactions of a minority; reactions which have been disowned by many Muslims.
Therefore the Commission condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the violence perpetrated against our office in Gaza, and against the missions of the Member States, in particular those of Denmark.
It is ironic that the aim of these missions is to bring real benefits to the lives of the people of their host countries.
A trade boycott is not an appropriate way of addressing the issue, either: it would hurt the economic interests of all parties and could damage the growing trading links between the European Union and the countries concerned.
Trade, and the greater interconnections it brings, is a means to promote mutual understanding.
Let us be clear: a boycott of Danish goods is by definition a boycott of European goods.
I have spoken with the Prime Minister of Denmark and expressed the solidarity of the Commission.
I want here today to send my solidarity to the people of Denmark as well; a people who rightly enjoy the reputation of being amongst the most open and tolerant not just in Europe, but in the world.
I welcome here today their representatives in the form of a delegation from the Danish Parliament.
I have also spoken with the President-in-Office of the Council, Chancellor SchÃŒssel.
The Commission will continue to work with the Austrian Presidency and all parties to resolve the problem peacefully and efficiently.
This issue raises wider themes.
Our European society is based on respect for the individual personâs life and freedom, equality of rights between men and women, freedom of speech, and a clear distinction between politics and religion.
Our point of departure is that as human beings we are free, independent, equal and responsible.
We must safeguard these principles.
Freedom of speech is part of Europeâs values and traditions.
Let me be clear: freedom of speech is not negotiable.
Like all freedoms, its preservation depends on responsible use by individuals.
We all condemn all forms of prejudice and discrimination wherever and whenever they are expressed. But governments or other public authorities do not prescribe or authorise the opinions expressed by individuals.
Conversely, the opinions expressed by individuals engage these individuals, and only them.
They do not engage a country, a people, a religion and we should not allow others to pretend that they do.
Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is the basis not only of the possibility to publish an opinion or a cartoon, but also to criticise it.
Freedom of speech cuts both ways.
Freedom of speech has limits as well. These must be respected.
They are defined and enforced by the law and legal systems of the Member States of the European Union.
It is self-evidently unacceptable to go outside the law that is decided by democratic institutions.
Freedom of religion is not negotiable either.
Just as Europe respects freedom of speech, so it must â and does â respect freedom of religion.
Religious freedom is a fundamental right of individuals and communities; it entails respect for the integrity of all religious convictions and all ways in which they are exercised.
Muslims are and must be able to practise their faith in the same way as the adherents of other religions and convictions practise theirs.
The European Union and its Member States have for a long time promoted dialogue between different communities both within the European Union and with neighbouring Muslim countries, and in other parts of the world.
It is through a vigorous but peaceful dialogue under the protection of freedom of expression that mutual understanding can be deepened and mutual respect can be built.
I am fostering and will continue to foster dialogue between cultures and with religions.
This dialogue must be based on tolerance, not prejudice, and on freedom of expression and religion and the values connected with them.
Violence is the enemy of dialogue.
We must not allow the minority of extremists to win.
Let the best of our values win against the worst of prejudices.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is following the controversy over the caricatures with great concern.
One thing is crystal clear to us, however, and this forms our guiding principle.
We shall defend freedom of the press, and we shall protect the feelings of believers, irrespective of their religion, and also the symbols that are important to them.
We shall defend human rights and the achievements of the Enlightenment, and we shall uphold the right to profess oneâs faith, to be different and to be respected.
It is only possible to achieve all this at the same time if all parties first remain calm and level-headed.
Therefore, our plea today goes out, in particular, to representatives of the media in Europe, in Iran, in other Islamic countries; it goes out to those who seek to inflate the caricature row to a matter of political principle.
Meeting polemic with polemic, aggression with aggression, and insensitivity with insensitivity, is not the way to a good future.
We want an order that defends freedom of expression as one of the supreme human rights, whilst also being aware of its limits, which are to be found in the freedom and dignity of others.
This order must show respect for the beliefs and religious sensitivities of others, whilst at the same time enabling a peaceful, constructive dialogue on the things that divide us both superficially and deep down at the heart of our being, of our values, experiences and feelings.
It follows from this that violence as a means of agitating or inciting outrage at differing opinions can never be accepted.
We condemn all the instigators of the violent reactions in various countries across the world, for this was no spontaneous reaction â it did not take place until several months after the event â but was organised in part by regimes that do not value freedom of expression, but rather repress their people.
This, too, must be made quite clear.
We oppose all forms of violence; not only against people, but also against objects â flags or buildings â and we condemn them in the strongest terms.
It is important to now add to this a rather more specific approach, as merely pledging ourselves to dialogue between cultures is not sufficient.
I should like to make two very specific proposals; imperfect ones, admittedly, but food for thought nevertheless.
Firstly, because we need to start with the young people, we should set up a committee of experts to examine school books in Europe and in the Islamic world to see the kind of words and values that are being attributed to each other and disseminated by this means.
This committee should be under the joint auspices of the EU and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and, to make it most effective, the UN Secretary-General should be involved in the choice of experts.
We, or rather the Islamic world, have become agitated over a number of caricatures in a European â Danish â newspaper and other newspapers; but this is only one instance of hundreds â not to say thousands â of caricatures, including those in the Islamic world making fun of our â Christian â values and our convictions.
This has to stop: both here and in the countries of the Islamic world.
Secondly, I was among those Members who participated in the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona.
We should use the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to bring together elected politicians and representatives of civil society from Europe and our partner countries for regular dialogue and targeted discussions within the framework of the Barcelona process.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly could thus be a pivotal forum for the dialogue between cultures.
Allow me to make one personal remark.
From 1999 to this year, 2006, I have visited 16Â Arab and Islamic countries.
I recall a conversation with a very committed, credible senior cleric in Saudi Arabia, which was, all in all, a wonderful conversation.
He then asked me how Muslims were treated in Europe.
I replied that we should often like to see better integration, but that Muslims could practise their faith freely.
I then asked a question in return: is it true that, in Saudi Arabia, the law requires that any Muslim wishing to convert to Christianity be punished with death?
I did not receive an answer.
Tolerance is important; but it is a two-way process.
Tolerance, reconciliation and understanding must be based on the truth, and that is what we advocate.
I emphatically welcome what the President of the Commission said: an attack on one Member State is an attack on us all.
In this sense, we of course stand in solidarity with Denmark, and this debate should send out a signal of tolerance and understanding, albeit based on reciprocity and recognition of the truth.
Only then will we be on the path towards a good future based on dialogue between cultures.
Â Â  â MrÂ President; MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council; MrÂ Barroso, President of the Commission; MrÂ Schulz, our group chairman, has asked me to talk today on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and that is something that I am pleased to do where this matter is concerned.
It has been terrible and shocking to see people killed, my own countryâs and other countriesâ flags burned, ambassadors attacked and boycotts implemented, causing large numbers of innocent people to lose their jobs.
It has been doubly depressing, given that our countriesâ history has also been about tolerance of other peoples and about understanding and respect for them.
We have led the way in international solidarity and in economic and political aid to poor peoples around the world.
We have always fought for justice and for peoplesâ right to their own independent states characterised by peaceful co-existence, especially in Palestine.
It is absolutely crucial that the violence we see should not get completely out of hand.
That violence must stop now, and I should like, personally and on behalf of my country, to thank MrÂ Barroso for the clear signal he has sent out today in Parliament and for the solidarity he has shown with my country and with all those countries that have been attacked.
An attack on one Member State is an attack on the European Union as a whole.
It is also important to emphasise, however, that the European Union stands for the opposite of xenophobia and intolerance.
European values are based on respect for peoples and religions.
The whole of our bloody history has taught us the wisdom of mutual understanding, dignity and co-existence.
The first thing I should therefore like to say today to the whole of the Muslim world and to everyone in Europe is that freedom of expression is not something on which we are able to compromise.
No government or ordinary citizen can put a question mark over that freedom.
Freedom of expression does not, however, exist in a vacuum.
It must and will be exercised with responsibility.
Nor can we compromise on respect for other peoples and religions.
This is also fundamental to the human rights on which Europe and the UN are based.
Freedom of expression must therefore go hand in hand with respect for other peoples.
That is the way things have to be.
I should like to use my freedom of expression today to criticise and clearly repudiate the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that appeared in a Danish newspaper a few months ago.
Publishing them was arrogant and disrespectful and reflected a total lack of knowledge of Islam.
I should like to emphasise that the cartoons do not reflect the attitudes of ordinary Danes.
We are well aware, both in Denmark and elsewhere in Europe, that the love of our own country, dignity and religion does not require us to criticise others or talk down to them when what is in question is something they regard as holy.
I also know that many people in Europe cannot understand why the Danish Prime Minister refused to meet ambassadors from the Arab world.
That is something that I too fail to understand.
We cannot, however, change what has happened.
Most important of all is the fact that the Danish Government subsequently used its freedom of expression clearly to express respect for other peoples and their religions, not least Islam.
We must now look forward.
We want to send a clear signal today: we are determined to ignore new provocations, which cannot be used by extremists in Europe and in the Muslim world to inflame violence and intolerance and create new myths about each other.
We have seen it so many times before from xenophobic and populist parties in Europe and from the extremist movements in the Muslim world.
We say ânoâ to those who claim it is âthem against usâ.
For much too long, extremists on both sides have been allowed to play their false tune.
Worst of all, they have inflamed hatred and fear and they have gained an audience for their views.
It is time for moderate and responsible voices to set a new agenda, as Mr Barroso said, a new agenda which clearly and unambiguously shows that there is another way.
We in Europe do not want to add fuel to the extremistsâ fire.
Here, in the European Parliament, we have a clear message: we want to unite all forces in a new and far stronger dialogue with the Islamic world, building on unconditional respect â a respect extending beyond borders and applying to all people and religions.
We know that we live in a globalised world.
That gives us a special responsibility.
In this globalised world it is not âthem against usâ: we are one.
And no, it is not a clash between religions or civilisations.
What we have witnessed are ignorant acts creating humiliation and insult.
This was used by extremists to inflame hatred and violence.
However, trying to understand the broader reactions, those cartoons, together with manipulation from extremists, were the last straw.
Let us not forget the many years of social and economic frustrations in many Muslim societies.
Let us now realise what humiliation and arrogance from those with power and wealth can result in.
Let us not fall prey to short-sighted sanctions but, instead, stand by our economic and political cooperation.
Let us put behind us what the cartoons initiated.
Let it be the last thing to cause provocation, and let the next step unite us to build a stronger dialogue â critical, open, permanent and constructive.
Â Â  . Mr President, today the core message from Liberals and Democrats is to safeguard and defend freedom of speech, not only in Europe but also in Kabul and Tehran.
It is totally unacceptable for violent protests, attacks on embassies, burnings of flags and boycotting of goods to replace dialogue.
That we have seen examples of a European company boycotting Danish goods is unfortunate and not a sign of European solidarity.
We have all been shocked and saddened by the terrible circumstances of the last 14Â days, and no one has been more shocked than me and my fellow Danes.
However, Muslims should recognise that the global tensions have merely increased support for far-right, anti-immigration parties and have been abused by extremists in and outside Europe.
Europeans from all communities must now exercise personal responsibility to quell this rising tide of anger.
We must not let extremists triumph at the expense of the moderate majority, and we must stand together in respect for ArticleÂ 11 of the Treaty to condemn violence and intimidation against Member States.
When the Danish flag and other European flags are burned, the EU should show solidarity, as we have seen today, and reject demands that governments should apologise on behalf of independent media ...
... especially since SectionÂ 77 of the Constitutional Act of Denmark clearly states: âAny person shall be at liberty to publish his ideas in print, in writing and in speech, subject to his being held responsible in a court of law.
Censorship and other preventive measures shall never again be introducedâ.
It should also rebuff efforts by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League to seek a UN resolution, backed by possible sanctions, to ban attacks on religious beliefs.
Such a move would contravene the constitutional basis of many liberal democracies and is an invitation to criminalise freedom of thought on a global scale.
Nobody is denying that Muslims have a right to feel offended by these drawings, just as Sikhs, Jews, Christians or believers of any sort have a right to take umbrage at the press.
However, complaints must be handled through the appropriate legal channels.
In a civilised society, offence can never be grounds for violence.
In a secular, democratic society such as our own, freedom of the press must remain paramount, for it is this freedom that reinforces the principles of democracy and pluralism on which our Union is founded and which are universally acknowledged in international conventions.
As such, all believers should stand up for those values, which ensure that anyone in Europe can practise their religion freely and openly, but also accept the right to be a non-believer.
This is not to say that freedom of the press should mean total freedom to cause offence.
It is self-evident that, after 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London, greater care must be taken to ensure that relations between different communities remain as harmonious as possible.
However, Liberals and Democrats are convinced that the current situation cannot be resolved by the âthought policeâ, but only through dialogue.
From that perspective, we support the Alliance of Civilisations initiative proposed by the UN Secretary-General, and we applaud Justice Commissioner Frattini for organising a round table with media bosses, journalists and religious leaders.
But, Mr Frattini, we draw the line at supporting your proposed code of conduct for the press, and we encourage Mr Solana to draw exactly the same line.
That way lies greater distrust and mutual antagonism, because if communities cannot discuss issues on their cultural fault lines, how will they ever grow into acceptance?
Before I close in Danish, I just want to thank personally the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and my colleagues here in this Chamber for showing their solidarity.
Freedom of expression is a right, but not necessarily a duty.
It is, however, a right that must be neither called into question nor compromised.
If we begin to compromise our freedom of expression and, at the same time, suspend our right to subject all religions to critical analysis, the fundamental right to think and to express ourselves freely will be restricted.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Hannah Arendt described freedom as being disturbing and painful, saying that men may even flee from it, as it can sometimes be difficult and unpleasant.
I believe that there is one thing that we, as politically minded people and politicians, must not do, and that is to attempt to define boundaries for the press, for example.
That is something that politicians cannot and must not do; only society knows what is common sense.
We politicians can of course discuss those actions of ours that are causing offence â for example where, as in Denmark, legislation on foreign nationals has been passed that offends and fails to respect immigrants.
That can be criticised here, as the Council of Europe did in Denmarkâs case.
We can also express criticism where, for example, a questionnaire for Muslims has been drawn up by German that shows Muslims a quite blatant lack of respect.
Politicians can by all means criticise and discuss such things.
Ladies and gentlemen, this whole discussion on limits is a matter for society.
CommissionerÂ Barroso is right: people are entitled to publish caricatures poking fun at us politicians, at me, at MrÂ Poettering or anyone else.
In society, we are entitled to express disapproval.
Muslims are entitled to hold demonstrations in protest â we respect that â in the same way as members of the Jewish community demonstrated against a play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
This is a debate that should be held within society.
We cannot draw up a code of conduct for the press; either the press does that itself or it does not â it is not our job.
In the international debate, it is always pointed out that religions are to be respected.
That may be so, but religions are in the public domain, and as such will be the subject of blasphemous caricatures.
That is as integral to religion and democracy as air is to breathing; it is just the way things are.
It does not mean that one has to approve of these caricatures or consider them to be in good taste.
Freedom is not a matter of good or poor taste.
Freedom is something we have fought for, and no civilisation has yet fallen on account of too much freedom, but always on account of too little; much too little.
I can tell you, therefore, that I do not sympathise with the caricatures.
I can tell you which ones made me smile, which ones made me laugh, which ones I found repellent.
I do sympathise with all those who have fallen victim to violence in this dispute.
I think it dreadful what, for example, large European enterprises such as Carrefour and NestlÃ© have done, running advertisements in Saudi Arabia with the slogan âWe are not Danish, we are Frenchâ.
That is in bad taste, that is a legitimate target for our criticism.
I ask that we all refrain from self-righteousness.
Let us not exempt religion from the social debate, as religions, too, have the right to say what is right or wrong.
We are not supposed to caricature them when they talk nonsense on the issues of abortion or homosexuality; yet we have the freedom to do so, and this is a freedom that we wish to defend.
If we were to show immigrants more respect in this world, if our laws were to show them more respect, they would have the opportunity to discuss our freedoms differently.
Give them the freedoms that we claim for ourselves, and they will use them responsibly.
Â Â  . â Mr President, of all the peremptory judgments expressed so far with regard to the cartoons of Mohammed, there are few I find very convincing.
This issue lends itself to all kinds of oversimplification and I believe that this is a trap that we must avoid at all costs.
It is urgent that we reflect on the various facets of the problems we are facing calmly and in depth.
First of all, there is the issue of freedom of expression, clearly the touchstone of democracy and also the touchstone of the existence of a secular public space to which we quite rightly attach great importance.
In this space, a critical spirit, a personal relationship to oneâs faith and tolerance are supposed to prevail.
These principles must not be compromised, but at the same time let us agree that the defence of these principles must not allow for insults, generalisations or stigmatisation, let alone justify them.
We are constantly saying that we all live in the same world, a world that is getting smaller, in which everything is interdependent and of which neither Europe, the West in general, or any other region, is the centre.
We must draw every possible conclusion from this.
We are constantly being watched by the whole of humanity.
We must therefore strive to create a kind of global public spirit.
Everybody must exercise their freedom while respecting everybody else.
On the other hand, what should we make of the entirely disproportionate reactions of certain Arab States to these incidents, which are surely intended above all to restore the rather tarnished reputation of their leaders amongst their populations, resulting from their submission to a great power that is far more blameworthy than peaceful Denmark?
Elsewhere, the Islamic radicals compete with the European far right to exploit this kind of issue to galvanise their respective troops and to silence the reasonable, courageous and progressive voices with whom they are battling.
The worst thing would therefore be inadvertently to fuel their cause, rather than doing everything possible to break this vicious circle.
We must look beyond this current unrest and the entirely unacceptable excesses that it has generated, and consider the absolutely essential issue that lies behind it, that is to say the heightened expressions of identities wounded by a profound sense of injustice, domination and humiliation, for which the West, from Palestine to Iraq in particular, is responsible.
As the great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, stresses in a more general sense: 'Arabs and Muslims have the impression of being pushed outside of history'.
It is here that I believe Europe could play an essential role: building bridges between civilisations.
But in order for that ambition to be credible, it means being fully liberated from those who, while behaving like the masters of the world, are in reality leading it âÂ we see this a little more every dayÂ â to the brink of a clash.
That also means applying the same international law to all States without exception, in order in particular to put an end to the open wound in the Middle East, which is an endless source of the poison of despair.
The unfortunate cartoons affair should serve to illustrate the strategic options that we are facing!
Â Â  . â Good morning, little EU!
Globalisation has indeed arrived.
I never thought that other people could burn the Danish flag with such passion.
On freedom of expression we will never give in.
Freedom of expression and freedom of religion both need to be respected.
The editor of has apologised for the feelings raised.
He would not have published the cartoons today.
Some Danish imams have distributed the cartoons they do not like.
Why feel so offended by cartoons you spread to as many as possible?
The Danish Prime Minister has rightly refused to take responsibility for the content in our newspapers, but when 11Â Arab ambassadors ask for a meeting, it is a duty for a prime minister to meet them.
He should have explained that freedom of expression is limited by the Danish courts, not by the government.
He should have advised on how to write to the special press authority to have its judgement.
Blasphemy is a crime under the Danish penal code.
Every local editor must show global responsibility.
Cartoons in a newspaper can spread via the internet and global media like wildfire.
Several people have been killed.
The Danish Foreign Minister had an excellent press conference when the Danish embassies were burning.
He talked of dialogue and generosity instead of animosity.
People could be put in jail in Denmark for burning the Koran.
I could not agree more: generosity instead of animosity.
We must learn to respect and cooperate with Muslims, even if we will never surrender freedom of speech.
My group warned against making fundamental rights a part of EU law.
Sensitive judgements on freedom of expression and religious rights must be decided locally under international frameworks decided by the United Nations and the European Convention on Human Rights.
We can offer dialogue in the new joint Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
We can amend our exchange programmes to allow Europeans to visit the Arab world and young Arabs to visit us.
We can open our markets more to their products, make peace and prosperity in the Middle East a priority, but state-sponsored trade boycotts against Danish products must be raised by the EU in the WTO.
Islam is not about the Danish Constitution.
Danish imams have no right to appeal to other nations.
Muslims may use the Danish courts in the same way as all other citizens.
If it is not enough, go to the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg.
Indeed, globalisation has arrived.
We all need to open our minds.
There is no easy one-way ticket back.
We will all have to change a bit to live in a global village.
A third world war can be started by a little cartoon, as the First World War was started when a young student shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
A studentâs shot â or a satirical cartoon â may not be the reason, but let us take the message.
We must all live together on this globe.
We have no other globe available yet.
It is on this planet that we must all live.
Â Â  . â Mr President, when discussing the right to freedom and freedom of expression, one of the Supreme Court judges in the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes, said that there are no absolute rights; rights can be restricted.
The example he gave was that you do not have a right to shout âfireâ in a crowded cinema, unless there is a fire.
One of the difficulties we face in our discussions is the justifiable desire to ensure that the press and media in Europe have freedom of expression, the freedom to poke fun, the freedom to satirise, the freedom, in some cases, to insult people.
A democracy, by its very nature, needs the safety valve of humour and offence in order to operate properly.
I do not think anybody in this house could in any way condone the violent reaction in certain countries in the Middle East to the publication of those cartoons and caricatures.
Unfortunately, what has been forgotten in the debate, discussion and media coverage, is that there were also many peaceful protests, where Muslims and non-Muslims came together because they found the cartoons and the images they represented offensive, not to their religious belief , but to them as human beings.
Respect for human dignity is as important a right in any democracy as the right to freedom of expression.
One of the greatest challenges facing us in the European Union today is to ensure that we do not have a knee-jerk reaction to every horror or outrage.
For me, coming from a small country like Ireland, it was shocking to see a Danish embassy burned and the flag of a country that has stood up for freedom and against intolerance burned in public.
Likewise, I found it particularly distasteful and very hard to watch the media coverage of a minority element at some of those demonstrations who were inflicting pain on themselves, especially young people.
There is an old saying in the media that if it bleeds, it leads; the more dramatic the image, the better chance it has of making the headlines.
How can Europe respond?
President Barroso rightly said that Europe stands in solidarity with our Danish colleagues, because a boycott of Danish goods is a boycott of all European goods.
We must ensure that we can help our colleagues in the Danish Government withstand the pressure they are being put under by voices in the media to go back on their present position.
Even if we are critical of the politics of the Danish Government and its exercise of tact and skill, Prime Minister Rasmussen did stand up for one principle. He said that he would not be backing down on the question of government or parliament controlling the media.
In 50 yearsâ time he will be feted for that; it is one of the bulwarks of democracy.
My last point is that some people on both sides of this argument will try and present it as a clash of civilisations or religions or cultures.
Respect and tolerance are needed more than anything else now.
We must respect differences and give a proper and meaningful role to the different religions in the European Union, but we expect mutual recognition.
Freedom can never be given away.
It can be taken from you, but the freedom that allows us to have the passions that burn in our hearts and souls must always be preserved and protected.
Â Â  Mr President, all in all, I think it is a disgrace how little solidarity most European governments have shown towards Denmark in this situation.
It is equally shameful how today again, in a grovelling and cowardly fashion, the most carefully chosen words of solidarity are immediately followed by all kinds of caveats so as not to offend the Islamofanatics.
We should all feel Danish, because the criminal campaigns mounted against embassies, the boycott of Danish products, the threats and violent demonstrations are, in fact, directed against freedom and against the West as a whole.
Anyone who responds to this threat with a scantily disguised appeal for self-censorship becomes, in fact, an ally of terror.
Can I, in fact, repeat in this Chamber the question for which the editor-in-chief of a Jordanian newspaper was arrested and put behind bars?
What would cause more prejudice against Islam â the publication of a few caricatures, or images of Islamic hostage takers who cut the throats of their victims in front of the camera?
Can I also ask the question whether anywhere in the world, there is one Islamic country where atheists or people adhering to other faiths are given the respect that Muslims demand from us?
To ask the question is to answer it, and it is therefore high time we stopped beating about the bush and asked Muslims who live in Europe and who, by the way, enjoy freedom of religion, the free expression of opinion and all the blessings of social security, quite rightly so, to take themselves less seriously and to realise that democracy is about differences of opinion and sometimes clashing viewpoints.
Anyone who cannot live with this would do well to use their freedom to move to one of the many countries where the inflexible and often very cruel laws of Islam already apply.
I would like to quote the Danish Queen Margarethe II, with whom I am in complete agreement and who appears to be much more spirited than most European leaders put together: âThese days, we are being challenged by Islam nationally and internationally.
We have left this issue unaddressed for far too long, because we were tolerant or even perhaps complacent.
We must show our opposition to Islam and accept the risk of being given unfavourable labels at timesâ.
Let us therefore defend, tooth and nail, the free expression of opinion.
Let the European countries where laws inimical to liberty are already in place to curb the free expression of political opinion â Belgium for example â take the initiative to abolish these laws which muzzle people and thereby send a strong message to anyone who combats freedom.
We should also draw lessons from this for the negotiations with Turkey, because Turkey can never become a European Member State, simply because it is not a European country, and also because the basic principles of Islam are incompatible with the European values of freedom, separation of church and state and gender equality.
It is time we mustered the courage to say this, certainly now Prime Minister Erdogan has been arrogant enough to seek to impose restrictions on the free expression of opinion.
On a final note about this Danish issue, I should like to add an impressive quote from MrsÂ Doornaertâs column in the Flemish newspaper : âEurope appears to be unable to shake off its tendency for appeasement.
It should have learnt by now that it is impossible to appease a totalitarian monster.
The more you feed it, the more insolent it becomesâ.
MrsÂ Doornaert and her newspaper certainly do not think along the same political lines as I do, but those are prophetic words and we would do well to ponder them very carefully.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my place, of course, to comment on a debate in this House, but I should like to express my most sincere thanks on behalf of the Council for the strong message that has been sent out today: one of commitment to our values, but also to tolerant dialogue with other civilisations and religions.
I should also like to emphasise that the Council naturally considers it very important that all the institutions of the EU â the Commission and Parliament as well as the Council â agree on this and speak the same language; I consider that most important.
The debate that we have held here today will also make the Councilâs job easier in future.
On behalf of the Council, I wish to reiterate what I said in my introductory statement â which has also been said by the President of the Commission and also very many speakers: any attack on a Member State of the EU, any boycott against a Member State of the EU, is an attack on the EU, and we of course stand in solidarity with Denmark.
This I say also on behalf of the Council.
A number of very interesting ideas have been put forward here, which the Council will be happy to take up.
I agree with MrÂ Poettering that it is important to reach out also â or particularly â to the young people: in schools, and also at home, as their education naturally begins at home.
I also agree with MrÂ Poettering that it is important to avoid stereotypes and clichÃ©s in school books, too, and so I think that the idea of examining these is a good one.
I could not agree more with MrÂ Rasmussen on the importance of dialogue between civilisations and on the need for the dialogue to be open, critical and respectful: that seems to me to be most important.
Indeed, extremists must not be allowed to triumph: this is a fundamental statement that must be made here.
It goes without saying that no benefit should induce us to bow down to extremists: we must show solidarity and unity on this.
I could not agree more with MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, and I also said in my statement that I, too, am of the opinion that the responsibility of the press is a personal one, and that governments should not tell it what it can or cannot do.
I am aware that, over the years and decades, institutions such as the Council of Europe have made repeated attempts to draw up a code of conduct; all of which have failed.
I believe that this is a personal responsibility; that is very important.
In the same spirit shown by todayâs debate, the Council will continue to work on improving understanding between civilisations and between religious communities, but will also speak in plain terms when it comes to rejecting violence, and when it comes to condemning the use of violence or boycotts against Member States of the EU.
We must show solidarity on this.
Â Â  To end the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of this resolution because I defend freedom of speech as a European and universal value and because I condemn violence as an expression of indignation, regardless of its target, and that includes European interests and embassies.
I also voted in favour because the second paragraph of the resolution condemns incitement to religious hatred and the dissemination of racist and xenophobic attitudes.
That being said, I feel that the resolution as a whole is unbalanced, because it focuses primarily on freedom of expression and not on the islamophobic intentions behind the cartoons published by an extreme right-wing, racist and xenophobic newspaper in Denmark.
If it is to promote freedom of expression and the most basic human rights, Parliament must categorically distance itself from islamophobia and must condemn any attempts to correlate Islam and its believers with terrorism.
My vote for this resolution was also an expression of my solidarity with the people of Denmark.
I do not, however, approve of the complacent, arrogant attitude of the Fogh Rassmussen Government, which I hold jointly responsible for the fact that extremist reactionary forces, both in the West and in the Islamic world, have made capital from the incident by invoking the âclash of civilisationsâ.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the confrontation between Iran and the international community.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in this Council statement on the confrontation between Iran and the international community, I should like to comment on the following issues: firstly, the nuclear issue, secondly, relations between the EU and Iran and, thirdly, the recent violence in Tehran.
The resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue is a key concern for the international community, which has serious doubts about the peaceful nature of Iranâs nuclear programme.
Over recent years, the EU has spared no effort to find a solution by negotiation and to urge Iran to adopt confidence-building measures with regard to its nuclear programme.
Iran has been moving in the wrong direction recently by taking unilateral action, most recently resuming uranium-enrichment activities at Natanz and suspending application of the IAEA Additional Protocol.
The adoption by the IAEA Board of Governors of its resolution of 4Â February bringing the matter to the attention of the Security Council of the United Nations gave a clear signal to Iran.
The large majority by which the resolution was adopted demonstrates that Europeâs deep concern about Iranâs nuclear programme is shared by the international community as a whole.
The EU is by no means calling into question Iranâs right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
The cause of this conflict lies in Iranâs failure to take sufficient action to date to build the necessary confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.
On the contrary, over the last 18Â years, Iran has failed to declare a substantial part of its very extensive nuclear programme to the IAEA, and is still refusing to provide it with important information concerning, in particular, the extent of development of its uranium-enrichment technology and the field of âweaponisationâ â that is, the militarisation of its nuclear programme.
The EUâs objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation.
Yet this requires that Iran show sufficient willingness to be cooperative and open, in particular towards the IAEA, and to take urgently needed confidence-building measures such as suspending sensitive nuclear activities.
The Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil as an alternative to enrichment in Iran is an important contribution and has the full support of the EU.
Let me reiterate quite clearly that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, in which the IAEA must play a key role.
Involving the Security Council is not tantamount to diminishing the role of the IAEA, but rather is intended to strengthen the IAEAâs authority and make it possible to implement the measures required by the resolutions of its Board of Governors.
On the subject of relations between the EU and Iran, the EU still regards the human-rights situation in Iran with great concern.
The situation is worsening, and the Iranian authorities are not taking any tangible action to reform legislation or official practices.
Despite repeated requests by the EU, Iran has failed to make any further commitment to resuming the stalled human-rights dialogue.
The EU will continue to voice its human-rights concerns, both directly to the Iranian Government and in public statements and international forums.
The statements made by the Iranian President on Israel have been unambiguously and strongly condemned by the EU and the international community as a whole.
Iranâs position on the Middle East gives grounds for grave concern.
It still supports Palestinian groups that the EU classifies as terrorist organisations.
We note with concern that the Iranian President recently met some of the leaders of such groups in Syria, and we call on Iran to end such contacts.
In addition, we call for it to join the international consensus on the necessity of a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.
The repeated attempts by the Iranian President to deny the crimes of the Holocaust, and his calls for the state of Israel to be âwiped off the mapâ, are to be firmly rejected.
Statements such as this are completely unacceptable and, furthermore, are totally at odds with the efforts of the numerous political and religious leaders who are specifically working on all sides to promote a dialogue between the cultures that is characterised by mutual respect, particularly following the events of recent days.
The EUâs relations with Iran will depend on progress made on all of the issues of concern: the nuclear issue and other concerns in connection with weapons of mass destruction, human rights, the fight against terrorism and the countryâs position on the Middle East.
The options for action by the EU will be kept under close review and weighed up in the light of Iranâs declarations and actions.
On the subject of the violence: as has been clearly underlined in the debate in this House, the attacks on bodies of the European Union are in no way justifiable, and are completely unacceptable.
The EU Presidency has condemned these attacks and called on Iran to meet its obligations with regard to the protection laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.
In accordance with these obligations, the Presidency has also reminded Iran that responsibility under international law for ensuring compliance with these obligations lies with the state.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is clear that Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back in order to regain the confidence of the international community.
For the past few months the nuclear file has been at the centre of EU concerns with Iran, and rightly so.
The region does not need further tension and prospects of nuclear escalation.
Despite the persistent efforts for dialogue of the so-called EU-3 and of other international partners, Iran has not engaged in a convincing way.
That is why, as a result of the vote of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board in Vienna on 4Â February, Iranâs nuclear dossier is now to be reported to the United Nations Security Council.
The Iranian reaction was the decision to step up its enrichment programme and to cease implementing the additional protocol.
That is unacceptable news, although Iran expected to continue cooperating with the IAEA on the basis of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
A substantial majority of the international community, including Russia and China, now stand firmly behind the reporting of Iran to the Security Council, agreeing that Iran needs to return to a suspension of its enrichment activities.
There must be no mistake in Tehran about the resolve of the international community.
At the same time the door still remains open for a negotiated settlement through diplomatic efforts, provided that Iran takes the necessary steps.
Iranâs tactic of trying to divide the international community proved unsuccessful on this occasion, as it did last autumn.
The Russian proposal to enrich uranium outside of Iran is still on the table and needs to be explored fully.
If Iran returns to a suspension of its enrichment activities and accepts the Russian proposal, the Security Council track may not prove necessary.
The prospects depend very much on the will of Tehran to compromise and engage with the international community, and to do so swiftly.
We shall not speculate on further steps, but if the situation continues to deteriorate, we will need to consider options for further action through the United Nations.
The United Nations Security Council will revert to the issue in the light of MrÂ ElÂ Baradeiâs report and the next meeting of the IAEA Board starting on 6Â March.
Conversely, if things evolve in the right direction, more could be done through Community actions.
If and when the situation calls for that, we must be able to re-engage Iran through a series of EU and Community instruments.
We are ready to engage constructively, and Iran knows that.
The nuclear issue is not a dispute between Iran and Europe or between Iran and the United States, but between Iran and the larger international community.
Nor is it a dispute about Iranâs right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
It is about Iranâs failure to build the necessary confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.
Indeed, Iran has the right to develop research, production and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
For that, without discrimination, we need objective guarantees on the peaceful nature of Iranâs nuclear programme.
I should like to say a few words about President Ahmadinejadâs statements on issues that affect regional stability and international relations.
His unacceptable remarks regarding Israel and the Holocaust sparked global outrage.
We feel that those statements are a profound offence to all of us.
It is also totally unacceptable â as the Presidency has just said â that Iran continues to support terrorist organisations in the Middle East.
With regard to human rights, you may recall that on 12Â December the General Affairs and External Relations Council found the situation grave enough to adopt conclusions on the state of EU-Iran human rights dialogue.
Stating what is for me a fundamental requirement vis-Ã -vis Iran, the European Union reaffirmed that greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran is essential if there is to be progress in EU-Iran relations.
I should like to emphasise some points of major concern.
There have been an increasing number of public executions and death sentences â juvenile executions in particular.
Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year.
There are restrictions on freedom of expression, with widespread censorship of the internet and the press â even the former speaker of parliament and presidential candidate, Mr Karroubi, could not get authorisation to broadcast his new television channel from Dubai.
On the plight of human rights defenders, we are very much concerned about the fate of prisoners of conscience, such as Mr Akbar Ganji and his lawyer MrÂ Abdolfattah Soltani.
The list of human rights concerns in Iran remains worryingly long.
The Commission looks forward to a continued exchange with Parliament regarding the matter of Iran.
The situation is critical, but the long-term objective continues to be, despite everything, that deeper and broader relations should be established with a country that is an important regional and international player.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to declare our full support for the policy of the international community on Iran, as revealed in the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors of 4Â February, the position of the EU General Affairs Council of 30Â January, and the statement issued by the EU-3 together with the USA, Russia and China in London.
In the government of my home country, too, ChancellorÂ Merkel and Minister for Foreign Affairs Steinmeier are together resolutely following this course.
It must be made clear to Iranâs leaders that they cannot create divisions within the international community, nor â naturally â within the individual bodies of the EU.
Parliamentâs resolution today will make that clear.
We recognise the fundamental right of all parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful, civil purposes; but Iran has crossed so many red lines that confidence in the regimeâs honourable intentions has faded.
Neither its reduced cooperation with the IAEA, its Presidentâs threat that Iran would leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty, its postponement of the talks with Russia that had been scheduled for this Thursday nor, in particular, its resumption of uranium enrichment, are conducive to building confidence and defusing the situation.
This makes it all the more important to continue to present a resolute, united front to Iran.
Anything that could now be conducive to giving Tehran the impression of division or compliance is unhelpful.
Those who believe that our unconditional desire for peace alone will induce our opposite numbers to change course and see the light are doing our natural yearning for peace a disservice.
Particularly when our counterparts are preaching hatred and hostility, and deliberately acting contrary to the expectations of the international community, we should not disclose to the other side everything that we might do as a consequence of their actions.
I do not believe that the scope for diplomatic efforts has yet been exhausted.
We are offering constructive cooperation.
We are calling on Iran to resume cooperation with the IAEA before the issue is discussed in the Security Council.
We also support Russiaâs offer of uranium enrichment for civil purposes outside Iran.
We cannot help wondering why Iran wants its own enrichment facilities.
The country does not operate a single âŠ
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should have been surprised if it did not.
However, I should also like to ask the House to reflect on what is more important: having time for a proper debate, or Members of this House complaining when a vote is taken.
I should have liked to hear MrÂ Gahler out, as what he was saying was most fascinating.
Indeed, the question he raised is one of the ones that preoccupies us most at the present time.
How do we deal with a regime that is quite blatantly pushing all its boundaries?
How do we respond to that as an international community?
In my speech I shall try to add some further questions from the point of view of my group.
It is not necessary to comment in this House on the remarks made by the Iranian President.
A Head of State who denies the Holocaust, and who calls into question Israelâs right to exist, is not a fitting dialogue partner for us.
All the values that President Ahmadinejad stands for are the opposite of those we stand for, and I should welcome a debate on values with these people.
We have already had a debate on values this morning; and that was good â it was a serious, considered debate.
We should hold a calm, self-confident debate, and see whether there are others in the region besides President Ahmadinejad with whom we can hold dialogue.
We should reflect on options open to us before we philosophise about options closing.
Are there not sufficient moderate countries in the region who are open to dialogue and with whom we can cooperate, who may not share our values one-to-one, but to whose interests it is also entirely detrimental to have Iran become a leading nuclear power in the region?
Yes, there are, and, in my view, they are suitable dialogue partners for the EU.
In this connection, of course, the conflict over the caricatures not only comes at the worst possible time, but is even counterproductive in the extreme, for these are the very countries with whom we need a relationship of mutual respect.
Solving this caricature conflict is also central to solving the problems of the region as a whole, therefore.
For this reason, I would advise against equating âIranâ and âIslamâ.
The actions of one aggressive Head of State of one country do not in any way reflect the views of the vast majority of peace-loving Muslims around the world, with whom we have to cooperate.
I think it is right that all enrichment activities â that is, those by all countries â should be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as proposed by the IAEA itself.
We should support this proposal.
I also think, incidentally, that it is perfectly justifiable to refresh memories and say that the debate on nuclear disarmament should not be limited to this region: it needs to be universal.
In this connection, allow me to point out that treating countries who already have nuclear weapons differently from those who are on the way to having them, and carrying out pre-emptive strikes against countries who did not have any weapons of mass destruction, only encourages regimes to procure nuclear weapons as quickly and illegally as possible, because those who own them will not be attacked.
This is a logic that also needs to be discussed, one that was triggered by a pre-emptive strike carried out in the same region in the past, which was utterly wrong and which we vehemently opposed.
I believe that the logic behind this was extremely dangerous, and that is why we have to abandon this strategy of goal-based thinking, as it leads to the militarisation of thought.
We must reinforce our diplomatic options step by step.
It was an enormous accomplishment on the part of the EU-3 to bring China and Russia together and thus give Iran a clear signal that the international community will not allow itself to be divided.
Let us talk about diplomatic successes instead of philosophising about military options.
The international community should do everything in its power to make it clear to Iran that failure to return to the negotiating table by 6Â March will automatically trigger a referral to the Security Council.
Subsequent action should then be decided there, however, rather than by just any central government.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after two and a half years of intensive research and inspections, the International Atomic Agency has been unable to confirm the peaceful character of the Iranian nuclear programme, and basic questions remain unanswered.
Iranâs recent decisions to resume the uranium enrichment activities and to suspend all voluntary cooperation with the Agency are particularly worrying, not least in the light of the Iranian Presidentâs statements denying Israelâs right to exist and of the general tightening of rules that has been noted in Iran.
Now that the issue has been passed on to the Security Council, things are gaining momentum, even though it has been decided to wait for the next report which MrÂ ElÂ Baradei will be submitting on 6 March.
The stakes are extraordinarily high.
The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of weapons of mass destruction is in the balance.
The stability of the entire region is at risk, as is the effectiveness of the International Atomic Agency itself.
It is very rare that I put things in such strong terms, but I am warning you that this issue is placing the whole international rule of law under pressure.
Even if the conference reviewing the non-proliferation treaty fails, which would be very regrettable indeed, even then the permanent members of the UN Security Council, including China and Russia, and the others â you are familiar with them â together with the European Union, appear today to be of one mind in seeking to prevent proliferation in a peaceful manner, and that is indeed cause for modest satisfaction.
It is now up to Iran, in full transparency and renewed cooperation with the Agency, to convince the world that it only has peaceful objectives in mind
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to recognise that this situation is escalating.
We have to realise that the strategy of President Ahmadinejad is a new one.
He is intent on a breach with the West, on building up an Islamic region and taking over its leadership.
We are seeing a mobilisation of national pride in Iran.
How should Europe respond to this?
I expect us to be guided by reason and make clear analyses.
I agree with MrÂ Schulz when he says that we have to abandon the âstrategy of goal-based thinkingâ, that we need new dialogue partners, and that we must be active in prioritising diplomacy.
I would also say, however, in view of the difficult negotiations over recent days, that the military option has been discussed, and I ask those who have this in the back of their minds to think it through.
I expect them to define how they propose to deal with a military escalation, and tell us whether the way they do so will enable us to achieve our objectives, namely preventing Iran developing nuclear weapons and ensuring Israelâs existence.
I do not believe that it will.
For this reason, I would appeal once more to this House to take account, in todayâs vote, of our argument â which we were unable to push through in negotiations â that we should now refrain from toying with any ideas of a military approach, and subsequently to put the emphasis on diplomacy â in spite of all the hate speeches by President Ahmadinejad.
The questions as to whether sanctions should be imposed, what sanctions are appropriate and whether world peace is at risk, are not for PresidentÂ Chirac to answer, the man who suddenly issued the threat of France using nuclear weapons; nor are they for ChancellorÂ Merkel to answer.
The vital issue of world peace is to be decided by the United Nations and no one else, and we should not forestall them.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is nothing whatsoever to recommend the Tehran theocracy.
It is an ignorant and arrogant regime, as proved by the statements made by its President on the holocaust; not even Le Pen would plumb such depths.
This is a reactionary and fundamentalist regime that violates human rights on a daily basis, a dangerous and reckless regime that is staking its survival on uranium enrichment, thus edging it nearer to the club of countries with nuclear weapons.
Let us be absolutely clear: Europe must do everything, short of waging war, to prevent Tehran from having nuclear weapons.
This is why we do not accept the motion for a resolution, and in particular point 7 thereof.
Referring the Iran question to the United Nations Security Council is an inappropriate, irresponsible step, as it brings the world closer to another pre-emptive war, this time in the form of surgical military intervention.
Europe has an alternative to escalating the dispute: it can and must turn what is currently a problem into an extraordinary opportunity for the human race and for the Iranian people.
I should like to remind you of Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and I quote:
âEach of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.â
This, rather than war, should be the starting point.
The United States, which is a signatory to the Treaty, has an opportunity to reverse the underlying military approach in negotiations with Iran.
The Council takes the view that the Union has yet to do all it can, so it is time for Chirac, Blair and Merkel to offer the world a sign of good faith.
Â Â  . Mr President, not being myself a Shiite, I have to say that the Islamic Republic of Iranâs current atomic aspirations really are beyond me.
After all, the founder of this Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, emphatically rejected nuclear energy as âun-Islamic technologyâ.
These days, President Ahmadinejad regards atomic energy as a blessing from Allah, so that really does amount to a splitting of the Shiites, if not of the atom.
At the same time, I am still confused about Teheranâs atomic intentions.
On the one hand, we hear from the Supreme Leader Khamenei very reassuring words about the use of weapons of mass destruction being prohibited in Islam; it is in line with this that Iranian leaders claim to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
On the other hand, the whole Persian atomic programme shows every sign of that country secretly seeking to possess a nuclear weapons capability, hence the cat and mouse game that Teheran has, for years, played with the Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna.
I ask the Council and the Commission: where do we go from here?
Whatever you do, I urge you to stand for no more nonsense from the mullahs, in short, to keep all your options open against a terrorist regime that so far has only played for time and wishes to drive a wedge between the European Union and the US, and Israel, respectively.
Meanwhile, the Iranian nuclear clock is still ticking ominously; you must persuade the Russians and the Chinese, by a combined effort, to stop it.
That is the kind of European diplomatic activity that I am expecting to see.
Â Â  . Mr President, the President of Iran tells us that his country, like any other, has a right to nuclear weapons.
This might be true if Iran were a normal state, but it is not.
It is a dictatorship that has openly challenged the right of one of its neighbours to exist.
Consequently, Israel may well be the first target of Iranian aggression and it should have our guarantee of security right now.
As things stand, the course of events in Iran depends on the worldâs powers standing as one.
This will be difficult to achieve, since Russia is seeking to profit from Iranâs nuclear programme and is selling weapons to Iran, as is China, while India is planning to build a gas pipeline from that country.
It therefore falls to Europe to take the lead and play an active role in resolving the conflict.
Will Europe prove up to the task of working out a common strategy with the United States, or will it succumb to the next delusion born of the fertile Iranian imagination in Teheran?
If the UN Security Council is not equal to the task, if we fail to change Iran's policy through a programme of economic and financial sanctions, we should not be surprised to see fighter planes in the skies above Natanz or Isfahan at some point in the future.
Â Â  â There was something touching in the way the Austrian Secretary of State stumbled through the script presented to him on the subject of Iran and its atomic energy programme.
It shows how far removed from these issues representatives of the Austrian Government have become in the first decade of the third millennium.
That is a good thing; we have learnt our lessons from history, and the first speech by the Secretary of State had a lot to say about responsibility.
Combining the two, the obvious course of action would actually be to take initiatives, to say that we need an even wider perspective on this conflict than that indicated by the previous speakers.
We must not do things back to front, we must start with the basics, and that means âno nukesâ.
It is incomprehensible why some, the âgood guysâ â who decides who those are? â are allowed such weapons, whilst others are not.
If the Secretary of State starts there from an Austrian perspective, he may be able to do a great deal of good in the longer term rather than just being superficially diplomatic and pleasant in the short term.
Â Â  Mr President, for some years Iran has sought to export its fundamentalist revolution beyond its Shia lands to Sunni population areas, including Palestine, where, through Syria and its proxy terrorist Hezbollah, it liaises with Islamic Jihad and Hamas, both committed to theocracies under Sharia law.
A nuclear-armed Iran is therefore particularly dangerous to Western security, and that of Israel in particular.
There is no consensus on how to deal with Iran, which is in clear breach of the NPT Treaty and its agreements with Britain, France and Germany, but I welcome the 3Â February vote by the IAEA to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council.
I also welcome China and Russiaâs belated support.
The traditional compact â whereby Iran supports Russia in the OIC over Chechnya in exchange for Russian support in supplying nuclear technology, and its Security Council veto when necessary â seems now to be dissolving.
China naturally rejects further nuclear proliferation and is also worried by its own home-grown Islamist threats.
Iranâs intransigence and refusal of the reasonable Russian offer on enrichment of uranium has been a wake-up call to Russia and China.
Only Syria, Cuba and Venezuela rejected the proposal.
The Iranians immediately pledged to resume commercial-scale enrichment of uranium, which can be used either as a fuel for power plants or, as they really wish, in the core of an atom bomb.
They have ordered an end to the unannounced visits by the IAEA inspectors.
Western intelligence alleges that Iran is using a network of front companies to try and buy components for missile and bomb production from western Europe and to hire impoverished nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union.
I agree with all those who say that all options must be left available to the West to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.
I ridicule the appeasing statement by the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who claims that military action is inconceivable, whereas his boss, Prime Minister Tony Blair, rightly refuses to rule it out.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to remind Members of certain fundamental mistakes made by many people during the Iraq affair when assessing the intentions of Saddamâs regime regarding weapons of mass destruction.
Intelligence, then and today, is largely inconclusive, if not misleading.
It is based largely on inferences and is often lacking in hard data.
The best intelligence agencies today do not have a single reliable source in Iran capable of providing information on Tehranâs intentions and capabilities.
While it may not be perfect, the IAEA is the only means of monitoring any nuclear programme in Iran.
Between 1991 and 1998, and despite Saddamâs best efforts from 1992 onwards, the IAEA could not declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction.
So let us avoid making further costly mistakes based on confusing mistrust with well-founded suspicion.
This is what warmongering politicians are trying to instil in our minds, and it is simply illogical.
One of the lessons we should learn from the Iraq nuclear case is very simple: it was the bombing of the Osirak reactor in 1981 that led Saddam to decide to have a serious nuclear programme.
I can easily imagine what disasters could result from a so-called âsurgical strikeâ of this kind today.
We have the time to negotiate, we have solid political and legal grounds to request that Iran comply fully with the NPT and there is a political and social opposition in Iran that is far from toothless, but, if we want to create the conditions for security and stability in the Middle East, we, as Europeans, must make it clear to all sides that international rights and obligations are the same for everyone.
This also means that our American friends must change the political paradigm with Iran, acknowledging that their past approaches have been ineffective and that they need to adopt a more collaborative policy in order to safeguard everybodyâs interests in this crucial part of the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in Iran provides genuine grounds for concern.
Not only is the human rights situation deplorable, but the regime also mocks the world community by violating international principles and ignoring the IAEAâs demands.
The idea of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is, of course, incredibly frightening, especially in the light of its statements about, and threats against, Israel and in terms of what such a development would mean for the rest of the region.
The disturbances surrounding the cartoons of Muhammad also appear perfectly to suit the regime in Tehran, and there are many indications that it is precisely Tehran that is fomenting the disturbances.
It is time for the EU to formulate a very clear strategy in relation to Iran.
It should have several different dimensions: international cooperation, clear support for dissidents and forces of democracy, such as the referendum movement, within and outside Iran, vigorous condemnation of the serious human rights violations, pressure on Iran to comply with international conventions and, of course, dialogue and diplomacy.
This strategy should, however, also include preparing possible sanctions decided on in the UN Security Council.
Â Â  Mr President, it appears that our strategy against the Iranian regime has largely failed.
Nowadays in Iran we are seeing the worst phase of the theocratic regime: executions are continuing, human rights are at their worst in Iranian history; the mixture of religion and politics is heavier than in any other part of the world and the government is mobilising its own people and other peoples in the Middle East against democracy.
I think everybody accepts that developing nuclear power and nuclear weapons in Iran would be dangerous for the whole region.
For that reason, I agree that we must act carefully when we speak about nuclear power in the region, because we could give the Iranian regime the ideal excuse to continue with its nuclear programme.
Iranian leaders could be tempted to say that if Israel does not stop its nuclear programme, then Iran has the right to develop its own.
We have to be aware of the fact that when we are taking about the Iranian regime we are also talking about Syria and Lebanon, the future of the peace process in Israel and Palestine, theocracy and democracy, human rights and universal values.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the joint motion for a resolution is very problematic.
Paragraphs 4 and 7 support the escalating position of the EU-3.
This time, the EU-3 is greatly contributing to the escalation.
Jacques Chiracâs remark that he is prepared to use nuclear weapons against âterroristâ states is scandalous.
The historical comparison drawn by Angela Merkel, too, is completely unacceptable.
It is not only Iranâs atomic energy programme that is dangerous; the nuclear weapons in the EU â France and the United Kingdom â and the USA should also be disarmed in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
The use of nuclear energy in itself is problematic.
Summoning Iran before the UN Security Council is the first step towards a military attack on Iran.
All military options must be ruled out; German SPD chairman Matthias Platzeck is absolutely right about this.
The war in Iraq is obviously a blueprint for the conflict with Iran. The unspeakable comments by the Iranian President on Israel and the human rights violations in the country must not be exploited for the purposes of a policy of war against Iran.
Â Â  â Mr President, we need to debate in order to see what we fear: nuclear weapons or the person in possession of nuclear weapons?
We fear the person in possession.
We do not fear nuclear weapons, because when Israel acquired nuclear weapons a few years ago by the same method, we did not kick up such a fuss.
You will tell me that Israel has a democracy, while Iran has a dictatorship.
Yes, but Pakistan also has a dictator â Musharef â and we allow it to have nuclear weapons.
So let us look at the facts.
The story of David and Goliath is repeating itself.
Slings and stones were not allowed then, but David used them and his name went down in history.
What are the facts?
The facts are that we want our allies to have nuclear weapons and noÂ one else.
That is intimidation and it is an-ti-de-mo-cra-tic!
We should engage in dialogue, not threats.
Threats always lead in the wrong direction.
They lead to invasion, they lead to war, they lead to death.
NoÂ one ever got hurt from di-a-logue!
We should provide an opportunity, we should talk, however much the other side digs its heels in.
We must make an effort, because we are the more civilised.
Â Â  MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, it has been clear for some time that the Iranian nuclear issue would be considered at the UN Security Council.
Let us recall that at the end of last year, when the European Parliamentâs report on weapons of mass destruction was debated, it was precisely Iranâs nuclear programme that triggered the most vigorous debates.
The Membersâ call at that time for constructive action was shrugged off with the stance that only the path of negotiation would solve the Iranian problem.
It is obvious, however, that tensions between Iran and the international community have only increased.
Ladies and gentlemen, recent months were a time for the consolidation of international action.
Now, not just the International Atomic Energy Agency but all five permanent members of the UN Security Council unanimously acknowledge that Iranâs nuclear programme is not of a peaceful nature.
Certainly, it is not the European Parliament that will decide on the further course of events, but we must stress that the inability of the states to agree on joint action at the 2005 review conference of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) only gave rise to an obsession among Iranâs leadership.
Ladies and gentlemen, while the Iranian nuclear issues are considered at the UN Security Council, in this situation the European Parliament and national parliaments must again and again highlight the need for unity among the international community.
Let us remember that any doubts or lack of conviction provide strength to the Iranian regime, encourage the fanatics and play into their hands.
Â Â  Mr President, we must remember firstly that it is Europe that has sold this nuclear technology to Iran.
We tend to forget this, and it does not put us in the best position to protest today.
Secondly, we must bear in mind that there is an enormous difference between degrees of enrichment of uranium for civilian and for military purposes.
Thirdly, returning to nuclear weapons, is it not shocking that our international community has allowed several countries to the east and the west of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons without reacting in any way?
Finally, solely in relation to the external aspects of the Iranian revolution, I would remind you that the most radical and hostile forms of Islamism come to us from countries other than Iran, despite what certain speakers have said.
In conclusion, we have been swamped with so many lies in the past that we have the right to be better informed.
We must ensure that the rule of law, which we advocate, is the same for everybody.
This is essential to our credibility.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, we must not let the fundamentalists and those abusing the opportunities that freedom in Europe presents destroy our capacity for dialogue.
Events from the caricature conflict, to begin with, to the drastic, unacceptable statements by the Iranian President, cannot be allowed to result in the moderates that live in all regions and countries of the world losing the ability to talk to each other.
I believe that that is a crucial starting point, as, too, is ensuring that a president such as this is unable to win through in Iran, and that the many, well-educated, young people who wish to live a decent life have prospects; and for that reason we have to maintain this capacity for dialogue, in order to support internal reform process here, too.
This also means that we should not climb the escalation ladder too fast; it is not possible to go down a rung, so careful consideration is required.
For that reason, I am glad that next Monday, for example, the Committee on Foreign Affairs will have the opportunity for dialogue with the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which will form an integral part of a debate such as this.
The international community must be resolute when it comes to breaches of the law â irrespective of whether these occur in the context of freedom of expression â or when it comes to ensuring that Iran abides by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the rules that have been agreed.
Iran must also realise that, if it has not done so properly by 6Â March, the international community stands together and that the matter may then be discussed within the Security Council of the United Nations.
For this reason, it is important that we ensure this dialogue helps to build a more peaceful world, that we do not now let ourselves be talked into taking steps that render it impossible to use this escalation ladder for peaceful purposes, and also that, in the process, we do not lapse into automatism from which there is no escape.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we are unfortunately having to realise that the situation in Iran is escalating, and that is certainly not the right way for it to go about assuming a responsible role in the future of the international peace process, particularly in the Middle East, as Iran always likes to see it.
I do sympathise with a countryâs desire for scientific and technological progress for the benefit of its citizens â it must be given this option â but a field as double-edged as nuclear research requires a common effort by the international community; it is unacceptable for any parties to go it alone.
It is vital to build mutual confidence, both on the part of the USA and Europe and on the part of Iran.
How is that possible, however, with talk of military options on both sides?
The fact is that the political situation in the region is not as stable as we would wish upon the people living there.
For that reason, we would call on all the countries of that region to enter into a process of dialogue.
Regional stability and security cannot be achieved through outside intervention, and power games must not be allowed to result in doors being closed to us, so that we no longer know what is happening behind them.
We should not give fundamentalism or fanaticism any chance.
Â Â  Mr President, it is estimated that Iran could have nuclear weapons within three to ten years, although the point of no return in stopping that development could be reached much sooner.
Dealing with Iran has been made all the harder by the Iraq war, which was not just a disaster but could turn out to be an act of geopolitical folly.
The Iranian regime cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.
It is a religious fundamentalist, barbaric, pro-terrorist and anti-Semitic regime.
The world became used to the nuclear stand-off between the democratic west and the communist east during the Cold War, but in that confrontation, disaster was avoided because ultimately both sides were rational.
The religious fundamentalists of Iran are not rational.
An Iranian nuclear device could turn out to be the biggest suicide bomb the world has ever seen.
In this situation all the options are dangerous but the most dangerous option is doing nothing at all.
Â Â  Mr President, that everyone is agreed that we cannot accept a regime of religious maniacs having weapons of mass destruction at their disposal is not something we have learned only today, so from that point of view this debate is superfluous.
Far more relevant is the question as to whether we should not have stepped in much sooner.
Allow me in this minute to draw your attention to the hypocrisy which Europe and the US display in matters such as these in order to pursue .
It was, after all, France which offered Ayatollah Khomeini shelter and asylum and which helped ensure that the Shahâs Persia was able to slip into obscurantism.
If we are shocked today â as we rightly are â by Teheranâs barbaric execution of minors, at the same time as it plays a leading role in the smear campaign against Denmark, should we not also question the human rights situation in the large Islamic country Saudi Arabia, which is claimed to be the USAâs major ally and hence ours too? We have not even mentioned Pakistan, itself a country armed with nuclear weapons.
What do we do if another Ahmadinejad starts rebelling over there tomorrow?
Â Â  â () Mr President, this morning Iran announced four more executions.
In January, they executed 18 people and in December 35.
We sit here talking and talking while Iran goes ahead with the obvious production of nuclear weapons.
Neither the US nor Israel can protect us.
A military solution costing millions of lives is not an option at present.
If we are to find a solution, therefore, we must understand the causes of Iranâs behaviour.
It would be a gross error to think that Iran is reacting out of fear or alarm. The Persians are not Arabs.
Iran ruled the Middle East in ancient times, and for five hundred years in medieval times.
The country is convinced of its position as the leading power in the Middle East, and is producing nuclear weapons in order to secure this position.
Its natural historical partner in this hegemony is Russia.
Iran is a nation of rapidly growing, impoverished, uneducated, isolated and radicalised masses, who are kept in silence by a hard line totalitarian regime.
We are not dealing with radical Islam; we are dealing with a radical totalitarian regime.
Totalitarian regimes need external enemies, they need to attack the West, to block radio broadcasts and to execute their own citizens.
In contrast to previous totalitarian states, the transcendental nature of Islamist ideology makes it possible that their weapons will be used.
Let us support dialogue with those that care about it and those that need it.
We must, however, be clear, firm and principled in our attitude towards totalitarian regimes.
Â Â  (Mr President, there is no greater sin in politics than the sin of naÃ¯vety.
A one-minute speech such as this can only appeal to the emotions and the imagination.
The sin of naÃ¯vety is what we all commit when we utter these wise words, when we agree with one another and when we remain unconcerned as these words have absolutely no effect.
We are forever repeating the same words.
Iran is constantly creating new situations.
Has Iran recently come closer to having atomic weapons? â Yes, it has.
Has it come closer to atomic energy? â Yes, it has.
Has it come closer to possessing effective means of delivering these weapons?
Yes, it has. â Yes, it has come closer, but we continue to utter the same words, the same naÃ¯ve words.
Let us prepare for the day when nuclear weapons in Iran become a reality.
Let us change our defence doctrine then, because Europe will also be affected, and let us remember how dearly the sin of naÃ¯vety cost Europe in the past.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are certain findings which noÂ one can doubt.
Of course we disagree with the autocratic model of governance in Iran, we condemn the violations of human rights, but we must all acknowledge that the Iranian people put their new political leadership into place with democratic procedures.
The second finding is that Iran has an inalienable right to develop a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes.
The third finding is that the nuclear programme is not identified solely with President Ahmadinejad; it has the support of the broad majority of political forces and of the people of Iran.
There can be no solution outside the search for a political and diplomatic solution through dialogue, negotiation and respect for international law.
The European Union and the Presidency and the Commission must help to stop the threat or use of military means or preventive action against Iran.
The decisive issue for all of us is to build mutual trust on the basis of actual facts and elements, not simple information.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has every interest in preventing the repetition of a new Iraq in the area.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to put a stop to the activity of uranium enrichment, which lacks sufficient transparency.
The behaviour of the Iranian authorities towards the International Atomic Energy Agency has made it impossible to build the trust needed between Iran and the international community.
There are still strong doubts about the Iraniansâ claims that they only want to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
The recent actions of Tehran, the removal of the seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the suspension of the voluntary implementation of the additional protocol on safeguards run counter to the statements of intent made by the Iranian Government and to our attempts to secure a negotiated settlement.
On the basis of all that, we conclude that Iran is presenting itself on the international stage as the leading authority of the Islamic revolt against the West, and that it therefore intends to assert its own military might over that of the other Muslim nations.
For that reason, attacking and demonising Israel becomes a strategic move.
Iran considers itself to be invincible and unassailable on the economic, industrial, financial and energy fronts, and we therefore fear that any negotiation is destined to fail.
As the delegation of the party, we therefore propose that the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs be invited to Brussels to take part in a meeting with our EU-Iran parliamentary delegation.
We need to explain that it will not be possible to pursue a dialogue between our Parliament and the Iranian Government if the latter does not establish an equivalent parliamentary delegation.
We must therefore request an ongoing dialogue with all of the political forces in Iran, on both the ruling and the opposition sides, and show solidarity towards Israel with regard to the continual attacks it is under, by committing the European Union to guarantee security within the Middle East.
We therefore call on Members to vote againstÂ ...
Â Â  IÂ believe that sensible and peaceful thinking people the entire world over do not have a problem with Iran itself.
Iran is a country populated by people just like ourselves, with their everyday joys and cares.
Our problem is not the country and its citizens.
Our problem is an individual, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who became Iranâs president through circumstance, and his religious fundamentalism.
All of the problems stem from the sick mind of this one fanatic, be it the renewal of the nuclear programme, the brutal verbal attacks against the state of Israel or the primitive and deplorable denial of the Holocaust, the greatest atrocity and genocide in human history.
IÂ therefore believe that it is important to distinguish between these two elements and not to identify the president with the whole country.
Unfortunately, it has been true throughout our history that such sick minds have repeatedly managed to bring war not only to their nations and countries, but often also to whole regions and twice even to the entire world.
This is where the greatest danger lies.
Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is serious, though not hopeless.
However, we can never defeat fundamentalism by substituting a different form of fundamentalism â that is my message to our friend George Bush.
Responsibility has been vested in us, and we must act with forethought in order to make sure that one day future generations do not blame us for failing to deal with this serious situation.
Â Â  â Mr President, in spite of the international efforts, it is becoming increasingly clear that either Iran is raising the diplomatic stakes, or it really is not interested in ending the uranium enrichment programme and the subsequent use thereof for military purposes.
Todayâs Iran flouts the rules of the international community, has apparently no intention of honouring those rules and poses a threat to regional and world peace.
Todayâs Iran is potentially dangerous.
Tomorrowâs Iran, armed with nuclear weapons, is a definite danger.
Against this backdrop, the citizens expect the EU to guarantee their security and to be a stabilising factor on the world stage.
It is primarily up to those who have been given the task of leading the negotiations with Iran to dispel the citizensâ fears, in spite of the risk â clearly a calculated risk â that Iran will not want to heed the international communityâs legitimate demands.
Mr President, simply referring the case to the United Nations and the Security Council is not, to my mind, sufficient.
We believe that the EUâs first task should be to strive to maintain a cohesive and resolute response among the international community to the regional and global threat posed by Iran.
We must not allow the current difficulties and these politically sensitive times to lead to rifts, when what is at stake is something as fundamental as our global security.
Iran needs to know that the diplomatic route remains open, but also that it is up to Iran to restore trust by means of practical, verifiable moves towards the total suspension of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities.
It must also abandon its provocative rhetoric on Israel and the holocaust, and must commit itself to a policy, acceptable to the international community, of respect for human rights and for opposition parties.
What appropriate, effective measures can be taken to achieve these goals?
This is the key question to which we must respond.
Mr President, it is increasingly clear that the relevance of the EUâs role on the international stage depends entirely on its deeds.
Let us hope that this particularly difficult time will enable the Union to show that it has the means at its disposal to play a role on a world scale, something that this House has often demanded.
We hope that it succeeds in doing so.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, the word most often used in this morningâs debates has been the word âdialogueâ; dialogue between cultures, between civilisations and, I may say, even between the European Union and Iran.
Relations between the Union and Iran have in recent years been based on a three-tier approach, comprising trade cooperation, political dialogue and dialogue on human rights.
I firmly believe, despite the numerous disappointments and setbacks of recent weeks and months, that this approach is still applicable and still valid.
It is of course totally unacceptable that the Iranian president should question the existence of another state, namely Israel, and Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, any more than it can be allowed to circumvent international law or the rulings of international organisations.
I am, however, convinced that the potential for dialogue and for a diplomatic solution has not been entirely exhausted.
I am also convinced that it is not in the interests of the citizens of Iran, the Iranians themselves, that their country should become a kind of black hole within the international community.
I therefore support the dialogue mentioned earlier with the reformist groups within Iran and in the surrounding region.
Â Â  Mr President, personally speaking, I feel bound to point out the link between the comments by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for Israel to be wiped from the map and Iranâs decision to resume its uranium processing activities.
I do not believe that these two events are coincidental.
Neither do I believe that our institution can reasonably overlook the correlation between them.
Many countries are developing their nuclear capabilities, but the international community is only worried about proliferation in those countries that pose an immediate threat to peace in the world.
I believe that, if Iran does not inspire confidence in us today, it is because, amongst other things, its President makes bellicose, revisionist and anti-Semitic comments.
It is that Presidentâs malevolent intentions that make the resumption of the uranium enrichment programme so worrying in terms of world peace.
That is why I am delighted with this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the current debate is very important.
The debate on the Middle East here in Parliament and in the media has, more often than not, been focused on Iraq and the election in Palestine.
Now that Iran is the subject of debate, it is the issue of nuclear weapons that is being discussed.
At the same time, human rights are being violated, a state of affairs discussed by many of the previous speakers.
As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as Vice-Chair of Social Democratic Women in Europe, I receive very worrying reports and accounts concerning violations of both womenâs and childrenâs rights.
More time must be given to human rights issues, and we should act significantly more vigorously than I think we are doing at present.
Great changes are taking place right now in Iranian society.
There are too few of us who talk of dialogue and too many of us who have got bogged down thinking in terms of a major conflict.
The dialogue between the EU and Iran must be resumed.
The statements about Israel are unacceptable, as are executions, death sentences and the taking of political prisoners.
Diplomatic solutions must be preferred to an escalation of violence and other outrages.
In modern conflicts, it is always civilians, women and children who, more than anyone else, are injured and violated.
This must be put an end to now, while there is still time.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate has also shown, the resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue remains a central concern of the EU and of the international community in general; for doubts as to the peaceful nature of this nuclear programme are indeed justified.
I should like to emphasise once more, however, something that has been mentioned by many speakers in this House: that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue within a multilateral framework, in particular within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
That is an important point to emphasise.
We believe that the Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil would be a good alternative to enrichment in Iran: this solution has the full support of the EU.
Some have said that Austria should take the initiative, but I am, of course, speaking here in my capacity as representative of the Council, and as such I represent the position held by the Council as a whole, irrespective of any national positions.
However, as many speakers have mentioned â for which I am grateful â it is also important to bear in mind that the issue of Iranâs nuclear programme is not the only one that is important and fundamental to our relationship with that country, and which must be resolved if we are to improve our relations with its Government, with its President.
There is also the human-rights issue.
I should like to remind the House that, since 1975, Iran has been a party, without reservation, to both the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
Iran therefore has a clear obligation under international law to comply with the requirements of these important agreements.
Finally, I should like to confirm that I share the opinion expressed by MrÂ Brok and others that we must of course continue the dialogue with the forces in Iran who are favourably disposed to peaceful coexistence and to compliance with the countryâs obligations.
We intend to do so; of course we are willing to engage in dialogue.
It must be made quite clear, however, that we must not allow this dialogue to be abused, and so we have to be very careful in our choice of dialogue partners.
The issue of promoting civil society in Iran also seems to me to be particularly important in this regard.
Â Â  .
