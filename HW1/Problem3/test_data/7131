Secondly, immunity.
Recently, there has been a major shortcoming on an essential issue, from the point of view of the dignity of Members.
I am counting on you to take this issue seriously so that we do not find ourselves in a situation in which a fundamental aspect of parliamentary dignity is rendered meaningless.
Lastly, the Convention.
I also thank you for having today appointed Giscard d' Estaing as its Chairman.
The Convention is the daughter of our parliamentary work, but it also has other partners and members and I think that Parliament must act as the keeper of the conscience in this field to ensure that the Convention is visible to the public, achieves tangible results and is not simply a forum for discussion.
Furthermore, it must be able to push forward and develop something on which we can all agree.
As you know, Mr President - and with this I shall close - we supported an excellent candidate, Mr Martin.
I see that you have integrated many of Mr Martin' s ideas into your campaign, but in any event, I should like to say that if you implement this programme, you will have the loyal and honest support of the Socialist Group in this work, which concerns all of us.
Mr President, my dear Pat, congratulations once again, this time on your new professional dÃ©but.
It is splendid to see you doing what you promised.
You are showing yourself to be trustworthy.
We have obtained a new Europe today, but we have also had a new Parliament since January.
Now, we are to be politicians, not technicians, and you have shown, and will show, us the way.
Pat, we are hungry, in fact very hungry, and we have an appetite for change.
Our group will support you entirely as you prepare the individual dishes that can satisfy us. However, our group will always have an appetite for change.
In Denmark, we have a lovely song that our family often sings.
It goes like this: 'Life' s harvest is in struggle never ceasing...' , '...while changeless calm is death' s abode' .
Our group has always wished for struggle, for we have an appetite for change.
Enlargement is the most important matter we are facing at this time.
It is about people rather than about technical devices, budgets, laws and rules. We are clearly the place where people are to meet, and we must make this place work.
Our group will do everything to move the tradition on, as we have already done by now inviting members of the national parliaments in the candidate countries to visit us.
What is most important, however - and what we have a very great appetite for - are reforms to this House of ours.
We have a need for reforms, and not only reforms of our statute - important as those are - but also changes to the way in which we work, so that we can deliver the results our electorate wants to see.
That leads me on to my next point, concerning contact with the people.
The prerequisite for being in touch with the people is that we should be able to deliver the goods and, more specifically, the goods that people demand.
That means being able to put our own house in order and being effective and concentrating on what is really important and what we have some influence upon.
In those terms, what is most important are reforms, results and communication, and certainly it is splendid to hear you communicate.
You are enthusiastic, you show your feelings, you are colourful in your speech and you use the right words.
I would almost go so far as to say that we in effect have a female President, for you employ the feminine side of your personality: imagination and creativity; and that is what we need if we are to reach our citizens.
We must be politicians, not technicians.
All right, we were unable to have a woman as President, but a man with feminine sides to his personality is no bad thing either.
The Convention is what is most important in connection with the Europe of the future.
Moreover, it is important that we should not just engage in navel-gazing but try to find solutions to the tasks facing us.
Rather than get bogged down in a dispute about whether we are to have a 'Constitution' , a 'Basic Treaty' or a 'federation' , we should design a system in which there is democratic control over political decisions.
When we draw up legislation for our citizens, they must be able to see who are making the decisions, and those who are must be democratically accountable for them.
That is the message of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
We want to see political accountability in Europe.
We are "fit for the future" , but our group is also "fit to fight for the new Europe" , as well as being "fit to fight for the future together with yourself" .
Mr President, the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance is pleased with your speech because, in it, you remind Parliament of its political role and do not dwell on technical details, although I am certain that it will take a lot of time to regulate these.
We do not want to be a well-oiled voting machine.
We want to make history and we want to highlight Europe' s own role in the world at a time when peace and stability in the world are under threat.
It is not sufficient to organise development cooperation.
We must be able to promote peace and stability in a European manner, on the basis of our values.
We want to maximise our role as a parliament.
We want to monitor.
We want to enact laws on behalf of public opinion but also in contact with that opinion and with the media which should bring us closer to the public.
A great deal of progress has been made.
I arrived in this Parliament having had experience of many parliaments before, sometimes parliaments which were usually better attended than this one, a phenomenon which I regret.
Outside these walls, people often think that we are not a real parliament, but I have found a true parliament here.
However, we must ensure that we have a statute, we agree with you on that, otherwise we as MEPs lack credibility.
In addition, we must also further shape the assistants' statute into which Mr Onesta has put such great effort.
Moreover, we must be given more competences.
Codecision must be extended rather than eroded, and this must be done in a fully transparent manner.
Needless to say, the activities must be reformed.
The will to reform is there.
A great deal can be done within the current Rules of Procedure, provided that the will is there, the will to debate rather than read out little monologues prepared on paper, the will to be present and to enter into dialogue with each other.
The debate must not stifle pluralism, quite the contrary.
We are here to talk, for we are a parliament in which it must be possible to express the whole range of opinions.
This is why we do believe that the Corbett report is a solid basis for a discussion, but if it means that the rights of small groups are cut back, or the rights of individual MEPs compromised, then we touch the soul and diversity of this Parliament, and that is not acceptable.
We also want to express our slight concern to the Council.
Parliament cannot accept shortened procedures if the Council fails to debate with us in our committees.
We can hold more debates there, but not in the absence of the Council, not without the attendant transparency and not without the debate that we want.
We must condemn creeping reforms without clear objectives.
We want more democracy, respect for subsidiarity, a rapprochement between citizens and the European Parliament and a dialogue with the regional and national parliaments. If not, the already strong distrust among our citizens will only grow.
We must clearly establish the legal basis for our actions once and for all, and not let our legal basis be taken away.
We welcome your instruction to prepare the future in consultation with public opinion and with the parliaments in the candidate countries.
You are moving closer to them.
We encounter them in the joint meetings.
Why do we not open up our committees to enter into debate with them, as we also want to do with our own public opinion, and why do we not open up our sumptuous chambers more than has hitherto been the case?
The Convention will be the proof of the pudding.
We are putting our trust in this.
If we want to prepare Europe for tackling the enormous tasks of enlargement, the Convention cannot afford to fail.
It should not endeavour to write a cookery book, which is subsequently used in some new night-time session to concoct a grim menu.
We want a Convention that knows the direction in which Parliament wants to guide it.
As the European Parliament, we must face up to our task in that Convention and involve the others in that debate, both regional and national parliaments, as well as public opinion, and ensure that Europe takes the qualitative step forward that is required for enlargement.
Mr President, during the debate held in preparation for the election of the President of Parliament, I had the opportunity to say what I expected of the new President.
Basing my comments on the undisputed observation that the increasing numbers of citizens are showing a very worrying lack of interest in the European institutions, I said that the number one priority of the new President should be to do everything in his power to win back their confidence.
I am therefore pleased to see that this objective is implicit in your programme.
You said that we must win back the confidence of the people.
We fully support you in doing this.
How can this be achieved in practical terms?
I myself have come up with three ideas.
I think that two of them partly cover the same areas as your plans, but I would venture to say that the third idea could remedy a shortfall.
The first idea concerns the involvement of citizens in the debate on the future of Europe.
I suggested that our President launch, in parallel with the work of the Convention and in conjunction with the national parliaments, a campaign on the theme 'Let your voice be heard' .
This would be an incredibly bold experiment for our institution to undertake.
We should stimulate a real confrontation of ideas, as you said, we should listen to what the people have to say to us on what they expect from Europe and strive to connect the Convention to the subjects of these diverse discussions.
Then we should all face up to our responsibilities.
We want the Convention to shake up the IGC, so let the citizens shake up the Convention!
My second idea was for our President to take the initiative, along with ourselves, in organising meetings in Parliament of groups of citizens from various European countries to discuss common objectives that we could support.
I mentioned three examples.
The first is to organise meetings involving young people to discuss questions that directly concern them, such as Erasmus-type grants or the full and mutual recognition of qualifications, as well as broader subjects - we could call them more civilisation-related issues, like those that were recently discussed in Porto Alegre, under the alluring title 'Another world is possible' .
Another example is to invite women from all over Europe to meet and discuss the question of the full application of Treaty provisions that encourage equality.
The last example, which is similar to your proposal, Mr President, is to organise meetings of members of civil society from the candidate countries and Member States to examine, together, the ins and outs of this quite historic undertaking and to give us the best possible chances of making it a success.
In the same spirit, you proposed to invite observers from the candidate countries and we shall support you in this effort.
The third idea that I mentioned two months ago is the only one that I fear was missing from the speech you gave this morning, and that is the idea of putting pressure on the Commission and the Council regarding several emblematic legislative texts that clearly spell out to our fellow citizens the direction in which we want to take Europe in the future.
I am personally thinking, particularly at a time when so many businesses are undergoing restructuring, of the directives such as that on the information and consultation of workers, that on the European Works Councils, or even of the framework directive on services of general interest, and am looking forward to the possible - and, in my view, desirable - reform of the Treaties in this crucial area.
The general approach advocated by my group and the many practical suggestions that turn it into a reality are the same as they were before your election and they will remain thus during your mandate.
In this spirit, we will naturally be prepared to help you to make our Parliament a positive role model for millions of European citizens.
Mr President, on a lighthearted note may I firstly say that I am extremely pleased to be here to witness the discovery of the feminine side of your personality, revealed to us this morning.
Let me also assure colleagues that there is a tougher side to the personality of the President, as I have seen in another House in another place.
I warmly welcome the statement made by the President to us here this morning.
I am genuinely pleased with the response to it by the people who have already spoken.
It augurs well for the change that we know must take place - a change that we have been hesitant to face up to for quite a considerable period of time.
I would like to go on record as saying that this, in my view, is the first serious attempt in a long time to take up the challenge of the need for change.
We often see change as something that is always desirable but that can wait until tomorrow.
Now, with Pat Cox as our President, we must confront it from day one.
I welcome that.
There is an obligation on each and every one of us to support that change.
My Group in particular welcomes the changes that you have outlined in your statement.
They will make this Parliament more meaningful.
They will give it the role that Parliament must, and should, have and which we know it has not got.
They will give us the type of debate that will mean we can put away all the documents we read diligently and carefully on technical matters that we should not be debating at all.
Let us debate the political issues.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo mentioned the good debate we had yesterday with the High Representative, Javier Solana.
It was a good and open debate, but we should have had more debates like that one.
It should not just be a privilege for us to have Mr Solana present; perhaps he should be here on a more regular basis.
He is accountable to this Parliament - we should not overlook that.
That is important too.
I was delighted that Commissioner Patten was here yesterday because his is a role that we must respect and support as well.
I should like to thank the Commission and the Spanish presidency for being here at this most important debate here today.
They too have a role.
I have consistently supported the view that the Commission's best friend is the European Parliament.
Parliament will support the Commission and make sure it is not sidelined by one or two of the larger Member States wishing to do so for any particular reason.
I also know that the Commission is the best friend of the smaller Member States within the European Union, which can count on protection when they need it.
As regards the representatives of the Spanish presidency, it is right and proper that they are here today and I thank them for coming.
Last November they came and met the political leaders of the groups in this Parliament and held open consultations with them on the agenda that they proposed to put forward during their presidency.
This was a worthwhile initiative that we welcome, value and appreciate.
It is not so long ago that the outgoing presidency refused to come to this Parliament to report on its activities because it wanted to go immediately afterwards.
It did not want to answer questions.
We should not accept that.
Much reform is required within this House.
We will support that reform.
I welcome what Mr Cox has said on the different matters he mentioned.
He mentioned the need for the statute.
There is full support for the statute and I welcome the fact that the consultation is going to take place from the bottom up, involving everybody in a decent, fair, upright, open and democratic fashion.
This will contrast with the past, when Mr Rothley was working on his own and efforts were made just to get a deal done to give a presidency something to their credit at the end of the day.
That was not good enough then.
It will not be good enough now.
We have all involved ourselves in this debate and something worthwhile will come from it.
As regards the workings of the Convention, I very much welcome the suggestions that have been made here today.
I would add, though perhaps not with 100% conviction, that the meeting that is taking place today between Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the heads of the political groups should not have been confined to the heads of the political groups.
Consideration should perhaps have been given to having that meeting in this House to let all Members see what is going on.
We have urged Mr Giscard d'Estaing not to have his little meetings behind closed doors.
We have called for the rhythm of the Convention to be dictated from the floor and to involve the Members from the different states in this House, yet we assist Mr Giscard d'Estaing by having a private, cosy little lunch at which half a dozen people will be present.
Think again, Mr President, when these matters come up for debate and discussion.
As regards enlargement, I very much welcome and support your initiative to invite representatives from the parliaments of the applicant states.
That is good, right and proper.
Let us have debate and discussion.
One small word of caution: let us not overplay our role and move into an area where we might be overlapping the negotiating mandate of the Commission.
We have to be careful and I would trust your experience and judgement in that.
I speak from my own limited experience in that area, which I shall relate at another time and in another place.
Finally, I support and commend your approach towards promoting external affairs.
Might I ask you to look at the role of the parliamentary delegations in this particular area?
Are we doing Parliament justice?
Are we doing justice to anyone when we meet a delegation from India, say, or China once a year for one-and-a-half or two days?
Is that promoting foreign relations?
No, not in any shape or form.
Why are we not, for instance, opening up discussions and debate with Iran at the present time?
If those advocating change within the Iranian regime need help and support through debates and discussions with people like us, why are not we giving them that?
Is it not about time we became masters of our own policy, our own approach, our own attitude in foreign affairs?
Mr President, you have made a great start.
I warmly support you.
I wish you well and I will be with you right along the way.
The only modest correction I should make is that Mr Giscard d'Estaing will not be having lunch with the group chairmen.
Today's meeting precedes the Convention, but I guarantee you that when the Convention starts and we know how it will be up and running we should insist on full accountability to Parliament on the floor of this House.
Mr President, your speech today shows the value of the open election campaign.
We have taken the time to discuss our own circumstances, and I should like to thank the President for his contribution and the discussion today, as well as table proposals for consideration.
Consolidation of the laws could of course take place through our refusing to debate, or directly rejecting, proposals that are not consolidated.
It cannot be sensible to accumulate 70 amendments in order to see how the law stands where fish are concerned.
A reform in the interests of transparency should ensure that all meetings are open and all documents accessible, unless a qualified majority approves an exemption supported by reasons, of the kind we approved in the Martin/Bourlanges report.
Political appointments must be a thing of the past.
In future, everyone should be appointed and promoted according to their qualifications, here in Parliament too, and we could make a fresh start with those who are now to be appointed from the candidate countries.
The plenary sittings must be turned into lively occasions.
A third of the time could be set aside for spontaneous debate, as you intimated.
Those active in Parliament must have the opportunity to tackle the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council if they do not receive answers.
All MEPs must be permitted to speak at least three times a year.
The number of votes must be cut back so that we are only voting on political differences.
After each debate, the coordinators should meet and make the technical preparations for the voting.
Details of the voting list should be known at least a week before voting takes place so that we can all consult our electorates and be aware of what we are voting on.
The way in which posts are distributed should be revised.
The d' Hondt method could be replaced by the Saint LaguÃ« method in which the distribution is on the basis of 1,3,5 instead of 1,2,3,4,5.
It would provide the same proportionate distribution, but it would make it possible for the smaller groups not always to have to take what the large groups leave aside and, in cases where the small groups are not represented, they could be appointed as observers.
The independent Members should have their quota of opportunities, and we should ourselves remove all forms of discrimination instead of risking new legal proceedings.
The Corbett report' s attack on the small political groups should be replaced by a gentlemen' s agreement through which we achieve some of Mr Corbett's objectives without reducing the groups' rights.
In the Convention, majorities and minorities must have the same access to qualified aid and be able to put forward, and campaign for, proposals in the same way.
There cannot be special rights for specific positions.
The European Movement and the federalists do not have a sole and exclusive right to organise the debate with civil society using Parliament' s money.
We must join in getting the whole of Parliament and the Convention to operate in such a way that all Members representing all positions feel they are being treated properly and on an equal basis.
Today at the meeting with Mr Giscard d' Estaing, we must make a point of ensuring that all alternates in the Convention are given full rights of participation in the work.
Good luck with the reform work!
Mr President, you have called for a more democratic and less bureaucratic Parliament.
I see this as an important concept, and so I would like to start with the situation of the Unattached Members, the 33 truly second-class Members who do not have access to the d' Hondt system which is used to distribute everything in this House, who are not entitled to table documents or amendments and who are forced to admit even to their electorate that they are unable to play a full part in the Parliament' s work.
There is a report which has been at a standstill for two years in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs; moreover a judgement was returned a few months ago by the Court of Justice which raised a number of important points in terms of whether those measures were appropriate or did not need to be amended, or whether legal penalties should not be imposed for failure to apply them.
Mr President, I call upon you to pursue this matter and to revitalise that aspect of the work of this House, for I feel that, precisely with regard to the goal you mentioned, one of the problems facing us is not just the general, essential need to make our working methods more democratic and to ensure greater participation by all the Members, but also to take into consideration the second-class status of the Unattached Members which is endorsed and still confirmed in this House.
From this point of view, Mr President, as has already been said, the Corbett report not only fails to provide an adequate response but is also, in a number of respects, a caricature of what should be an endeavour to improve our conditions.
How could one possibly envisage - the Members may not be aware of this, but Mr Corbett did make this suggestion - doing away with topical and urgent debates, which are one of Parliament' s opportunities for real political debate, as President Cox said?
At this point, we might just as well do away with the resolutions at the end of political debates as well and, that way, we will become even more of a machine for voting on reports.
I feel that this is not the right direction to take and, in this connection, I genuinely hope that the political groups, the Members and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs itself will carefully reconsider this suggestion, which is not a good one.
Mr President, we need a Parliament whose work is better structured.
When we have major debates, attended by members of the Commission or the Council but where only 10 or 15 Members of this House are present, it does not reflect well on Parliament. Parliament is not doing itself any service.
Then, two hours later, maybe, this House becomes a sort of voting chamber, not least because, as we know, the existence of a certain penalty system makes it convenient to come here and vote.
We used to have explanations of vote and a system which made debates visible and comprehensible for journalists and the public.
That is no longer the case.
The other point concerns publishing our debates.
Mr Collins has raised this point and the other Unattached Members agree with him.
Even today, for example, this meeting could have been organised in such a way that everyone participated or it could even have been transmitted over the internal system.
I feel, and it is our deep conviction, Mr President, that, just as your election was broadcast over the Internet - and this was a major step forward - in this age of the Internet, both committee and plenary debates can and should be broadcast to give all the citizens, not just the European citizens, access to our work.
Lastly, a word on the subject of the statute, Mr President.
The statute is important, but it must also include Members' prerogatives; in other words, it must not be a statute centred solely on the financial side of being a Member of Parliament.
I feel that the challenge facing us is to produce a Statute that definitively defines and establishes MEPs' status, their responsibilities, their prerogatives and their rights in respect of the institutions preparing for enlargement.
I wish you every success in your work in this area, Mr President, and I hope that major reforms will be achieved under your presidency before 2004.
I wish to begin by congratulating you on the state-of-the-European-Parliament address, which perhaps, like other state-of-the-Union addresses, should become an annual event.
I personally think you have made a very positive start as President of the European Parliament.
If we are to carry out the reform agenda that you have discussed, then we need an esprit de corps in this House.
The way in which you have engaged the Bureau of Parliament, the Conference of Presidents, the committee chairs in your agenda, already in your first month, shows a determination to work across the whole of this House in order to deliver reform, and that is very encouraging.
But, at the same time, you have also done the same with the institutions.
Although we should not overstate these things, there is already an improved relationship between the Commission and the Council and this institution - and, perhaps most importantly - you have shown a willingness to take tough decisions.
That is something which, I am afraid, will become more and more a feature of your presidency, but we will have more and more occasion to take hard decisions.
If I have any criticism of your speech, it was not in terms of the content - there was hardly a word I disagreed with - but that I perhaps detected an element of "mission creep" in your speech.
If you try to do everything, you may end up not succeeding in doing very much.
I would encourage you to stick to just two or three key items: enlargement being the vital one; the internal reform of this House being the second; and also, as others have said, the communication strategy of this House to connect better with the citizens of the European Union.
If you achieve progress in these three areas, you will have achieved very much indeed.
Your speech also correctly got to the dilemma that we face.
If we are to improve our standing as an institution, then we have to reform internally.
That means a little navel-gazing.
However, if we spend two-and-a-half years navel-gazing, then we will be even further away from the citizens out there.
So we have to combine the two.
We have to conduct reform within the structures of this House while on the floor of this House, as you rightly say, connecting with the citizens by discussing the major items that face them in their daily lives - to actually talk about the issues that matter out there, not the issues that matter in here.
It is out there that really matters to us.
Mr Dell'Alba made a point I had wanted to make.
When you talked about inviting the members of the applicant countries' parliaments to be present at the enlargement debate here, I agreed with you, but my immediate reaction was to wonder where were they going to sit.
Then I looked around the Chamber and realised that there would be no problem in finding seats for them in this House.
There we have a double dilemma: one that you have identified, which is to make our debates more lively and interesting; but another one, which we have tried in the past to solve and need to try again: to make this plenary the focus of our four days' work in Strasbourg.
There is plenty of other time for committee and delegation meetings, and for meeting lobbyists, etc., but when we are in Strasbourg, the plenary should be the centre-point of our activities.
In fact, for most Members it is a side-show when they come to Strasbourg; the average Member spends less than five hours in this Chamber during a Strasbourg week.
It should be where they are most of the time; it should be the focus of our activity; you should feel that if you have not been present at the plenary, you have missed out on something.
Instead, sometimes you feel that when you have been in the plenary you have missed out on something that has been going on elsewhere.
So we have to refocus to make this the centre of activity: a livelier Chamber where we really discuss the day-to-day issues.
One last but important point, because both you, Mr President, and Mr Poettering in different ways referred to it.
I welcome the decision on the von Wogau report - it was a right decision.
But I do not believe, as you indicated, that better regulation or the long-term solution to what Mr von Wogau was dealing with in the Lamfalussy proposals can be left to the Convention.
We have to focus on that in the next two or three months because the June Summit will deal with governance and better regulation, and it may be, if we do not focus on that now, that by the time we get to the Convention the pass will have been sold in June, so it is important that we look at this issue now and do not think that von Wogau was even a five- or six-month solution.
It was a short two- or three-month solution to a very important point in terms of the powers of Parliament.
Thank you very much and, again, congratulations on the progress you have made so far.
Please be assured that, as I mentioned in the speech, I want to work between now and the Barcelona Summit to put together the interinstitutional working group or at least to be able to engage in that dialogue.
The Spanish Prime Minister has already subscribed to that idea before this House.
The Commission presidency has also backed the idea.
We need to lock it down.
You are perfectly correct: it is not something to be left for the medium term.
But its agenda is one that will carry us over a number of other major hurdles.
Mr President, I should like to start with a little irreverence which only your Irish colleagues can take the liberty of doing.
As I address you, it is a great pleasure for all of us to move from the era of Paddy the Irishman to Paddy the President.
In your own area of Cork in Ireland they would be tickled pink to think that we were discussing the feminine side of Pat Cox in Parliament this morning.
But it is right that we should.
I concur with Mr Collins.
But there would be some amusement in some of the more rural parts of Ireland at the tone of the debate.
I thank you for your contribution this morning.
I thoroughly support your plan, as you have laid it before us.
More importantly, thank you for addressing us in a language that was devoid of Eurospeak.
One of the great problems in all the European institutions is that we have developed a language, a glossary of terminology that has created a barrier between ourselves and the people of Europe we represent.
We have created that barrier not just between the people but between ourselves and the media, on whom we depend to sell our message to the people of Europe.
Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak.
For that I warmly congratulate you.
It is important that we all follow suit - from the technical end to us as parliamentarians - as we express ourselves.
May your enthusiasm not wane for the next two-and-a-half years and may it prove to be infectious as you represent us throughout Europe and indeed further afield.
May your affection and obvious love of this Parliament, of these European institutions prove to be infectious as you address gatherings throughout your term in office.
May it be particularly infectious in our country of Ireland as we endeavour to awaken from their slumber, from their indifference the 65% of the Irish electorate who failed to turn out to vote for the Nice Treaty last June, as we yet again try to offer them the opportunity to endorse enlargement of Europe between now and the end of December this year.
It is most important that we enthuse our peoples and - top of your agenda - enthuse the Irish people for the enlargement project which we all support.
I wish you good health and Godspeed for the next two-and-a-half years.
Mr President, I shall keep it very brief.
I am delighted that you have emphasised the 'primacy of politics' .
In the final analysis, this Parliament has grown from a paper tiger into a watchdog of democracy, and that is down to politics.
In my view, communication and information are crucial in this connection.
Information more so than communication.
They are not the same.
Communication is about bringing news.
Information implies a dialogue with those to whom the information is directed.
The dialogue must be open and objective, and should not degenerate into indoctrination and propaganda but should comprise communication and information.
Sound information means that one has to present something of substance, that one has something to offer or something that one can pass on.
It need not be perfect, but a dialogue is necessary to make any improvements.
How will we deal with this?
There are countless reports on this subject.
I myself had the honour of being the author of one of the many that are stored in the dark recesses of this institution.
There have been many reports, yet little has changed in the many years I have been in this Parliament.
How will we tackle this?
Could I make a suggestion, as we have tried all manner of things?
Why do we not hold an open debate?
You as representative of Parliament, along with those you select, you on behalf of Parliament along with the representatives of the media.
Not with the intention to indoctrinate.
I know how anxious the media is about propaganda, and with good reason.
But simply an open dialogue to examine together how we can best serve the parliamentary, democratic culture, and hence Europe, a democratic Europe, for this is what is at stake in the final analysis.
Mr President, I wish to say first of all that your work programme is also ours and that really your ambitions are also ours, and I am sure you will have the support of the House.
I wish to make three distinct observations.
Mr President, you spoke of a realistic and intelligent defence of the prerogatives of this House; you mentioned the Lamfalussy report; also, yesterday you decided not to attend the Court of Justice and to adopt a long-sighted approach on a matter vital to Europe' s citizens.
I would say that this intelligent defence of our prerogatives - which are not our own, but which represent our responsibility towards the citizens - is a leitmotif that I wish to highlight.
Within this defence of our prerogatives and this maintaining of better relations with the other two institutions, in which we all have an interest, there is, nevertheless, one aspect that you touched on briefly and on which I should like to focus: access to the 'screening' documents for the candidate countries which, to date, are being denied us.
It makes no sense for us to ask our colleagues from the candidate countries to familiarise themselves with these 'screening' documents, whilst we ourselves do not have access to them.
This is one of the practical issues, which should not simply be of concern to us, but which we should attend to immediately.
The second aspect concerning this Parliament' s prerogatives is image.
One image reveals more than a thousand words and the press conference held yesterday by the three institutions, together with the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, will mean that, in future, we will not have to read, as has happened before, that a directive has been approved, when what has really been approved is a Council common position.
The three institutions are committed to demonstrating responsibility towards the citizens to produce effective and good legislation.
Which leads to the second aspect: the insistence on the rigour of this institution is important.
The three institutions have to improve the quality of legislation.
This has been said on various occasions and is one of the great challenges overall, not just for the European institutions.
Legislation must be legible despite its complexity.
We must eschew jargon and unintelligible expressions, as has been said.
To this end, when it comes to reforming this House, I wish to point out that this is a House of committees.
We must support your idea - expressed, amongst others, by the Provan group and by other working parties within Parliament' s Bureau - that the more technical work must be carried out by the committees, but without its visibility to the citizens suffering.
It is important that the citizens understand the work we are undertaking, not only in Plenary, which is already happening, but also in the committees.
This is why we have to improve the committee' s system of communication with our citizens.
I shall finish by discussing a third aspect, which is dialogue with the citizens.
Mr President, you are a magnificent representative of what this House stands for.
Your personal skills will ensure that we are able to undertake a useful piece of work.
I use this word carefully: we have worked constructively on European integration, on what the European institutions really do, on what this House does and on to what extent we in this House feel responsible for the extremely important task of representing Europe' s citizens.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate you on an excellent start to your presidency.
This debate has shown that there is much support and much appetite in this House for reform, in this lively exchange we are having in the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of this debate.
You were kind enough to refer to my own report, which hopefully will be on the agenda at the next part-session.
We are building quite a broad consensus on the bulk of the proposals contained in my report.
In the last few days many groups have been kind enough to invite me to address their meetings and to engage in building this consensus.
I am now quite confident that there will be a majority next month in favour of a useful package of reforms that will not solve all our problems - far from it - but will be a useful step forward.
To those colleagues who feared that there may be elements of my report which are unfavourable to the smaller groups, I would like to reassure them.
There is nothing that significantly undermines the position of the smaller groups in my report.
If they continue to have fears, I shall be very happy to meet them to try to find a solution to any issue they wish to raise.
My preferred solution is to persuade them, but I am open to other solutions if we can find them.
This will be a useful part of the reform process and I thank you very much for your support.
Mr President, on a point of order: I just wanted to engage in 30 seconds of navel-gazing.
I agree with everything that has been said about reform.
But when we talk about reform, let us not forget the conditions in which backbench MEPs work in this House.
David Martin reproached us for not spending more time in the Chamber, but one of the problems is the amount of time we waste getting to this place.
I will not relaunch that debate, but anyone looking at this splendid Chamber and the palatial public spaces of this building would not believe the cramped conditions in which a backbench MEP works.
Please do not forget, you important people who have spacious offices - even the secretaries-general of the political groups have office space four times that of a backbench MEP - that when you have an assistant and a stagiaire crammed into one office, you have no place in which to meet visitors.
Mr President, will you at least pledge to back us in getting computers for MEPs, preferably flat-screen computers so we can fit them on to our desks in our tiny offices and be more efficient for the 21st century?
I am sorry to raise such a brass-tacks issue: I know parliamentarians are always shy about raising the matter of their own working conditions but, frankly, unless we can be efficient in dealing with our work, we cannot deliver good service and present a good showcase to the world.
I would not like people to look at the masses of space in the public areas and then come and see our little cramped offices, out of which we lose a third for a useless bathroom - but that is another matter.
Please help us to be efficient, Mr President.
The Bureau is looking at the technological aspect.
I am sure we can do that.
I am not sure what I can do as regards the buildings aspect, but you have my sympathy.
Mr President, it is being stated that President Prodi took a position in a press conference yesterday on Commissioner Verheugen's behaviour in the Commission.
This has to do with Stability Pact issues.
Mr Verheugen is alleged to have assented in the Commission to the Commission's decisions, but then, last Sunday, to have dissociated himself from them in an interview with a German newspaper.
I wish to ask you to give consideration to a procedure whereby we, that is, in Parliament or some appropriate forum, might hear an explanation of this from Mr Verheugen.
That is my request, which I would like to make a matter of public record.
I will check with the Commission as to whether the Commissioner is available to come to the House this week or, if not, on another appropriate occasion.
Mr President, since Mr Poettering has raised this issue, I would remind him that, for the last six months, we have been waiting for Mr Bolkestein to speak to us, as we requested, on the remarks he made about Islam.
I think that we must start at the beginning, because otherwise, only the Group of the European Popular Party will be able to raise these issues and I believe that we all have the right to have the Commission make a statement.
As long as we make sure we are dealing with issues of political substance and not something else I am sure we can find a modus vivendi.
I should like to thank everyone who has participated in today's debate.
I should like to say in particular to the Commissioner and the Council present here that we are normally not so self-indulgent in terms of the time we take to talk to each other as colleagues.
It is very important that in this House we work towards establishing an esprit de corps.
It is very important that we work on this culture for change.
If we do that I guarantee that the other two institutions will also benefit.
I hope this has been time well spent for you too.
The debate is closed.
Combating terrorism
The next item is the joint debate:
Council statement - Decision taken on 27 December 2001 on measures to combat terrorism;
Report (A5-0003/2002) by Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism (14845/1/01 - C5-0680/2001 - 2001/0217(CNS))
and
on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States (14867/1/01 - C5-0675/2001 - 2001/0215(CNS)).
Mr President, my report is a draft response by this Parliament to two legislative acts: a proposed Council framework directive on combating terrorism and a proposed Council framework directive on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States.
Together with the creation of the European judicial authority, Eurojust, these two measures form the legislative basis of the European Union's response to the menace of terrorism.
The European Union may allow itself a few moments of satisfaction.
These measures represent a major step forward towards the creation of a European judicial space.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for reminding us that this judicial space did not start on 11 September last year, although it would be churlish not to recognise that the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September gave a political momentum which allowed us to knock heads together and overcome certain objections.
Many of us regret that such a stimulus was needed.
Nonetheless we welcome the progress it has brought.
What do these measures do?
The European arrest warrant applies to a wider range of offences than previous extradition agreements.
It makes surrender a judicial, rather than a political process.
It largely abolishes the dual incrimination principle.
It sets a time limit of 90 days for extradition, giving us the chance to judge all suspects of an offence at the same time.
It consolidates the idea of European Union law.
The framework decision on terrorism makes terrorism an offence in every country.
Currently it has been an offence in only six.
It defines for the first time in international law a terrorist act and the offences which constitute a terrorist act.
It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties.
I commend these measures to the House.
The terrorist threat is deadly serious.
It requires a serious response.
These two measures constitute such a serious response.
I regret - and we have in previous debates here regretted - the absence of proper democratic oversight and control of the Union's procedures of law-making in this area.
This House argued for the invocation of Article 42 of the Treaty, allowing these measures to be brought within the first pillar.
Nonetheless, we recognise that the process of debate has brought improvements, that our amendments at the first reading have introduced certain safeguards into these measures.
I welcome the words from the President-in-Office of the Council about closer involvement of Parliament in the process of passing such legislation.
Other measures, such as the freezing of assets, have been far less coordinated.
Indeed, it is not unfair to say, from reports of Coreper meetings, that the European Union has been all at sea in its approach to freezing of assets and other decisions.
The motion for a resolution on the table today reflects that.
We know since the end of the 1990s that three phenomena - terrorism, internationally organised crime and corruption - are increasingly linked.
What academics have called the terrorist criminal nexus is well established.
The fight against the terrorist criminal infrastructure must be our top priority.
We know, too, that internationally organised crime is by far the biggest factor, economically and probably politically, in this terrorist criminal nexus.
Money laundering represents between 2 and 5% of aggregate global GNP. That is between EUR 500 billion and EUR 1.5 trillion.
It is not enough just to freeze assets of terrorist groups.
We must fight the economic dimension of terrorism if we are to get on top of the problem.
The United Nations has started to do this through its financial action task force.
The recommendations from the Washington meeting of 30 October to be implemented by June of this year are essential and provide an area where we can work together with the United States of America in combating this threat.
But here I would appeal for the European Union to take the initiative: to take the initiative on ways forward, to try to bring the Americans back into the international community in this fight against terrorism, and to do so within a proper legal framework, with proper democratic and parliamentary control.
A number of amendments have been submitted to my report.
Amendments Nos 1 and 5 are identical and they cause me no problem.
Amendment No 2 which comes subsequent to our adoption of the report in committee seems to be slightly out of context and I recommend a vote against.
Amendment No 4 calls for the establishment of a European habeas corpus act.
My group will support this, as we did in committee, although we consider the reintroduction of the amendment to be rather like adding too much monosodium glutamate to the cooking.
But Amendment No 3 is the crux of the debate: the movers say that the European Union should not proceed without the guarantee of adequate standards in procedural law.
That means that the Union cannot respond to the terrorist threat.
I disagree with them.
We must respond.
But, in giving our agreement, we do so on the basis of faith that these measures will be rebalanced with procedural guarantees.
This matter is very poignant to me personally.
Faith is not a comfortable basis on which to proceed in politics.
I am aware that my name, and perhaps the name of my party, may be associated with laws that could be used for repressive purposes.
I appeal to the Council and Commission, in the spirit of the new relationship that we have between our institutions, to move rapidly to consolidate the necessary move forward in security with measures to promote freedom and justice on which the European Union will be judged.
In commending these framework directives to the House, in recommending that we trust the other institutions, I say to them: you are on trial.
The European Union is on trial before the court of world democratic opinion.
Mr President, if we can conclude this debate with a vote that confirms the broad consensus that we have reached to date on this matter, I wish to call on the parliamentary groups not to change the report.
We will be renewing our commitment to the fight against terrorism and we will be ending a process which, as Mr de Miguel has reminded us, began in the European Parliament.
By doing so, we would be turning one of the most illustrious pages in the history of this House.
We now hope to see a rapid transposition of these measures so that they are effective, so that decisions are taken that are able to freeze the assets of European terrorist groups and so that efforts are coordinated in the fight against terrorism, not only between Member States, as has happened most notably between Spain and France in recent times, but also between the competent bodies that have been established within the European Union.
Mr President, I am convinced that with this process, we will not only be responding to a demand expressed very firmly by Europe' s citizens, but we will also be making an invaluable contribution to the cause of freedom.
There is no greater risk to the freedom of thought, of expression and to the right to life itself, than violence expressed through terrorism.
Every democratic State has an obligation to provide justice with instruments such as those we are discussing today, which will make its work more effective.
Under the Rule of Law, democratic dialogue must be based on mutual trust and non-violence, with the aim of defending democracy, precisely as we stated in one of the report' s sections on the Union' s role in the fight against terrorism.
To do anything else, ladies and gentlemen, would be to accept that the laws approved by democratically-elected parliaments should change to please the murderers and for them to stop killing; this hope, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, should be rejected because it is antidemocratic and immoral.
Mr President, the Council should realise that it is heading for a great row if it carries on as in its complex package of 27 December, making legal definitions of who is a terrorist without any democratic scrutiny.
I predict that the Council's next step will be to institute Europe-wide bans.
It would be outrageous to do that in secret and without accountability.
Turning to the framework decisions on combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant, my group will support them.
For a normally sensible British journalist yesterday to say that Europe blindly, on the nod, is about to indulge in its own sinister overreach, really is over the top.
My group will not vote to postpone the entry into force of the European arrest warrant until there are common minimum standards of procedural law.
Urgent action to catch terrorists and criminals cannot be postponed, but the habeas corpus amendment drafted so deftly by Mr MacCormick is very worthwhile.
However, high minimum standards are also urgently needed in parallel.
It is a fiction to say that, since we all have excellent justice systems, mutual recognition is enough.
I could highlight flaws in the system of my own country - for example we have the highest number in prison of any EU State - as well as flaws in other Member States.
The Council, as well as MEPs, must welcome proposals that the Commission is preparing on achieving equivalence in criminal justice standards.
If some of the people who now oppose the European arrest warrant - in particular those on the right, not least in my own country - also cry "shock! horror!" at what they might claim is harmonisation of criminal justice systems, they will be guilty of great hypocrisy.
We need the European arrest warrant; we also need a programme of equivalence in common minimum high standards.
Mr President, the issue of the European arrest warrant is really quite bizarre, not only because important issues remain vague, but also because Parliament lacks the courage to exact what it agrees to in substance.
First of all, I should like to give you a random example of this lack of clarity.
The Council has rightly pared down the Commission proposal, as a result of which a Member State can refuse to extradite someone if that person has not done anything wrong according to that country.
I agree with this.
Accordingly, a Dutch doctor who carries out an abortion on an Irish girl in the Netherlands does not face extradition to Ireland.
However, could this doctor ever go on holiday to Ireland, or any other EU country, if Ireland requests extradition on the grounds of manslaughter?
This remains unclear, and a lack of clarity in criminal law leads to the sense of justice being eroded.
I should now like to turn to the issue of parliamentary courage.
Mr Watson, ever since the Di Lello report, this Parliament has been of the opinion 'that the Member States have to agree on common minimum standards for certain aspects of procedural law in order to guarantee a common level of protection of the constitutional right across the EU' .
Since the European arrest warrant has demonstrated the need to protect our citizens across the European Union, and we also have the tool to enforce this protection, then we must also have the courage to use it.
And you need not be frightened.
If the Council is just as dynamic and decisive in guaranteeing citizens' rights as it is in taking repressive measures, the European arrest warrant will not run into any delays.
Certainly not now the Commission has presented a first version of the minimum standards, by means of which it has demonstrated that these are both necessary and possible.
With regard to the definition of terrorism, my group adheres to a number of guarantees included in the recitals and the Council Declarations of 6 December, including the guarantee that nothing in this framework decision 'can be interpreted in such a way that people who exercise their constitutional right to free expression of opinion can be charged on terrorist grounds, even if they break the law in the process.'
But all good intentions to adopt this text have been seriously hampered by the fact that these guarantees are not included in the Council Decisions of 27 December.
The essence of the definition in this text is identical, but the guarantees have disappeared.
They are not even referred to.
Our amendment to the resolution aims to plug this loophole and, since only time will tell whether I am unnecessarily distrustful or justifiably cautious, I would ask the other groups to give my group this assurance.
Mr President, for a second time, we are rejecting a text which forms part of a campaign conducted by the Bush Administration and which, in the name of the fight against terrorism, merely seeks to place the most basic democratic freedoms in jeopardy throughout the world, with total disregard for international conventions.
To illustrate this, there are still, because of 11 September, 500 immigrants in the United States who were arrested on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities, are being secretly detained and have never been charged.
Military proceedings have been instigated.
And, several dozen prisoners are now being detained in appalling conditions, at the Guantanamo Bay military base, who have no guarantees and no status.
Here in Parliament, we have been made to endorse a list of terrorists, which was, in fact, drawn up by the CIA on the basis of its own criteria and without justification, whilst England, France and Italy are taking measures to curb freedoms, particularly those of immigrants.
Furthermore, we have had a common definition of terrorism thrust upon us, one that is destructive of freedom and which, if applied to the letter by a leader like Mr Berlusconi, could lead to trade union activities, such as strikes within the public services, being classified as crimes.
The last point I will add is that we do not fight the terrorism of private individuals by supporting terrorism engaged in by a State, as is the case with Mr Sharon - we do so by eradicating poverty, injustice and corruption from the globe.
Mr President, I have just returned from Porto Alegre, and I understand the concerns of Mr Bush and his allies in the face of this huge movement that is fighting rampant globalisation. I, however, have chosen the camp I support; I reject a campaign that seeks to criminalise any movement that challenges the established order.
Mr President, I sympathise both with the previous speaker and with all those who, as frequently happens, mention - albeit, in my opinion, inappropriately in some cases - the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi.
To get back to the debate, the European Parliament is, at last, going to vote on two fundamental issues: combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant.
Of course, this vote is only a sort of belated attempt to comply with bureaucratic procedures in respect of decisions which have actually already been taken.
As has already been stressed, this way of going about things is not particularly acceptable, for it represents a genuine political humiliation for the European Parliament, which - and we must not forget it - is the only democratically-elected European institution, the only institution which fully represents the European citizens.
We can be satisfied with the endorsement of the European arrest warrant, a tool which will certainly be effective in legal terms in combating terrorism and international organised crime, replacing the complex, excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures.
However, we must not forget that the fight against terrorism, particularly the sort of terrorism which we have encountered in recent months, cannot be conducted solely by means of arrest warrants, for this would be a hypocritical and wholly inadequate approach.
As Mr Solana stressed yesterday, Europe will only be able to attempt to win genuine international credibility if it is capable of restoring peace and social and political justice to the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East.
Europe' s undertaking in these critical areas must not be dictated solely by emergencies and emotion or, even worse, by the selfish desires of those who see their own peace threatened: it must be part of a European project, a practical, ongoing undertaking seeking to secure a fitting economic, political and social future for these areas.
In conclusion, we are confident that the new constituent phase which will be inaugurated with the installation and work of the Convention will genuinely succeed in making Europe a strong, responsible political actor, capable of achieving a single common foreign and security policy and a common European area of freedom and justice.
Thank you, Mr President, the date of 11 September has made it even clearer that a tough battle against terrorism and organised crime is what is needed in order to guarantee the free area of peace and security in the Member States.
Via the present proposals, the Council is making a commendable effort to contribute to this by making rapid extradition possible.
However, I do have some concerns.
In my view, a restricted, positive list of criminal offences should fall under the European arrest warrant.
The criterion is whether there is a European or international definition, as in the case of terrorism, for example.
However, the list which is now before the Council contains many criminal offences for which there are no European definitions available.
The nature of the listed offences is diverse.
They cover fraud, rape and manslaughter.
What is the cross-border aspect of these offences?
Do the existing extradition treaties not offer sufficient scope in this area?
However, in order to prevent this welcome initiative from being shelved again, now that a difficult compromise has been struck, I would give it the benefit of doubt.
Mr President, we need to strengthen control at the European Union' s external borders if we want to combat the menace of terrorism effectively.
I would point out that there is an undertaking made by the Ministers, which commits the Strategic Committee on Immigration to implementing measures such as the joint training of border control officials through the creation of a European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control.
In this connection, we have firmly condemned the activities of a country which is hoping to accede to the Union, Turkey.
People continue to arrive in Italy illegally by boat and Turkey must assume its responsibilities: the international authority has drawn up a list of what are known as 'rogue States' , but I would like to stress the responsibility of the 'Mafia States' too, which are making no effort at all to curb this appalling trafficking of people dragged into situations where there is no hope and which have no end.
With regard to the arrest warrant, I must point out that the Italian Government has endeavoured to ensure that this framework decision cannot be enforced until the Constitution has been amended.
Indeed, we need to consider two different requirements simultaneously: the security of the European citizens in the face of severe terrorist threats and the safeguarding of Constitutional freedoms and guarantees - fundamental, inviolable rights - whose sanctity must be defended in the face of all rules, including those of international law.
Mr President, Commissioner, esteemed Presidency of the Council, I take a very positive view of the commitment brought, formerly by the Belgian Presidency and now by the Spanish, to this great issue of combating terrorism.
The added value of this European Union of ours was also shown by the speed with which the European institutions, in particular the Commission and the Council, responded to the terrorist attack on 11 September with a whole package of measures ranging from the definition of the common offence via the European arrest warrant, to facilities such as joint investigation teams in Europol.
This is a very positive response.
What is, however, highly problematic about certain areas of this decision-making process is the circumvention of Parliament - of Parliament, which represents the citizens of our European Union and the involvement of which is required by law and Treaty, indeed it must be involved prior to a resolution of the Council rather than afterwards.
As this is not the first time this has happened, and since there seems to be method in this approach, I would like to take this opportunity to protest in strong terms.
Such modes of action involving circumvention of the Treaty should no longer be tolerated.
I wish to add to this the demand that Parliament be in future more involved in the adoption of third pillar measures.
The Regulation of 27 December stipulated the persons and groups whose accounts were to be frozen.
I would be interested to know whether there is a report evaluating the success or otherwise of this operation, indicating which accounts were actually found and what funds were frozen.
I would like to conclude by repeating my demand that Parliament should be involved in an effective way, as this would, on the one hand, enhance efficiency and, on the other, maintain legal certainty.
Mr President, if any good came out of the events of 11 September - and it would be a brave person who said it did - I would single out two things.
Firstly, it caused the world to look, for the first time perhaps, at the whole question of Islam as a religion - but I will leave that for the moment.
Secondly, it caused Europe, the USA and the West to look again at the whole question of international relations.
We cannot close our eyes and minds to the problems of small countries thousands of kilometres away or impoverished and troubled regions - whether or not we agree with the regimes there - and just think that they do not matter.
If we do, we run the risk that the problems will manifest themselves on our doorsteps.
One way that happens is through terrorism, which obviously we cannot ignore.
We counter it by international cooperation.
Mr Blokland said earlier that we need to be harder and firmer.
In addition to repressive measures, it is fundamental that we look at and try to address the root causes - poverty, war, oppression and a whole range of issues - that lead to terrorism.
We all abhor and condemn terrorism.
These two reports are a first step towards greater international cooperation in addressing terrorism and increasing international police cooperation.
We, as politicians, are elected to monitor at a European level what happens.
We must press for the highest possible standards, for maximum cooperation, and constantly keep the situation under review and monitor progress.
Mr President, I have taken the floor to express both satisfaction and concern: satisfaction at the tangible step forwards taken by the European Community in terms of combating terrorism; concern at certain inappropriate compromises imposed by some Member States as a condition for them agreeing to endorse our Convention, compromises which we were not able to oppose before it was too late because Parliament was not consulted before the decisions were taken.
The Italian situation is one example: our Italian citizens had to suffer humiliation and dissatisfaction on the part of the other Member States just because our government attempted, without success, to make the scope of the European Convention subject to certain conditions, excluding from it certain offences which are of great importance to our Prime Minister, who - by pure chance, as the State attorney for Milan, Francesco Saverio Borelli, would say - happens to be on trial in Italy for precisely these offences.
I refer in particular to the offences of corruption and fraud.
Failing in that attempt, our government had the gall to request, and this time obtained - a concession made purely to get out of the impasse - another misleading clause, which, in fact, is in danger of rendering the Convention on the European arrest warrant unenforceable in the foreseeable future.
I refer to the clause to the effect that the government deems it necessary to amend the Italian Constitution in order to be able to implement the European rules.
This is not the case: our Constitution does not need to be amended in any way; it provides all possible guarantees.
My country can therefore now postpone indefinitely the introduction of a major instrument for fighting crime on the pretext that the Constitution has not yet been amended.
I am aware that adopting the amendment we have proposed on this matter would be a superfluous gesture, but it would be the only way to make it clear that Parliament needs to be involved before decisions are taken, not afterwards.
Mr President, all of us in this House are agreed that it is a good thing to move towards the creation of a common European judicial space.
We are also agreed, particularly in respect of the arrest warrant, that it makes the adoption of common and high minimum standards a matter of urgency.
Mr Watson and Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ have asked us today to take it on trust that it will be done as a matter of urgency.
We have to take some things on trust, but I would be reluctant to take all on trust.
Furthermore, standards alone are never enough because standards can be broken.
The only thing that guarantees high standards being observed is effective remedies.
One of the most effective remedies ever devised was devised by the English common lawyers - I speak as a Scotsman - in the way of making sure that those who are wrongly detained are brought to court and released if the jailer cannot show cause for keeping them there.
That is a really effective remedy.
In adopting the European arrest warrant each of our states makes its own judiciary the instrument of justice in another state.
That is a good thing, that we help each other.
But it should also be the case that if the powers of one country's courts are abused by misconduct of prosecutors in another country, they can be recalled with an effective remedy.
An effective remedy must be a Europe-wide remedy and one that diminishes the risk of undue detention pre-trial like the old 110-day rule which we celebrate in my country.
Let us have Amendment No 4 and make sure that we have remedies that are effective as well as standards that are high.
Mr President, terrorists acts are now punishable in all EU countries, and it is already possible to extradite criminals from one EU Member State to another.
That means that what is being proposed here is to some extent an empty gesture.
It is clear, however, that it is in danger of weakening legal certainty.
The proposal means that extradition cases would not be examined in the same way as before and that special legislation against crimes specifically classed as terrorism would be implemented on very vague and unclear grounds.
I think it is dubious, on such vague bases, to have a special legal system within a legal system.
We can now already see how people who ended up on the UN' s and EU' s terrorist lists have had their assets frozen without discovering why.
As a result, they have no means of defending themselves, either.
I believe that when, as we must, we combat terrorism, we must do so by employing, rather than weakening, the Rule of Law.
Mr President, since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September of last year, we in the European Parliament have debated the threats to our freedom, democracy and values in a more realistic light than before.
Most of us have realised that an attack on the United States is an attack on ourselves.
Just a few months further on, however, there are circles that are busy relativising the threats by distancing Europe from the United States.
None of us likes the restrictions and controls that hit all of us and limit everyone' s rights to freedom, but we have to accept them because we do not know where, and precisely who, the enemy is.
We must, however, face the fact that until the divisions that divide the world economically, religiously and ideologically have been removed, it is impossible for us to bring about the area of peace, security and justice we want to see.
While I shall vote in favour of the framework decision on combating terrorism, I shall abstain from voting in favour of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant since the latter has not appeared on the scene because of the terrorist threat but serves the overall purposes of federalism and is not limited to striking a blow against terrorists.
In actual fact, I agree with Baroness Ludford that legal certainty is not, in all Member States, at a level that can justify such far-reaching surrender procedures as are at issue here.
Mr President, this is one of the most illiberal and dishonest measures ever to come out of the EU, one with potentially enormous consequences.
It has nothing to do with citizens' freedoms and rights, and everything to do with a monstrous power-grab by Brussels.
In the book 1984 by George Orwell, the state ministries were given names which represented the exact opposite of their functions.
Thus, the Ministry of Peace was concerned with war, the Ministry of Truth was responsible for propaganda, and so on. From this stemmed the term "Orwellian inversion", meaning a description which implies the opposite.
How appropriate it is, therefore, that this measure should be approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - the ultimate Orwellian inversion.
In approving this decision, the committee should be ashamed of itself and, if this so-called Parliament adopts that decision today, it too should be thoroughly ashamed.
It will be betraying the very principles it claims to support.
Mr President, I would like to tell the rapporteur that he is mistaken.
We are the ones on trial: it is not the Council that is being put to the test today but Parliament.
The Council has taken its decisions, and it took them in meetings held behind closed doors, in secret, decisions partially harmonising criminal law and criminal procedure.
In particular, the European arrest warrant, whose scope is much wider than just terrorism, is an incentive to introduce heavy prison sentences.
Above all, in automatically recognising the decisions and procedures of national penal systems, it fails to lay down any common minimum guarantee safeguarding the rights of the defendant.
These are guarantees that Parliament cannot afford to hope will be put in place just for the future for it is its duty to demand them for the immediate present, to demand, that is - and here I am addressing Mr Pirker - that the procedures be respected rather than merely lamenting the fact that they have not been.
Parliament must demand that, to safeguard the Rule of Law, no fundamental principles are jeopardised.
Mr President, I am sorry that Graham Watson is not present, because I wish to begin by paying tribute to his work on these two reports, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Public Freedoms, Citizens' Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
As I have inherited this position, I feel, if possible, even more obliged to acknowledge the work that has been undertaken.
I agree fully with what he has said, but with one important difference.
We are talking about minimum guarantees of procedure as if there were none.
There are, and although they are not common, which is the case in many areas, they are equivalent. They are also adequate for the time being.
Not having - as European citizens who wish to establish a common area of justice - to become involved in discussing how to improve these guarantees is another matter altogether.
We must make a clear distinction between the two issues.
The Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, together with the Socialist Group, will vote against these amendments, not because we are against the issues, as some speakers have claimed, but because we must make it clear that all Member States have minimum guarantees of procedure which are adequate and equivalent.
We must, therefore, act on the basis of this trust.
We all want to be more ambitious for the future, however.
The European Union flies the flag of human rights and guarantees and, therefore, when we establish this area of justice, we shall do so resolutely, in the committee that I chair and in this Parliament, as far as we can in this legislature.
We will never consider it to be enough.
Mr President, I think 11 September woke us all up and made us aware of the need for urgent action.
I also believe that we have acted accordingly.
I am myself from Germany. Germany, Spain and Great Britain are examples in the field of counter-terrorism, of which they have had experience.
I think that is why we understand each other very well.
It is also for this reason that Parliament has done its homework and always supported the Commission and the Council when they wanted to adopt reasonable measures and submitted sensible proposals.
That has always, to date, been the way we have conducted ourselves.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, my problem is, though, that this is not just about combating terrorist organisations.
It has also become clear since 11 September that the combating of terrorist groupings is not sufficient on its own.
To take Islamic extremism in the European Union as an example, there are groupings that we do not describe as 'terrorist' but which our security agencies, for example, nonetheless categorise as organisations detrimental to security.
In my country, Germany, there are 30 000 adherents of an Islamic grouping called Milli GÃ¶rÃŒs, or, in Berlin, 'Islamic Federation' .
As they enjoy the right to provide Islamic teaching in schools, and thus to engage in the brainwashing of small children, I see them as being in several respects at least as dangerous as the terrorist organisations.
I therefore believe that an arrest warrant and a definition of terrorism cannot be enough on their own, and that it is precisely for this reason that we have to concern ourselves very intensively with the other causes of terrorism as well.
I work on the assumption that the Commissioner and the Presidency, being from Spain, are in a position to examine this danger very closely.
Mr President, the European arrest warrant that is before us is an unqualified political, legal and procedural sham.
It is a procedural sham because the framework decision is already prepared and drafted.
Everything was ratified at the Laeken Summit on 14 December 2001.
The consultation of Parliament is therefore utterly illusory; it is worthless and I would even go as far as to say that it is insulting.
It is also a sham in substance, because its original purpose was to combat terrorism following the attacks of 11 September.
In reality, the scope of the future arrest warrant was widened to include 32 offences, which means two things.
The first is that we are proposing to change from using a system of extradition between States, which guarantees individual freedoms, to a single legal system, without the representatives of the people being involved in this change.
The second is that, on the pretext of combating terrorism, the European arrest warrant will provide the basis for cracking down on the convictions that are included on the list in question.
In the future, for example, for having criticised an immigration policy that a judge supports, or for having declared one' s national preference in one' s country, or for having expressed an opinion that is deemed politically or historically incorrect, a patriot could be expelled from his country, arrested, and transferred to another country that has an unfamiliar language and legal system.
What you are preparing is, in fact, not the Europe of security, which requires many other measures; you are preparing the Europe of uniformity, of power systems and of ready-made thinking.
Big Brother is watching you.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr de Miguel for his statements today.
The Watson report, which has recently been provoking extremely serious debates and has caused a number of clashes, is back on the table today.
Today' s debate is on the amendments made by the Council after the decision was approved by Parliament; these amendments include those of the Italian Government, of course.
My respect for Parliament prevents me from focusing on the controversy triggered off by a certain political party.
The passage of time has proved these accusation to be nothing but hot air, hot air which, I regret to say, has been blown this way again today, thanks, not least, to Mr Di Pietro, on whose behalf, as a friend, I take it upon myself to apologise to the House, especially for his grossly inaccurate accusations which are more the product of blind hatred of the individual concerned than proven facts.
The priority of internal security and the protecting external borders must therefore be underscored firmly once again.
Internal security and the fight against organised crime can no longer be matters purely for national competence.
The trafficking of drugs and human beings and terrorism are transnational phenomena which can only be addressed at a higher level.
With regard to the need to create an internal judicial space, the differences between national Constitutions and judicial systems must be taken into account so that national legislation can be genuinely harmonised.
The European arrest warrant must be accepted as an essential tool for combating terrorism and crime but, if it is to be genuinely effective, it needs to be handled in the same way in all the Member States.
Only thus will the citizens be able to have guarantees of effectiveness in the fair handling of individual cases and the certainty of justice rather than the freedom and rights of the powerful - as somebody in this Chamber has insinuated - but the freedom and rights of all the citizens, including citizens of third countries who wish to live and work lawfully in Europe.
We must fight to stop Europe becoming the new forum for attempts to exploit the legal system to persecute political figures or other forms of intolerance which diminish the dignity of the individual.
In conclusion, Mr President, the battle against old and new forms of crime and unlawful activities, against organised crime, money laundering and corruption - combined with a bold fight against terrorism in all its forms - must not be confused with inquisition-like persecution.
Henceforth, we must quickly build a common judicial space, maybe even placing the rules governing penal law under the first pillar again, making the different legal systems consistent and with the objective of combining inflexibility in fighting unlawful activities with firm consolidation of the Rule of Law.
Mr President, we must never forget that our task here is to build, all together, a Europe based on the freedom of the citizens.
Mr President, I should like to begin by reiterating the importance of this debate and of the piece of legislation that has brought us together today, because we have spoken so often of these matters that we sometimes run the risk of losing sight of how important the issues really are.
I should, therefore, like us to be aware of the importance of what we are today deciding on, not only from the point of view of creating a common area of freedom, security and justice, but from the point of view of the political decisions that have led us to this agreement.
In general, we tend to value things once we have lost them.
I should like to value this decision - and I would ask you to do the same - for what we have lost as a result of not having taken this decision before.
If ten years ago we had initiated the arrest warrant, if we had defined the crime of terrorism, if we had made European judges and police forces work together, if Europe had accepted ten years ago that defeating terrorism requires joint action and not only solidarity with those who directly suffer its blows and if we had confronted terrorism with the entire might of European democracy, today ETA would be a thing of the past.
This is why I say I would like you to consider from this point of view the importance of the instruments that we are today debating and which we will be adopting.
If we had introduced them before, we would not have suffered such irreparable losses.
We have lost years of freedom and human lives and we have buried friends, dear friends, who would have been with us here today.
History has shown that human beings can be extraordinarily cruel if their actions go unpunished.
This is why I say that, if we had acted previously, ETA would today be a thing of the past.
We would have fewer orphans, fewer widows, less suffering and less fear.
Think about this when you vote, ladies and gentlemen.
Be proud to be key players in this major decision and do not forget that, above and beyond all the speeches, what you are doing is giving life and freedom a chance.
Mr President, this House is requested to give its approval to the proposal of the Council on a framework decision that concerns directly basic principles of democracy.
This Parliament is merely consulted.
Its opinion is, in the words of Mr Turco, "no more than a costly bureaucratic exercise".
More than forty years have passed since I learned from Patrick McGuilligham at the Faculty of Law in Dublin what the expression "rubber stamp parliament" means.
In our last sitting in Strasbourg, talking about the area of freedom, security and justice defined in the Amsterdam Treaty, the Spanish presidency put security first, ignoring the fact that the only real guarantee for security is the implementation of freedom and justice.
Mr Watson, on that occasion, stood up to say: "We will push you to make sure that freedom and justice are not far behind."
Yesterday two more Basque organisations - SEGI and ASKATASUNA - were expelled from the area of freedom and justice in the name of Mr Aznar's priority - Spanish security.
Can this judicial decision form part of the European judicial space mentioned by Mr Watson?
Thank you, Mr President.
The European Parliament' s renewed consultation about the framework decisions on the fight against terrorism and on the European arrest warrant bears the hallmarks of a diversion, although it presents the Dutch members of the PVDA in this Parliament with an opportunity to express our satisfaction with the result achieved in negotiations by the Dutch Minister in the Justice and Internal Affairs Council.
Thanks to this result, an initially unacceptable proposal proved satisfactory after all, a compromise that is nothing to write home about in terms of content but that does secure the important achievements of our criminal law policy.
Moreover, we do support the amendment relating to the European habeas corpus order.
However, viewed in terms of the European Parliament' s relationship with the Council, this debate and subsequent vote actually constitute a mere show which compromises the credibility not only of Parliament but also of the Council.
Every presidency pronounces touching words about the crucial dialogue with the European Parliament but, in this area, we have been taken for a ride twice.
Firstly, Parliament was consulted about superseded proposals and, secondly, Parliament was allowed to have its say on completed proposals which were already set in stone.
The vital new proposal on criminal procedural law seems to me to be a good opportunity to right this wrong and thus to better organise this dialogue.
Mr President, today we have genuine reason to be pleased, because I am convinced that, with the approval, in a few minutes, of Mr Watson' s reports, we will be taking another important step towards the creation of the common European area of justice, freedom and security that we all wish to see.
Another reason for this Parliament and, of course, for me personally, to be pleased, is the fact that the decisions adopted by the Council at the Laeken Summit take up the tenor of the positions that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions.
I cannot however, approve the lack of sensitivity that the Council has shown towards Parliament - and this has been recognised by fellow Members and by the Council itself - with regard to consultation on the list approved on 27 December 2001.
In achieving the difficult balance between freedom and security, a position in which we often find ourselves at the moment, we are taking the appropriate measures.
We cannot postpone the approval of resolutions and democratic standards which protect democrats against the terrorists and against those who prevent the exercise of the democratic freedom of Europe' s citizens.
At the same time, it is also our duty to acknowledge that we have a certain responsibility to continue to create this area of freedom and security, an aspect that some Members of this House have already put forward in various amendments.
Sometime very soon, we will have to address these issues, but today is not the right time.
Mr President, I too feel that, in adopting the Watson report, we will be taking a step forwards in the creation of that area of freedom, security and justice provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam and merely accelerated by the tragic attacks of 11 September.
On the one hand, a common definition of terrorist offences is introduced, which has been greatly improved thanks precisely to the intervention of Parliament and which is necessary for the effectiveness of our undertaking in this field.
On the other hand, not least in the area of criminal law, we are starting to implement the principle that Parliament has already upheld by unanimously adopting the Di Lello report on the mutual recognition of judicial measures when it came before Parliament, which is based on the assumption that all the Member States ensure minimum respect for fundamental rights.
Here, we do not have the Guantanamo prisons but the supervision of the Strasbourg Court to safeguard human rights, although there is room for improvement in all our systems, of course.
Thus, we are also bringing the effectiveness brought by joint action into play in the fight against terrorism, while still respecting the national diversities which make European integration unique.
I regret to say that the slow progress of this integration means that the European Parliament is still in the situation where it is merely consulted by the Council.
However, we can be confident that, once the Convention' s work and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference reforming the Treaties are over, this will no longer be the case, and that the Community method, which provides the greatest guarantee of democratic decision-making across the board, will be fully adopted in the Third Pillar too.
Mr President, having heard all the speeches, the Presidency of the Council wishes to join in expressing its pleasure that today a major decision is being taken; the decision to approve these two Watson reports.
I agree with the speakers who said that this is a great day.
I would say that it represents a huge step forwards in the construction of this area of security, justice and freedom.
Although it has been suggested that we could have done this sooner, the fact is that we are now, at least, on the way to achieving it.
At the same time, I should like also to say, Mr President, in response to the words of some honourable Members of this Parliament, who expressed their concerns that the implementation of these decisions could endanger fundamental rights, human rights and the idea that every European country accepts the primacy of the Rule of Law, I should like to say that this primacy and the safeguard of these fundamental values and human rights are the foremost considerations of the Council and the Member States when implementing these antiterrorist measures.
We are convinced - as I feel sure Parliament is - that the best way to combat the scourge of terrorism is precisely to do so on the basis of our system of values and with the law behind us. And also to fight resolutely, in order to safeguard this system of values, which terrorism wishes to ignore.
I therefore wish, on behalf of the Council, to offer every guarantee that citizens' rights will never be violated by the implementation of the decisions taken by the Council, which are also supported by this Parliament in the two Watson reports.
Thank you Commissioner.
After the Council statement, I received two motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m.
Financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference (Monterrey (Mexico), 21/22 March 2002].
Mr President, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union is delighted to appear before Parliament to give details of the current state of preparations for the International Conference on Financing for Development, which is due to take place in Monterrey (Mexico), from 18 to 22 March.
In recent months, the Monterrey Conference has come to occupy a prominent place on the so-called Development Agenda, particularly after the attacks of 11 September and with the realisation that the problems of development in a globalised world require our full, immediate and urgent attention.
This widespread interest justifies the efforts made by everyone who attended the fourth meeting of the Conference' s Preparatory Committee, which has just been held in New York, and which concluded with the adoption of a text that will be submitted for the approval of the Heads of State and Government that are due to attend the Monterrey Summit.
It is no accident that this document, which I shall discuss briefly a little later, is entitled "The Monterrey Consensus" .
Given that the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey is undoubtedly one of the most important events in the field of cooperation during our Presidency, Spain wishes to attach special priority to this event and this priority is reflected in the level of the official representation.
By this I mean that the Community delegation to the Monterrey Summit will be led by the President of the Spanish Government, the President-in-Office of the European Council.
The preparations for the Conference, Mr President, have been extraordinarily complex, given their exhaustive nature and the huge number of individuals that have been involved in the discussions.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank the previous Presidencies of the Union for the considerable effort they have made throughout this process, since it has been a gradual process to bring us up to the point we have now reached.
This ongoing and joint effort now means that, in Monterrey, the European Union can play the leading role it deserves as the world' s major donor of official development aid.
Before I highlight and discuss the features of the text adopted in New York, I should like, Mr President, to put the Monterrey Conference in the proper context, because it is not an isolated process. Instead, it is part of what was started by the Millennium Declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000, on sustainable development and the fight against world poverty.
We are, therefore, facing three independent but closely related procedures.
Firstly, trade, within the framework of the commitments adopted at the conference of the World Trade Organisation held in Doha.
Secondly, everything that concerns the mobilisation of financial resources, the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development and, thirdly, in the field of the environment, the Conference on sustainable development that is planned to take place in Johannesburg in September of this year.
I shall now refer briefly to the features of the Monterrey document, the famous Monterrey consensus that I mentioned earlier.
This final text, adopted ad referendum, since a formal closing session could not be held in New York, consists of 73 numbered sections and reflects the spirit of consensus in which it was drawn up.
Because it does not contain any unresolved elements, since everything has been agreed on, we hope that the Heads of State and Government will be able to maintain a genuine, frank and open political dialogue on the main issues that affect development and its current challenges.
The agreement that has been concluded lays down that the fundamental pillars of international development cooperation are a series of principles shared by donors and beneficiaries and, in particular, the concept of good governance at all levels, the existence of solid democratic institutions and respect for the Rule of Law, all in the spirit of partnership, on the basis of which the developed States are committed to adopting a series of measures to make financing flows more flexible for developing countries - albeit with a set of conditions - enabling governments to use international cooperation to create domestic conditions favourable to economic growth and social development.
Developed countries also assume the obligation of promoting trade within the terms of the agreements adopted in the World Trade Organisation, which are generally considered to be the main driving force behind all economic activity.
The developed States, after overseeing a reduction of official development aid in recent years, are now committed to increasing it.
This increase of resources is a commitment that applies to all donors, including the United States and Japan.
The text adopted is in line with the Laeken Declaration and the entire document emphasises the private sector' s role as a driving force for development and as a source of resources.
The text also takes up the need to increase resources to strengthen the institutional capacity of developing countries, and to implement the entire Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
With regard to the international financial architecture, the autonomy of the existing institutions and the mandate of their boards of management will be upheld and support will be given to the process currently under way in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
At the same time, we will be insisting on the principles of coordination, of transparency and of the participation of the developing countries in the international financial institutions.
The mechanisms for following up the Conference were also the subject of intense debate, with the decision finally going to various methods of follow-up, at the spring meeting of the Economic and Social Council, with the Bretton Woods Institutions and with the participation of the World Trade Organisation, also including representatives of civil society and the private sector, and with high-level dialogue in the United Nations General Assembly, held every two years.
At the same time, within the United Nations, the Secretariat-General has been asked to support the full use of existing mechanisms for coordinating the specialist agencies of the United Nations and the drawing up of an annual report on the work achieved in this area.
To this we can add a follow-up International Conference, whose concrete procedures will be defined by 2005.
This set of instruments and these mechanisms are intended to ensure that the Monterrey Conference process remains on the agenda of the main international organisations and institutions, as well as in the fora of the United Nations, and of its specialised programmes and agencies.
I would not wish to end, Mr President, without mentioning some of the contributions made by the European Union, that arise in the text on more than one occasion.
The European Parliament must be very aware, and we must be proud, of the firm position that the European Union has maintained throughout this Monterrey process.
I should like to list these contributions.
Firstly, the concept of partnership and the insistence on the need for solid economic policies, good governance and democratic principles, and the defence of human rights.
At the same time, the European Union has insisted on the participation of civil society in the development process.
Secondly, I should like to highlight the European Union' s position of emphasising the need for development to be sustainable and to incorporate economic, social and environmental aspects, whilst respecting, in all cases, gender equality and holding the fight against poverty to be a fundamental objective.
The Presidency, therefore, regrets that it was not possible to include a specific reference to the innovative concept of public goods on a global scale, in the face of opposition, to the very last, both from the Group of 77 and from other donors, although it hopes that, given its importance, the discussions on its definition and financing will continue in the appropriate fora.
Thirdly, the European Union has sought to highlight the link between the effectiveness and efficiency of official development aid and the implementation, by the beneficiaries of aid, of appropriate policies in the political, economic and social fields.
These are policies focused on giving aid to those in greatest need, so that maximum benefit can be gained from this official development aid.
In this way, the emphasis is focused not only on increasing the volume of resources, but on its effective use, with the fight against corruption also playing a key role and, furthermore, the commitment to continue with negotiations on the specific United Nations convention applying to this issue.
Similarly, external debt relief has been linked to the effective use of these resources to achieve economic growth and a sustained development that benefits the least-favoured sectors of each country taking part in these mechanisms.
Naturally, the European Union has worked very actively with other major donors, such as the United States and Japan, and with the Group of 77, to achieve consensus on the objective of contributing 0.7% of GDP to development, which allows us to include the differing points of view, economic realities and sensitivities.
I wish to emphasise that, precisely because of this work, a similar terminology has been used in the Monterrey consensus to that approved at the Laeken European Council.
Fourthly, the European Union has made efforts, which have been crowned with success, to have explicit references included in the text on multilateral cooperation in light of the new transnational challenges and threats arising from the funding of terrorism and organised crime.
My fifth point is that the European Union has also worked actively to have specific references included in this text to private-sector banking and to the importance of the development of this sector in supporting small and medium-sized businesses in developing countries.
Lastly, the support measures to increase the institutional capacity of the developing countries in the field of trade should also be highlighted.
For this reason, the Presidency sets great store by the package of practical measures that is being prepared by the competent services of the Commission, to increase developing countries' negotiating power in the field of trade.
To sum up, following the fourth and last preparatory meeting, the Presidency is quite optimistic about the forthcoming Monterrey Conference.
Despite the doubts that remained up until the last moment, we were able to adopt a final text on 27 January, almost two months before this important international meeting.
The fact that this was achieved by consensus - as I have already mentioned - and that we managed to involve all the donors in this consensus, makes the Monterrey consensus a good platform for the future, because it is creating the climate of trust that this complex process requires and which, furthermore, now means that the round tables planned for Monterrey can take place in an atmosphere that is positive and constructive and not one of confrontation.
The Monterrey Conference needs to be an innovative event, by tackling development and the fight against poverty from an all-encompassing position, covering the various aspects and encouraging the participation of all players.
This global vision gives the process as a whole an extraordinary complexity, which we must also tackle pragmatically and realistically, by means of work that makes inclusion - and not exclusion - the main objective of all those who are committed to cooperation development tasks.
We hope that the international campaign that is announced in Article 62 of the document, as one of the Millennium objectives, will also contribute to this.
Mr President, I can ensure this Parliament that the Council Presidency remains firmly committed to this approach and that the success of the Conference is still our main objective, especially if we take account of the fact that development cooperation policy must be one of the pillars on which the European Union' s external action is based, and must be in perfect harmony with other pillars such as the external and common security policies and trade policy.
For this reason, we are sure that the Monterrey Conference offers us an historic opportunity for the European Union to be able to project and transmit, together with the rest of the participants in that event, a clear message in defence of the values we hold dear.
Therefore, we consider that the defence of the democracy, of good governance, of strengthening the institutional development of aid-receiving countries, the Rule of Law, peace and security, and human rights, are crucial elements of economic and social development as a whole.
Mr President, the EU attaches great importance to the Conference.
We are convinced that in the current international context, we cannot approach the Financing for Development Conference on a business-as-usual basis: this time we need concrete action.
The present crisis will impact on economic development worldwide and it will be once again the poorest who pay the highest price.
We must counter this tendency by trying our best to make globalisation work for the poor and not against the poor.
In this context, the Financing for Development Conference represents a key opportunity for the international community to enter into a new "global deal" on the assumption that a safer world for all will only be possible if there is a strong signal on the renewed commitment in the fight against poverty.
After the agreement reached in the Preparatory Committee on the final document for the Conference, we should focus our attention on positive initiatives that the EU could make in key areas and on the input we can make in the political declaration in Monterrey.
Action is needed on the volume of ODA: we have to agree on concrete steps to double ODA flows within the next five years, in order to be able to achieve the Millennium development goals.
ODA must also be more efficient: we have to complete work on the untying of aid in time for the Conference.
All the themes discussed internationally will remain on the international agenda, whether or not they are specifically included in the Monterrey consensus.
One such case is the discussion on global public goods.
We will continue arguing in order to give some real impetus to international solidarity.
In our view, Monterrey and Johannesburg are closely linked, as both look at ways and means to implement the Millennium Declaration and the International Development targets, which we strongly support.
Also they are both related to the trade negotiations following the launch of these in Doha.
We have an opportunity to work in a comprehensive manner and we look forward to taking part in the conference and making it a success.
Mr President, we live in a world characterised by great material wealth, but the wealth is unevenly distributed.
At present, more than three billion people are trying to survive on less than two dollars per day.
Eradicating poverty is a moral imperative, but it is also an issue directly linked to our common security.
We live in a world in which countries and people are increasingly interdependent, which is more divided and in which there is greater danger of tensions, large-scale migration, damage to the natural environment and increased crime.
All this can of course also be linked to desperate acts that can lead, for example to terrorism.
It is against this background that we must view not only the forthcoming conference in Monterrey, but also this autumn' s world summit in Johannesburg.
On both occasions, rich and poor countries will have an opportunity to agree upon a long-term plan to eradicate poverty step by step.
The rich nations must offer increased support.
The poor nations must determine their priorities when it comes to work on combating poverty, greater respect for democracy and human rights and a more vigorous fight against corruption etc.
I think the consensus document referred to here today is weak.
No amount of fine words and eloquent rhetoric can eradicate poverty.
The spirit of this resolution is therefore that the EU should make every conceivable effort in Monterrey to ensure that specific pledges are made on increased cooperation and transfers of resources, debt cancellation and generally increased aid in a range of areas.
One particular issue is that of work designed to increase the production of the global, or 'public' , goods to which Commissioner Nielson refers, that is to say efforts to protect the climate, combat deforestation and develop vaccines and medicines to combat infectious diseases etc.
Through this resolution, we are sending a clear signal to the Commission, to the governments of our Member States and to the international community that, as parliamentarians, we take these issues extremely seriously and desire more than merely words in Monterrey.
We want to see practical results.
Mr President, with the UN Conference in Monterrey around the corner, the world is facing a fundamental choice.
Despite all the fine speeches, international conferences and development programmes, the gap between rich and poor has only widened over the past decades.
1.2 billion people, that is one fifth of the world population, live on less than one dollar a day.
The three richest people together own more than the total income of the world' s 48 poorest countries, and 130 million children never attend school.
These are the bare facts.
We all have a clear lesson to learn from the disastrous attacks of 11 September.
In the Global Village, we have to be prepared to tackle these problems together, but our response falls extremely far short of the mark.
I want to warn against a new international doctrine according to which the western world, having turned its back on these one billion people fighting for their daily existence, withdraws behind barriers made up of weapon shields and expensive technological defence materiel.
The amount of USD 379 billion which, if it were up to President Bush, is being earmarked for the Pentagon next year is more than seven times the total amount of development aid spent last year worldwide.
This situation is all the more poignant when one realises that, despite the worldwide agreement to spend 0.7% of GNP on development aid, the figure has even dropped to an all time low of 0.24%.
This is unacceptable because it is precisely a doubling of the worldwide development aid figures that is required in order to meet our international pledge, namely that, by 2015, all children in the world will be able to attend school and receive medical care.
The pledges for 2015 are clear.
The Member States must now very quickly meet this 0.7% target in a practical way.
We must not allow the breakthrough at Doha to be watered down.
European agricultural policy must change to benefit the Third World.
Without any serious commitments by the Western countries, the conference in Monterrey will end up in a stalemate.
This is why Europe, as the world' s largest donor of development cooperation and as the largest international trading power, must be prepared to throw its weight into the balance, building on the successes achieved at Doha, with a view to reaching authentic binding agreements in Monterrey about aid, education, health care and far-reaching debt relief.
Plugging the welfare gap is crucial for attaining stability and peace in the world.
More development aid is not enough but, without extra funding, poverty cannot be eradicated.
Affordable schooling and health care must enable people to develop the economy themselves and attract foreign capital.
In order to achieve the UN development objectives, aid has to be doubled.
Most donors still give far less than the agreed 0.7% of their GNP.
America could easily contribute far more, but only has an eye for increasing its military expenditure.
Many European partners too are still failing to meet the mark.
The problems involved in granting aid should not be an excuse for doing too little.
Learning from experience and improved international coordination can make development cooperation more effective.
Aid must help set up good governance, democratic structures and a well-functioning market economy.
Access to the global market is essential for developing countries.
Insupportable debts must be substantially lowered, and the Debt Repayment Fund must be adequate for this.
Poverty, Mr President, is the breeding ground for violence and terrorism.
More aid is not only a humanitarian necessity, but also an absolute condition for attaining stability and peace in the world.
Mr President, we must welcome the International Conference on Financing for Development, as this is an essential theme in the debate on reducing aid to developing countries.
For more than 20 years, the UN has told donor countries that they must dedicate 0.7% of their GNP to state development aid, in accordance with OECD standards, but only four countries are respecting this commitment.
Aid is decreasing in general and the current average is 0.2%.
Developing countries are suffering badly from the gradual and structural deterioration in trade terms for basic products and are caught up in the vicious cycle of paying back often illegitimate debts, as well as the interest charged on them.
How can we raise financial resources for the human, economic and social development of these people, given these circumstances?
Our hopes rest on Monterrey therefore, unless the outcome has already been determined and the American positions dominate this conference, as was the case at Doha.
By faithfully following the liberal principles of development that the international institutions and the European Commission have been applying for 20 years, the document before us, just as the Monterrey consensus, never calls neo-liberal globalisation into question.
However, the income of the population of developing countries has continued to fall over the same period, which proves this formula is ineffective and counter-productive.
It is failing, but we carry on regardless.
I do not know if the draft consensus for Monterrey, which does not propose any ambitious objectives, any practical financial measures or a timetable, is set in stone.
If that is the case, and if the conference limits itself to making wonderful statements which will never be followed up, I think that we must cancel it and the millions of euro that have been earmarked to organise the conference must be given directly to the least-advanced countries.
It would be a shame because there are grounds to condemn and criticise, but there are also grounds to discuss and, in relation to mobilising aid, propose cancelling debt, taxing capital and reforming the WTO.
The European Union must seize this opportunity to push through the adoption of ambitious objectives as well as restrictive measures, which could enable poverty levels to be cut in half by 2015.
The EU must reiterate the commitment made at Gothenburg to request the Member States to increase their aid to 0.7%.
The governments and parliaments which agreed to the principle of a Tobin-type tax must demonstrate their interest in regulating the financial markets and redistributing wealth towards the south.
Mr President, all those taking part in the summit must ensure that it is a success.
The European Union has a responsibility to do this.
Mr President, the situation of poverty in the world is perfectly well known, as is the deep gulf that separates the northern and southern hemispheres.
Nevertheless, and despite several declarations of good intentions, the formal 1974 commitment to attain the objective of public aid for development at a level of 0.7% of GDP and despite the fact that the World Bank recently found it necessary to double the resources earmarked for public aid, the truth is that it is no higher than 0.22% in the OECD countries, the lowest level ever, having fallen by around 25% in the last decade and not currently exceeding 0.32% in the Member States of the European Union.
Against this backdrop and with Johannesburg on the horizon, the Monterrey Conference is taking on an undeniable importance.
It is truly time to reverse past actions and negative trends, to look at the problem of the development of poor countries in a different way, a way that demonstrates greater solidarity and to adopt practical and binding measures.
We respect the Council decision of 8 November, but it is crucial that the Spanish Presidency and the Commission spare no effort to ensure that Monterrey results in objective and scheduled commitments that guarantee some progress, even with the awareness of the retrograde and unacceptable positions of the American administration in this field, which cannot impose conformist positions on others, and even with the awareness of the weaknesses of the so-called Monterrey consensus itself.
Monterrey must also result in guidelines that put an end to the devastating effect of foreign debt on the development of developing countries, by putting forward mechanisms that do not hold back the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative and which are primarily founded on global recognition of the principle of debt relief.
The appalling situation in which the developing countries find themselves cannot remain as it is and the European Union and its Member States must not only not content themselves with being the largest donor but must also adopt a clear position which helps these countries to find a way out of this situation.
Mr President, the widening gap between the world's rich and poor represents an enormous potential risk to all concerned.
Traditional development aid, which is taken more or less to be a sort of gift day in which the rich countries give to the poor ones, does not work.
What we need is an all-embracing concept of the peaceful development of the poor countries.
This is, of course, easier said than done, but we must remember that it is the countries with a wealth of raw materials, such as Angola or Nigeria, for example, whose people are the poorest.
That is not by chance; there is a system behind it.
We need to ask ourselves which, in this instance, are the donor countries and which the recipients - a question which, for me, has not been answered unambiguously.
The position of the developing countries is worse than in the days of colonial rule.
The key is fair world trade, in which raw materials have to be at the prices they deserve, and in which the net product must remain in these countries in order to develop their infrastructure.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate is adjourned.
It will be resumed this afternoon.
(The sitting was adjourned at 12.25 p.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
Mr President, given that today is the 50th anniversary of the accession of Her Majesty the Queen to the throne of the United Kingdom, could we not make a special note of that and send her felicitations and congratulations on fifty years of a glorious reign?
I will pass on your remarks to the President.
Vote
Mr President, I should like to notify you that, at any rate, it is still possible to vote on the second part of Amendment No 1.
In terms of words, you are probably right, but the spirit of the amendment is in contradiction.
So I would ask the rapporteur, Mr Olsson, for his advice on this matter.
Mr President, I share your view.
We are concerned here with three different alternatives.
We have now voted in favour of one of them, which mean that the others cease to be options.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report Vidal-Quadras Roca (A5-0465/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca' s extremely important report on methods of saving energy, particularly as regards the construction of buildings that are fit for habitation, where heating costs are the most burdensome for the citizens of the European Union.
On this occasion, as regards the heating costs very often sustained by pensioners and the elderly, I hope that our States decide to allocate pensioners a sum of money, which would differ from region to region, to meet these costs.
There are extremely beautiful areas of Europe such as Sicily where the cost of heating houses is very low, but there are other just as beautiful regions - in Sweden and Finland, for example - where heating costs are much higher.
I would add Scotland to your list of places where heating costs are very high.
Report Kauppi (A5-0466/2001)
I will talk about Scotland in a minute, Mr President.
With regard to Mrs Kauppi' s report on cooperation in the field of value added tax, I have to say that I met an old school friend, Mr Bertone, at Genoa airport. He said to me, with regard to the matter at hand: 'How good you are in Europe at making us pay more taxes, at organising yourselves and reaching agreements to improve the way we pay taxes!'
Just like myself, Carlo Fatuzzo, Mr Bertone is from Genoa and Genoa has a reputation in Italy similar to that of Scotland in the United Kingdom: in other words, we are very thrifty, as they say.
Indeed, my friend, Mr Bertone, of Genoa, said to me: 'Yes, you are good at making us pay out.
Why do you not do something, rather, to make us pay less tax, which would make us Genoese happy and probably the Scots as well?
I hope this happens as soon as possible!'
I have voted against this report.
The reason for my having done so is that the report quotes Article 95 of the Treaty as a legal basis, involving majority decision-making in the Council and codecision making for the European Parliament, and this in spite of the fact that Article 95 states that it does not cover 'fiscal provisions' .
What, therefore, we have here is something so crucially a matter of principle as a reorganisation of the way in which tax issues are dealt with, involving an abandonment of intergovernmental cooperation with its demands for unanimity in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty.
I cannot support the Commission' s view that the report only concerns administrative cooperation and that the proposal would not have any fiscal consequences because it does not directly relate to tax collection.
In the past, the Council has always rejected this position, and it changed the legal base to Articles 93 and 94, which only require that Parliament should be consulted.
The Swedish Christian Democrats fully support the Council' s approach.
We believe that tax issues should not be decided by majority decision in the Council and by codecision in Parliament.
Our clear position is that, in the future too, unanimity shall be required in connection with decisions on taxes, and this in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty.
Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0025/2002)
This report talks about climate change and what we must do to clean up the air.
I totally agree, Mr President.
However, do you remember what a beautiful day it was yesterday here in Strasbourg?
The temperature was 14-15 degrees and it was as if Spring had come; we all enjoyed it very much.
Well then, Mr President, I started to wonder whether, ultimately, global warming, which we are all endeavouring to fight and which raises the average temperature of the earth, might not be better than if the earth were getting colder.
Should we not reflect carefully before fulfilling these requirements, for maybe a little more heat in our world would be a good thing?
Report Watson (A5-0003/2002)
As you are aware, this document has been the subject of much debate, and it has also provoked opposition, particularly in Italy, as you know, Mr President.
I want to reiterate what I have said when we have voted on the European arrest warrant and combating terrorism in the past.
I agree that there should be rapid procedures for arresting those who ought to be arrested, whatever Member State of Europe they might flee to.
However, my ultimate goal and the ultimate goal of the Pensioners' Party is genuinely to achieve a single code of civil procedure and a single European penal code because, when all is said and done, if we all agree that a particular deed is a crime, then we must all agree on that without exception and without differences.
This is too important an area for there to be differences within Europe.
Mr President, when we are reflecting on the problems of improving procedures in the House it is worth noticing that an explanation of vote of this kind is one way one can reply to a point taken by the Commissioner at the end of a debate.
At the end of the debate on the Watson report, Mr Vitorino said that the amendment relating to the habeas corpus order would risk confusing the issue and undermine respect for human rights.
In that he completely ignored the point that the first condition stated for the operation of that amendment was for there to be a violation of human rights in the receiving state.
The point I made in my speech in the debate was that it is not enough to have common agreement to respect rights; you must have effective remedies.
That text of ours would have put in an effective remedy.
Since Parliament in its wisdom (or unwisdom) chose not to adopt it, I voted against the Watson report on the Arrest Warrant.
Other Members from the United Kingdom will come to regret that they did not too.
Some of my colleagues in the European Free Alliance - a majority of them - voted for the Watson report; not that they did not also regret the absence of the habeas corpus amendment, but that they felt a strong commitment in conscience, as we all do, to getting the European judicial space going forward, and thought that necessary.
Mr President, I wish to thank you for enabling us to arrange this properly.
I thought we had submitted the names in time, but there was some misunderstanding.
What is at issue, then, are the anti-terrorist laws and a European arrest warrant.
We are strongly critical of these terrorist laws, and above all of an arrest warrant, in terms both of their content and of the speed with which these laws have been devised.
We are also critical of the fact that there has been no basic examination of the proposed laws or assessment of their impact.
Moreover, the European Parliament has in actual fact dealt with the issue without much in the way of reflection.
We were therefore also extremely anxious that our Amendment No 4 should be voted through today.
Unfortunately, it was not.
I therefore think that Parliament has not accepted its responsibilities when it comes to protecting those deprived of their freedom and safeguarding human rights.
Following the attacks in the United States on 11 September, the work designed to produce new anti-terrorist laws within the EU has proceeded at a furious pace.
These draft laws are extremely far-reaching, and the security of the individual may be in danger.
The same concerns also apply to the interpretations brought to bear upon how a terrorist group is really to be defined.
A majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore voted against the arrest warrant.
All this is also having further consequences.
In Sweden, the freezing of the assets of al-Baraka, a not-for-profit association, has directly affected a number of Swedish citizens of Somalian origin.
It has also been made impossible for Somalians to send money to needy families and relatives.
This is a clear example of what can be the indiscriminate effects of these laws, and the fact that measures of this type can be taken without any proof being required is an injustice committed against people.
In my opinion, greater reflection and more impact assessments were needed before we took this decision.
Mr President, I voted against the decision on combating terrorism because I feel it is fundamentally flawed.
I recognise that there have been some improvements - for example in Recital 10.
A lot of people are putting faith in the Council's statement, which is not part of the legally binding text.
It is basically only a political promise.
People should be extremely wary of political promises.
The statement protects the right of people to protest, which is one of the fundamental issues that people were very concerned about.
If it had been in the text itself it might have been legally binding.
But there is no guarantee as to how this legislation will be used.
Will it interfere with the rights of people who are unhappy with the status quo and want to change things?
We also have to look at how it will impact on foreigners, for example people from different cultural and religious backgrounds - some people in Western society are extremely wary of them.
There is a great threat to their fundamental rights.
On the European arrest warrant I would endorse what Mr MacCormick has said.
It was very disappointing to see so many people in this Parliament not support an amendment that would have given people some sort of protection in relation to protecting their basic civil liberties.
The Communist Party of Greece never misses an opportunity to denounce the fact that the capitalist mechanism and police state being built up by the European Union are capitalist society's response to the rising tide of protest and demands for justice being generated by its own anti-grass roots policy of serving the interests of big business.
The leaders of the ÃU know full well that, despite their efforts, they cannot fool the people by cloaking their policies in pro-grass roots terms.
This tactic was on a slow but sure course up to 11 September.
Now, the horrendous events of that day are being used as a pretext to speed up the application of political decisions taken long ago.
The perpetrators of and accessories to the terrorist attacks have played straight into the hands of the American and European imperialists.
Which is why we are now examining, for the second time, the improved proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and on the European arrest warrant, the heavy artillery in the capitalist arsenal.
Basically nothing has changed in the draft decisions, apart from a few editorial improvements to appease the reactions, and the addendum stating that "the European Union is founded on the universal values of human dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; it is based on the principles of democracy and the Rule of Law".
The pure hypocrisy of this statement is highlighted by the fact that the framework decisions deal a very severe blow to democracy and collective and individual social rights.
According to article 1, anyone fighting for fundamental political and social change can easily be labelled a terrorist.
Types of protest, such as symbolic sit-ins, or the results of protests, such as interruptions to the electricity or water supply when workers go on strike, need only cause "significant economic losses" in order to be labelled terrorist crimes.
The same applies to protests by farmers who block the roads.
Extending the responsibilities of the organisations to which the "terrorists" belong may create a handy mechanism for prosecuting troublesome organisations and parties but it also gives them the incentive to engage in provocation.
The only people above all suspicion are the rulers of the ÃU and the USA.
They are in no danger of being tried on the basis of their own law, which labels acts which may "seriously damage" the country as terrorist acts if the perpetrator carries them out with a view to: (i) seriously frightening the people or (ii) unreasonably forcing the public authorities or an international organisation to carry out or refrain from carrying out an act or (iii) seriously destabilising or overturning the fundamental policies or constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or international organisation.
Did the European and American imperialists do any less or any different in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chile, Greece and dozens of other countries?
The people throughout the world know exactly who the terrorists are.
Likewise, they also know that violence and suppression cannot reverse the historic advance of mankind and they will continue their fight until all the terrorist laws have been repealed.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, do not have a very consistent view of the fight against terrorism at all.
I have risen on previous occasions to ask for increased border controls, including those controls at the internal borders of the Union.
But this has not happened.
What has in fact happened is that the policy on phasing out internal controls has been pursued unchanged.
That is why, on Monday, at the debate on the Kessler report, I condemned the scheduled withdrawal of the 'reporting of presence' which, under the Schengen Convention, should be demanded of third country nationals who wish to move between European Union Member States.
We are today examining the last phase of the plan to create a European arrest warrant, which seeks to abolish, for certain offences, the former extradition system between EU Member States, which gave discretionary power to the executing State, but there is an obvious contradiction as far as this point is concerned.
We have seen the list of offences grow in size with the subsequent versions of the plan. However, the essential guarantees that we requested in our explanation of vote of 29 November 2001 have still not been included, such as the right for the judge of the executing country to properly check the validity of the request and for the new system not to apply to the nationals of the executing country as they should continue to enjoy maximum protection.
The European Parliament is prepared to turn a blind eye to all these anomalies, because they are helping to build a super-State.
At our previous sitting, however, Parliament did not hesitate to vote in favour of a resolution that refused to facilitate the extradition of terrorists or potential terrorists, who have been arrested in the EU, to the United States.
It would, in fact, have been important to make a gesture in relation to this issue, because the United States is now facing a battle to protect the whole of the western world.
We are, therefore, trying to achieve too much with the European arrest warrant, which is dangerous.
And we are not doing enough to support the United States against terrorism and this is shocking.
. The British Conservatives voted strongly in favour of the framework decision on terrorism in order to underline our continued ongoing support for the war against terrorism, and to confirm our determination to ensure that the European Union presents a united front against those who seek to undermine our values and our way of life.
However, we were obliged to vote against the proposal in relation to the European Arrest Warrant.
As now proposed, the procedures go much further than is either necessary to deal with the terrorist threat, or desirable in terms of both safeguarding human rights or respecting due legal process, as is currently satisfied by the extradition agreement processes.
Nonetheless, let no one be in doubt of our determination not to waver in the long war against terrorism, but we do not believe that the European Arrest Warrant as currently proposed will achieve the ends to which we are all striving.
- (NL) The initial perplexity which the attacks of 11 September caused have not only led to unqualified support for American action in a country where the possible mastermind behind those attacks could be hiding, but has also resulted in measures being considered which would seriously affect civil rights deemed obvious hitherto.
All the primitive ideas which guardians of law and order had ever entertained to make it easier to lock up, extradite and condemn opposition forces were suddenly given free rein.
It is not only the American administration that comes up with new inventions such as the introduction of the notion of 'illegal combatants' , who are subsequently unable to enjoy the protection received by prisoners of war. Unfortunately, this development also plays a role in Europe.
Anyone who, for a long time, had fought for the right to extradite people to countries where capital punishment still exists, for calling an end to freedoms deemed undesirable in neighbouring countries or for curtailing the rights of suspects, seized their opportunity.
Meanwhile, those who, in panic, allowed themselves to be convinced of the need for such draconian measures are starting to consider the implications.
This morning, the President of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats rightly said that support for Russian action against Chechnya cannot be justified in the name of combating terrorism.
The fresh proposal by Mr Watson is an improvement, but not yet sufficient to prevent accidents.
.
(DE) I did not abstain in the final vote on the report through opposition to the European arrest warrant. It was much more the case that I was opposed to the rushed procedure with which this matter was dealt with.
Report Rapkay (A5-0002/2002)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Rapkay' s document on State aid in the European Union - both on my own account and on behalf of the Pensioners' Party - but while I was voting I was thinking, Mr President.
Should we not consider the money that governments use to cover and make good pension fund deficits to be State aid too?
When the State budget intervenes to make good the balance of pension funds, that, in my opinion, is State aid which distorts competition in the European Union between different systems and procedures for managing pension funds in Europe.
We need greater competition when it comes to pension types available on the market too.
I hope this is achieved in the future.
Mr President, I just want to say, in addition to casting my vote just now, that we need to attempt to make the concept of State aid totally clear.
Today' s document addresses this subject - which has already been dealt with in the past - in a number of respects, it develops and analyses it and also welcomes in principle the decline of that aid during the period 1997 to 1999.
It remains to address the issue of regional aid, the money that passes from the State - for regional tax income is not sufficient, at least in Italy - to the regions and from the regions directly to many bodies and companies, which thus break competition rules and distort the market, particularly in respect of other companies which, for example, are not based in regions with a special statute, which are particularly favoured.
. (PT) This report on State aid closely follows the line of the previous report, endorsing the observation that there was a reduction in State aid during the period between 1997 and 1999, specifically due to reduction in aid in Germany and Italy, the two countries that provide the highest levels of State aid.
The rationale of the report is based on defending the reduction of State aid and on stepping up the measures used in this context, specifically tax measures.
The objective, in accordance with the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit, is to achieve a steady reduction in State aid by 2003, only allowing aid, in exceptional circumstances, specially requested by the Member States.
Existing Community aid will, of course, continue.
Nevertheless, with the creation of the State aid assessment panel, pressure on Member States to reduce aid will increase, with States basing their approach on protecting competition, ignoring the problems suffered by weaker economies and pilfering America' s own policy, which continues to grant State aid in various economic sectors, in defiance of WTO rules.
This is why we have voted against the report.
- (NL) The rapporteur is backing the March 2000 Summit in Lisbon which declared that the EU would be the world' s most competitive region within ten years.
The high price we need to pay for this will even lead to many Europeans not having a sense of victory when the project proves successful.
In the US and Japan, many people are worse off than in large parts of Europe, despite considerable company profits and growth.
Competition means that those who manage to sell the cheapest products and services at minimum cost survive to the detriment of everyone else.
The latter cannot, therefore, afford to take issues such as human rights, working conditions, public health, the environment and animal welfare too seriously.
State support, government initiatives and Community enterprises are crucial instruments for correcting the adverse effects of the market and for promoting the well-being of people and of the environment.
I condemn state support if it is aimed only at using tax revenue to compete better against others within a free market, as in the case of aviation, but not at maintaining facilities and regional employment in vulnerable regions.
The re-nationalisation of regional policy, feared by the rapporteur, cuts down on red-tape and waste, but does need to be offset by contributions provided, in a spirit of solidarity, by rich Member States for the benefit of the poor.
Report Martens (A5-0017/2002)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Martens' important report on education and training, but I hope that the pensioners of the different sectors of European industry will soon stop playing cards or sitting at home in front of the television, counting the days they have left to live, and be used, if they so wish, to pass on their knowledge to workers, especially young workers.
For example, pensioners from the banking sector could teach new employees how to manage the bank' s money and achieve good results, and a similar process could be introduced in other sectors: there should be more pensioners in vocational training and lifelong learning.
Report Olsson (A5-0467/2001)
Mr President, I wish to point out with some emphasis that certain items in Parliament's report on the ongoing handling of BSE are having negative effects on Europe's farmers and I therefore voted against these unrealistic demands, which had been introduced by some elements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
To be specific, these were the obligatory reduction to the age of 24 months, the debate on omnivores in connection with BSE, and also aspects of waste management.
I am, furthermore, opposed to the demand for a reform of the CAP with food safety as one of its objectives, as this is already set down very definitely in Agenda 2000.
Our agricultural policy is founded on the principle of multifunctionality and on family-run farms, and the production of safe and high-quality food is a matter of concern for farmers like us.
By doing this, we would be sending the wrong signal.
The delegation of the Austrian People's Party in this Parliament has therefore abstained in the final vote.
I want to wish the presidency and all the interpreters 'bon appÃ©tit' before focusing on the matter at hand, which does nothing to whet the appetite, for this is a document on BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Mr President, paragraph 5 'calls on the Member States to step up ... compliance with the temporary ban on MBM' .
But why, Mr President, is it 'temporary' ?
If meat-and-bone meal is dangerous, we must make the ban on using it permanent and leave the firms that produce meat-and-bone meal to make something else - maybe they will produce Italian-style spaghetti or spaghetti with pesto, which would be a much more appropriate subject for debate at this precise moment.
In other words, Mr President, meat-and-bone meal should be taken completely off the market once and for all.
On the occasion of the debate on the Olsson report on the monitoring of the BSE crisis, I would like to draw attention to the scandalous decree handed down by the Court of Justice on 13 December 2001 which condemns France for having failed to observe the Commission' s request to lift the ban on British beef imports.
The decree cites the higher powers of the Commission, which itself refers to the superiority of the freedom of movement.
This raises a question of principles - what sort of Europe do we want?
A Europe where each nation has the right to exercise its fundamental choices, or a Europe where the Commission determines from on high what is the so-called common good?
We believe that each nation must be sovereign.
With regard to public health, in particular, if one of the Member States democratically chooses one option, the others must note the choice made, even if they do not agree with it.
We must stress that the French Government has put itself in an impossible situation, by ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam, which gives the Commission the powers that it is now using against us.
When will governments realise that the texts that they sign will have some consequences?
When will they realise that their actions will catch up with them?
When will they stop pulling the wool over their own eyes, and over the eyes of the citizens at the same time?
In the wake of the decree of 13 December, there is no point in the French Government saying that it will not obey it, the Commission will not go to the trouble of complaining to the Court of Justice to request a penalty payment for each day that the French Government failed to execute the decision.
We will therefore have to pay a ransom for having the right to use - and this is still on a provisional basis - a fundamental competence that we ourselves foolishly abandoned when we signed the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Of course, this absurd situation will only last the length of the election campaign in France.
As soon as the elections are over, our next government will probably rush to obey the decree on the quiet.
What we need is a fundamental reform of the Treaties in order to restore national sovereignty.
.
BSE undoubtedly triggered a crisis of confidence on the part of consumers and an economic catastrophe in the agriculture and food processing industries.
