If not, the consequences could be catastrophic, as removing quotas would have drastic repercussions for the price of milk, and consequently for profits in the dairy sector.
I therefore ask, Commissioner, that any transitions be made and ideas proposed from 2015 onwards.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the policies of the Member States need to cooperate in the whole of this process and that therefore any restriction on exchanges of quotas in a Member State should be considered as a serious obstacle to the capitalisation, competitiveness and development of the sector, as is unfortunately the case with the national plan proposed by the Spanish Government.
(PT) I should once again like to thank you for being in the Chamber, Commissioner.
Your frequent attendance in Strasbourg is ample demonstration of the continued importance of farming in Europe.
We have been considering the common agricultural policy.
My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, held an important seminar just last week in Brussels on the theme of the CAP as it is and of the CAP as we would like it to be.
Reflection on the future does not necessarily mean introducing any element of instability.
Farmers work with nature and value nature's cycles, and markets, as we know, react to all elements of instability.
That being said, instability does at least rule out inertia, and we must not therefore fall into the old trap of defending the status quo simply for the sake of it.
Commissioner, the latest statements coming from some quarters have, then, given rise to extraordinary alarm in the sector, to which an appropriate political response needs to be given so that the instability felt by the sector on this matter is not in some cases exploited in the service of untoward political objectives.
Instability and insecurity can only be tackled by providing regular, transparent information that is as clear as possible.
I would therefore call on you to adopt as effective as possible a strategy of clarification for the sector and also to make it clear to the sector that the Commission honours its agreements and the arrangements fixed until 2014.
These arrangements must naturally be fulfilled without prejudice to the debate and without prejudice to the examination of alternative arrangements that may prove appropriate.
Mr President, Commissioner, the ability to have a clear and certain future is very important for any business, none more so than for dairy farmers and for the dairy industry.
Quotas are in place until 2015 and this I believe was a good decision during the mid-term review.
But to now cast doubt on this on the part of the Commission sends the wrong message and I am pleased that the Commissioner went some way tonight to assure us of what the Commission's position is.
Commissioner, you said that quotas have outlived their usefulness.
Well, OK, you may be right, but I have to say to you that 2015 is a long time away and it is very difficult to crystal-ball gaze and see what conditions will be like at that time.
In 2015, you rightly say, we should have a soft landing and when the time comes for quotas to disappear I think that soft landing should come into place.
What I question is the timing.
So far from the date, by all means let us have an exchange of views on what may or may not happen, but how do we encourage our young people to go into the industry?
How do we take young farmers into the industry?
How do they plan for the future if the future is being questioned at this moment in time?
The dairy sector, as you know only too well, is the backbone of the agricultural industry throughout the European Union.
We must work together to achieve a sound future for that industry.
Only by working together can we achieve that sound future.
I hope that you will take the opportunity to engage with us in the Committee on Agriculture and positively and actively be involved in ensuring that there is a future for the dairy sector, for dairy farmers and for the dairy industry.
It is not only the people who are employed on the farms who are important; the people who are employed in the processing industries and off the farms are equally important.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we all agree that the European countryside and European farmers and livestock breeders need some certainty.
The Brussels Agreement in 2002 provided that certainty, and in exchange for it, the Member States tolerated a reform of the CAP that required serious sacrifices for the rural world, especially for the 'cohesion countries'.
This certainty meant, among other things, that the system of milk quotas would remain in force until 2015, allowing farmers sufficient time to reorganise their farms in order to make them more competitive and, if necessary, to leave the sector.
But we want the certainties to be maintained, and you know that quotas are the only guarantee for farmers in a market in which prices are falling.
And quotas are an asset for farmers, who need to have the freedom to transfer and sell them when they want to cease production.
What uncertainty does, Commissioner, is reduce the value of quotas.
In my region, Asturias, 94 000 tonnes have been lost in two years due to farmers giving up.
Between 1996 and 2006 the number of farms has dropped from 30 000 to just 3 200.
Young farmers, who we all talk about so much, including young farmers with high milk quotas and profitable farms, are leaving the sector.
The Government has also forbidden transfers of quotas between individuals.
Our problem, Commissioner, is rural development.
You are going to do a health check on the common agricultural policy next year.
We hope that you will be acting as a doctor and not as a forensic scientist.
Do you think it is right to talk about transitional measures when there is not even sufficient funding secured for rural development?
I would like to remind you that, for example, my country is going to lose 50% of rural development funds in the next few years.
Are you planning to report this situation during the review that you carry out next year?
(PL) Mr President, the debate in this House on dairy quotas is intensifying.
We are all wondering what will happen if we end the quota system for milk production.
There has been a great deal of criticism which focuses on the fact that the current system is an archaic one which inhibits the development of the dairy sector and makes it less competitive on the world market.
Ending the system is opposed by the countries which have unfavourable natural conditions for dairy production.
To them, ending the system will mean that production will shift to other regions, leading to loss of livelihoods and stable incomes for many farmers.
This may also affect the least developed regions in the east of Poland, Poland being one of the countries that was allocated an unfair, extremely low milk quota.
We may soon become net importers.
According to some experts, the negative impact of a rigid quota system will be worse for Poland than for other Member States, because all the system does is restrict opportunities for modernisation and utilising production potential because of the low level of aid for the milk sector in the European Union.
Many people assert that the milk quotas have lost their economic raison d'etre.
We are also in negotiations with the WTO, in which we have promised to eliminate export subsidies and greatly reduce the tariffs set up to protect the internal market.
How will this affect the EU milk market?
It appears that limiting the restrictiveness of the system, for instance, by combining wholesale and direct quotas and restricting the penalties for exceeding the limits would be fair at this moment.
I would like to remind the Commissioner that there are some countries which are not currently using their quotas to the full.
Mr President, in Ireland they speak of little else.
I spoke to a large group of dairy farmers in Navan, County Meath on Thursday night and the question they are asking is not so much if quotas will be gone in 2015, but what is going to be done from 2008 to collapse the value of the milk quota.
I am indebted to last Thursday's edition of the Farmers' Journal for outlining five key points that the Commission has in mind.
It is well worth bringing them to the attention of the House.
I believe you are looking at gradually increasing quotas from the health check onwards, reducing super-levy costs to Member States, balancing quotas across the European Union so that an over-quota in one Member State may be taken up by slack in another.
Cross-border trading is on the table, as is reducing the value of quotas in Member States.
That is already happening, certainly in Ireland.
There is a downside to all of this.
Every single study that I have read on the subject says that the abolition of milk quotas will lead to a substantial drop in milk prices in many Member States and there will be a corresponding increase in production.
That would happen in Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg.
The key to all this is that we are all for abolition if markets are positive in 2015, but none of us knows what the markets will be like at that time.
I look forward to your analysis of the dairy market.
It will have to take a very close look at the future, because if global markets are not positive I cannot recommend to farmers that they run faster to stand still.
It makes no sense.
To those who have concerns about young farmers - and I have many myself, although my little farmers are quite small at the moment! - who would encourage anyone to go into a business where they have to work twice as hard to earn half as much money?
It does not make sense.
We need to bear that in mind.
The key is the WTO and what happens there.
But at least we are having a debate and that is a positive sign.
We should discuss these things more in this House, rather than reading about them in our national newspapers.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Freitas for bringing this forward and the Commissioner for being here tonight, because this debate is really worthwhile.
We have to face up to the fact that, as milk quotas and set-aside do not fit easily into a decoupled agricultural policy, they will have to be phased out in the future.
We must also set a date and stick to it, because ever since I have been here quotas have been about to be phased out, and it has never happened.
We must face the reality that one day they actually will go.
Everyone in this House accepts the value of dairy production to all our Member States - nowhere more so than in my own region of the UK, the West Country, where dairying is the bread and butter of the whole area but is also under huge pressure.
What is interesting about quota and the value of quota is that ten years ago in the United Kingdom the rate was nearly a pound a litre, whereas now it is worth a penny a litre.
We must therefore remember that in many ways quota is not a tangible substance, and its value can disappear overnight.
We have to be very careful about how we deal with this.
In the UK, it is the power of the supermarkets and the driving-down of prices which is now the real problem.
We are not even meeting our national quota, which shows there is a problem with price.
At certain points over the last 20 years there has been a world increase in dairy trade, but because in Europe control is exercised over the amounts produced, it has never been able to take advantage of this.
We therefore need to have a more flexible regime in the future.
I should like to hear the Commissioner's views on that.
New Zealand - which probably produces milk as effectively as anybody - still has a form of quota, because it has a national cooperative, of which farmers have to be shareholders in order to be able produce extra milk.
It is interesting to explore the arrangements beyond 2015, but first we must face up to the reality that quotas need to go.
author. - (PT) Mr President, thank you very much.
As author of the question, I should very quickly like to ask the Commissioner a specific question, so that we can all leave the House with this issue clearer in our minds.
We know, as the Commissioner said, that, if nothing is done, the arrangements will end in 2005.
We also know that, in the view of the Commissioner herself, this is an outdated system that must be brought to an end.
What we want to know now, and this is the question that I should like to ask you, Commissioner, and that I want you to answer very, very clearly - is whether you accept that phasing out can begin before 2015, as Mr Rasmussen, your representative in Parliament's Committee on Agriculture, assumed it could, or whether the process will begin from 2015 onwards.
This is a crucial question to which I should like you to give me a very clear answer.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I have listened with great interest to this interesting and very passionate debate.
It reflects perfectly the importance of the dairy sector.
As Mr Mulder rightly said, the quota system was introduced in 1984 at a time when we wanted to maintain high prices for our products.
At that stage, therefore, the quota system was a good idea.
However, things have changed dramatically over the last 20 years and there was therefore a discussion, as part of the 2003 reform, on what to do with the dairy sector.
The decision was taken to maintain the quota system until 31 March 2015.
It was decided to increase quotas and reduce prices.
The phasing-in of these changes will be finalised next year.
Then there was the possibility of this health check.
There is not going to be a new reform in 2008/2009.
That is important.
The health check simply provides an opportunity to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy, in line with the 2003 CAP reform.
In my dealings with Parliament I always try to play with a very open hand.
I do not keep my cards close to my chest.
We need to have a discussion, as part of the health check, on what we do with the quota system when it expires in 2015.
I have no fixed ideas on phasing-out, but we need to tell the dairy sector whether or not we want to prolong the quota system.
I am not proposing any changes, as the quota system will expire in 2015 if we do not do anything, but we must therefore tell the sector whether or not we are sticking to the agreement to abolish the quota system in 2015.
If we say nothing, farmers all over Europe will assume that this will not happen.
They will keep their quotas on the basis of these still being worth something after 31 March 2015, only for the Council and Parliament to suddenly decide to abolish them, with the value of quotas falling to zero overnight.
They will be worth absolutely nothing!
That is not predictability, and we must therefore send a clear signal of what the future will be.
As I said in my first contribution, we will have this dairy market outlook report at the end of next year.
I have a tradition, Mr Nicholson, of working closely with Parliament, and specifically with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, so at that point we can discuss what is going to happen, in order to provide stability and avoid uncertainty for the dairy sector in the European Union.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
(HU) In recent times, several reports have been circulating to the effect that the Commission is preparing to reform the organisation of the milk market, an important element of which would be the abolition of milk quotas.
The Commission has not denied these reports.
This news is unsettling if only because, in recent years, reform has been undertaken primarily in those sectors in which the system would in any case have ceased to be in force.
There is no such compelling reason in the case of the milk sector, since the regulations for this sector are in force until 2015 and, moreover, the quota system has been providing the market and producers with adequate stability.
Should the quota system be abolished, the income of dairy producers would fall across Europe, leading to further concentration in the sector.
Tens of thousands of farmers producing for the local markets would be obliged to stop production.
As a result, those Member States in which conditions are less favourable would see their milk production fall significantly.
This would oblige several Member States to supply their dairy needs predominantly from imports.
Although in Hungary milk production is primarily in the hands of large-scale industries and is competitive, nevertheless it would not be in the interests of our country either to abolish the quota system.
Because of current economic difficulties, milk consumption is low, and Hungary is not able to take advantage of the quotas allocated to it.
At the same time, however, we hope that if the economy picks up then consumption will also rise.
Therefore, Hungary would find particularly unacceptable any transformation of the quota system that involved transferring the quotas of Member States that make less use of them to those countries that make greater use of them.
(HU) The reason for maintaining the strict milk quota system is that the quotas that are presently in effect allow for a greater volume of milk production than what the EU consumes internally.
From 2007 on, direct payments to milk producers have to be kept completely separate from production, that is, payments will be received not by the milk producer but by the one who owns a milk quota during the reference period, in the form of a lump sum based on land area.
Under current rules, the milk quota system will remain in force until 2014-15.
Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that in the context of the review, we should look at the question of quotas, but she did not give any concrete details.
Maintaining the quota system is the sole guarantee of market and price stability.
Without quotas, production would rise significantly, and the resulting surpluses would bring down prices, which would very easily stifle small producers.
At the same time, without support only the most competitive industries would be able to compete with the pressure from imports or to succeed on the export market.
In Hungary, milk production is steadily declining due to problems of efficiency; in spite of the fact that purchase prices are not falling, we are using only around 70% of the Community quota allocated to us.
Unfortunately, in contrast to Western European practice, producers here do not own the processing establishments.
If the quota system were abolished, the proportion of imported products would rise, making the problems of competitiveness among Hungarian producers even more evident, and the fall in domestic production would probably accelerate.
For all these reasons, I do not support the abolition of the milk quota system.
Support for rural development by the EAFRD - Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP (debate)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, before going into the content of the reports I want to thank the rapporteurs, Lutz Goepel and Jan Mulder, along with the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts in drafting the two reports.
I should like to start with Mr Goepel's report.
I have carefully taken note of the Committee on Agriculture's position, which is to reject the proposal concerning voluntary modulation and call on the Commission to withdraw the proposal.
Before addressing some of the report's points I should like to recall why I presented the proposal and what the guiding principle was for the drafting of it.
The Commission proposal is a response to a request made by the European Council last December to present a proposal on voluntary modulation.
Such a modulation was a means to enable Member States to transfer funds from the first pillar of the common agricultural policy into the second pillar in order to reinforce the rural development budget, an objective with which most of you would agree.
I have expressed my concerns about certain aspects of the Council agreement, in particular that it would apply both to direct payments and to market-related expenditure as well as the fact that it derogates significantly from the basic rules of rural development expenditure.
The Commission tries to address those concerns to the greatest extent possible and ensure as much coherence as possible with the rules governing compulsory modulation and rural development spending.
That is in line with the Commission's declaration on the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives.
With regard to some arguments in Mr Goepel's report, it is said that voluntary modulation would lead to a distortion of competition.
I do not share that view.
Both the single farm payment and rural development expenditure are considered as non-trade distorting under the WTO rules.
It is claimed that there is no proper impact assessment.
Firstly, in the short time available during the meeting last December that simply was not feasible.
Secondly, it would have encountered methodological difficulties since we have no idea which Member States would apply voluntary modulation, and if they did so, we have no idea of the percentages they would apply.
So, the proposal does not go against the principles of rural development, such as national cofinancing.
We propose optional cofinancing as a compromise, to meet the expectations of the Council.
Let me now turn to the Mulder report on the proposed amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.
The text is a legal translation of what was decided last September by the heads of state and government in relation to the so-called 'capping provision', which is common to all structural instruments, including the Rural Development Fund, and is also reproduced in the general regulation on the structural funds.
Moreover, the text reflects the non-cofinancing requirement for an amount of EUR 320 million as part of the Rural Development Fund allocation to Portugal, which was also agreed at last December's Council meeting.
I have taken note of the draftsman's position, in particular on cofinancing.
I agree that the exemption of EUR 320 million for Portugal from the requirement of national cofinancing should be an exception in rural development, since cofinancing is a basic rule in rural development.
It also means co-responsibility for expenditure and it is an essential element of the subsidiarity that is applied in the policy implemented in the various Member States or regions.
I look forward to a fruitful discussion on this issue.
I will respond at the end of the debate.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, let me take this opportunity to once more express warm thanks to all my fellow Members from all the groups who have supported me in creating a framework worthy of this debate, which is of such great importance to this House and to Europe's farmers.
You, Mr President, by your wise and astute decision, have ensured that Members from all groups will get the chance to speak, albeit at a rather later hour.
Following a decision by the Council - which, as is so often the case with agriculture debates, is notably absent today - the Commission submitted a proposal according to which 20% of agricultural direct payments would be shifted from the first pillar of CAP to the second, from which they could be spent without mandatory co-funding.
That is a concession by the majority on the Council and, whether it wishes to or not, on the part of the Commission, as part of the budget compromise reached in December 2005.
The Commissioner has confirmed as much.
This House has already expressed strong misgivings about this in the interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective.
When I say that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development firmly rejected this proposal, I mean that it did so with only three dissenting votes, and its rejection of the draft legislation was indeed unanimous.
This is not just about differences of opinion where specific policies are concerned; it is also about where Parliament, as an institution, should stand in the forthcoming debates on the reorientation of the Community budget.
As part of the Budget compromise, all the institutions agreed that all the Community's outgoings, among them the post-2013 agricultural expenditure in particular, should be subject to review, and that this House will play a full part in this process from an early stage.
Now, though, we see the Council adopting, through the back door, an extensive remodelling of agricultural funding, and this House has no option but to kill it off, for there was no prior consultation with us.
Instead, the Council has decided to proceed with such an extensive reallocation of resources that there will be such limited scope for debate in 2008-2009 that serious discussion will scarcely be on the cards.
This is something that we in this House cannot tolerate if we are to be taken seriously in future, and the proposal is, moreover, questionable in terms of financial policy.
What is worthy of note on the agricultural policy side is that there is no impact assessment accompanying the proposal.
On the contrary, the impression is given that a short-term reduction of 20% in direct payments would not cause farmers any problems.
Taken together with the cuts resulting from mandatory modulation and those generally expected after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, what this means, for those Member States that want to apply this voluntary modulation, is a reduction in payments of something like one-third over against what they were in 2003.
Far from supporting structural change in agriculture, that amounts to a flagrant structural violation that would put the viability of many thousands of farms in rural areas at risk.
It is generally agreed that what our farmers need is the security to plan ahead.
In the absence of any impact assessment on the part of either the Council or the Commission, we caused evaluations to be carried out, and these confirm, not only that there will be massive distortion of competition and illegal discrimination against the farmers concerned, but also that modulation does nothing to serve the objects of the Community in rural areas, but rather jeopardises them to a considerable degree.

To date, the Council has offered no response whatever to the legitimate concerns of Europe's farmers, and there has as yet been no discussion of the potential consequences.
This sort of behaviour is not at all what we are used to in the European Union and is also quite obviously inappropriate.
Since, moreover, the transferred Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with a strategy laid down at Community level, we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation in which the renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds, particularly when one considers the way the Council is thinking ahead; I would ask you to take a look and see what happens at the next meeting on 14 November, this very week.
We all want to strengthen rural areas.
We have put forward proposals for solutions to their financial problems that are worthy of discussion; the BÃ¶ge report is just one of them.
The Council, though, preferred not to give these proposals any closer attention, so let us not reach out a hand to help it after all that we have done already.
If there has to be a paradigm shift in agriculture policy, then let that happen only after a transparent and open debate in which Parliament, too, can have a decisive part to play, for this proposal is wide of the mark - legally, in terms of its substance, and as policy - and solves none of the problems that rural areas have.
If we want our contribution to future debates on the valuation of the agricultural budget to be taken at all seriously, then we should firmly and forthrightly reject this proposal.
I hope that the Council's response to the vote in this House will be to embark on a more in-depth discussion of the matters at issue.
My colleagues in the committee, and I myself, are willing to join them in this, but the Council must make a move.
It has to be said, though, that it probably does not entertain very high hopes at the present time.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, my report has received unanimous approval in this House's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We considered additional aid for rural development in Portugal to be justifiable; although this was not, of course, ideal, it did form part of a package of measures nodded through by the Council in December, it was not something to which this House, during the negotiations on the financial perspectives, thought it necessary to make any changes.
I should like to repeat, though, that it is not ideal and should remain an exception.
We have to accept, after all, that something similar has been agreed on for various other countries as well.
I should now like - with your permission, Mr President - to turn to the Goepel report.
With regard to the financial perspectives, which were subsequently approved by this House as a whole, the committee made it quite clear that Parliament has suspended its verdict with regard to voluntary modulation.
It is therefore surprising that the Commission should come up with a proposal so promptly.
It has, actually, only followed the Council's 'orders', for want of a better word.
I disagree with the Commissioner that there is no danger of a renationalisation of European agricultural policy; it is something I regard as a very dangerous trend.
What matters most of all to the European farmer is the common market of soon to be 500 million consumers who we must try to retain as much as possible.
In addition, as Mr Goepel has already indicated, it can hardly be said that there has been any examination of the policy's effects.
It may well be that around 2013, the average farmer in Europe, as a result of all manner of measures, will need to make do with one third less of what he received in 2004.
Is that the reliable authority that the European Union wants to be?
What are the consequences of this?
Can farmers survive this measure in certain regions and suchlike?
We have not received an analysis of it, and it would appear to me that the Commission has no choice, when the proposal is submitted, but to analyse its effects.
One of the most important prerogatives of this Parliament, upon which Mr BÃ¶sch will undoubtedly elaborate, is the right to enact the Budget.
We have approved the financial perspectives, which contain precise figures, with so much being set aside for this, so much for that and, among others, so much for market measures in the framework of European agricultural policy and so much for rural policy.
If voluntary modulation were to be implemented, it would have an impact on these figures.
Does that not amount to a change to the financial perspectives?
I do believe that it does.
A change to the financial perspectives requires approval by the budgetary authority, that being the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
I am not at all certain that Parliament will go along with this.
That is why I will be voting against the Commission proposals on voluntary modulation.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have not been in this House long, but I have been here long enough to realise that solid agreement between the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, such as we have here with the rejection of this draft, is not that frequent an occurrence.
The opinion of the Committee on Budgets does, of course, concentrate on the issues of relevance to the budget, and there are with regard to these sufficient arguments available to justify the firm repudiation of the Commission's proposal.
The Member States can, by way of voluntary modulation, unilaterally and without consultation with Parliament, increase non-mandatory expenditure on rural development by many billions of euros, contrary to the wording and spirit of the interinstitutional agreement.
Nor has the Commission adequately thought through the budgetary consequences of a voluntary transfer of this kind.
It is irresponsible of the Commissioner to declare herself once more to be taking down dictation from the Council and not to have carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted.
What will be this proposal's effects on the common agricultural policy?
We do not know that any more than she does, and yet we are supposed to agree to it; well, we are not going to.
Perhaps then exactly the same thing will happen as did with the European aid arrangements for cotton, which the ECJ declared null and void at the beginning of September this year; there, too, the considerable economic effects of the reform had been underestimated or insufficiently examined.
Moreover, the proposal contradicts everything previously laid down concerning modulation, since it makes no provision for cofinancing on the part of the Member States.
What our Heads of Government have come up with in order to fill the hole in the rural budget, for which they were responsible, is a cheap solution; if the Council were really interested in topping up the funds for the second pillar, they could quite simply have complied with this House's demands in respect of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
What we should do with this proposal is reject it, and firmly.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, according to Government figures, the average earnings of farmers in my constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10 000, or EUR 14 000.
This is disastrous: it is forcing farmers into bankruptcy!
They do not have any room for reinvestment in the industry.
Instead of offering practical help, Prime Minister Blair comes up with the startling proposal to slash 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of the existing 5% compulsory modulation that already exists and, as we have heard from Mr Goepel, a further 8% that will be deducted to pay for Bulgaria and Romania.
In other words, British farmers - as Britain appears to be the only Member State really pushing for this voluntary modulation - will lose roughly 33% of their subsidy, which for many of them is a vital lifeline.
But worse, this naked discrimination against UK farmers will place them at a huge competitive disadvantage to all other farmers in every other Member State in Europe.
I say to the Commissioner: it may be that in the eyes of the WTO this does not amount to trade distortion, but in the pockets of farmers it certainly amounts to a catastrophe.
I must also protest at the threats being issued by the UK Government, which tells us that if we vote against voluntary modulation it will compromise the future of the popular agri-environment schemes in which many UK farmers have participated.
This is tantamount to blackmail and coming from a government that has imposed more than 80 stealth taxes, from a Chancellor - Gordon Brown - who has made taxation in the UK higher than Germany or France and now wants us to believe that he needs to slash 25% off our farmers' single-farm payments in order to be able to afford agri-environment schemes, it is an absolute joke.
I can tell Mr Brown that if he watches the way this House votes on this proposal, he will see what we think of his sense of humour.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are being called on today to take a stand on a proposal on rural development policy which we consider to be invalid, contradictory and dangerous to the future of the CAP itself, as well as to our own credibility.
This is, of course, a proposal which emerged from a contradictory compromise by the European Council last December.
On the other hand, however, it is worth our emphasising that the Commission proposal tries to improve the outcome of this highhandedness on the part of the European Council towards both the institutions and the Treaty itself.
We agree in principle with the Commission proposals for defining the measure on a multiannual basis at national level and retaining the limits which exist in the Rural Development Fund.
However, although these improving proposals could be considered as a good effort by the Commission towards the Council, they cannot be considered adequate.
As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we shall vote against the legislative text of the Commission regulation on voluntary modulation at this stage for the following reasons: firstly, in order to strengthen the Commission's negotiating position with the Council, which in essence wants voluntary modulation as a blank cheque for managing Community expenditure under pillars 1 and 2.
Secondly, in order to give the Commission the time needed to present an integrated proposal which responds to the real needs and the real rural development support mechanisms, without renationalising the CAP.
Thirdly, in order to provide a time margin for studying the effective and essential possibility of taking up Community resources transferred from compulsory modulation and from the new additional modulation, in order to avoid the return of significant resources from the Member States due to inadequate application of the programmes.
Commissioner, there is already a timetable for evaluating the new CAP and its priorities.
We expect the Commission to examine measures for viable, effective, simple and transparent policies which will contribute towards the objectives of rural convergence and development.
You will find my group in agreement with such a policy.
A ceiling on payments and an additional single modulation rate are policies with which we can agree in principle.
However, they will have to be clarified as to their expediency, their added value and the degree to which they help to achieve the objective of rural convergence.
Commissioner, only under these preconditions will the Commission be able to submit an integrated proposal so that, all together, we can save European aspirations and our credibility in the eyes of the citizens of Europe.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel, for their excellent reports.
Voluntary modulation is a bit of an oddity, something which has never been tried before in the EU's common agricultural policy.
The conclusion adopted by the European Council that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20% was both unexpected and very badly formulated.
The European Council decided that even export aid could be cut.
Luckily, the Commission did not go along with this totally unrealistic proposal.
First of all, the cut would not be based on any objective rules but would merely be the result of high-handedness on the part of a Member State.
It would lead to inequality among farmers and would distort competition.
It would amount to an arbitrary additional tax on farmers.
Secondly, it needs to be made very clear that the cut would not increase resources for rural development in the countries concerned.
This additional funding would not be affected by national cofinancing as contained in the Regulation on rural development.
A Member State could use modulated cash in place of its own national funding and thus reduce it.
It would then of course be a case of a direct payment of agricultural aid to the Member State's Ministry of Finance.
How could the European Parliament deal with discharge as regards such a transfer of funds?
Voluntary modulation would entail moving funds from the EU budget's compulsory expenditure to non-compulsory expenditure.
That would mean that the interinsitutional agreement would have to be altered.
The Council would thus be in violation of that agreement six months after it was concluded. The Council would therefore not be a reliable partner in the agreement.
For these reasons I warmly welcomed Mr Goepel's suggestion that Parliament should reject the proposal.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Mulder, we are, today, discussing the second pillar and rural economic development, something that this House, and - if one is to believe its own utterances - the Commission too, regard as important, and even the members of the Council, in their speeches, keep on emphasising that this is where the future of European agricultural policy lies, yet here we are, rejecting a proposal that is intended, to all outward appearance, to put several billions of euros aside for this purpose.

It is not easy to justify this rejection on the basis of the money involved, but the offer being made to us is an improper one.
The powers that have caused it to be made are those who are responsible for rural development falling EUR 20 billion short of the budget proposal made by this House and the Commission; it is they who have forced through budget cuts come what may - not least to the detriment of this qualitative line - and are now saying: 'OK, you can take 20 per cent out of the first pillar, and then use it to top up what we have taken away from you.'
That is what I call improper.
These powers are no friends to European agriculture, or, indeed, to Europe's rural areas; what they are seeking to do instead is to use the agriculture budget as a quarry in the same way as they are trying to do with many other policy areas, but what makes this so very deceitful is that it has the appearance of being a redistribution while not really being one, with the possibility of taking the money out without co-funding, so, in other words, the agriculture budget is, as a whole, more likely to lose something than have anything added to it.
This is in fact not the proposal that the committee made for medium-term financial planning, in which we said that co-funding in the first pillar too would have made it possible for funds to be made available for the second; we would in fact have been able to restrict the co-funding of the second pillar to 25%, thus enabling a better flow of funds, but all these proposals were cast to the winds, and now along they come with this figure of 20%.
The only thing is, Commissioner, that this financial plan has been agreed to by the Commission, and also - and this I have to say with bitter regret - by this House, which has gone along with this extortion in order not to put the European Union's financial future at risk.
Commissioner, that must not be allowed to hamper us, though, and I will ask you just what you propose to do in order that rural development is not starved of funding.
What are we in this House to do?
How are we, in our groups, to make it clear that rural development can have a future not only through the reallocation of funds, and that this whole budget line must develop its financial arrangements independently, in the same way as the other structural funds have done?
It is to that question that I would like to have an answer from you, here and now, in order that the Commission, in our next negotiations on this subject, should show its colours more openly and that we, here in this House might perhaps stand up for ourselves a bit more.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, I should firstly like to stress the importance of adopting Mr Mulder's report, thereby giving assent to the Commission's proposal to exempt Portugal from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million, in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement.
My country, Portugal, faces known difficulties in meeting the unfair criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, given the fragility of our economy and the accumulating social problems, especially in rural areas.
Hence the importance of adopting this proposal.
As regards the Goepel report, I wish, secondly, to say that we are in favour of compulsory modulation, accompanied by capping and by the fair redistribution of these funds, and in the new Member States too.
As previous speakers have said, this is not guaranteed in this Commission proposal.
We therefore call on you, Commissioner, to reconsider your proposal.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Goepel on his excellent report, whose views I fully share.
Although the proposed modulation directly affects the old Member States, it is also cause for concern among farmers in the new Member States.
The modulation impairs the vision of stable agricultural rules until 2013, and will lead to what we fear greatly in the new Member States, that is, a partial re-nationalisation of agricultural policy, which the new, poorer Member States will not be able to afford.
That is the reason for our concern.
Let us adhere to the established agricultural policy rules.
Keeping them stable until 2013 is the minimum of certainty we owe to our farmers.
They have been subjected to too many upheavals in a short time: changes to the support system, liberalisation of agricultural markets, and increasingly stringent norms and standards in various fields.
It is all too much, too soon.
What agriculture needs is clear and stable rules for at least the coming few years.
That is why I support Mr Goepel's report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, today's debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments once again highlights the different ways in which the old and the new Member States understand the common agricultural policy.
When the old members think of the future of the CAP, they think of the future of agriculture in their own countries, rather than in the enlarged European Union.
Rejecting the Commission's proposal is the most appropriate course of action.
The claim that it is contrary to the rules of competition and solidarity, threatens re-nationalisations and breaks the promises made to the farmers, is correct.
The point is, why were these arguments not considered when setting out the terms of accession for the new Member States in 2004?
These conditions have blatantly undermined competition and the principles of solidarity.
The poorer states, who receive much lower payments, are forced to compete on unequal terms.
Re-nationalisation of the common agricultural policy was introduced in the new Member States, which in 2004 paid as much as 75% to the first pillar, while the old fifteen members benefit from 100% EU support.
This is hypocrisy.
The terms of accession were not based on objective criteria, but discriminatory production quotas were imposed which took no account of the potential of producers and self-sufficiency in food production for example, the milk sector.
Support in the most obvious cases (fruit and vegetable growing) has been neglected, and no consideration has been given to the extremely low income of farmers in the new Member States.
This mindset is a threat to farmers, to consumers and to the entire economy of the European Union.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their excellent reports and by saying that I endorse the proposals contained in their reports.
The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different Member States, depending on the percentages of modulation that they choose to adopt.
The fact that there is soon to be a health check on the CAP 2008, in which we shall be able to discuss capping and the increase in compulsory modulation, is a further reason not to press ahead now with measures such as voluntary modulation, which may bring irreversible consequences.
If this proposal is pushed through, we shall clearly be taking a further step towards renationalising the CAP and dismantling the communitisation of agricultural policy.
Without wishing to underplay the political importance of rural development, I must say that investment in this policy will not be boosted by this measure.
Let me give the example of my country, which returns more second-pillar funding to Brussels than any other country and which, in the EU-15, already had the largest balance between the first and second pillars, 53% and 47% respectively.
Nevertheless, the Minister for Agriculture in my country, Portugal, has already announced the intention to adopt 20% modulation.
Taking back money from farmers in order to fund the State budget or so that the money can be given back to Brussels will certainly not be the best solution for farmers, and it represents an approach based solely on economic criteria and aimed at using the money for rural development without cofinancing.
With these practical risks, which are already clearly apparent in countries like Portugal - as evidenced by the example I mentioned - it is abundantly clear that, if we are to defend farmers resolutely and to champion a common agricultural policy, we must do all we can to ensure that voluntary modulation goes no further.
(PL) Mr President, like my colleague before me, I would like to express my support for Mr Mulder's draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million.
This is a good decision which shows solidarity, and is particularly important in the light of the drought that has hit that country.
I concur fully with Mrs Batzeli's words on Mr Goepel's report, but as regards Mr Mulder's report, and in particular the final section, where the rapporteur criticises the method by which rural development funds are distributed under the current rules, and where he demands that distribution be based on objective criteria, I would like to draw your attention to the following facts.
The new Member States are characterised by significant under-investment in the farming sector and their farmers' incomes are vastly disproportionate to those in the other Member States.
They are also ignored as regards the fundamental principles of non-discrimination, solidarity and proportionality, and by having to cofinance direct payments from their own budgets, which are much smaller, not to mention the huge reduction of around EUR 20 billion in the pool of funds for rural development for 2007-2013 in comparison to what was promised during the accession negotiations.
Here I must also point out that support for rural development as set out in the strategic Community guidelines should make allowance for the differing structural problems in the fifteen and the ten EU member states, including Bulgaria and Romania.
Particular attention must be paid to ensuring the necessary funding for the new Member States in respect of their huge need for basic investment and the need to secure wide-ranging support for rural development.
Rural development policy offers a range of mechanisms which make it possible to influence the differing needs of European farmers.
However, we need to search further for effective mechanisms for such a policy in order for it to fulfil its aims and to make it increasingly effective for all countries of the European Union.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I too should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his steadfast work, not only on budgetary issues in general, but also on issues concerning the funding of agricultural and rural policies.
If, in my capacity as permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds within my committee, I asked to take the floor in this debate on the modification of the ceilings on EAFRD development support, it was to express two things: firstly, a 'democratic' regret, but also a kind of 'strategic' wish.
I deeply regret the fact that the European Parliament is being forced to change the ceilings that it has already adopted, and this in order to bring them into line with the decisions taken by the Council.
Furthermore, my 'strategic' wish consists in pointing out our attachment to the fundamental principles of rural development policy, and the extent of that attachment, because these principles give Europe transparency.
I should like us to remain very cautious when faced with the temptation to make wider use of obligatory cofinancing, which could eventually lead to the renationalisation of expenditure under the first pillar.
Such a decision must not be the subject of a 'go with the flow' policy, but must be considered as an important issue to be subjected to a clear and democratic debate.
As for the necessary - and undoubtedly justifiable - Christmas 'presents' given to Portugal, on this subject too I regret that there is no real strategy and I would ask that we define one and that it be the outcome of an in-depth debate.
(PL) Mr President, the proposal for so-called 'voluntary modulation' by the Member States as regards direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers, which will be in breach of the norms and procedures prevailing in the European Union.
Exempting farms receiving less than EUR 5 000 from modulation means that only farms under 40 hectares will be covered.
This system, which is on the face of it logical, cannot be cohesive, merely due to the fact that the new Member States, unlike the old countries, are already cofinancing the common agricultural policy by topping up EU payments from their own budgets.
In my opinion, we should aim to eliminate the existing imbalances and introduce new rules and payments in all Member States as quickly as possible. Otherwise regional inequalities will intensify.
I would like to remind this House that it was we Polish MEPs who warned of the consequences of approving an EU budget of just 1% of GNP and cutting rural development funds.
(PL) Mr President, direct payments give many poor Polish farming families a chance to make ends meet.
They have been a way of buffering the increased cost of production since Poland's accession to the European Union.
Using voluntary modulation to reduce them by as much as one third from 2008, at a time when they are so low in our country anyway, would cause substantial losses to these farms and families.
The important aim of developing rural areas, to which the money thus saved would be directed, should be pursued on the basis of other funds.
We could restrict regional payments to recipients with a maximum not of 50, but of 100, 200 or 500 and more hectares.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports.
My first point is that this is an extremely bad proposal.
We know how it originated in the Council meeting last December.
I would say to the Commissioner that this is a proposal that will only be implemented in the United Kingdom.
We all know that.
Even the dogs in the street know that.
It has been brought in to help Blair and his government try and resolve their problem.
It will place United Kingdom farmers in an impossible position.
Financially, they will be in a totally invidious position compared to other farmers in all parts of the other 24 EU Member States.
In Northern Ireland it will erode the concept of the family farm, which is the backbone of our industry.
I therefore totally reject this proposal, and will not stand by and allow anyone to hijack farmers' single farm payments.
This was something that was agreed. It was promised and it is depended upon.
It is not the fault of our farmers that the UK Government has negotiated such a miserable deal on development of the second pillar in support of the rural economy.
I must say to the Commission, the Council and the UK Government that they should not blame us if now they do not have sufficient funds to support some of their proposals for the rural and environmental development of the countryside.
I can take no blame for this.
It is totally the responsibility of the negotiators.
I must also tell the truth, which is that the so-called negotiators have achieved the worst possible deal, and that they now want to hijack a maximum of 20% or perhaps even 25% of farmers' single farm payments.
Such a proposal must not be agreed to, either now or in the future.
It will turn farmers and other members of rural society against each other.
It is unworkable and will spell the beginning of the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy as we have known it.
It must not be accepted.
This dossier will have to be referred back to committee, and I will call on the Commission not to fall into what is a skilful trap that would set farmers and other rural dwellers at each others' throats.
We have a duty to reject this legislation.
We must never agree to this covert means of undermining UK farmers and placing them in a position so subservient to the rest of the European Union.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is familiar with the 2003 CAP reform, which provided for the freezing of the first pillar and the strengthening of the second, namely rural development.
The fact is that the agreement on the new financial perspective - which, I might add, I voted against - runs counter to these two commitments.
Indeed, the rural development package has lost EUR 20 billion in comparison with the Commission proposal, a figure that represents, for the 15 old Member States, 35% less than the current period.
The proposal for voluntary additional modulation, which is aimed at transferring a maximum of 20% of the sums from the first to the second pillar and which does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy, is unacceptable.
I recognise that the European Commission has attempted, in its proposal for a regulation, to manage this tool, but I share the rapporteur's concerns and I endorse his proposal that it be rejected: the risk of distorted competition is too great if certain Member States choose to deduct 20% from direct aid and not from other types of aid.
It is unacceptable for this voluntary modulation not to have to comply with the same rules as those that normally apply to rural development, and the risk of the CAP being renationalised is too great.
The funding requirements for rural development policy are, however, real, and I fear more people abandoning our rural areas.
That is why I am calling on the Commission to propose, instead of voluntary modulation, an identical increase in the rate of compulsory modulation in all of the Member States.
I should also like to stress that compulsory modulation currently applies as soon as a farm receives more than EUR 5 000 in agricultural support per year.
The large majority of farms are, indeed, affected.
If we are to have a genuine tool for redistributing aid, we should also take account of other criteria, such as the size of the farm, its dependence on aid, the workforce employed, the standard gross margin, and so on. Furthermore, if we are to guarantee that agricultural support is divided up fairly, we should think about capping direct aid.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the UK delegation in my group.
We fully understand the cogency of the arguments in the Goepel report and the reasons for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's voting indications.
However, the approach of successive Westminster governments to EU rural development funding has restricted its availability in the UK.
Our allocation for 2007 to 2013 is only a quarter of what fairness would in principle require.
In default of some further degree of modulation, there would be severe constraints on establishing and maintaining effective rural development programmes, particularly in relation to the environment.
There is also a risk of delays in making some of the payments of which farmers have a legitimate expectation.
I am grateful to the Commission for its willingness to explore the ways in which it might be possible to overcome such immediate practical problems, but that can only be a stopgap.
We need a much longer-term solution.
We therefore call on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to find a way of redressing the current historical imbalances in the allocation of rural development funding.
As a Scot, I ask that, in any further discussions on modulation, both the Commission and colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture take account of the fact that the levels are of concern not only to Member States but to administrations at sub-state level as well.
(PL) Mr President, in thanking both of our colleagues for their work, I would like to focus more closely on Mr Mulder's report.
We are raising a question that affects the mechanism of funding designated for areas inhabited by some 20% of the population of the European Union, but which are very important as regards secure food supplies for Europe.
We therefore need to do everything to strengthen the position of rural areas and secure the cohesion that we are supposed to provide.
The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Regional Development should also serve this purpose.
This is essential for all countries, including my own country, Poland.
Although today we are debating changes to the regulations affecting Portugal - which I support - we need to stress clearly that this has upset the sequence of things.
First of all the procedure should be set out, and only then the specific financial decisions made.
Therefore, let us treat this as an exceptional situation and look for systemic solutions which, based on as objective and non-discriminatory criteria as possible, will really strengthen European farming.
Any other course of action may end up by destroying European solidarity in this area.
(PL) Mr President, in order to keep European agriculture competitive, we must maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States, and not introduce the additional modulation of 20%.
The arguments put forward by the European Commission are unconvincing, while the proposition does not conform to the principles of the CAP.
The new Member States need more funds for the development of rural areas, for reasons which include reducing the labour-intensity of farming and to speed up the transfer of land from social and small farms to large-scale market farms.
This will improve the competitiveness of farming in the new Member States, mainly through economies of scale.
Instead, what has been done?
If you remember, the new financial perspective adopted for 2007-2013 cut the rural development funds by 20 billion euro compared to what was proposed by the Commission.
We must apply different methods of support, because there is a distinction between the countryside and farming in the European Union.
Rural areas in European Union countries, including Poland, are poorer than the cities, and need more jobs, the development of services and better environmental protection.
For this reason we need to support farmers and the countryside throughout the European Union for many years to come.
(PT) I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his admirable report and to thank the members of the committee, who voted unanimously to adopt the report.
The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of a number of Council decisions aimed at offsetting the recognised difficulties faced by Portuguese farmers in relation to the CAP as it stands, whereby farmers have been manifestly penalised.
This is a way of compensating them.
As for the Goepel report, regrettably I am not able to extend the same congratulations, because this is an eminently political matter and we must use political arguments to discuss it.
We all know that the CAP unfairly works against various Member States, various regions and many farmers, and one way of correcting that injustice is to apply modulation mechanisms.
In the case of Portugal, this distortion is utterly scandalous; just 5% of farmers receive more than EUR 5 000 per year.
Consequently, given that voluntary modulation is possible and that compulsory modulation is currently impossible, voluntary modulation is preferable to having no modulation at all.
I therefore feel that the positions that have come to light are deeply inappropriate.
I should like to reassure the Commissioner that she is not alone in defending this position in Parliament.
I believe that, in the interests of justice, it is only right that funds be given to the Member States.
I should like to draw Mr Nicholson's attention to the fact that it is not only the United Kingdom that will apply the measure; the Portuguese Government has already announced that it will do so.
I feel, therefore, that not allowing the Member States to use this instrument to do the right thing in relation to many farmers who are unable to receive a single cent under the first pillar of the CAP, or restricting their ability to do so, is a totally inappropriate position for Parliament to take.
I say this solely on the basis of political arguments because I have neither the time nor the desire to discuss legal, technical and other aspects of the issue.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Goepel and Mr Mulder for these reports.
Commissioner, you know very well that your heart is not in this and that you are having to do the Council's bidding.
This is a complete mess.
You have a lot of support here in Parliament.
In fact, the Council has managed to unite the whole Parliament against this proposal.
When we vote tomorrow we will reject it, it will go back to committee and we will reject it again.
So I urge you to come forward with a new proposal.
When I first came to the European Parliament, my farming friends told me the one thing they wanted out of Europe was a level playing field.
That may be a forlorn hope, but this proposal makes it less level than it has ever been.
I do not need to tell you, Commissioner, that the British Government is about to be fined for not meeting the deadline for the Single Farm Payment Scheme.
So what do you do?
When it cannot make the payments on time, you give it more rural development money to squander.
You can imagine how much confidence farmers have in the Government to deliver that at the moment.
As I look across the House tonight, it is interesting that there is not one member of the Labour Party on the Socialist benches.
Who is here to defend Mr Blair's proposal?
No one.
So look to us for help.
As Mr Stevenson said, the government is putting enormous pressure on us to say that we are against environmental schemes.
Can I put it clearly on record that we are not, and nor is the Commissioner.
But we need to move forward with more money going from the first to the second pillar, all across Europe; a compulsory modulation on a level amount.
Also, as other speakers have said, there has been no proper impact assessment of this proposal.
It cannot possibly go forward.
The cotton regime was scrapped after a ruling by the European Court of Justice.
Please think again and come back with a new proposal.
(HU) Mr President, the use of the current Community payments, when placed alongside the decision of the European Council taken in December 2005, according to which Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement, raises serious questions about the budgetary decision-making process.
In spite of the fact that there is broad agreement on the exceptional exemption of Portugal from the cofinancing requirement, questions and problems of legitimacy may arise in relation to the horse trading methods of negotiation engaged in by the Council.
Although I do not oppose this one-time concession offered to Portugal, I consider it important that in future no Member State be allowed to benefit from special treatment solely in order to persuade it to support a particular agreement.
On the contrary, equality and transparency are fundamental criteria that should be observed in all circumstances, and at every level of negotiation with the Council.
In future, not only must we prevent these forms of positive discrimination, but since we have committed ourselves to an egalitarian agricultural policy, then the regulation of rural development should not be permitted to rely on exceptions.
We need to put an end to all forms of discrimination.
I agree with the rapporteur that the system should not make any distinctions or exceptions, but that we need a fair, standardised approach that distributes resources on the basis of objective criteria.
However, I do not agree with the rapporteur that it would be a good solution to finance the direct payments in the first pillar, because although this would lessen pressure on the European budget, it would cause serious financing problems for the new Member States, which are in a strained budgetary situation because of the convergence programmes necessary for the introduction of the euro.
As a result, this would further increase inequalities among Member States.
For the same reason, I do not consider voluntary modulation to be the most appropriate solution.
Apart from respecting current agreements, in future we must strive to create a truly united rural policy instead of making further exceptions.
Mr President, I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports.
When I reread the Presidency Conclusions, these seven lines of text read worse now than they did almost a year ago.
It is literally a free-for-all for any Member State that wants to take it up and it has no regard for the rules that this House, and indeed the Council itself, had drawn up in relation to rural development.
Voluntary modulation as outlined in this proposal is anything but voluntary, because the farmers certainly do not want it.
Therefore we are misusing and abusing words.
Of course this proposal distorts.
It has to, because it is allowed in one Member State but it may not be applied in others.
We need to look at the impact of this on agriculture generally.
I am also conscious that we are looking towards a health check for the CAP in 2008 and, in parallel with that, a review of the financial perspectives.
I should like to compliment the Commission on trying to make something good out of what is essentially a very bad proposal: the Commission is trying to get rules applied and is insisting that they be implemented; it is excluding market support measures.
I shall conclude by saying that it is very difficult to make something good out of essentially a poor suggestion, or, to use an agricultural term: you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
I compliment the Commission for even trying to do so.
This is a bad proposal and we will be rejecting it.
(ES) Mr President, the proposal that we are debating today is unacceptable.
It is unacceptable because it is disintegratory, fragmentary, anti-European, selfish and highly hypocritical.
From the point of view of agricultural theory, it involves cutting 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development and thus fill in holes.
These holes were created because, in the financial perspectives, 1% is not sufficient to fund the agricultural policies, and as the Member States are incapable of giving more money, they have to take it away from those who were receiving it until now.
It also represents the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy: getting rid of the only truly European policy, the only policy that united European producers.
And not only does it mean renationalisation, but, if we look at the proposal by the Spanish Government to the Council, it means going much further: not only renationalising, but regionalising.
This way everyone will be able to do what they want.
I think that it is part of the disintegratory madness of the socialist Spanish President, who, Mr Parish, also has no one here to defend him, because he, along with all the presidents who signed the financial perspectives and accept this change, do not care at all about the competitiveness of the European agricultural sector and the impact that these measures may have on their economies is of little importance to them.
Therefore, and in defence of European farmers and livestock breeders and of the sector, we will of course reject this proposal.
Mr President, I apologise for not being in the House when I was first called but my travel arrangements went rather awry today.
Voluntary modulation is but fancy phraseology for a very unpleasant practice, namely government grab of farmers' money.
As Mrs McGuiness has said, there is nothing voluntary about it, certainly in respect of those from whom the money is to be extracted, namely the farmers.
The consequence is a very unbalanced rural development programme right across Europe, both in how it is financed and then in how it is delivered.
That, of course, is then discriminatory against the farmers in those Member States that practice this madness of voluntary modulation.
In my country we are already seeing the consequences, with delays in the intended LFA payments.
Voluntary modulation is something to be resisted.
I welcome the stance of the committee and the stance of this House when it rejects it and I urge the Commission to be robust in forcing a change of policy by the Council on this matter.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I have listened to the debate carefully and with huge interest.
I can only repeat what I said at the outset, i.e. that the Commission proposal is consistent with the European Council's request.
As Mrs McGuinness rightly said, we have tried to align it as much as possible with the existing rules on obligatory modulation and financing of the rural development policy.
Tomorrow, if - or I should say when - the European Parliament rejects the Commission's proposal, I intend to raise the issue with my fellow Commissioners in order to consider our position carefully.
That is completely in accordance with the framework agreement between our two institutions.
Thank you, Commissioner, that was very clear.
I thank all those who took part in the debate.
I should also like to thank all the interpreters.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be tomorrow.

Decision on urgent procedure
Council Proposal on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania - C6-0334/2006 -
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (ES) Madam President, since the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, is not present, I simply wished to say on behalf of that committee that we are in favour of this urgent procedure.
We believe that it is necessary to speed up the procedure, as the Commission has requested.
The Committee on Fisheries is therefore in favour of this urgent procedure.

Presentation of the Court of Auditors' Annual Report - 2005 (debate)
The next item is the Court of Auditors' Annual Report.
I am delighted to welcome the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Weber, to this House.
Madam President, Vice-President Kallas, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity today of participating in your debate on the 29th Annual Report of the Court of Auditors, for the 2005 financial year, at the plenary session of the European Parliament.
I presented this report to the Committee on Budgetary Control in Strasbourg on 23 October and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in Brussels on 7 November.
Each annual report from the Court is the culmination of complex and exhaustive audit work performed in situ by our auditors over the course of the preceding 12 months at all levels of the administration of EU resources.
In accordance with the principles of international auditing standards and as corroborated by external experts, the audit evidence of the Court is based on the exhaustive examination of samples of transactions from the individual budget areas and on assessments of the functioning of the internal control systems for expenditure.
Only serious formal errors and errors with financial consequences, inflated expenditure claims, ineligible beneficiaries and expenditure form the basis of the Court's Statement of Assurance.
One of the Court's primary duties, and one that it has been required under the Treaty to carry out since its inception, is to perform cost-benefit analyses, the results of which the Court publishes in its special reports.
In addition, the Court's assessments of the internal control systems, which are required for the annual Statement of Assurance, form an important basis for these cost-benefit analyses.
Allow me now to turn to the Court's key audit findings for 2005.
In respect of those areas in which considerable improvements have been achieved, the Court duly recognises the Commission's success in managing and implementing the change from cash-based to accruals-based accounting.
The Court has reached the conclusion that the consolidated annual accounts of the EU general budget for 2005, totalling EUR 105 billion, are reliable. I must qualify this audit opinion, however, in the light of the net overvaluation of assets and the inconsistent application of cut-off procedures.
As regards the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, the Court again provides an unqualified opinion on revenue, funds commitment, EU administrative expenditure and pre-accession strategy, excluding Sapard.
A positive view can also be taken of the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS), which covers 56% of expenditure within the framework of the common agricultural policy.
As in 2004, the Court confirms that the IACS has, where properly implemented, successfully played its part in preventing irregular agricultural expenditure.
In practice this is the case in the EU15, with the exception of Greece.
In the new Member States, the implementation of IACS has progressed well, although these systems are not yet fully effective.
As the Court's detailed audit evidence shows, the remainder of the areas of expenditure, which accounts, in terms of value, for the majority of the EU budget, is still characterised by material errors of legality and regularity in the underlying transactions.
In other words, the Court is once again unable to approve without qualification the expenditure areas, in particular, of agriculture (taken as a whole), structural measures and internal and external policies.
This is the result of the high level of irregularities found, which include inflated expenditure claims, duplicated cost listings, ineligible beneficiaries and/or projects, claims for expenditure not actually incurred and breaches of the rules governing public tendering procedures.
These irregularities are able to occur because the current internal controls on EU expenditure are inadequate.
According to the EC Treaty it is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure that the internal control systems are in place and work effectively in practice at all levels of EU administration.
Not only has the Court found evidence of the inadequate performance of checks on payments under shared management, namely agricultural expenditure and structural measures, but it has also found that the Commission has failed to lead by example in respect of EU expenditure managed directly by it, that is to say internal and external policies.
Thus, in the field of research, for instance, the Commission considerably reduced its checks on expenditure claims in 2005 despite the continuing high levels of error and the inherent risk in this type of expenditure.
The Commission argues that the errors found and reported by the Court are of little import since the various multi-annual correction mechanisms detect and correct errors and irregularities when the programmes are finalised.
The audit work of the Court shows that in practice these corrections are insufficient and that they are not directed towards the final beneficiaries in all areas.
Furthermore, there are numerous shortcomings in recovery procedures.
In the areas of shared management with Member States, for example, the Court's findings were as follows.
As regards agricultural spending, the financial clearance procedures are much delayed - the last fully cleared financial year was 1998 - and, due to failures in the system, the conformity decisions imposed fines only on the authorities of Member States.
Since, in most cases, excess amounts paid to the final beneficiaries are not recovered, the burden is borne by the national taxpayer rather than by those final beneficiaries who overclaim.
As regards structural measures, the 1994-1999 programmes have still not been completely closed and the Court finds that a number of the programmes that have been closed still exhibit substantial error levels.
Moreover, the Commission closed a number of programmes without making financial corrections despite there being significant reservations in respect of the certified expenditure.
This clearly highlights the risk that errors in intermediate payment claims may not be corrected in practice.
I would like to emphasise the fact that the Court, clearly, welcomes recoveries to the benefit of the EU budget.
However, it must be pointed out that flat-rate financial corrections are made for weaknesses in the control systems of the Member States. As a consequence of this, these corrections do not, as a rule, lead to rectification of the errors of legality and regularity in the underlying transactions at the level of the final beneficiaries.
In the Court's opinion, there are a number of measures that should be taken to address these shortcomings. There needs to be a logical chain of effective internal controls based on unambiguous and appropriate rules and on common principles and standards, taking into account risk assessment of the nature of transactions and types of management.
Effective recovery and sanction systems should likewise be applied in all areas of the EU budget.
For its part, the Court of Auditors is keen to explore more intensively areas of common interest with the national audit institutions.
For the meeting of the Contact Committee of the Heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions in Warsaw next month, the Court has suggested extending current levels of cooperation to cover assessment of internal control systems in the Member States.
The European Union is facing renewed challenges in the shape of the rules of operation, the completion and closure of the current structural funds spending programmes and the opening of the 2007-2013 programmes, as well as the imminent accession of two new Member States.
Allow me to conclude by setting out how EU financial management should approach these challenges.
The Commission, together with the authorities in the Member States, must ensure that there are efficient and reliable internal control systems across all levels of EU administration; that these systems, in turn, include sufficient checks which are properly carried out, reported and followed up; and that the systems in question are based on simplified regulations governing EU expenditure.
We should all be aiming for a European Union which has its budget under effective control for the benefit of its citizens.
Thank you for your kind attention.
Vice-President of the Commission. (ET) Madam President, Mr Weber, ladies and gentlemen, I presented my initial position concerning the annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 23 October.
The committee is presently actively taking follow-up action and correcting the errors that have been identified.
On the day after the Court of Auditors' Report was published, the committee sent a letter to the Member States, in which it asked them to present comments and clarifications concerning errors identified in the countries concerned, and eliminate those errors.
Thus we will take the conclusions of the Committee on Budgetary Control into consideration fully and promptly.
Like you, however, the committee has also contemplated the political significance of the report after its publication.
It is clear that the above-mentioned report is not yet a general positive statement of assurance.
As Mr Weber, the President of the Court of Auditors, said, the Court submits a statement of assurance concerning the 'legality and regularity' of expenditures, obligations, pre-accession strategy expenditure, administrative expenditures and common agricultural policy expenditures that are part of the Integrated Administration and Control System.
The Court of Auditors does not, however, present a positive statement of assurance concerning other areas, for instance research programmes and structural funds.
The main reason for this is that the Court of Auditors has found too many errors in the sampling of transactions in these areas.
As Mr Weber stated, the cause for these errors is 'simple negligence or oversight, poor knowledge of the complex rules and presumably also fraud connected with the EU budget'.
I think that the criticism in the area of research programmes that was presented as a result of last year's control is, unfortunately, justified.
The reduction of the number of auditors in this sensitive area by nearly half, and our recovery procedures should be more rapid and more forceful.
It is true that we failed to notice many errors that the Court of Audits later detected.
I believe that in both this and other areas, the poor knowledge of complex rules is the main cause of errors.
Frankly, I think the Commission has done too little too slowly to simplify and clarify the rules and guidelines.
We are addressing these questions in the Action Plan and in proposals for the new programming period.
We welcome the continued attention and advice from the Court on how to improve the situation.
I would also like to look at the topic of fraud.
How much fraud is there in the performance of the European Union budget?
Any suspicions of fraud will be investigated thoroughly by OLAF, as witnessed by the two cases recently reported in the media in connection with the Chernobyl project and the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Brussels.
Yet is the entire European Union budget 'riddled with fraud', as some journalists write year after year?
Let me quote from the report on the management and auditing of EU funds published yesterday by the UK's House of Lords.
The report finds that 'much of the coverage in the press suggests that there is a significant culture of corruption in Europe's institutions. Our investigation has uncovered no evidence to support this suggestion'.
Based on data from the Member States, the Commission possesses fraud estimates concerning two areas in which spending is greatest - agriculture and regional aid.
These estimates show that 13-15% of notified irregularities are cases of suspected fraud, corresponding to 0.05% of the expenditures of agricultural funds and structural and cohesion funds.
Last year the Commission wrote off EUR 90 million as irrecoverable financial losses, representing some 0.09% of the budget.
Thus the rate of fraud is marginal.
That does not, of course, mean that we should not seriously combat each specific case.
This also appears to be confirmed by the Court's audit work in 2005.
Of all the information, audits and about nine hundred sampled transactions the Court looked at in 2005, in only four cases did the Court have cause to suspect fraud or serious violation of the rules and regulations and inform the European anti-fraud office (OLAF).
After analysis, however, OLAF was unable to confirm any of the fraud cases of which it had been informed.
However, the Court traditionally has once again provided useful data that is useful to OLAF in its operational work.
Mr Weber, Madam President, now that these comments on our weaknesses, the need for simplification and the level of fraud have been presented, I presume the discharge authority would also like to assess the impact of the errors on the 'price-quality relationship'.
The Court of Auditors' report (page 138) reveals that the Court audited 95 projects funded from structural funds, and found significant errors in 60 of them.
Does this mean that two thirds of structural funds has been lost or wasted?
Does this mean that the objectives of these projects have not been achieved?
It clearly does not.
Some ground-breaking research may have been done without all the necessary paperwork, and conversely, one can find projects that were brilliantly executed in terms of the formal rules, and all the paperwork was done, but the objectives were not achieved.
Unfortunately the report gives no information on the true impact of the Community funding.
Thus one wonders what conclusions Parliament and the ordinary citizen in Member States can draw based on the Court's overview of the errors in structural policies.
The Court often states that it is only a messenger, and that the Treaty obliges the Court to give a statement of assurance on the whole budget each year.
It does this through its samples of transactions and other audits.
It tests compliance with the rules.
This work, the Court does professionally, within the limits of its human resources.
Who, though, then evaluates the impact of these errors on the achievement of policy objectives?
On what basis should Parliament make such evaluations?
After all, together with Council, you are the budgetary authority and have the final word on future budget allocations.
The Court's report should offer you a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of budgets approved in the past.
In this perspective, I think one should invite the Court to evaluate how significant an impact the errors have had.
We know the Court has the expertise to do this.
It does this kind of 'price-quality' evaluation in special reports, which we highly appreciate.
So why is such analysis absent from the annual report?
For the Commission, sound financial management means reaching policy objectives in an efficient way and at a reasonable cost.
It necessarily takes a multi-annual view of each aid programme, and ensures that the expenditure on control over the programme is in balance with the costs and benefits.
The Commission is well aware that few university professors who apply for funding for research programmes are qualified accountants, and it knows that some will make mistakes in their applications for EU funding.
Should the funding of research stop for this reason?
Absolutely not.
We reduce the scope for error, but live with what remains.
In terms of choices, there is clearly something missing between a negative DAS and a positive discharge.
The Treaty - Article 248.2 of the Treaty on the European Communities - requires the Court to assess the soundness of financial management.
Could it not also assess whether, in a given year, the Commission has indeed taken the steps necessary to ensure value for money?
This would not simplify the Commission's task, but it would give us all a clearer point of view!
You may think this sounds too radical.
Perhaps it is, but the UK House of Lords goes even further in a very serious report published yesterday.
The House says that 'substantial improvements are needed to the methodology underpinning the Statement of Assurance' and proposes, among other things: that the Court 'should distinguish clearly between irregularity and fraud, publishing separate figures for the level of fraudulent transactions and administrative mistakes'; that 'the Statement of Assurance should focus on giving a detailed summary of financial management in each of the spending categories and Member States' listing those Member States demonstrating poor management of European funds'.
The Commission will carefully study this interesting report.
Allow me also to touch on the issue of recoveries, or 'clawbacks'.
In this year's DAS statement, the Court appears to cast doubt on the relevance of clawbacks for the DAS, arguing that recoveries do not right wrongs, nor do they dissuade the final beneficiary from making errors.
This Commission thinks this does not fairly represent the actual situation.
Every year, very significant amounts are clawed back by the Commission from Member States and by Member States from the final beneficiaries.
This system contributes to the effective protection of the Union's financial interests.
It has a preventive effect, by giving Member States an incentive to improve their management and control systems, to prevent, detect and recover irregular payments to final beneficiaries.
We - actually the Member States - should receive the credit for that, and it should affect the DAS declaration as well.
I would like, Madam President, to continue on a more positive note.
The Commission has established working relations with many national audit offices and found a positive attitude towards auditing EU funds in shared management.
I am very encouraged by the announcement made by President Weber that the Court is intending to propose joint audits with these national audit offices, starting with the areas of Structural Funds and financial corrections performed in Member States.
Indeed, we could much more effectively convince Member States to take more responsibility for spending from EU budget, if the Court were willing to work with - and eventually use - the results of audits produced at the national level.
I would like to end with a comment on some of the good news in the Court's report.
Its President, Mr Weber, has pointed out that 'the Commission successfully implemented the new accounting system with notable rapidity, and it now offers additional key information that is significantly more complete than that provided through the previous cash-based system'.
We are proud of this achievement.
To sum up: the DAS is once again negative.
The Commission regrets this.
It will correct the errors made and take further actions to correct systemic weaknesses, as announced in the Action Plan for an Integrated Internal Control Framework.
In acknowledging that there is still much work to be done, the Commission also notes that important progress is made every year and that the overall management of EU funds is sound.
It is under control, but there is further scope for simplification of complex rules.
Together with my colleagues, I look forward to the more detailed sectoral discussions in the discharge hearings ahead.
Finally, the Commission would like to re-emphasise that there is a missing link between the list of errors reported by the Court and the discharge procedure.
The Commission would welcome an audit approach which also looks at effectiveness or 'value for money'.
We believe this would assist the discharge authority in carrying out its important task.
Thank you for your attention.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, President Weber, Commissioner, this year we are once again being presented with the report by the Court of Auditors on the management of the Community budget and, this year once again, the European Parliament will pay the greatest possible attention to it, since it represents the most credible and reliable reflection of the state of the European public accounts.
As the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture, Mrs Fischer Boel, said yesterday, we are genuinely going to subject the Union's finances to a proper health check.
I do not intend to demand that the institutions take responsibilities that go beyond their particular competences.
The Court of Auditors plays its role, often with little cooperation from the Member States and their national control institutions.
I hope that Mr Weber will achieve in Warsaw what we have not been able to achieve over all these years.
Despite its defects, the European Commission does an extraordinary job, an extremely difficult job, given its lack of resources and the huge quantity of work.
We do not therefore want this report to become an object of controversy, but rather a genuine instrument for improving public accounts.
The Council and the Member States also have their own responsibility, since, with the current institutional architecture, it is difficult to go any further with financial control of the budget and the execution of spending.
Previous speakers have already said it: 80% is spent in the Member States but we do not even get the Finance Ministers in those Member States to declare the reliability of spending.
There still remains much to be done, therefore.
Amongst other things, I intend to use 'value for money' as a basis for the cost-benefit analysis.
The guiding principle of our report will be good financial management.
We shall attach great importance to management, both shared management and direct management and decentralised management, and to the recovery of funds.
Finally, Madam President, we would like to see a new approach to the statement of assurance, but we shall talk about that over the coming months.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, those of us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament too are, of course, unhappy about the fact that it is now getting on for many years in a row that the Court of Auditors has not been able wholeheartedly to approve the EU accounts and to give a positive statement of assurance as to their reliability.
We should like to begin by, of course, emphasising this but, at the same time, also saying that, although there are many points of criticism, we are working in a balanced, progressive and proactive way with a view, of course, to solving the problems.
It is not only a question of criticising.
It is, first and foremost, about discovering what specific type of problems we are facing and how we can solve them.
We think there is good reason to commend the Court of Auditors on its detailed report.
We in the Socialist Group have on many occasions asked for further details.
We have sought a higher degree of differentiation in relation to the various types of error.
This has been provided, but the situation is still not good enough.
We might have wished, for example, for more of a distinction to have been made between what is, factually speaking, fraud and what are, factually speaking, errors.
Praise is due to the Commission for introducing a new accounting system: the integrated financial control system for agricultural expenditure.
There are quite a few areas in which progress has been made, but there are, of course, also grounds for criticism, especially in relation to internal policies, where the Court of Auditors' report shows that things have in fact deteriorated since last year.
We shall, of course, use the discharge procedure to look more closely at these matters, to demand some answers and, presumably, also to look ahead and come up with some better proposed solutions.
We in the Socialist Group earnestly call on Commissioner Kallas and the Court of Auditors to continue their cooperation with a view to solving these problems in the best way possible.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, this debate is one we have been having for many years, with a number of recurring themes.
Yet again, there is no Statement of Assurance, much to the discontent of everyone who is well disposed towards European cooperation, and yet again, it is not entirely clear why this should be.
Every year, we ask the Court of Auditors for more detailed information and every year, we are faced with those typical phrases in the report, of which I should like to quote you a few: 'The Court of Auditors has concluded that generally, where CAP spending is concerned, mistakes of material interest still occur'. With regard to the structural funds: 'For both programme periods (1994-1999 and 2000-2006), the Court of Auditors has concluded that spending was not free from irregularities of material interest'.
Indeed, we have been asking for high-risk and low-risk budget components for years.
Is it not possible for the Court of Auditors to be a little more precise and, among other things, to specify what error percentages would be acceptable?
This would allow us to measure any improvements that are made.
I get the impression that the Commission is becoming a little more assertive, and I see that as totally justified.
It is not only a matter of bookkeeping, but also a matter of effectiveness.
It is unfortunate for this Parliament that neither the President of the Court of Auditors, nor Commissioner Kallas have spoken one word about the new financial perspectives.
This is new.
We would ask that someone who carries political responsibility at a certain level would issue a statement of assurance annually.
For Parliament, the question is essentially: How does the Commission intend to do this?
It is unfortunate that the Commission has given no indication of this, and that the Court of Auditors, for that matter, has not mentioned it either.
Since it forms part of the multi-annual budget, it is up to the Member States and the Commission to implement it.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr Weber, Commissioner Kallas, I am, above all, grateful to the Court of Auditors for the report, which I regard as a sound one.
I also think that the standard of its editing is continuing to improve.
The report has been written in clear language and, above all, has recourse to 'naming and shaming', something I appreciate enormously.
We are facing a special discharge, because this is the first budget year for the whole of which, the enlarged Union has had 25 Member States, and that falls entirely within the current Commission's remit.
In that sense, I have to say that I am a little surprised, even shocked, about the rather defensive speech Commissioner Kallas gave here today - shocked, because when he came into office, he was the very man who stated on this platform that, during his tenure, we would at last see a positive Statement of Assurance being issued.
What do we see now, though?
The Court of Auditors' criticism of key components of the budget remains unchallenged, and Mr Kallas goes into the defence with a report, which I read last night, and which is actually worth reading, from the House of Lords.
This is not, of course, the right way of going about things.
Having read the Court of Auditors' report, I can tell Commissioner Kallas that it contains very specific elements.
For example, the integrated management and control system for agriculture works perfectly for those Member States that apply it.
Greece does not.
This was already mentioned in last year's report by the Court of Auditors and was an important component in Mr Mulder's discharge last year.
What have you done about this since then?
What have you done to call Greece to account?
According to the same report by the Court of Auditors, there are serious problems involving export refunds.
In Denmark and the Netherlands, exporters can simply seal their lorries without customs officers having to be present.
What have you done to counter this?
These are, after all, specific questions, and there is no need to adopt a defensive stance.
I have two specific questions for Mr Weber.
The first question is: On 7 November, when you addressed the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, did you finally make it clear to the Ministers that it is vital for them to sign off their accounts?
Secondly, will you entertain the request made by the House of Lords that a black list should finally be drawn up of Member States that do not manage European funds very well?
I should like to have an answer to both those questions, Mr Weber.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Today, Parliament has the pleasure of discussing the enlightening report by the European Court of Auditors about the spending of European funds in 2005.
Once again, the auditors are not impressed.
There are still too many errors that are too substantial and too structural in the way in which European funds are spent.
In that sense, this report is not very different from its eleven predecessors.
What is different, though, is the reaction to the Court of Auditors' negative verdict.
European institutions, the Commission among them, would formerly indulge in regular sessions of mea culpa and promises of improvement.
This time round, the Commission has mounted a full-on offensive, and the Court of Auditors is being accused of being overly critical and having produced an ambiguous report.
They even claim that we must learn to live with some mistakes.
It is a fact, however, that Europe is the proud owner of 200 000 virtual cows that receive subsidies even though they do not exist.
It is a fact that major errors have once again been flagged in the areas of olive oil, the export subsidies and the structural funds.
It is a fact that, as a result, funds do not end up where they are most needed.
Also, it is a fact that, as a result, the European public is increasingly losing faith in the Union.
A grown-up institution should be able to use criticism to its advantage.
The European institutions are demonstrating that they, even at the age of 50, have not yet reached this level of maturity.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, all of us in this House are saying that the Court of Auditors has produced a good report - it is informative and clearer than it usually is.
What does the report tell us?
Well, it tells us that anomalies are continuing to occur just as much as before, and we have to ask ourselves whether we are to continue living with such anomalies.
What we have here is, of course, an entirely unreasonable approach to the problems.
What is needed is an examination of how and why things have got into this state and clear proposals from the Commission concerning what is to be done.
Any examination of this nature would necessarily lead one to observe that most of what goes wrong has to do with the agricultural policy.
There are, besides this, very many other reasons to change the agricultural policy, in fact to do away with it all together.
If that happened, a very large proportion of the problems that we see in this context would simply disappear.
I would nonetheless still like to remind the House that it bears a very great part of the blame for the EU losing its good reputation among the peoples of Europe.
This House always votes to back everyone up but in practice never insists on responsibility.
It was pathetic to see the leaders of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats standing here in Parliament, practically in tears, telling us that they felt compelled to postpone the granting of discharge to Parliament itself as a result of the scandal relating to the buildings here in Strasbourg.
Despite the fact that I pointed out that discharge should not be granted to the Committee of the Regions, it was granted anyway.
We cannot go on like this.
Madam President, the Court of Auditors has confirmed there is no independent audit of any part of these accounts, including the treasury function, which sometimes sits on a pile of EUR 20 billion or more.
I would like the Court to explain precisely how many years it has carried out a full and specific audit of the treasury function, and would also like confirmation as to how frequently, such as once annually, it might undertake such a task in the future.
The Court has also confirmed that EU funds are held in the individual Member States before being allocated for use there.
The cash flow and interest-bearing consequences of that are important and hitherto unknown.
Net contributors like the UK and Germany are at a disadvantage, because a large proportion of their funds are stored in recipient countries.
The French, on the other hand, are always holding the funds of net contributors and routinely earning interest on the overnight money markets.
How much money has been lost to British and German taxpayers through the use of this system?
Finally, I should point out that I have been asking Mr Weber these questions for over six months, and still await a reply.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as well as for the control of the Commission's budget, this House is responsible for monitoring the budgets of what are termed the 'other' institutions, and if they are to be given a positive discharge, it must be clear that they have used European taxpayers' money properly.
It is at this point that we have a number of things to discuss.
If we take our monitoring role seriously, we also have to audit those items of expenditure that we formerly disregarded, for example, the Council's common foreign and security policy - and I regret that the Council is not present today to hear me say this, for it is in close cooperation with the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, that I am, quite deliberately, making reference to this policy area today and making a demand for transparent cooperation on the part of the Council.
There will be several issues in relation to the Committee of the Regions in which closer examination will be required; the ones I would give as examples are the failure to implement the internal auditor's recommendations and the questionable use of the weighting, not to mention the wholly inadequate consideration of this topic by the committee itself.
The buildings policies of the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and of the Court of Justice raise issues that also have to be addressed, and there are many other matters to be sorted out.
OLAF, our anti-fraud office, has also exercised an effective monitoring role with respect to the institutions over recent years, and I wonder why it is that neither the Ombudsman nor the Data Protection Supervisor have as yet concluded an agreement with it.
These bodies, too, will have to answer that question.
I call on all the interested parties to answer the questions in a transparent manner, to play their part in enabling this House to get an all-round picture and to work together in devising ways of improving things.
Only if this is done will we be able to give discharge for 2005.
(HU) Madam President, the report by the European Court of Auditors, which, as in previous years, is the result of very thorough, high-quality work, states that the expenditure of the European budget has been carried out essentially with legality and regularity.
I wish to emphasise the significance of this statement because once again this year, as in the past 12 years, the Court is unable to give an unqualified positive opinion.
The reason for this is that some 80% of the European Union's budget is spent under the system of joint responsibility by the Member States, where the Court of Auditors has, in the course of its very thorough inspections, found fairly high levels of error that have a financial impact.
This does not in any way mean that all expenditures of the Union's budget are burdened with error, nor can these errors be interpreted as indications of fraud.
In its initial reaction, the European Commission objects to the methodology of the Court of Auditors, but continues to set as its goal a positive DAS by 2009.
To this end, it has launched a process of reform, within the framework of which it has developed an integrated internal control system; the introduction of a goal-oriented budget management can also be counted as a significant step forward.
Now that the Member States have recognised, at the behest of the European Parliament, that the declarations they are being asked to provide are necessary, we can look forward to a very successful Court of Auditors.
Madam President, I am tempted to ask you simply to read the speech I made last year.
The comments from the President of the Court of Auditors sum it up very neatly.
Overall, the situation has not substantially changed since last year.
In fact, the Court's press statement makes it abundantly clear that nothing has changed, with comments like 'due to continue in high levels of error' and the piÃšce de rÃ©sistance, 'errors with a financial impact are found too frequently for the Court to conclude that all is well'.
The only real difference this year is that the Commission has been more strident in denying its responsibility for the mess.
I must thank Commissioner Kallas for providing me with the rib-tickler of the year, when he said that the perception of fraud in the EU finances is 'highly unfair' and that the spending of money in the EU is under tight control.
Yes, and Santa Claus really does come down the chimney!
Blaming the nation states for most of the fraud is an easy way out.
The Commission is supposed to enforce the rules and oversee spending.
Therefore it must take the blame for all those invisible cows in Slovenia, a country that has only been a member for two years but has quickly learnt to play the system.
Nothing has been learnt and the mistakes go on being repeated.
(ES) Madam President, as the Court of Auditors' report says, we have made progress in many areas.
I would like to thank it for its report.
But there is one area in which we have not made any progress: in pointing to Member States individually.
We are a group of twenty-five and we cannot just give one mark for the whole of the class
The 300 pages of its report contain references to Greece, but you have never said which Member States are mainly responsible for our not achieving the target or - if you do not just want to be hatchet men - which Member States are doing well or are greatly improving.
Other institutions do it: the European Central Bank points to individual Member States by name.
You are not an assembly of diplomats defending national interests.
In your press communiquÃ©s, you must point out, amongst other things, which States are doing things well and which are not.
The Finnish Presidency is not even represented here, but on the basis of the report by the House of Lords, a report for which we have great respect, I am going to ask, on behalf of the group that I coordinate, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for an initiative report to look into the Court of Auditors' methodology.
I well remember how one of its members, the Belgian member, Mr Pinxten, took his post without giving up any of his economic or political responsibilities.
In the end, when he was threatened with being brought before the courts, he had to leave by the back door.
That shameful episode was not unfortunately the finest hour of the Court of which you are the worthy President.
I would like to say one thing to Vice-President Kallas.
In your speech to the Committee on Budgetary Control on the 23rd, you said that 2 100 million had been recovered.
You criticised the auditor harshly - I do not know whether that is the best you could do - but I would like you to specify, if possible, which policies, programmes and Member States that 2 100 million recovered relates to.
(DE) Madam President, I want to congratulate the Court of Auditors on a good report, which holds up a mirror to quite a few things; the only thing is that certain people do not want to look at it.
I have to tell Commissioner Kallas that it is not acceptable that the new Commission, acting on the 'shoot the messenger' principle, should close its ears to the bad news from Luxembourg.
If we re-read the treaties, we will find that they state that the Commission - and nobody else - is responsible for the implementation of the European budget.
Yet I, Commissioner Kallas, read everywhere references to things for which you are not responsible, for the agencies, as you yourself say - and we will have more to say about that - or, for example, for Greece's failure to implement an integrated administration and control system (IACS); everywhere, the Commission is disappearing from the scene, and that is something that - since we have to deal with the new Commission for the first time - we will have to have serious discussions about.
Commissioner Kallas, you must start taking on responsibility, or else you are in the wrong job.
Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Members of your House who have had some very friendly things to say about our report, in particular to Mr Staes, Mr Lundgren, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz and Mr BÃ¶sch.
If I may come back to Vice-President Kallas, he has lamented the constant focus in the media on the subject of fraud.
I can assure you that, together with the many of your Members who have spoken today - among them Mr JÃžrgensen, Mr Fazakas and Mr Titford - we are giving the Commission our wholehearted backing.
It is not acceptable that the same old tune - 'fraud, fraud, and more fraud' - should be playing all the time; it is unjustified, it is damaging, and it is something we can do without.
We do have rules.
Let me now return to the second aspect, that being the recommendation from the British House of Lords, on which Mr Kallas believes we should act.
We have a system.
Our report cannot confirm that fraud has been committed; that is for judges, rather than the Court of Auditors, to determine.
We will, though, look carefully at the report from the House of Lords, which reached us only around yesterday lunchtime.
I myself had a hand in an agreement we reached with the Commission, according to which, if we suspect that fraud is in play, the matter is passed on to OLAF.
As I have already said, the procedures are subject to rules.
I can wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Garriga Polledo said; collaboration with our sister authorities is vitally important, and we will take with us to Warsaw your best wishes, for which we are grateful.
Mr Mulder asked why it is that the accounts have once more not been approved without qualification, and the answer to that is quite straightforward.
It is that the transactions to which the accounts refer are still, to a large degree, not subject to appropriate risk management.
Only as and when they are will it be possible to give a positive Statement of Assurance.
Here, too, though, the incidence of errors would only result in the media once more putting the spotlight on fraud.
I am much obliged to Mr Staes for pointing out that a positive Statement of Assurance would be one result of improvements in the internal auditing systems, and for citing a number of examples; I can do no other than endorse what he said.
I expressed myself very forthrightly before Ecofin, and the British House of Lords has highlighted a number of problems, among them countersignature and the blacklist.
We received their report yesterday and must first examine it very closely.
I will respond to Mr Mote's comments by saying our concern today is with the Statement of Assurance, although the great importance of the matters to which he alluded is not in doubt, and I am quite happy to continue with him the dialogue on which we have already embarked.
I have now answered, in essence, most of the questions put to me.
Vice-President of the Commission. Madam President, I should like to thank all the Members for their remarks.
This is just part of the process, and next week will see the start of more detailed hearings on the implementation of our budget.
In response to some of the remarks, I would like to say that the Commission is not pointing the finger at anyone.
It is seeking to achieve an accurate picture enabling adequate, balanced evaluation of the implementation of the European budget.
We are fully responsible for everything we do, and we are willing to bear that responsibility.
However, it would be unrealistic to expect, in response to an analysis of the implementation of the European budget the thrust of which is that the Commission is bad, for the Commission to say that it is not bad, but even worse.
That would be inappropriate, although we fully recognise our weak points.
Internal policy issues will be the most vulnerable area of our 2005 activities.
During the three budgetary discharge processes in which I have been involved, I have seen real improvements and I know what can be done to improve the situation further.
We will do our utmost to improve that situation, and are looking for comprehensive, adequate professional evaluation of the implementation of the EU budget in all its aspects, be this its achievements or weaknesses, errors or fraud, etc. It is our aim and desire to show everybody that although the machinery is huge and could be improved, things are not bad at all.
Being familiar with the experiences of Member States in the sphere of public administration, and knowing what happens in different Member States and in other international organisations, I can state that things are indeed not bad at all.
It is our desire for the general public, Members of Parliament and the Court of Auditors to also see this side of our activities.
Concerning Mr Mulder's question on the financial perspective and the idea of increased participation by Member States in this process - the question of national declarations - I welcome the change in stance.
When we started discussing this issue, only one or two Member States shared the attitude that Member States could take more responsibility.
That attitude is changing but, as I know from my limited experience in European affairs, this will obviously take time.
We are pleased that the Member States have agreed to provide a summary of the declarations of paying agencies, which is a step forward, and we are working with the Member States to take things further.
Regarding the declaration itself, I fully share the opinion of the Court of Auditors that this will not solve everything per se.
It is part of the much broader issue of systemic and structural control and audit, which should bring the expected results.
Let us therefore discuss every aspect and not omit anything from the scope of our discussions.
Let us also discuss the question of methodology and our actions and weaknesses.
Let us hold a comprehensive, professional and adequate discussion on this issue, and then we will all be happy.
Madam President, I was interrupted in the middle of my speech because apparently you were not correctly informed of the amount of time available to me.
I was unable, therefore, to make what I believe is a very important point and draw to the attention of this House other words that are included in the House of Lords' report published last night, which say - and Mr Kallas omitted to mention them - that the Commission should focus on requiring officials and existing audit bodies to take responsibility for their systems and accounts, and that this process should culminate in the requirement for the Secretary-General of the Commission to sign an assurance that the Commission's annual accounts are true and fair.
That seems to me to be one of the most important statements we have yet had on the process of improving standards in this House, and I wish to make sure it is fully understood.
You were speaking on behalf of your group, which was given one minute's speaking time in this debate, and so it follows that I interrupted you at the right moment, and it is not right and proper that you should now, as it were, be using points of order to secure yourself even more speaking time.
Madam President, I would just like to ask Commissioner Kallas something for clarification.
He was a little ambiguous in his answer to my question, so I would just like to ask him again: when will the Commission remind Member States about the obligations in respect of the financial perspective?
Vice-President of the Commission. Madam President, we already reminded Member States of this obligation in our letter to them and we will also do so during the Council meeting when these issues are discussed again.
We are trying to promote the idea and do whatever we can, but, just as in the case of Parliament, there is a limit to what we can do in this matter.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
EU spending shares the weakness common to many large organisations, governments, ministries and international organisations: money is spent over such a range of activities and in so many places that the auditors cannot guarantee that the exact amounts were always spent correctly.
The US federal budget has not had a positive statement of assurance for about eight years.
Britain's Department for Work and Pensions has not had its equivalent statement for the last 15 years - and its budget is larger than that of the whole EU!
As the UK's House of Lords reported yesterday, there appears to be relatively little actual fraud on the EU budget.
The auditors have rather found cases of technical irregularities, which normally result in a refund to the EU budget anyway, or a late payment, or incomplete paperwork which gets chased up later.
Sensationalist press articles then classify all these as 'fraud', which they are not.
Further progress in eliminating such errors is needed.
I would like to see a system where the annual statements of assurance had to be given to the Commission departments and each of the 25 national governments individually, rather than in one single statement for the whole EU.
(FR) In its annual report, the Court of Auditors gives a positive statement of assurance on the EU 2005 accounts and congratulates the Commission on putting in place the new accounting system for the fiscal year.
However, as regards the legality and regularity of underlying operations - that is to say, payments to and from the EU coffers - the Court notes that adapted risk management is not always guaranteed when it comes to important areas of expenditure.
Most of these mistakes are the result of ignorance of the applicable rules, ineligible expenses or attempted fraud on the part of end beneficiaries (farmers, local authorities or project managers).
Who is to blame for this?
Firstly, the Commission, which, according to the Treaties, is directly responsible for the implementation of the European budget.
It has to strengthen the quality of internal control, and procedures must be simplified to prevent non-compliance with eligibility criteria, the double charging of costs and the overstatement of costs.
Lastly, the Member States must also assume their responsibilities, given that 76% of the funds are spent by national or local administrations.
It is in my view of paramount importance that the Member States undertake to submit their annual statements on how the EU funds that they manage are spent.
Joint Undertaking for the European air traffic management system (SESAR) (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of a Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) - C6-0002/2006 -
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges on which you are invited to give an opinion is a thorough-going, high-quality report.
I wish to thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, together with Mr Bradbourn, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs, for their support for the Commission's proposal on SESAR, a major European project.
Your report, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, coincides with the Commission's position, and we support most of your amendments.
I shall not go into the details of the debate on all of the amendments that have been tabled, but limit myself instead to a few general remarks.
First of all, I note that Parliament and the Commission take the same view of the strategic importance of major technological and industrial programmes like SESAR and GALILEO.
SESAR is a vital programme for the competitiveness of the European aviation industry.
It forms part of the Community's technological innovation programme, which lies at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy.
In a sector as crucial for the European economy as this one, it is vital that public bodies and the private sector pool their resources to build together what will become the most efficient, most reliable and safest air traffic control infrastructure in the world.
This public-private partnership requires a clear division of roles, together with transparent procedures, so that potential conflicts of interest can be pre-empted.
The Commission therefore welcomes the amendments tabled by Parliament along these lines.
As regards some of Parliament's means of intervention, there is a matter of principle at stake.
SESAR is a partnership between the public and private sectors, and the essential prerequisite for private sector participation is that the programme is managed as a business.
Furthermore, and Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges highlighted this point very well in her report, voting rights in the Administrative Board of the SESAR joint undertaking must be balanced and weighted in proportion to financial contribution, which is one of the sound principles of good management in any private business.
It is accordingly difficult to accept Parliament's amendment aimed at gaining representation for Parliament on the Administrative Board.
As Parliament is the Community's main budgetary control authority, it cannot perform its monitoring duties and, at the same time, sit even as a simple observer on a Board that it is charged with monitoring.
On a similar theme, the industry is keen for the choice of executive director to be based on objective criteria of experience and technical knowledge, rather than on political criteria. It is important to acknowledge that the SESAR joint undertaking is an instrument for managing a technological research and development programme and has no regulatory-type role.
Consequently, it would make no sense for Parliament to be directly involved in the process of selecting an executive director of the SESAR joint undertaking.
The Commission does support, however, all amendments aimed at ensuring that Parliament be kept properly and continuously informed about the SESAR programme.
Madam President, I am delighted with Parliament's work.
I am convinced that a few differences of opinion will not hamper our joint efforts to make this programme a success for the EU.
I should like to add that the whole of our environmental policy will receive a further boost, insofar as SESAR means aircraft being able to take off on time and not needing to be stacked, with the result that energy will be saved and needless carbon emissions prevented.
This is why, from all points of view - passenger safety, energy saving and environmental quality - SESAR is an absolutely vital project.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today examining a report aimed at establishing a joint undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR).
As the technical arm of the single European sky, SESAR is tasked with adapting air traffic control to new technologies, ensuring the safety and regulation of flights, organising air navigation services and defining the respective roles and responsibilities of surveillance authorities and service providers.
As you said, Commissioner, the project is, on various levels, of paramount importance to the future of European civil aviation.
It is also one of the joint infrastructure projects identified by the 1994 European Council.
We have already lost a good deal of time.
SESAR will be indispensable, given the fact that air transport, which contributes some EUR 220 billion to the European GDP and employs 3.1 million people, is set to more than double in the next 20 years.
Given that, because of its old age, the reliability of the control equipment, whose technology dates back to the 1970s in some cases, can no longer be guaranteed, SESAR will have a major impact on safety.
The same goes for the environment.
Once the project is up and running, it will be possible to make appreciable savings on fuel, due, on the one hand, to the optimisation of trajectories and better use of air space and, on the other, to a reduction in stacking.
The Commission estimates that greenhouse gas will be reduced by 4% to 6% per flight. Passengers will also see their waiting times at airports reduced as a result.
The Commission is proposing the establishment of a joint undertaking. It is to get off the ground quickly, even before the end of the definition phase, which runs from 2005 to 2007, and is to receive some EUR 60 million in cofinancing from the Community budget and Eurocontrol.
Between 2008 and 2013, the joint undertaking will take charge of the development phase with a budget of EUR 300 million per year divided between three partners - the Commission, Eurocontrol and a consortium of private businesses.
Then comes the deployment phase, which will be taken charge of by the industry and which is predicted to last from 2014 to 2020.
This first public-private partnership in the field of civil aviation will bring numerous job opportunities.
It will also be a major research and development project that may extend into markets outside the Union, provided this does not delay its entry into force.
The enhanced cooperation procedure between our two parliamentary committees reflects the relevance of this project to two areas, namely research and transport networks.
The Commission based its project on Article 171, meaning that Parliament was not involved in codecision.
I should like to mention, however, the positive spirit of collaboration with the Commission and to say that Parliament will keep a close eye on events and that it will do all it can to help even if it is not represented on the Administrative Board.
The amendments that we have introduced clarify the text as regards potential conflicts of interest.
We also asked the Commission to produce a new document dealing solely with the third phase in order to dispel a significant proportion of the doubts raised by the first project.
SESAR is a project that will serve the citizens' interests, that will place the European civil aviation industry at the cutting edge of progress and that will enhance our competitiveness.
The industry's interest in the project justifies its financial involvement, and the distribution of voting rights will have to prevent any cumbersome administrative procedures.
Parliament believes it has done the right thing in keeping open the possibility of creating a levy given that the industry's contribution, supported by figures, has yet to be confirmed.
All that remains, Commissioner, is to express the hope that SESAR suffers neither the delays that affected Galileo, nor the debacle that beset Airbus, and that it shows that European research, Eurocontrol's know-how and the capacities of the industries concerned can come together in the interests of progress.
Finally, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that the Member States will have to be prepared to organise the distribution of air traffic control on the basis of technological development.
To conclude, I should like to thank all those who contributed and, primarily, Mr Bradbourn, my co-rapporteur.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Mr President, the SESAR project is one which will greatly benefit not just Europe's aviation sectors, but the consumer as well.
When SESAR is launched, airline efficiency will be improved, with more direct routing, less congestion in the skies and greater reliability for passengers.
The environment will also benefit from the system, because it will shorten routes and reduce stacking and thus reduce the CO2 emissions caused by aviation.
However, it strikes me that, with such an important project, it is unacceptable, given that the original single skies legislation was dealt with under codecision, for the implementation process only to be carried out under the consultation procedure.
That surely raises the question as to why the Commission feels it can pick and choose about when to involve the only democratically elected EU institution in the development of such proposals.
More worryingly, the Commission and Eurocontrol are attempting to accrue to themselves 60% of the voting rights on the Administrative Board.
The SESAR project should be driven by industry, not by bureaucrats.
We cannot expect industry to pay for the development of a project when it will have little control over its direction.
That is why I and the co-rapporteur on the lead committee, on behalf of our group, have tabled an amendment to reduce voting rights, to give industry and the air navigation service providers the incentive to be involved from the outset.
The SESAR project can help shape the future of European aviation.
It can be a positive force for change if it is given the support of all players in the sectors on a fair and equal basis.
I therefore call on the House to support our amendment to give this important project just the direction it needs.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, over the coming years, we will see more traffic on land, on water, and - above all - in the air as well, and more traffic means new problems, and more of them.
The increase in quantity must be managed, the associated health and environment issues must be satisfactorily addressed, and all that will cost a lot of money.
What we need to deal with the issues I have just mentioned is above all intelligent solutions, new technologies and better logistics, and it is on these things that we actually ought to be concentrating today.
Unfortunately, though, we have not got that far yet.
A number of things are already in the pipeline, though, and one that springs to mind is Galileo.
At present, though, we are still concentrating on preparatory matters such as: how the administrative organisation should be structured, what we should do about Eurocontrol, how to involve the private business sector in our project, and much else besides.
I would like to say a few things of an admonitory nature about public-private partnerships; it is right and proper that we should discuss these and focus on potential conflicts of interest, but we should be doing much more to get the business sector actually involved in our project.
It has to be said, though, that previous experience with PPP models has scarcely ever been really successful.
One exception I would point to - not least because we will be kicking off its successor in a few weeks' time - is the Marco Polo programme, where we managed to come up with the right mix of incentives for the private sector and the public interest, and that is the sort of thing we should concentrate on this time - more so than we did before.
Quite apart from all that, I want to say how very grateful I am to both rapporteurs for the work they have put in, and that I hope that we will, despite the question as to whether this House should exercise codecision or only be consulted on this issue, head for our goal with concentration and in unity.
Perhaps we will manage to tighten up the timetables a bit.
That would have a very, very beneficial effect.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her sterling work on the report on a common European air traffic management system, SESAR.
I agree that there is a need to develop a new generation of European air traffic system so that we might guarantee safe and smoothly flowing air traffic in Europe over the next 20 years.
The current air traffic control systems are outdated and governed unduly by specific local conditions.
They are, therefore, not especially suited to a rapid, reliable and economically sustainable development of air traffic in Europe.
Therefore, SESAR is basically a sound initiative, which will make the air traffic management system in Europe more efficient.
SESAR will mean safer and more efficient transport than is offered under current air traffic control systems, and at a reasonable price.
When, however, it comes to environmental considerations, the Commission proposal sheds insufficient light on the challenges posed by increasing air traffic over the next few years in Europe.
SESAR must not merely guarantee the safe management of air traffic.
The environmental advantages must also be present.
I am therefore able to support the amendments emphasising that SESAR must lead to more energy-efficient air routes that require less fuel to be used and are kind to the environment.
Another important consideration is that it be made clear what benefit the Member States are to gain from SESAR, that is to say in terms of property rights to the material and non-material assets created through the SESAR Joint Undertaking.
At the moment, it is not clear what is to happen regarding the rights of ownership of the assets produced through the SESAR Joint Undertaking when the ownership of SESAR is at some point transferred to industry.
It is therefore crucial for the knowledge and assets created through SESAR continuously to be accessible to the constituent members for the purposes of their own, non-commercial product development.
We do not want to end up in a situation in which all the Member States have standardised their technology in a European air traffic management system while, at the same time, the rights to this technology are owned by a private undertaking.
I would again thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges for her report and hope that, through our joint efforts, we can launch SESAR within the planned timescale.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
We need a new-generation air traffic management system for Europe to improve air transport safety and environmental performance.
SESAR will deliver what the archaic and fragmented current air traffic control technologies are incapable of.
The SESAR joint undertaking must be established now in such a way that we avoid unnecessary problems and delays further down the line.
The approach of a public-private joint undertaking is still quite a new one and I hope that the Commission will be up-front and transparent on lessons learned from the Galileo joint undertaking.
The SESAR joint undertaking needs to be reviewed periodically to make sure that the teething troubles experienced by Galileo are not repeated.
Parliament, as well as the Council, should be kept informed and consulted on issues such as the accession of new members and the appointment of the executive director.
It was strongly felt in committee that the appointment of the executive director must be made following an open competition and on criteria of competence and experience.
In no way should it be a political appointment or a perk.
The committee also stressed the ongoing importance of Eurocontrol.
Its involvement is essential, given its experience and expertise.
Finally, on the issue of where the joint undertaking should be located, I agree with the original Commission proposal that for practical reasons the seat should be in Brussels.
Opening up the seat as a discussion point would unnecessarily waste time and could prolong the establishment phase of the joint undertaking.
This is a point which will not be lost on those MEPs who deplore the waste of time, money and energy caused by the failure to locate Parliament permanently in Brussels.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if it is used properly and enters into effect as soon as possible, SESAR will be able to make an important contribution to reducing the gases that are detrimental to climate.
It will be possible, by means of good cooperation with weather services and proper arrangement of flying altitudes and speeds, to reduce not only the numbers of aircraft circling over cities while waiting to land, but also the condensation trails that more recent research highlights more emphatically as causes of climate problems.
Its efficient functioning is dependent on, among other things, the creation of regions of airspace that are well suited to helping to saving on fuel; it is unfortunate, though, that work on these is progressing very, very slowly, and this is an area in which Austria, like its northern and eastern neighbours, has work to do.
The organisational form was a major topic of discussion in our committee, and I do not believe that Eurocontrol should under any circumstances be marginalised.
There needs to be some central body to defend the public interest - which includes, and must in our view include, such things as climate protection - and Eurocontrol is probably better suited to doing that than the votes of industry alone, and industry's participation in this area can be ensured by other means.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, air traffic above Europe is gradually beginning to come up against restrictions arising from the large concentration of airports and the need to cope with ever more aeroplanes taking off.
Some of these problems have already been solved by means of the International Civil Aviation Organisation agreement and other legislation adopted at various levels.
The issue of air traffic is solved mainly by means of an international convention on managing medium height air traffic above central Europe, which has yet to enter completely into force.
The SESAR programme should pave the way for significant progress in this matter.
I should like to take this opportunity to raise two questions.
The first concerns the funding of the projects.
I feel that we should be very wary of using private capital, because this is one of the key projects in this area.
It is important, in my view, that the lion's share of the funding should not come from the private sector. Funding should, rather, come from Eurocontrol charges and from the EU budget.
A second question which is certainly important and has long been left unresolved is the definition of the parts of the air fleet to which the new air traffic system will apply.
The question of differentiating between aircraft and ultralights remains.
There is a different classification in force in Europe to that in the United States.
I should therefore recommend that the determining factor be defined in the charter of the joint undertaking as an aircraft standby weight of 600 kg.
I believe that harmonising the definition in this way will be beneficial for future negotiations relating not only to air traffic but also to air transport as a whole.
To conclude, I wish to say that my group firmly supports the SESAR project.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
The problems of air traffic, which is currently growing at a rate of approximately 5% annually, demand a solution that is quick, comprehensive and effective but at the same time caters for the long-term perspective.
If the necessary steps are not taken immediately, Europe's airspace will soon be in gridlock.
It is therefore good that we are implementing the joint undertaking SESAR, which will serve aviation management and safe operation of European airports.
I am pleased by the news that the measures will improve the punctuality of connections and air safety, as well as having a positive effect on the environment.
This undertaking should provide jobs for many highly-qualified people.
The cofinancing of this project by the European Union and the private sector is a very important issue.
I hope this project is approved, as it deserves implementation.
It should, however, stimulate compatible solutions in other parts of the world.
We should also continue to search for radically innovative solutions, for example, airborne air hubs.
Mr President, Commissioner, the SESAR is a very good idea, but you will, however, need to tell us directly something that not even you know: what will its scope be?
