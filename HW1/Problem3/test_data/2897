I took some persuading that a directive such as this was necessary at all.
I finally accept that, for example, in relation to oil-soluble vitamins there is a case to be made in terms of safety.
But having scoured medical literature and asked colleagues to point out to me the scientific and medical evidence, I cannot find examples of people who have overdosed or killed themselves with vitamin C and various others.
Commissioner, as one of the busiest commissioners it is a matter of some fascination to me that this particular directive should come out of the pile, given the workload you have.
I cannot understand the priority it has been given, but I accept that there is a general need to have harmonisation at upper safe levels.
Basically we must be driven by informed consumer choice and safety.
We must assume that the intelligence quotient of the average European citizen is reasonable.
We must desist from getting into the 'nanny state' frame of mind.
Dare I suggest that the next directive - seeing as you are in this mode at the moment, Commissioner - should be a directive on bedtime.
When we get up in the morning can we go to bed at night?
There seems to be a need to direct our lives, to minimise risks and to tell us what to do.
Please do not take me seriously but I really am frustrated with the way we are headed.
Points made in relation to the physiological effects must be reinstated.
I appeal through the President to my colleague to look at this again.
I am quite upset at the way the oral amendment was bounced.
I do not want to be told that I cannot take fibre, garlic, cranberry juice or folic acid, if I happen to be pregnant.
I do not want my life regulated to that extent.
It brings the Commission and the European project into disrepute with citizens who are otherwise not Eurosceptic at all.
I appeal to you to get the balance right.
It is most important.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to join in congratulating the rapporteur, who I think has done an excellent job, and the rest of the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have also worked hard.
One of the objectives of this directive is to harmonise, and the directive has been drawn up - the Commission says so - to eliminate barriers to internal trade.
But it does not fully harmonise, as there may be differences between the Member States in the way that they deal with the declarations on the products.
Ladies and gentlemen, the internal market does not work.
At the end of 2000 the number of violation proceedings initiated by the Commission associated with this problem was 27.
According to the Commission, this diversity of regulations has created barriers to Community trade, and the principle of mutual recognition has not solved the problems.
Harmonisation is therefore necessary.
I am going to refer specifically to Amendment No 51, which is tabled by a group of us who have a series of problems, as the situation of lack of definition that the legislation of eight Member States is currently in could result in the production and sale of these food supplements, which are not included in this directive, being banned, once it is transposed.
Meanwhile, the national legislation of the other Member States that regulate these food supplements would allow them to be produced and, as a result of the rules of the internal market, to be sold across the European Union.
Commissioner, this is not harmonisation.
We need to allow the production and sale of such substances in the countries where there is no national legislation, as long as their composition is identical to the substances that are already sold in one or various Member States, while Community rules, through its scientific committees, extend the scope of application of this directive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Two or three-wheel motor vehicles
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2001) by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/24/EC on certain components and characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles [COM(2000) 314 - C5-0334/2000 - 2000/0136(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, motorised two and three-wheel vehicles, that is motorcycles and scooters, are mainly used in two areas. Firstly, to respond to the need for mobility in urban areas and, secondly, for leisure purposes, particularly in sensitive areas of countryside with many attractive bends.
In both areas, and I say this as a motorcycle enthusiast, the drivers of these vehicles have a special responsibility, because two-wheel vehicles should not have a greater impact on urban areas or sensitive areas of the countryside than motor cars have.
It is therefore both legitimate and essential for us to ensure that motorised two and three-wheel vehicles should have the same level of emissions as motor cars.
The European Parliament has set a very successful example through its input into legislation reducing emissions from motor cars, with the introduction of EURO III and IV, and also emissions from both light and heavy commercial vehicles, with a view to improving air quality in Europe's cities and sensitive environmental areas.
We cannot therefore make an exception for motorcycles and scooters.
Hence this proposal that there should also be a two-stage approach for motorcycles and scooters, with the first reduction stage being introduced in 2003 and a second reduction stage, and this is the important thing, coming into force in 2006.
Industry naturally needs time to develop new engines and new exhaust emissions cleaning systems.
We must give industry this time, and that is why the second stage in 2006 is important.
The Commission's proposal for 2003 is essentially the current state of the art - vehicles complying with these limit values are generally speaking already on our roads.
There is already a list of registrations which indicates that over 80 vehicles already comply with the 2003 values.
We do not want to tinker about with that - what we want is a second binding stage for 2006, applying the EURO III 2000 motor car levels to motorised two-wheel vehicles.
However, we want to see one thing start in 2003 that already applies to cars and to light and heavy commercial vehicles. I have in mind concentration on the sustainability of emissions-related parts.
Of course, it does not make much sense if a two-wheel vehicle achieves marvellous emission limit values on the test bench if in practice, after just a few thousand kilometres, these limit values are history.
That is why we want to see a start made on sustainability for motorised two-wheel vehicles in 2003 and why we also want to create a situation whereby if there is a serious suspicion that particular models are not complying with emission limit values on a long-term basis, the authorities are empowered to check this using in-service surveys to ensure in-use compliance.
I have been told that it is not yet possible to do anything as regards 2006, because we do not yet have a new motorcycle test cycle, and because the test cycle needs to be revised before we can do anything.
I do not agree with that.
As with heavy commercial vehicles, we have said that it would be good if we had a worldwide cycle, but we want to stick to our objective.
That objective is that by 2006 we should achieve a level corresponding to the motor car level for 2000, allowing a little more time for motorcycles, but they must reach that level by then.
If there is no other test cycle by then, we will just have to use the same cycle that applies to cars.
Mr Goodwill and I have built in a slightly longer lead time for certain smaller manufacturers who would have particular problems in converting their production lines. I think that is appropriate and does not affect the overall result.
I believe that that if we accept the proposals of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and enter into the conciliation procedure with the Council, motorcycle riders will in future be able to exercise both their responsibility and their freedom, and that should be our common objective.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Climate Summit held recently in The Hague dealt with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, to notoriously meagre effect.
This forces us to confront the seriousness of the situation that the motorised transport sector is currently facing.
Transport accounts for a huge proportion of CO2 and NOx emissions, road transport being the worst culprit.
It is true that two and three-wheel motor vehicles only constitute a very small percentage of total road traffic volume.
It is therefore all the more striking that their contribution to emissions is relatively high.
According to the forecasts of the Auto Oil Programme II, unless there is a change in policy, this proportion will only increase.
The current generation of two and three-wheel vehicles still satisfies the requirements placed on other older vehicles.
However, these categories are regularly confronted with more stringent emission standards.
In order to allow two and three-wheel vehicles to perform to optimum effect, it is desirable to adapt emission standards on a continuous basis.
Therefore, I personally am content with the line proposed by the rapporteur.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I am pleased that the rapporteur has advocated a longer period, although not as long as our committee would have liked, for the smaller manufacturers of two and three-wheel vehicles.
Mr President, all in all I am delighted with Mr Lange' s report.
The implementation thereof should mean a step in the direction of a sustainable transport system, and, of course, that is what Parliament wants.
Mr President, this amendment to the directive is part of the process of tidying up the loose ends not covered by the Auto/Oil Programme.
I cannot wait for the other directives coming along on small pleasure craft and the small spark ignition engine which will complete the story.
Motorcycles constitute a very small percentage of traffic volume.
Advances in engine technology for cars and trucks coupled with a 6% rise in motorcycle mileage in the 1990s have meant that the proportion of pollution from bikes is increasing.
I therefore welcome this proposal but with certain reservations.
My major concern is the short time between 2003 when the new standards will apply to new models and the date when that is extended to all new motorcycles.
This will put tremendous pressure on the smaller European manufacturers, like Triumph and CCM in the United Kingdom.
Although these modifications are technically feasible, small companies do not have the resources to do the work in only 12 months and the development costs would have to be recovered from a smaller volume of vehicles.
This would put European manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage as compared with the big boys from the Far East.
I am pleased, therefore, that the rapporteur has recognised this by extending this transition phase to two years.
I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur by leading by example by converting his own classic Harley Davidson motorcycle with a retro-fitted catalytic converter.
It is not a case of saying one thing and doing another from that side of the House.
I have some reservations regarding on-board diagnostics and in-service testing.
Regarding on-board diagnostics, a motorcycle is often the first vehicle that a young person buys with limited resources and therefore this will make the vehicle more expensive.
Secondly, I am rather cynical about what the owner of the bike will do when that little green light comes on saying that the exhaust system is not performing to standard.
I suspect he may be tempted just to take the bulb out.
Maybe at this stage of the game we should keep these two balls in play and see how the game progresses towards second reading and possible conciliation.
Lastly, on the subject of fiscal measures.
Whilst I support market solutions like tax incentives, these should be applied by Member States according to national criteria if they so wish.
This proposal is to be made under Article 95, that is to say qualified majority voting, and despite the 28 vetoes given up by Tony Blair at Nice, the UK has not yet given up its right to determine its own taxes, and therefore this should not be within the scope of this directive.
Subsidiarity is something that should be protected.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive upon which we are about to vote is a substantial step forward in the Union's intention to pursue ambitious goals in the field of the restriction of air pollution.
We are currently in a paradoxical situation: although motorcycles represent only 2-3 % of the total volume of transport, motorcycle emissions account for an increasingly high proportion of the total emissions.
The amendments tabled by Mr Lange, like almost all those adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, enhance the Commission's proposal.
In particular, the insistence on the development of Europe-wide test cycles specifically for motor vehicles, but also the call to make type approval subject to confirmation of the effectiveness of the anti-pollution measures are indications of the European Parliament's will to take firm action in such a sensitive area as this.
In this regard, it would appear important to stress that the majority of these objectives are widely endorsed by the sector's businesses.
This means both that Mr Lange's negotiations with them have been successful and that awareness is growing among producers too of the need to contribute to improving our environmental conditions.
Therefore, the decision to fix, as of now, not only the date for revising the initial limits set - 2006 - but also the limits for the second stage, is an indication of Parliament's decision to apply continual pressure to industry to make progress.
Moreover, the introduction of the opportunity to revise these limits in line with the hoped-for technological developments is evidence of the will to continue the dialogue with manufacturers in the future as well.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lange for producing another excellent report on an important issue, that of atmospheric pollution and ozone smog.
Several hundred thousand motor cycles cause just as much atmospheric pollution in my country, the Netherlands, as all the six and a half million cars put together.
We cannot have a situation where new cars have to become exceptionally clean in 2005, but motor cycles get off scot-free.
Nor is it acceptable that new lorries produced after 2007 will become exceptionally clean, whilst motor cycles remain unaffected.
So I hope that when it comes to tomorrow' s vote, all delegates will vote in favour of equipping new motor cycles with a catalytic converter in 2006.
Finally, I have a question for the Commission.
I believe it is now high time we abolished the exemption for diesel motors, i.e. for trains from 1978.
Trains too, must, and could, be far cleaner.
I hope the Commission is prepared to respond on this point.
Mr President, Commissioner, the high number of motorcycles on the roads and in the cities of the European Union is a clear reality, particularly in the Mediterranean Member States, which enjoy good weather throughout the year.
Mr Lange' s report, whose environmental concern our group shares, constantly compares 2- and 3-wheel vehicles with 4-wheel vehicles. However, their ease of use, the fluidity that they give to traffic in cities, their simplicity for parking and the low cost of purchasing and maintaining them should be more than sufficient reason for the necessary anti-pollution measures not to decrease their use.
The European industry needs more time to apply the proposed measures. I therefore ask that the Commission, in cooperation with the manufacturers, evaluate the applicability and the cost-efficiency relationship of these measures and essentially of the periods proposed, as we run the risk of indirectly favouring the large companies in the sector, which are precisely not the European ones.
We need tax incentives to facilitate the sale and use of less-polluting vehicles that are easy to use, improve traffic and are more integrated into our cities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, because he has once again spearheaded a very important debate here.
I believe that two and three-wheel motor vehicles are particularly fashionable and in vogue at present and we should therefore make a point of ensuring that they comply with the latest exhaust emission standards.
There has been great progress in research in this field, and it is now up to us to implement this research.
The inventory of emissions drawn up by the Commission demonstrates very clearly the progress that has been made with NOx emissions: up to 80% for four-stroke engines as against a maximum of 70% for two-strokes.
These values really look quite respectable.
That is why I am in favour of staged reductions which, if they are reasonable, will certainly mean great benefits for motorcycle drivers and others using these engines.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the European Parliament, and Mr Lange, for their lively debate on this issue.
The rapporteur recommends the adoption of the Commission' s proposal on limit values to be implemented as from 2003.
The rapporteur, however, is suggesting a second stage for mandatory limit values to apply from 2006.
This stage would be based on a test cycle for passenger cars.
The Commission acknowledges the need for this second stage.
We shall be putting forward a separate proposal for this by the end of 2002.
The forthcoming proposal will be based on additional research into the technical performance and economic viability of equipment that is more advanced with regard to reducing emissions.
In this next stage, emissions will have to be measured in relation to an improved test cycle.
The situation will thus be made to match the real driving dynamics of motorcycles.
The Commission has not included mandatory limits to apply from 2006 in its proposal, as it does not yet have access to the information that would give the right sort of scientifically persuasive support to the introduction of test cycles.
The Commission actively supports the development of a worldwide, harmonised test cycle for motorcycles.
The work was started in 1999, and in May of 2000 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe extended an official mandate for this, having the support of the Member States of the EU, Japan and the United States.
The work programme is progressing according to schedule.
For that reason, we believe that the new cycle will be introduced in sufficient time for it to start being applied in 2006.
This is in line with Mr Lange' s views.
Consequently, the Commission cannot support the amendments proposing that a decision be now made to start the mandatory second stage in 2006.
The relevant amendments are Amendments Nos 3, 5, 10, 11, 23, 24 and 25.
However, the Commission is obviously prepared to take part in formulating a general Interinstitutional Agreement as soon as possible.
The rapporteur mentions several measures to ensure more reliably that emission control equipment functions efficiently throughout a vehicle' s lifetime.
The Commission recognises the importance of these if we want to make sure that there is a genuine reduction in emissions whilst driving.
A motorcycle, however, is a very different product from a car in technical terms.
In applying requirements for motorcycles attention has to be paid to the consequences, meaning there has to be a careful appraisal made of technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness.
I might reply to the question put by Mr de Roo regarding rail transport that the matter is also being looked into but no proposal has yet been made.
The Commission in principle accepts the amendments in which the Commission is urged to examine the points of view mentioned earlier.
However, we reject the amendments which propose dates for the mandatory application of requirements, or provisions that take no account of the final results of research.
This is a reference to Amendments Nos 6, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 22.
The Commission adopts the same position with regard to Amendments Nos 8 and 17, dealing with carbon dioxide emissions from motorcycles.
The report contains several amendments the Commission would be able to support, such as Amendments Nos 4 and 12, if Member States were given the opportunity to encourage the retrofitting of emission control equipment and parts in older motor vehicles.
The same holds true for Amendment No 1 and the latter part of Amendment No 9, in which it is proposed that a year-long exemption be granted for the special class of trial motorcycles, and the first part of Amendment No 9, which recommends application to present models to start, not from January, but from July, 2004.
The Commission nevertheless rejects Amendment No 26, which would delay application to present models by a whole year.
In principle, the Commission also supports Amendments Nos 7 and 16 on requirements for defeat devices and by-pass arrangements, and believes it is able to include such requirements in its current proposal.
The Commission can thus accept Amendments Nos 4, 9, 12 and 18, and, in principle, Amendments Nos 2, 7, 8, 16 and 21, and, in part, Amendments Nos 1, 4, 19, 20 and 22.
The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 23, 24, 25 or 26.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Vehicles with more than eight seats
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0039/2001) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and the Council relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of persons comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC [9012/1/2000 - C5-0456/2000 - 1997/0176(COD)].
Mr President, earlier today we heard in the context of the copyright and GMO legislation how it has taken three years for Parliament to reach the point of being in a position to approve it.
Can I say that this report has been under negotiation for nine years and it is only now coming to fruition.
Since I took over the rapporteurship of this report I have tried to involve all the interested parties from the manufacturing side right through to the user side.
On the manufacturing side, I have had several meetings with the European constructors' association as well as individual bus companies.
All of these organisations are happy with the common position and the amendments.
In fact, they welcome the clarification it brings to the market.
I have listened to the users carefully and I have consulted widely.
It is only after these consultations that I have put forward the amendments that you have in front of you tonight.
I would also pay tribute to the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me closely throughout the compiling of this report.
Unfortunately not all of them were able to persuade their groups to follow the line.
Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 are specific detailed technical amendments designed to assist the manufacturers and relate to gangway slopes of 12.5% on existing class I and II buses.
These amendments have to be taken in conjunction with Amendment No 7.
In Amendment No 6 I am seeking to replace that with Amendment No 10 which refers to the ISO standard and not to separate Member State standards which I had initially put in Amendment No 6.
Amendment No 4 sets out in more detail the user groups that this report is trying to assist.
This list is, however, neither exhaustive nor prescriptive.
It was never intended to be and leaves plenty of scope for the inclusion of others.
Amendment No 8 opens up access to public transport to all those groups referred to in the aforementioned Amendment No 4.
For the first time, we are making public transport accessible to all those people with reduced mobility.
This will be done by providing a kneeling system with either a lift or ramp but it also takes into account infrastructure improvements which have been carried out as well.
Maybe I should declare an interest at this point.
Just before Christmas my mother unexpectedly lost her sight.
As a son I obviously wish to help her, as I wish to help all visually impaired people within the European Union.
It is what I was elected to do and I am sure it is what the vast majority of people in this Parliament were elected to do.
These citizens are important users of public transport and they depend on us in the European Parliament to get it right.
We have that chance tomorrow by voting for those amendments.
I must, however, also mention Amendment No 9 which was submitted later by the PPE-DE Group.
When this came up at the Legal Affairs Committee it went through unanimously but then, all of a sudden, we heard that the PPE-DE Group wishes to reject the common position.
I am sorry and disappointed that their amendment rejects the common position. That would set back accessibility for those citizens I mentioned earlier by several years.
I understand that one of the reasons that they are proposing rejection of the common position is because it will shackle the industry.
It will tie up the industry in red tape. Can I ask those in the PPE-DE who are intending to speak on this how they would feel if they were shackled to a wheelchair or to sticks or to having to have a guide dog?
That is shackling, not what we are trying to do with the industry.
I would be ashamed if their Amendment No 9 is carried.
I would be ashamed for every Member of this Parliament who puts their hand up or presses a button to vote for that amendment.
I therefore urge you to vote against Amendment No 9 but support the other amendments.
Mr President, it has been, as always, a pleasure to work with my friend Bill Miller on these technical directives and I believe that we will have made a significant improvement to this directive if it is approved.
So I will not go through the amendments.
He has done a good job on that.
I just want to address the question of why we on this side have chosen to propose a motion of rejection.
It relates to the whole issue of whether Parliament should be handling technical directives.
I recall that in a speech not long ago in this Parliament Commissioner Liikanen talked about some of the problems he is facing on potential pedestrian protection legislation for cars.
He presented us with at least 60 pages of complex technical mathematical calculations and he challenged us: is this the sort of thing this Parliament should be considering?
This directive is 150 pages long and it has it own share of technical calculations, graphs, charts and other detailed technical provisions.
The same arguments apply.
I want to pick up on a point made by Bill Miller.
He is right to challenge us on the question about disabled access, but he said and I quote him, "It will make public transport accessible to all users".
Regrettably that is not the case.
If it were, we would support it.
This piece of paper includes provision to make buses more accessible for disabled users, but it does not address the whole question of operating regulations for public transport systems across the European Union.
The issues which our colleague Mr Howitt quite rightly says we should be putting in here: changing the infrastructure to make buses more accessible for disabled users.
What have we actually achieved after nine years?
Do we really have mutual recognition of technical standards between countries?
Have we really achieved the sort of significant advances in safety that we want?
I had a look through these 150 pages. I may be wrong - Commissioner, you may be able to tell me this - but I could not find in here any provision for mandatory fitting of seat belts.
Why is that not in here if we are serious about the Council saying to us in this document that it has come up with a practicable solution with a high level of safety and user-friendliness.
If we really had achieved that, then we should be proud of it.
There are provisions, certainly, for things like strength of superstructure but the worrying thing here - and I ask the Commissioner to address this - is that this is not all.
At the end there is a list of things that the Commission and Council want to bring back to us.
It does not address school buses. It does not address the latest developing technology of buses.
There are going to be new provisions for superstructures.
When is all this going to end?
When are we going have realistic and sensible measures and the sort of technical committee structure that this Parliament asked you to introduce at first reading in 1997 and which is simply dismissed here?
I quote in conclusion: "The Commission was unable to support the approach and in consequence did not amend its original proposal."
Not a single word of explanation.
That is why my group will be recommending that this is rejected tomorrow.
Mr President, there is much in the text to promote access to buses by disabled people - passenger handrails, non-slip surfaces, standards for wheelchairs and a wide definition of reduced mobility to include all disabled people.
However, the key to tonight's debate is Amendment No 8: a guarantee of level access to all new buses in urban areas for persons with reduced mobility.
To achieve this requires a boarding aid, a lift or a ramp, because a low-floor bus on its own is not enough.
Our failure to agree this crucial part of the text would leave disabled people quite literally falling through the crack, a crack for which we would ourselves be responsible.
The rapporteur - to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks - has forged a compromise which seeks to share responsibility for access between bus manufacturers, operators, local planning and transport authorities.
But as we negotiate the final outcome I say to Parliament and the Commission that even a raised kerb at every bus stop can never be the full access solution.
Bad parking or obstacles on the pavement can still prevent boarding, whilst a simple manual swing-over ramp, built into the floor of each new bus, is cheap and will work time after time.
Yet nine years after this directive was first discussed, when the disability movement for a generation has put accessible public transport at the heart of its demands, those on the opposite side of the House threaten to vote, not simply against the amendment, but to destroy the whole directive.
Do they do so on grounds of cost?
No.
The study of accessible buses commissioned by my own government shows low operating costs outweighing the marginal extra capital costs, while a 14% increase in passengers brought in extra revenue.
Do they do so because of objections from manufacturers?
No.
A check today, again in my own Member State, shows that British bus manufacturers and British bus operators are unanimous in their view that they want the directive to go through.
Do they do so because of a genuine difficulty at all? No.
Because the parliamentary committee that scrutinised these proposals in detail voted for them unanimously.
Mr President, my only conclusion, as we have heard tonight, is that those who oppose do so because they share the prejudice that disability access is an unnecessary technical detail.
They are wrong.
For a disabled person it means the freedom to travel or the restriction to stay at home.
Tonight we have the chance to grant that freedom to vote for accessible public transport.
We must and we will.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us today the standard European bus directive, on which we adopted a position at first reading. The rapporteur then was Mr Murphy.
Murphy's Law is of course famous, but I have to say that Mr Murphy did a first-rate job, because he recognised that this directive involves implementing a number of important political principles, namely access for the elderly, children and the disabled.
We are fully in agreement with that.
We need to do something for those groups: buses and public transport must be accessible to them and we want to put all our combined energies into achieving that objective.
So why are we rejecting this directive?
Because at first reading the Commission brought forward a proposal comprising over 100 pages of detailed regulations, and during the first reading debate all the groups agreed to reject the directive for reasons of principle.
Now the Commission and the Council have come back with their common position, which is not 100 pages long, but 150 pages.
At first reading we said that we could imagine at most three pages covering the key political principles. This directive contains some really choice passages of a kind you very rarely find.
For example, on page 17 we have Figure 17, which is about permissible configurations for rear corner seats, and shows a plan view of the prescribed seat area, with both rear corner seats, in relation to Annex I Section 7.7.8.6.3.4, and as with aircraft design a maximum radius of 150 mm is prescribed.
I know that we in the European Union have set the radius of curvature for bananas and cucumbers and goodness knows what else, but I find it hard to imagine that we now need to set a radius of curvature for the standard European bus.
The directive also contains a formula that must even be hard for engineers to understand.
I have to say that this document is not a suitable basis for political decision making.
So the position is that designers, bus purchasers, consumer protection organisations and also disabled persons' organisations are in agreement with this directive, but are all very unhappy.
They all say that we want to achieve the objective of using disabled-accessible buses in Europe.
We in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats want a new approach here, which quite simply means limiting ourselves to key policy aspects.
First of all, that means standards for access for the elderly, for children and for disabled persons.
This is extremely important and needs to be guaranteed.
Secondly, we want safety standards for drivers and passengers.
Thirdly, we want the principle of mutual recognition.
The reason this principle of mutual recognition is so important is that a bus obviously needs to be different if it operates in a small poor village in Sicily, where it is very hot, as compared with a bus which has to cope with London's rush hour, with millions of passengers and where quite different demands are made of the bus.
A bus operating in northern Finland, in conditions of extreme cold and covering great distances would again have to be very different.
That is why the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is calling for the rejection of the common position and is requesting a vote.
We believe that it is important for us not to make everything in Europe the same. The European public is also opposed to this desire towards sameness.
We wish to see mutual recognition.
I have confidence in British, French and German buses, and that is how things should remain.
Mr President, at first reading of this directive, Parliament indicated very clearly to the Council and the Commission that it wished to replace the detailed legislation with general guidelines and to allow a technical committee to prescribe the detailed specifications.
However, the Council' s common position rides roughshod over Parliament.
The Council has not in any way taken account of Parliament' s firm repudiation of detailed legislation.
The report is about more than just buses.
It is about the way in which the EU is to legislate.
I am not of course opposed to making sure that people with disabilities can use European buses.
What I am opposed to is the mode of procedure.
I find it quite unreasonable that, as a politician, I should have to take decisions about how many millimetres bus door handles and luggage racks should measure.
In my own country, the EU is often made into a laughing-stock for meddling and for regulating in too much detail.
People quite rightly question an EU that is in many ways unwieldy and bent on regulating.
MEPs' credibility is brought into question if we take decisions about things we do not know anything about.
An example is Annex V of the Council' s common position.
I am not ashamed to say that I do not understand the formula according to which the closing power of automatic doors is to be calculated.
I do not want to contribute to making ourselves and the EU into laughing-stocks.
Despite the fact that I was not involved in the first reading in 1988, I would remind this Parliament that it voted 485 to 1 in favour of the general guidelines rather than the detailed legislation.
Why should Parliament change its mind now?
For the Swedish Conservative Party, this was an important issue in the 1999 elections.
I was elected on a mandate to combat politicians' inability to leave things alone.
I cannot therefore vote in favour of the Council' s common position.
I would therefore call upon the whole Parliament to vote in favour of Amendment No 9, tabled by my colleague Mr Lehne and rejecting the Council' s common position.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Miller, as well as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whose work has enabled this case to be brought to a successful conclusion.
As you no doubt recall, this proposal for a directive on the construction of buses and coaches gave rise to lengthy and involved debates at first reading.
This draft has been before us for three years already.
We have come a long way since then.
A consensus has been reached between the Council, Parliament and Commission.
As well as the institutions, the various parties involved such as bus and coach manufacturers, public transport operators and user groups, including those which represent passengers with reduced mobility, have also arrived at a consensus.
That is why we welcome the work of the rapporteur, who succeeded in bringing together some often divergent interests.
It is now possible for the proposal to be adopted quickly, which will allow the safety of buses and their passengers to be improved.
The Commission can accept the eight amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, either in full or in principle.
Amendments Nos 1, 7 and 8 are acceptable as they stand.
Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 5, which relate to the permissible slope of the bus' s floor area, are acceptable in principle, but may, of course, be reviewed at the drafting stage.
Amendment No 4, which gives a list of people with reduced mobility, will most probably be challenged by Member States, as it introduces the risk of excluding some categories of users.
Would it not be better retain the general definition, which is, for that very reason, more comprehensive?
Finally, Amendment No 6, which seeks to change the figure of the wheelchair, is acceptable in principle, but not in the form proposed in the report.
The reference to an ISO standard or to an authorised diagram, as the rapporteur proposes in Amendment No 10, would be preferable, bearing in mind, however, that we must ensure that size, shape and weight of the wheelchair, together with its occupant, are compatible with the physical characteristics of access areas.
On the other hand, the Commission does not wish to repeat the debate held at first reading on the regulatory approach to vehicles.
We do not, therefore, endorse the idea of challenging the timeliness of a directive, by which I am referring to Amendment No 9.
To sum up, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 in principle and can accept Amendments Nos 1, 7 and 8.
I want to reply to Mr Harbour on this question of principle.
Since Lisbon, when we discussed new proposals, we must consider alternatives.
For instance, we are talking about disabilities at the moment.
I have had a lot of discussion about design standards for the disabled in the information society to try to find ways to make all the tools for the information society available for people with different kinds of disabilities.
We should try to analyse when a new approach directive can be used vis-Ã -vis old approach directives.
We must see what type of regulatory reforms we can have which serve this purpose in an easier way.
I do not want to have this debate now because we have opened it for the future proposal.
This has progressed so far that the Commission proposes to accept it in the way I have presented.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community incentive measures in employment
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2001) by Mrs Jensen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment [COM(2000) 459 - C5-0384/2000 - 2000/0195(COD)].
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for cooperating so well on this report.
I think it is to be welcomed that we can muster a broad majority for a proposal that extends Parliament' s earlier decisions.
By means of this proposal, we are establishing the framework for the EU' s employment policy over the next five years.
Employment policy is based, of course, upon what we call open coordination which, most recently at the Lisbon Summit, has been highlighted as a method that may be used within many other areas of policy.
Open coordination means that countries may use different methods of achieving common goals.
And the common goal in this case is higher employment.
What we have here are recommended guidelines for the policies of the Member States.
Countries must report on what they are doing to make the unemployed better able to meet the demands of the labour market.
Encouragement must be given to the spirit of enterprise and to flexibility in the labour market, and countries must work to promote a better relationship between work and family life.
This reporting, carried out by the Member States every year, therefore forms the point of departure for the Commission' s annual report on employment in the EU which, together with the Commission' s analyses and statistics concerning development, forms the basis for the Council' s recommendation to the individual countries.
The process is open.
There is a free choice of policy, and if a country goes down a markedly different path than the one recommended, it can be criticised, but nothing more.
Is the process too informal, then?
A whole lot of reports, meetings and conferences and a whole lot of words, but no certainty that the objectives will be achieved.
On the surface of it, the process is indeed perhaps not formal enough. However, this policy whereby countries measure their efforts against each other and exchange experiences - benchmarking and employment of best practices, to use the modern terminology - means that a broader public gets to see which countries are doing well and which less well.
To a large extent, open coordination works by becoming a subject in the public and national debate about employment policy.
In those countries where youth unemployment is high, the public is bound to ask how it can be that their politicians are not achieving the same good results as politicians in other countries.
Is there anything we can learn from the efforts of other countries?
Transparency, understood as openness to the public, is in actual fact a very important agent in this process.
We therefore want to see more focus upon providing information to the public at large and upon involving the parties in the labour market, together with local and regional authorities, to a much greater extent than is contemplated in the Commission' s proposal.
Article 129 provides, of course, for the possibility of introducing pilot projects.
We want an exchange of information about the ways and means of involvement at local level.
This could be a pilot project.
There is no question of our having new projects which mimic practices with which the Social Fund has familiarised us.
It is about developing analyses, knowledge and information about the whys and wherefores of local and regional involvement in employment policy.
By means of its communication concerning the role of local and regional authorities, the Commission has already made a start upon work of this kind.
In this year' s Budget, Parliament too has introduced a new budget line for preparative initiatives to promote local participation in employment policy.
We have done this precisely to promote a broader knowledge of European employment strategy.
By including in this proposal the role of local and regional authorities in employment policy, we ensure that there is a legal basis for this initiative.
When, in this way, we ask the Commission to do more work than is contemplated in the Commission' s own proposal, then appropriations must of course follow, and my report therefore proposes an increase in appropriations to EUR 65 million in contrast to the Commission' s proposal of EUR 55 million.
To put it briefly, the open coordination method must be open in two senses.
It must be open in the sense that countries retain the freedom to organise their own policies and that there must be a number of ways to achieve the same objectives.
However, it must also be open in the sense that the general public is involved far more than it is at present.
The policy on employment, or Luxembourg process, is to be commended, but why does it have to be a matter of such secrecy?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning President Prodi reported that over a million new jobs were created in Europe last year, and that two-thirds of these were for women.
This demonstrates that employment programmes and work in this area can have very positive effects.
I also believe that the method adopted by the Commission is the right one, that is a combination of benchmarking and promoting best practice with a view to making Europe the world leader in the knowledge-based society.
The Commission has also applied its funding very carefully.
Expenditure was only 50% of commitments.
So a great deal has been achieved with very limited means, which is particularly commendable.
And perhaps it will also be possible to trim administrative expenditure further in future.
The potential is certainly there.
On the other hand, we should do everything in our power to improve and extend this programme in future.
The relevant committee has made appropriate proposals to this effect, and the European Parliament would be proud if the positive achievements of the past year could be carried forward.
In the field of information technology alone - the information society - we will be unable to fill around a million jobs by 2004 because of inadequate training.
I believe that it is a great challenge for us to create new, interesting and good jobs in this area and also in the field of biotechnology, where we need research to solve the problems associated with BSE. In short, we specifically need to invest in these new areas.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission proposal has the basic objective of encouraging cooperation between the Member States in terms of analysis, research and monitoring of employment policy, determining best practices and promoting the exchange and transfer of information and experiences.
Thus, based on the need to support and develop the European Employment Strategy, the Commission is proposing a series of measures, which include analysis, research and cooperation between Member States on employment, which will be very helpful for achieving the new strategic objective established in Lisbon, which is to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion.
We therefore fully support the Commission proposal, although I feel that it could be improved on some points which, broadly speaking, are as follows: firstly, and with regard to the planned Community measures, one of them supports a more strategic approach to employment in the Union, through analysis and evaluation of the factors that explain employment tendencies, the general political framework, etc. On this point the Commission proposal does not envisage that the analysis and evaluation will be conducted in a specific way, for men and for women, something that I consider to be essential if we take into account that unemployment in Europe is largely among women.
It is not excessive to say that, if employment among women were not taken into account, in some regions of the Union there would even be full employment.
With this in mind, and given that employment incentive measures must be one of the key tools for developing equal opportunities, we need to consider what women' s employment needs are.
We therefore need to consider which are the studies aimed at offering more childcare and social assistance in the home.
In this respect, we need to ensure that there is sufficient supply of quality services, particularly when dealing with dependants, which in the majority of cases are the responsibility of women.
We therefore need to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market and encourage them to remain in it, with an equal distribution of family responsibilities between men and women.
We need to take into account the reinsertion of women and, without any doubt, differentiating between the studies by sex would help us to understand the problems that this raises.
Mr President, this evening, we have returned to the European Parliament, at 11.40 p.m., to discuss the document on the Community incentive measures in employment, an extremely important document which calls not only for our presence here but also for that of Commissioner Diamantopoulou, who is thus demonstrating a certain concern for employment issues.
Moreover, since 14 February, Valentine's Day is only a quarter of an hour away, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all lovers: I hope that there are some in this rough, tough, severe Parliament as well.
With regard to the document under consideration, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party calling for the scope of the directive to include an analysis of policy developments from the viewpoints of certain categories of people such as the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable groups.
Mr President, this programme appropriates EUR 55 million over five years, chiefly to statistics and the drawing up of documentation on the employment strategy; we are talking mainly about aid to the Member States to achieve the above statistics.
A small proportion of the amount, which I feel should be increased, is for pilot projects intended to identify new forms of employment and work.
In my opinion, these should certainly include - as Commissioner Diamantopoulou said in her first speech - the new activity of caring for the ever-increasing number of elderly and disabled people carried out by young workers who are able to find work in this field and, at the same time, make life easier for the elderly.
I have already tabled this amendment in committee, Mr President, but I am afraid that the left-wing section of Parliament, the socialists that is, rejected it.
I am tabling it again in the Chamber in the hope that, this time, the request for the scope of the directive to be extended to include this activity as well will be accepted by that section of Parliament which professes always to be sensitive to the problems of elderly and disabled people, that is the left side, and that Mrs Jensen's central section will vote for this amendment too.
Tomorrow morning, I shall request a vote by name on this amendment, although I am sure that this will not be necessary and that it will be accepted unanimously.
I truly hope that Europe will concern itself, at last, with elderly and disabled people in the field of employment.
Mr President, first of all I want to say to the previous speaker, Mr Fatuzzo, that I am sorry that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are unable to support his amendments, for they simply do not fit into this context. Back to the report, however.
First of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur.
There is reason for doing so, for this is Mrs Jensen' s first report, and it is also a very good piece of work she has done.
As we all know, the report was, of course, adopted by a very large majority of the committee.
That is gratifying, for this is a very important piece of work.
This decision must ensure that the employment policy we talk so much about is not just a matter of fine words, but that these are in actual fact backed by vigorous action.
Nor must there be any doubt that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support open coordination whenever this is the most effective tool for achieving the desired objectives.
Employment policy is so important because it is the test run for the open coordination method, and it is of the very greatest importance to show that this method is being taken seriously and is producing the desired results.
Employment policy will simply be a model for many of the other areas - which are already part of the ambitious plan adopted in Lisbon last spring - in which we should also like to use the open coordination method.
And in the next few weeks, when Heads of State and Government take the Commission' s telling-off seriously and give some impetus to the many outstanding initiatives in the wake of the Lisbon Summit, we shall hopefully also have it confirmed that the open coordination method can be used.
The incentive measures must support employment policy, and that is why the incentive measures are important.
I am therefore very pleased that we in the committees were able to reach agreement on a series of amendments and improvements to the Commission' s proposal.
These amendments relate to five different points.
First of all, information must be provided about employment policy.
Secondly, the parties in the labour market, together with the relevant local and regional authorities, must be involved.
Thirdly, the focus must be placed upon equal opportunities for men and women, in which connection I should like to thank the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Fourthly, an assessment and revision of the open coordination method must be set in motion. And fifthly, the programme must be extended to include pilot projects as well.
What, in other words, we are concerned with here is a quite extensive alteration to the incentive measures which, in a way, were good enough originally.
In this way, we have extended their area of application, and I therefore also hope that, together, we can increase the financial resources we have for implementing the measures so that it will not in any case be possible to accuse Parliament of only producing fine words and not backing them up with genuine action.
I hope that the Commission and the Council are ready to demonstrate the same drive that we have tried to demonstrate here in Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals.
Despite Mrs Jensen's fine work, I feel that this report is not of great significance.
I know that there is effectively a need to do what the Commission, through its proposal, and the Treaties themselves call for, namely to combine best practices with all speed, to promote innovative processes and approaches and to assess the results.
I do not feel, however, that, in order to do this, there is still a need in the Europe of today to invest EUR 55 million over a small number of years in order to produce more detailed analyses, to attempt to find links between the experiences of the different countries and to promote cooperation - although it is not clear what this means in terms of employment - between the individual countries.
Do we really believe that, in order to carry out benchmarking, today, we need to perform once again yet more studies, to sprinkle euro dust on a thousand small more or less nepotistic channels - some to the trade unions, some to the different business organisations, some to the non-governmental organisations - to finance new studies which will end up, covered in dust, taking up space on the shelves of libraries?
Mr President, I really do not think we need this.
There may be a need to coordinate the recording of statistics or to consolidate and update the Eurostat comparison methods - I can see that - but I do not feel that we need to be spending money on further studies and analyses, on information exchange, on pilot projects which, when all is said and done, artificially create jobs subsidised by European, State or local public finances and will continue to do so in the future, but which will serve no practical purpose.
We waste time, we confuse the European unemployed, but we do not carry out those reforms which are truly necessary and with which we are all familiar.
A few minutes ago, in this Chamber, we were talking about groups of people who are disadvantaged in terms of employment.
In my country, Italy, thanks to a few reforms - extremely minor reforms opposed by the trade unions - liberalising the labour market, we created hundreds of thousands of new jobs last year, mainly in the disadvantaged areas of the South, for women and young people, but we did this through structural measures, which is what is needed, and not, I regret to say, thanks to new, enormously expensive studies.
Mr President, I disagree with the previous speaker so first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, on this comprehensive report.
Indeed, there is much that we can support in this report, in particular the emphasis given to the proposed Community-level/local-level mixed approach to employment policy.
In the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities we emphasise that the analysis and evaluation of this action in the field of employment should be carried out on a gender-specific basis, given that women are bearing the brunt of unemployment in Europe.
Commissioner, the Lisbon objectives of bringing up the employment rates for women, a target for 2010 of 60% can already be considered too ambitious.
In the Kingdom of Spain where the employment rate of women is probably the lowest in the European Union, it hardly reaches 30% of the active population.
That is why the Committee on Women's Rights asked for an analysis of the causes of this tremendous gap: part-time working, pregnancy, parental leave, household responsibilities, etc. That is why we, Euskal Herritarok, ask all the Members of this House to back all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights and of course the actual report by Mrs Jensen.
Mr President, after the abortive Nice Summit, we would do well to remember an event that gave the EU a great boost: the Luxembourg Employment Summit.
That summit succeeded in convincing the Member States actively to do more to improve employability and adaptability, to establish a new entrepreneurial spirit and to enhance equal opportunities.
Since then, model measures in the Member States have been a central plank of Europe's employment strategy.
A thorough assessment and evaluation of what these have achieved is to take place: reintegration into working life, activities to promote equality of opportunities, elimination of exclusion, and targeted measures to create a suitable environment for setting up small and medium-sized businesses.
Are we right in our view that European added value can be created if actions in the Member States are interlinked with Community initiatives and with Community education, training and further education programmes?
We want to involve local and regional stakeholders more actively by means of pilot projects and therefore call on the Commission to top up the funding it has proposed.
I believe that a priority here is improved coordination of employment and economic policy, which are, after all, two sides of the same coin.
We now need to have the courage to make more of our potential and not only be consulted when the employment policy guidelines are being drawn up - that is not enough.
As a European Parliament we need to get involved on a more consistent basis in the employment week in Brussels in November, whilst here in Strasbourg we should at long last find time to devote a whole day to a debate on the creation of jobs of the future and the implementation of national action plans.
As part of this, proper attention needs to be paid to the achievements of the social partners and the experiences of employees hit by unemployment and assisted by job creation measures.
Mr President, that would be our contribution towards a good campaign on Europe's employment strategy.
Mr President, a job - work - is the most important means of preventing exclusion.
The European Union is little able to tackle the question of employment directly.
The Luxembourg process, as it is known, with its yearly reports on employment and its approach to best practices and learning by example, is an excellent attempt to reinforce cooperation among Member States and encourage success and transparency.
A big step forward will be the subsequent Luxembourg process, which invests in new technology and uses it to put Europe on the path to growth.
Action to bolster employment must focus too on where best to obtain added value, in other words, education and training, research, the adoption of new technology as a tool of growth and, in particular, as one of sustainable growth.
We shall have equality by attending to the matter of public social services, which also make it possible for women to be fully represented in the labour market.
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, on the timeliness and the quality of her rapport.
One of the Union' s objectives is to promote a high level of employment.
Therefore, within the framework of the Luxembourg process, the Member States have been cooperating in the field of employment policy, and are responsible for selecting specific measures for its implementation.
In fact, it could not be otherwise. More recently, the Lisbon European Council set the Union the strategic objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth generating more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
This report seeks to make a contribution towards meeting this new challenge set in Lisbon, covering equal opportunities for men and women in the field of employment, an important pillar in the European Employment Strategy.
The report aims to foster cooperation between Member States in analysis, research and monitoring of labour market policy, identifying best practices and promoting exchanges and transfers of information and experience. All of this will be flanked by an active information policy, so that Europe' s citizens can easily see what the strategic objectives in the field of employment are.
We must ensure that the social partners and relevant local and regional authorities are involved in this effort, which must be a communal effort.
Furthermore, it is equally crucial that a study should be made of infrastructures that help men and women to gain employment and to remain employed, such as crÃšche places and home help, a point that is made clear in the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
The European Parliament is already a key player within the consultation process in defining the annual employment guidelines and must now also participate in a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of the European Employment Strategy in general.
I wish to say a final word about the allocation of resources for employment incentive measures.
The use of public funds must be dealt with in a balanced and extremely rigorous way.
An increased budgetary appropriation in this domain would therefore appear to be something that is essential and to be welcomed.
It must also be emphasised that the allocation of resources must meet real, specific needs and take account of the implementation of the budget for each heading.
Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mrs Jensen for her report and congratulating her on it.
In the limited time that is available it is important that, as a number of speakers have already touched upon a number of disadvantaged groups or groups who are not doing so well in employment areas, we consider a number of aspects, the three most important ones being: equality of opportunity, equality of access and equality of training.
Equality of opportunity must mean that all jobs, all services that are available, are open to all equally.
Equality of access means that there should be no physical impediment towards people accessing training or employment opportunities.
Equality of education means that people must have the skills that are required for the jobs that are going to be available.
We have moved from a time when there was heavy industrialised and intensive labour areas of industry, to other smaller networks, smaller cooperation.
We need to look more towards giving the skills and training to young people, middle-aged people, elderly people and those living in urban and rural areas to guarantee that they have equality of access to that training and new jobs.
The national action plans on employment, under the Luxembourg process, are very useful to us in ensuring that we use the carrot and stick with the Member States.
We can give extra resources where they are providing good jobs and meeting their targets and we can take them back when they are not doing it.
Mr President, as it is now after midnight, I say to you, Mr President and to you, Commissioner, happy Valentine's day!
This is a very good report.
I say that without surprise as it is by Mrs Jensen, so of course it is a good report.
However, it was a slightly better report before the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs 'improved it' .
Some of the amendments that have come through have not made it a better document.
I refer to just two aspects.
The first aspect - taking my life in my hands - refers to some of the amendments of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
I strongly support women's rights.
I strongly support the rights of young people, of old people, of disabled people and many other minorities.
But only the women have their own committee to speak up for them.
At times, perhaps, their voice drowns out some of the other groups, in my judgment.
I take as an example Article 3.1(1) where the original text said: "To the maximum possible extent analysis will be gender-specific".
I agree with that. It should be gender-specific to the maximum possible extent.
But the Women's Committee has taken out the words "to the maximum possible extent".
Apparently "maximum possible" is not quite maximum enough.
I believe it was fine as it was.
I use that as an example, but I am still supportive of women's rights.
I have my tomato-proof suit on just in case you were thinking of doing something.
The second point concerns the budget.
I believe the Committee on Budgets made a reference to the budget increasing from EUR 50 million to EUR 55 million, but on the basis that this should be proportionate to the implementation.
Last year's budget was EUR 50 million.
Only two-thirds of that was spent; 25% of that was eaten up by administrative costs.
To go up from EUR 55 million to 65 million - which is the latest amendment - is, in my view, disproportionate.
It is a reflection of the enthusiasm of the committee for this particular project.
Sometimes it is all too common that in order to signify the importance of a subject more money is offered to it.
I should like to hope that, increasingly, colleagues could recognise that money is not just a reflection of importance, and that it is possible to vote strongly for a report without increasing the money.
I fear I may have to wait a long time to see that.
Given my advancing years it may be my successors who see that approach first.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Yesterday' s Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I refer to the comments made in this Chamber on Monday afternoon with respect to the anti-nuclear demonstration at the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland.
As you are aware, I took part in that demonstration, and I would like to thank all those Members who expressed support for the action that I took when I participated in the largest-ever blockade of the base and was arrested, ironically enough, for committing a breach of the peace.
I just want to say a word to those Members who implied that my actions were somehow irresponsible or inappropriate.
Firstly, nuclear weapons are not only immoral and inhumane, they are also illegal.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the possession of nuclear weapons is contrary to international law, and this was reaffirmed by a Scottish court in 1999.
My action on Monday was therefore upholding the law, not breaking it.
Secondly, I believe nuclear weapons pose such a threat to all of us that it is legitimate and indeed essential to use all peaceful avenues open to us to try to rid our countries of them.
Of course there are parliamentary channels to use to do that, and I use them, but I also believe it is legitimate and essential to use extra-parliamentary channels as well.
It is our responsibility to use them.
A democratic state is not just a gift and right, it is a responsibility.
If citizens do not responsibly demonstrate against the operation of inhumane acts by their governments, the governments become increasingly irresponsive and corrupt.
Finally, it is the right and duty of every citizen, elected or not, to use all peaceful avenues to try to uphold international law.
My action on Monday was one further small step in trying to achieve that.
Mr President, in welcoming my brave and gallant colleague, Mrs Lucas, back to the House, I would like to draw to my colleagues' attention that today we will also be visited by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; who will be received by the President this evening.
In that connection I would like to repeat Mrs Lucas' point that it was implied in this House on Monday that only irresponsible hotheads took part in the protest at Faslane.
I ask Members to note that the leader of the Scottish national church, whom we will welcome here tonight, also took a leading part in that protest.
Leading an ecumenical service, he drew attention to the Church's principled rejection of states' reliance on weapons of mass destruction.
Profound opposition to nuclear weapons on both legal and moral grounds is a common position among responsible leaders of opinion, both religious and non-religious, throughout Scotland and throughout this great Union.
Mr President, to pick up on the points that Mrs Lucas has raised, I support the sentiments which she has outlined.
However, I would ask if she could prevail upon her colleagues to desist from claiming some sort of parliamentary immunity every time she gets arrested at Faslane.
Long before Mrs Lucas became involved, I had been involved in Faslane for many years and have been arrested there.
I have never once called for parliamentary immunity.
I had my day in court and I had my trial.
I will not go down the road to parliamentary immunity because I want my day in court and I want to make my point and not hide behind some smokescreen.
Mr President, can I just establish for yesterday's Minutes a correction to my vote.
I intended to vote yes on the RÃŒbig Report.
Mr President, my point also relates to the Minutes.
I wonder if it might be recorded on page 11 in the English version of the Minutes, at Item 8 where we talk about voting time, that the votes commenced at 12.12 p.m.
They were advertised on the screen as commencing at 12.15 p.m. and for that reason some of us missed some of the early votes.
Mr President, regretfully we have learnt that exactly one month after an earthquake devastated El Salvador a similar tremor struck this Central American country again yesterday.
I am sure that our Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico will set all the machinery in motion to urge the Community authorities, starting with the Commission, to renew their efforts of solidarity with this country.
We will look into this matter.
If you are right, the Minutes will, of course, be corrected, as you say.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, very briefly, as a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, I should also like to express our concern that the people of El Salvador have once more been afflicted by a natural disaster, and to urge that aid should arrive as soon as possible so that what happened after Mitch does not happen again, because if aid takes a long time to arrive it is the population that suffers.
Thank you, Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez. I believe that the House would join you in hoping this.
Accession partnership with Turkey
The next item is the report (A5-0024/2001) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on assistance to Turkey in the framework of the pre-accession strategy, and in particular on the establishment of an Accession Partnership [COM(2000) 502 - C5-0468/2000 - 2000/0205(CNS)].
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, after lengthy pronouncements and promises, the European Union - or to be more precise, the Helsinki European Council - has formally recognised Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union.
And the purpose of our debate and vote today is also to bring Turkey closer to this membership, or, more precisely, to the possibility of opening negotiations.
If, as I would hope, we adopt my report here today and the Council reaches a decision along similar lines, the ball will be well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch.
Turkey will then have to act.
The time for reaction - as has happened all too often with Turkey - will have passed, and Turkey will have to take the crucial steps.
For it must be clear, ladies and gentlemen - and I include our colleagues from Turkey who may be following this debate today - that the Copenhagen criteria must be fulfilled prior to the opening of negotiations.
We have not negotiated with any candidate before the political criteria were fulfilled.
So in this sense, we are demanding that Turkey meet the same conditions as all the other candidates.
Turkey is neither privileged nor disadvantaged.
That is the essence of my report, and it is also the essence of those paragraphs - which, however, have apparently now been called into question - which aim to ensure that Turkey has the same status as all the other candidates.
After all, it makes little sense to talk about equal treatment for Turkey, and impose the same obligations on Turkey, if we are not prepared to grant it the same rights as well.
And of course it will be a very difficult path - in Turkey, and for Turkey - to fulfil the criteria.
There are at least three significant trends in Turkey: those who are pro-Europe because they support democracy, transparency and respect for human and minority rights; those who are pro-Europe but have substantial doubts about adopting European values and fundamental rights; and those who are fundamentally opposed to Europe, largely because they are sceptical about the adoption of the basic rights and values to which we in Europe are committed.
But it is up to Turkey to take the domestic policy decisions.
Certainly, I believe that we - this Parliament - should send out a clear signal that the forces in Turkey which want to follow the path towards Europe and full democracy have our support.
And that is the essence of my report as well.
We hope that Turkey will make substantial progress in the coming years.
Some people harbour the illusion that negotiations could begin in one or two years' time.
I don't want to discourage or disappoint anyone, but it will take several years.
But one thing must also be clear, in my view: if it genuinely proves impossible to open negotiations within a specific period - which in my personal opinion should be around five years - because the political criteria have not been fulfilled, the European Union and Turkey must consider another form of partnership.
For we are Turkey's partners anyway, and we must be good partners.
Firstly - I would not wish to deny this - Turkey is a key economic factor.
And indeed, we should not deny this.
Secondly, Europe has a significant interest in ensuring that there is at least one stable major country in this crisis-torn region.
Thirdly, we have no interest in abandoning Turkey to the Islamic fundamentalists, for we are opposed to all religious or other forms of fundamentalism on principle.
Fourthly, there are regional problems to be resolved: improving relations with Greece, and especially the Cyprus issue.
I should like to come back to this point in a moment. Turkey must understand that we demand every candidate country's absolute willingness to maintain good relations with its neighbours.
A key element of the preparations for negotiations with Turkey is that it regulates its relations with Greece in a positive way and contributes significantly to the resolution of the Cyprus issue.
It is a difficult issue.
All sides, and everyone concerned, must play their part in settling the Cyprus issue; this naturally includes the representatives of the Turkish community and especially Turkey itself.
Let me conclude with two further brief comments.
Firstly, on the Kurdish issue: it goes without saying that resolving the problems with the Kurdish community in Turkey also features on the agenda.
We have stated quite clearly that the use of the Kurdish language - also in the media - and the fostering of, and the opportunity to express, Kurdish identity are key factors in changing the political conditions in Turkey as well.
As far as the Armenia issue is concerned, I personally am opposed to the notion that foreign parliaments should seek to judge history and events which took place a hundred years ago.
But I am also opposed to the exploitation of this issue for nationalist purposes in Turkey.
A more relaxed and, above all, a more active role in the Armenia issue would be helpful.
If Turkey were to take steps to invite its own historians and those from Armenia and third countries to come together to discuss this issue, this would also be a step forward towards a sensible debate about this question.
In this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to adopt my proposal in order to give Turkey the opportunity to prove that it wishes to follow the path towards Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the draftsman of the Committee on Budgets' opinion on the Swoboda report concerning the establishment of an Accession Partnership with Turkey, I fully support the document as it stands.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has taken account of all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets.
The following points were important for the Committee on Budgets. The first appeared to be a budgetary matter, but it is actually a political issue.
The Committee on Budgets called for the appropriations for Turkey to be switched from Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective, i.e. external action, to Heading 7, i.e. Pre-accession Aid, in order to reflect Turkey's status as a candidate for accession.
In a further proposed amendment, the Committee on Budgets made it clear that the volume of Community assistance should be determined annually by the budgetary authority, i.e. the Council and Parliament, as part of the budgetary procedure.
Two further proposed amendments concerned the need for consultation with Parliament as part of the cooperation with Turkey, firstly when the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership are decided, and, secondly, when appropriate steps are agreed in the event that commitments are not respected by Turkey.
As all the points put forward by the Committee on Budgets have been taken up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we are quite satisfied from a budgetary point of view.
Indeed, as far as the financial aspects are concerned, the Committee on Foreign Affairs actually went even further, for example with its proposed amendment on Turkey's inclusion in the other financial instruments.
Let me make one last comment: in the coming years, we will all have to push hard for real new money to be made available to Turkey, which is now a candidate country - and indeed to the other candidates for accession - rather than merely bundling the existing programmes together. Without new money, the candidates for accession will be unable to fulfil the criteria which we have established for them.
Mr President, first of all, I have a great deal of respect for Mr Swoboda' s report, which, in particular, deals expertly with a number of technical points relating to Turkey, but, of course, this goes beyond the technical.
We all know that there is a difference between Turkey, a candidate country which is not in a position to engage in accession negotiations yet because the political Copenhagen criteria have not been fulfilled yet, and other candidate countries that are involved in the negotiation process leading to EU membership.
This distinction has been drawn on sensible political grounds.
It will also be reflected in our financial dealings with Turkey, as compared with our dealings with other candidate countries.
I would therefore like to make the point that whilst in general, the positive attitude towards Turkey expressed in the report certainly appeals to our group, we have the feeling it goes a little too far on one particular point, and I would specifically like to hear the Commission' s opinion on this.
I am referring to Amendment No 1, which states that Turkey should be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments in order to ensure that all candidate countries are treated equally.
I do not think that such a step constitutes equal treatment in the real sense.
In the past, if the political situation was not to our liking, or if we felt it left something to be desired in certain countries, then we have said that we would take this into account on all kinds of different points.
We would then draw a distinction on the point in question, irrespective as to whether it was a large country or a small one that we had certain political objections to.
Only yesterday, I had a detailed discussion with the excellent Turkish Ambassador about these matters.
It comes down to the question of what has to change in a country for it to become a fully-fledged candidate country involved in accession negotiations.
If ISPA and SAPARD are already being discussed - and these instruments were not intended for Turkey hitherto - then Amendment No 1 would mean money being taken out of the budgets intended for the candidate countries currently engaged in accession negotiations.
In other words, we are talking about those countries that have fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria, for example.
I have a feeling this would have a demoralising effect.
I would specifically like to know from the Commission to what extent this would actually have financial implications.
How would Amendment No 1 actually affect the other candidate countries?
Would it mean a cut in the budget for the other candidate countries we are negotiating with, for Turkey' s benefit?
What exactly is the situation?
If that were so, I would find it most strange.
Or is it perhaps the case that the Financial Perspective could be extended, allowing Amendment No 1 to be implemented without adversely affecting the other candidate countries?
I think that technically speaking, it would be extremely difficult to effect this budgetary change.
So on this one point, I would very much like a clear answer from the Commission as to the impact that Amendment No 1 will have.
Because the fact is that our group has some major doubts about accepting something that will have such a negative impact, particularly on the other candidate countries, with whom negotiations are proceeding well.
That does not seem to us to be fair, and so we should rethink the situation.
If we want to do something for Turkey then there is always the Customs Union.
We are neglecting this at the moment. I fully understand people' s irritation over this, also in the financial sense.
We must bring these matters to a sound conclusion. I could not agree more.
If we can do all these things better, technically speaking, by amalgamating instruments for example, then this is what we must do.
But taking budgets away from candidate countries that we are negotiating with over accession, for the benefit of a candidate country that has not yet reached this stage, seems to me to be a very sore point.
On behalf of my group, I would be grateful if the Commission could tell us just exactly what the score is.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey has been offered a partnership agreement and, from a procedural point of view, it is right that we should now give this partnership agreement a legal basis, even though Turkey has not yet presented a national programme which will allow us to judge just how far it is prepared to assimilate the various points of the partnership agreement.
However, Mr Swoboda's report is not a standard procedural report, because the country which is the subject of the report is not a standard candidate country.
It is a large country and it is very different from the other candidate countries.
This difference provokes certain general comments.
Turkey's candidacy puts not just Turkey, but the European Union to the test.
It is not just Turkey, ladies and gentlemen, which is sitting exams in order to become a member.
In this particular case, the European Union is also sitting exams, in numerous subjects.
First of all, in the subject of religious tolerance. The opinion which, I think, prevails among most European citizens, is that a different religion should not be an obstacle to the accession of a new member.
In democratic Europe, we are proud of our religious tolerance, but we have never been asked to put it to the test as we are now.
It is a crucial test of the sincerity of our declarations and we must not flunk it.
The second exam which we are sitting is in powers of persuasion, i.e. our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of substantive acceptance of our democratic institutions.
I stress substantive acceptance because Turkey has not refused to accept democracy formally; hardly anyone in the world today does.
However, there is a wide body of opinion which believes that a democratic state starts and ends with a multi-party system and regular elections.
Obviously that will not suffice.
It is here, with the substantive acceptance of democracy, that Turkey's development post-Helsinki gives rise to serious questions.
Turkey creates the impression, following the European Council's gesture in December 1999, which was welcomed joyfully by the Turkish people, that it is moving away from - rather than towards - a substantive democracy.
The amnesty law passed freed many a criminal; but it did not free people sentenced for daring to express an opinion or talk their own language.
Leyla Zana, the European Parliament Sakharov prizewinner, is still in jail.
The state of emergency persists in south-eastern Turkey and cadres of the legal Kurdish party HADEP have disappeared in the region and been declared missing.
The tragedy provoked when the security forces stormed the jails caused public outrage.
We expect to see Turkey move forward; instead all we see is it moving backwards.
We are also sitting exams in our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of peaceful relations between former enemies.
Here Turkey's conduct shows a regressive trend.
We expect words of reconciliation on Cyprus; instead all we hear is the clang of arms.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the Middle Ages, Turkey and its army came knocking on Europe's door in Vienna.
The door remained closed.
Today Turkey is again knocking on our door, this time in peace, because over the intervening centuries, the real power has passed not to the advocates of military force but to the powers of liberty, democracy, rationalism and science.
Herein lies the power of Great Europe and anyone who wants to share in Europe's greatness must truly espouse its principles; otherwise the door to Europe will remain firmly closed.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his speech and also the report.
My group supports the regulation, not only because of its technical and financial value to Turkey, but also for the political message it sends.
The regulation is a confidence-building measure.
It shows we treat Turkey's candidacy for European membership with the respect that it surely deserves.
It squares Turkey's candidacy with that of the other states, sending a signal that we will be fair and straightforward with Turkey and setting an example of the political consistency that we expect and require from the Turks.
The regulation will trigger a raft of reforms.
It is certain that the quality and pace of reform in Turkey will be driven by the developing relationship with the European Union.
The next step must be the national plan, published quickly and fully responding to the Accession Partnership programme.
We need this national plan to ensure that the momentum that supports European integration in Turkey does not diminish.
We in the Liberal Group will assess this national programme for reform critically but fairly.
Mr President, the Council' s proposed regulation is a logical successor to the Helsinki decisions.
If a country is a candidate country then a clear strategy and a clear financing package are required, just as they are for other candidate countries.
It is a sound proposal and Mr Swoboda' s amendments improve on it.
What is currently more interesting to my mind, is the question as to whether Turkey and the European Union have drawn closer together since the Helsinki decisions.
My own group is still facing the same dilemma on that level.
As you all know, we were, and still are, highly critical of the Turkish Government' s record as regards human rights, the position of the Kurds and the dominant position of the army.
The crucial question then, and now, is what can, and must, the EU do to improve the situation?
The answer then, and now, is that the only way to achieve this is through dialogue, in the context of enlargement and membership.
This is also because the forces we are in touch with, the progressive forces, regard Europe' s support as something that will help them on their way to change.
The question now is does this strategy work?
I fear it is too early to say because the picture is extremely mixed.
Let me cite the prisoners' riot by way of example.
Of course it was a step in the right direction to propose that, henceforth, there should no longer be thirty prisoners to one large cell, rather there should be single occupancy, or only a few people to a cell. Naturally, that is the kind of improvement we have always pushed for.
However, the picture is greatly obscured by the fact that the regime in prisons is exactly as it always was.
And this regime goes hand in hand with acts of torture, which are now said to be easier to perpetrate because of the individual cells.
My group's response is that we must continue to pursue this strategy, but - and Mr Swoboda has also reminded us of this - there is absolutely no guarantee of success.
The price of accession is high, high for the army and for the supporters of the monolithic unified state.
Can we compel, or perhaps entice them to pay this price?
It is the European Union' s responsibility to ask this question and have a crack at it.
With that in mind, and as I said before, the regulation is a positive step and the amendments represent an improvement.
However, it is up to Turkey - and that, I think, is what needs to emerge from this debate - to see whether these overtures towards the European Union are sincerely meant, because my group' s motto still holds good: no radical reforms without the prospect of membership, but without radical reforms, no prospect of membership.
Mr President, Mr Swoboda's proposals for the Council regulation are appropriate, in my view.
I think they would enhance the regulation.
I would also like to thank him very much for his explanations. I do not want to repeat the criticism of the situation in Turkey which has already been expressed by Mr Swoboda, Mr Lagendijk and Mr Oostlander.
The situation has certainly not improved in recent weeks and months.
Our parliamentary group recently sent a delegation to Turkey; it came back with devastating reports from people affected, which we would gladly make available to the Commission, the Council Presidency or our parliamentary colleagues.
But I do not want to go into that here.
Mr Swoboda, you said that the ball is now well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch.
What would be the result of this Austrian footballing analogy, I wonder?
Which side will score? And if it is at the EU's end, is it an own goal?
What we need, as I am sure you will agree, is for this process to set the ball rolling towards democracy, human rights, and the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.
But I believe that in Turkey, the ball - which really is in the Turkish half of the pitch - is viewed in a completely different way.
I believe that what has happened recently has been provocation. It is not an attempt to pursue the application for EU membership towards its proper goal; it is an end in itself, in order to secure financial resources, to utilise the benefits conferred by the Customs Union, or even to ensure that the criticism of the situation in Turkey is toned down.
This brings me to the real issue which I would like to raise.
Alongside the necessary and very candid criticism of the situation in Turkey, should we not be examining our own policies very critically as well?
Since Helsinki - and, indeed, in Helsinki - it seems as if the Council and Commission have been the victims of their own propaganda, increasingly having to justify the fact that progress has been made.
Mr Verheugen, you informed us here on 14 November that we have, and I quote, "good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform...".
I would claim that the reality is very different.
I realise that diplomacy often has to work very cautiously, but we should not be taken in by our own propaganda, or Turkey's.
We should approach the debate honestly and strengthen the forces of reform, thus opening the way for Turkey into the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our position on Turkey' s accession to the European Union is well known.
We clearly expressed this position in Parliament' s part-session last November during the debate on the report on the progress of Turkey' s preparations for accession.
We have nothing against the great Turkish nation or against its close relationship with the European Union. In fact, the opposite is true.
We simply feel that the traditional cautiousness that has characterised our attitude to Turkey' s candidature has been changed without any coherent political debate on the matter.
Can the reasons for our cautiousness have disappeared or become less pressing?
First of all, there is the geographical problem: do we no longer think that just a small portion of Turkey' s territory is actually part of the European continent?
What new doctrine on the shape of Europe allows us to frame this new concept of external borders that would result from Turkey' s inclusion in the Union?
Must Europe gain a new border, one that is not only outside Europe but which is riven with war and conflict?
We only have to think of the possibility of being surrounded by countries such as Iran, Iraq or Syria.
What can we say about the contrast with the democratic model shared by all Europeans, brought about by the countless restrictions that are, unfortunately, still being imposed in Turkey on the exercise of fundamental rights?
How can we reconcile Turkey' s accession to the Union with its ongoing military conflict with Greece over Cyprus?
What about the Kurdish question, which is making no progress?
And what of the military' s influence over the regime which is still powerful?
Lastly, does no one question the impact that the size of Turkey' s population will have on the social and economic cohesion of an enlarged Europe?
Have all these issues changed or become significantly less serious?
We do not think so.
We even think that we are not alone in holding this opinion.
The more optimistic among you will say that we are the ones who are failing to see the good progress that has been made to date.
Is this the case?
Let us see what the Commission' s latest report on the Turkish situation has to say.
It does indeed acknowledge considerable progress in the field of macro-economic stability and in improving the most striking imbalances in Turkey' s economy. We are not naÃ¯ve and realise that this is probably what counts.
Turkey' s economic importance for the European Union today is considerable.
In 2000, for example, the European Union was responsible for 52.9% of Turkey' s imports and 53.1% of its exports. Obviously, we cannot ignore this fact.
Nevertheless, we strongly recommend reading this report in the light of respect for freedom of expression and of association, which the Commission has stated are being limited.
The report should be read in the light of the situation in the field of economic, social and cultural rights, which the document says have not changed since 1999, in the light of the judicial system, whose functioning has still not been improved, and of corruption, which is still taking place at worrying levels. The report deals with the military dimension of the regime, torture and abuse, which are far from being totally eradicated and which lead the Commission to conclude that, and I quote, 'with regard to the previous year' - 1999 - 'the situation on the ground has not improved and Turkey is not systematically fulfilling the Copenhagen political criteria' .
Mr President, the proposal for a Council regulation that we are going to vote on tomorrow creates a legal framework which will enable Turkey to benefit from a pre-accession strategy, just like the other candidate countries.
This strategy provides for a kind of suspensive clause, which will be triggered specifically if there is insufficient progress towards fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.
Parliament wants to be involved in this evaluation process, which is all well and good.
In the meantime, however, given the real framework drawn up by the Commission itself, we need to ask whether this suspensive clause will be anything more than an example of political hypocrisy.
Otherwise, we will only be able to conclude that what the Commission is proposing for Turkey gives partnership for accession with one hand and, with the other, suspends it indefinitely.
Mr President, in December 1999, the Helsinki European Council accorded Turkey EU candidate country status; a radical decision given the distinctly tricky mutual relations of previous decades.
At any rate, it was a step too far for our taste.
After all, the political and cultural divide between the two parties is far too wide.
Ongoing tensions bear this out.
Consider for example the current diplomatic clash between Paris and Ankara over the historical interpretation of the dreadful fate of the Armenian minority within the Osman Empire in 1915.
However, awarding Turkey candidate country status means that Europe now has certain obligations.
The Commission, and not least the rapporteur, are approaching this in a fair and reasonable way, and so we will support Mr Swoboda' s report.
Two elements of the proposed Accession Partnership have reinforced this decision.
Firstly, the strengthening of the Customs Union between the European Community and Turkey, our alternative to the inevitable mutual trials that would result from Turkey' s accession to the EU.
Secondly, Article 4 of the Commission proposal.
If Turkey absolutely fails to make any discernible progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen accession criteria, i.e. if it fails to establish a functioning democratic constitutional state with protection for minorities, then we expect the Council and the Commission to take 'appropriate measures' in conformity with Article 4.
Rapporteur Swoboda is right, in this specific case, to call for consultation of Parliament, which would be acting within the scope of its authority.
Mr President, Ankara has still not set a course for Europe by implementing an unequivocal policy of reform.
Yet it is still being given the chance to join the EU.
We must now wait for a clear Turkish response, and that will demand a lot of patience on Europe' s part.
However, we must not let ourselves be talked into simply disregarding our carefully compiled accession criteria for that reason.
Mr President, in principle, we welcome any attempt to improve conditions in Turkey and bring the country closer to the European Union.
But the question is under what conditions and with what financial resources.
A great deal has been said, quite rightly, about the human rights problems in Turkey, the Kurdish issue, and even recognition of the genocide against the Armenian people.
I myself visited Turkey as a trial observer a few months ago at the invitation of a group of students, and it was not a very encouraging experience.
It is interesting to note, for example, that the rapporteur himself, who has tabled a most interesting report, has changed his views on Turkey over recent years.
But we should not reproach him for doing so, for everyone has the right to alter their opinion.
Financial support for Turkey to boost those forces which want to move closer to Europe and achieve further improvements in democratic conditions must take place in tandem with observation of the human rights situation, however, and must not reduce the financial resources earmarked for other countries.
So we are interested in the TDI's idea of setting up a kind of Council of the Wise, which would monitor human rights on an ongoing basis and make funding for specific projects conditional on improvements in this area.
Mr President, the Accession Partnership sets out a series of important and challenging priorities for Turkey to address as part of its preparations for European Union membership.
It will certainly test the resolve of Turkey to carry out much-needed reforms in the area of human rights. A very topical aspect of this relates to freedom of expression, the functioning of the judicial system and the conditions in Turkish prisons.
This has been mentioned by previous speakers this morning and I spoke on this subject during our debate last month.
Following the adoption of a resolution by this House on the situation in Turkish prisons, I wrote to the Turkish authorities drawing particular attention to the request that Members of this Parliament should visit Turkish prisons to see the situation for themselves.
On 5 February, I received a reply from the Turkish Ambassador informing me that the Turkish Ministry of Justice was willing to allow a delegation of MEPs to visit F-type prisons in order to see some of the problems and the steps being taken to overcome them.
To my mind, this confirms the willingness of the Turkish authorities to engage with us in a positive and open manner.
It also demonstrates that some understanding for the Turkish situation, some balance rather than a constant barrage of politically motivated reproach, is more likely to lead to improvement in those areas where we have justified criticisms.
Constant references to events which took place generations ago in different circumstances should be avoided.
These merely serve to sustain generalised, stereotypical, negative images of Turkey and the Turkish peoples.
In this context, Parliament's facilities should not be used for exhibitions designed to whip up hatred and I hope that this sentiment will be conveyed by the President to the Quaestors.
Let us look forward rather than constantly harking back.
We support the Swoboda report and the sensible amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Mr President, when I am in Turkey, I am always told that the European Parliament is Turkey's enemy.
Here today, we have made it clear that this accusation is untrue.
The objective debate about Turkey, the speeches, the regulation, or at least the Commission's proposed regulation, and the rapporteur's report have in fact shown that the European Parliament is very keen to help Turkey and make it clear that there is absolutely no desire for hostility; instead, together with the people of Turkey, we want to welcome Turkey as a democratic country in the European Union one day, and are developing sensible proposals to this end.
And here today, our colleagues from the Turkish Parliament are listening to us and following the debate.
I would like to tell them something: we have no great interest in constantly talking about what is wrong in Turkey, but let me explain why we express criticism when they exercise their mandate in Turkey.
We are politicians, and we rightly ask about the politicians.
I have here a quote from a Turkish newspaper, not a Kurdish organisation's newspaper, and with your permission, I would like to read you an excerpt. It says, "Serdar Tanis, Chairman of HADEP in Silopi, and Ebubekir Deniz, HADEP secretary, have disappeared.
On 25 January, they were summoned by the gendarmerie to the gendarmerie station in Silopi and have not been seen since."
I think this is our problem.
If this type of thing occurs again and again in Turkey and nothing is done about it, people will have to accept that our criticism is justified.
Then they will have to admit that we are right to adopt a highly critical approach to the Turkish issue.
Mr President, first and foremost I too would like, on behalf of the ELDR Group, to congratulate Mr Swoboda on his excellent report and the measured words of his introduction.
This is another small but still very important step on the long road leading to Turkey' s accession to the European Union.
There are still a great many obstacles to be overcome along the way.
The political reforms and human rights are of course the first areas to spring to mind, but there are also problems with the economic reforms and Turkey must also satisfy requirements pertaining to environmental legislation.
There is nothing unusual at all in the fact that Europe is helping Turkey on its way.
However, we do expect that in return, Turkey will take our criticism seriously in the same spirit of trust and cooperation.
The Swoboda report is a technical-financial report that follows logically from the Helsinki conclusions.
But reading between the lines, it does highlight a very important message, namely Turkey belongs in Europe.
The ELDR Group wholeheartedly supports this fundamental message.
We are therefore disappointed that other noises are often to be heard from this Parliament. In particular, noises are occasionally heard from the right side of the House to the effect that Europe should remain a Christian club where Muslims are not welcome.
We repudiate that kind of intolerance.
Europe is a secular Community, a Community of equal rights, religious freedom and openness.
Although there is still a long way to go, particularly in the field of human rights, Turkey will belong to this Europe one day.
Mr President, we oppose Turkey's accession to the European Union because we are certain that the people of Turkey have nothing to gain.
On the contrary, even those in Turkey who believed that its accession would help democratise the country have come to realise, since Turkey was granted candidate status of the European Union, that the opposite is true.
And, if you believed your own declarations on democracy and human rights, declarations which come thick and fast, you would not spend a single euro of the European Union taxpayers' money supporting a military regime which crassly tramples all over human rights.
The money being given to the Turkish Government is in fact being spent on the continued repression of the Kurdish people and the refusal to find a political solution to the Kurdish problem.
It is being spent on the continuing occupation of 38% of Cyprus and the solution, Mr Swoboda, does not lie in Greece or Cyprus, it lies in an end to this occupation and in the application of the UNO resolutions.
And yet, even recently, Turkish leaders stated that the Cyprus problem was resolved in 1974.
The funding proposed by the Council and basically supported in the Swoboda report will be used not for the economic and social development of Turkey, but to support the repressive mechanisms of the Turkish state, which recently demonstrated what it is capable of by barbarically attacking the prisons, killing dozens of political prisoners on hunger strike, and by imprisoning and maltreating even children.
The European Union's overtures to and funds for Turkey are encouraging the regime to continue and extend its inhumane, repressive policies and are being cited by the regime at home as Europe's acknowledgement of the fact that Turkey is a democratic country.
Which is why our feelings of solidarity and brotherhood with the people of Turkey who suffer this policy require that we vote against the Council's proposal, which also illustrates just how hypocritical these declarations about democracy and the Swoboda report are.
Mr President, on 8 November the Commission adopted the reports for the year 2000 on the progress made towards accession by each of the 15 countries.
It considered that all of them, with only the exception of Turkey, were observing the political criteria set in Copenhagen.
Despite that, a fortnight afterwards, Turkey attended for the first time the fourth conference on the European Union social funds.
During the summit in Nice, Turkey promised that the new F-type prisons where physical and psychological torture exist would no longer be used.
We all ought to read the report of the human rights mission from 26 December until New Year's Eve.
This report has been presented in Brussels and shows the desperate situation of hundreds of prisoners in Turkish prisons, in particular those of Kurdish origin.
Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately.
We do not need to go any further.
This must be stopped right now.
Otherwise, is this the right way to guarantee the promotion of Kurdish identity?
As Mr Brie has pointed out, reality contradicts us.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Turkey is the key country above all others in creating good relations between the Christian and the Muslim worlds.
This fact can never be underestimated - especially in the light of the situation that Turkey is officially a secular state, while its citizens are overwhelmingly Muslims.
At the same time, modern Turkey is also the second land of the Bible, where Saint Paul built up his first Christian congregations.
My first question to the Commissioner and the Council is therefore: in which way are you prepared to help promote religious dialogue between Christians and Muslims?
My second question is: what concrete measures are being taken to strengthen religious freedom in Turkey, the whole of the Middle East and North Africa?
There are many of us wondering, especially millions of Coptic Christians in Egypt.
I would like to discuss a practical case in Turkey.
On 22 February the trial of the Syrian Christian priest Yusuf Akbulut will continue from December last year before the State Security Court in Diyarbakir.
The prosecution derives from Section 312 of the penal code used to try several politicians and writers, including Yasar Kemal, in which actions which "openly stir up and incite the population" to animosity and hate by highlighting differences in religion, race, social class or geographical area are prohibited.
Yusuf Akbulut is on trial for having been quoted in the newspaper Huriyet on 3 October 2000 as having welcomed the US Congress recognition of the genocide perpetrated against Armenians in 1915-1918.
In this context he added the fact that other Christian peoples such as the Assyrians/Syrians were also murdered during the genocide.
For these statements he risks several years of imprisonment.
The trial raises a number of issues ranging from the absurd matter of having such a vague and, with regard to freedom of speech and opinion, unclear paragraph such as Section 312 in the penal code, to the evidence and the background to the case.
We in the Christian Democratic parliamentary Group PPE-DE are following the case.
My third, and final, question to the Commissioner and to the Swedish Presidency is this: are you prepared to carefully monitor the case of Yusuf Akbulut?
Mr President, Mr Lagendijk once said, and rightly so, that recently, since Helsinki, the gap between the European Union and Turkey has narrowed; but the problem is that the gap between Turkey and democratic principles, respect for human rights and compliance with international law remains almost as wide as ever.
What we have to achieve is that, as the gap between Turkey and the European Union is reduced, the gap between Turkey and democracy, human rights and international resolutions is reduced proportionally.
The truth, however, is that in recent times things have not been going well in this area in Turkey, where human rights are still being violated.
For example, we know of the letter by Pierre SanÃ©, the secretary of Amnesty International, to the Commission and Council at the end of last year, and also the threats in the last few days to Akin Birdal and the Turkish Human Rights Association, the persistent declarations by the Turkish authorities on the situation of the Kurdish people and the Cyprus conflict, and many other matters.
In adopting the Swoboda report we will for the nth time be sending a positive message to Turkey: look, we in the European Union want our relations to get better and better and for you to be part of our great family, but for this to happen it is essential that you comply with democratic principles.
We have to get this message understood by Ankara, but at the moment they do not want to understand.
The message is a positive response but with this reasoning, with these conditions, with this hope that demonstrable steps will effectively be taken in the immediate future.
I can suggest some, such as freeing our Sakharov prize-winner Leyla Zana, taking a constructive and committed attitude towards Cyprus and the Kurds, and, of course, adopting the essential legal changes to certain laws which date from the military dictatorship and still do not respect human rights.
Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, for an excellent report, and the same goes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, and Common Security and Defence Policy for their realistic presentation of the matter.
The regulation under discussion concerns pre-accession aid to Turkey.
Turkey was accepted as a candidate country at the Helsinki Summit.
For this reason, it would be appropriate if we treated it as we do the other candidate countries.
The EU Financial Perspective includes a Heading 7 covering pre-accession aid.
Every year around three billion euros are set aside there - rather more than that, in fact.
In the EU budget, however, pre-accession aid to Turkey, as with Cyprus and Malta also, has been placed under Heading 4, "External Action" .
These countries are therefore actually accorded a different status from the other candidate countries.
In addition, the same objective, that is to say, pre-accession aid, is being financed now from two different headings, which is blurring the transparency of the budget.
Heading 7, "Pre-accession Aid", has not been used correctly.
Payment appropriations are lagging far behind committed appropriations, and this is thus clearly a case of over-budgeting, which is realised as unspent resources that are returning to the Member States.
However, Heading 4, "External Action" has become over-burdened.
For two years in succession now - at 200 million euros per year - a flexibility instrument has had to be used to finance it, something which in fact is Parliament' s own disposable fund for unforeseen expenses.
Parliament has thus borne a greater responsibility for EU foreign policy than the Council.
Budgeting for pre-accession aid for Turkey, Cyprus and Malta in Heading 4 has increased the over-burdening further and jeopardised the ready availability of these funds.
For that reason I support the proposals in the report to switch these funds to Heading 7.
Mr President, in my opinion, Turkey has a place in Europe, for both geographical and historical reasons, and no one can stop it from taking its rightful place, along with its culture, history and religion.
That is one issue and it is a separate issue from the Swoboda report, which we are dealing with here, the philosophy behind which is that we should put Turkey, from the point of view of funding mechanisms, on the same basis as the other candidate countries.
This position is wrong for three reasons.
The first reason is because, in Turkey's case, the Copenhagen criteria have not yet been met. This distinguishes it from the other candidate countries.
The second reason is because we should not discriminate.
In the case of Slovakia, in the case of Slovenia, in the case of the Baltic states which failed to apply human rights or had other problems, the integration process, including funding, stopped until they came into line.
The third reason is because, if the European Union continues down this line, it is paving the way for a huge showdown with Turkey; it is writing out cheques which will be referred to drawer and at some point it will be called to account, whereas what we need is a policy of steady progress in which - if need be - the European Union takes the first, the second, the third, even the fourth step, but in which Turkey too takes a step.
Just yesterday we were talking with Mr Verheugen about 12-year-old children who are in prison because they belong to the PKK, about Leyla Zana, who received the Sakharov prize and who is in prison.
So let Turkey take a step on the Cyprus issue, on the Kurdish question and on human rights before we go down this line.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am sure that everyone here in this Chamber wants a modern, progressive Turkey.
However, to be perfectly honest, I am beginning to wonder if Turkey wants the same thing.
That notwithstanding, the message which we must send out is that, if Turkey joins the European Union, it must adjust to European standards and not the other way round, with the European Union adjusting to Turkish standards.
To be honest, I am not sure if this message has got across - I am referring, Mr President, to the period following the approval of the partnership - and I should simply like to draw the House's attention to two facts.
First, to what happened in the Turkish jails which was condemned by the European Parliament.
And, secondly, to the hard line stance taken by the Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash, who is refusing to sit down to inter-community talks and who is being encouraged in this stance by Turkey.
Turkey has obligations on both these issues under the partnership agreement and is choosing to ignore them.
In all events, even if you overlook Turkey's disdain, so far at least, for its obligations under the partnership agreement, you will be brought up short by Amendment No 1 proposing that Turkey participate in the ISPA and SAPARD programmes.
This amendment is totally unacceptable and I will tell you just two reasons why.
The first reason is that the budget for these programmes has already been decided.
It was decided and agreed in Berlin - Mr Verheugen was personally involved in this agreement as Germany's Minister of European Affairs and knows all about it - and cannot be increased.
Consequently, the only solution would be to cut the share of the other Central and Eastern European candidate countries, such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, etc., which would then receive less money.
The second reason, and this is very important, is that, when it adopted the ISPA and SAPARD programmes, the European Parliament voted against amendments seeking to fund pre-accession tools, Cyprus and Malta from these programmes, on the grounds that Cyprus and Malta were being funded under the ÃÃDA programme.
May I remind the House that Turkey also benefits from the MEDA programme.
What I am wondering, therefore, is why we said no to Cyprus and Malta and are now preparing to say yes to Turkey.
And I say this notwithstanding my immense appreciation for the report by Mr Swoboda, who has done sterling work here in the European Parliament.
But that does not prevent me from disagreeing with this specific amendment for the reasons stated, reasons which are of a technical and a political nature.
Mr President, the proposal for a Council regulation on assistance to Turkey under the pre-accession strategy and the report by Mr Swoboda mark yet another significant step towards achieving a great historical objective.
As a matter of fact, Turkey' s economic involvement with the European Union is already high, since more than half of Turkey' s imports come from the Union and more than half of its exports are destined for the European Union.
Furthermore, Turkey is a member of NATO, which has a tradition of mutual recognition towards European countries that are members of the alliance.
In addition to other aspects, particularly cultural ones, there are therefore bases on which progress can be made towards Turkey' s future membership of the European Union.
This proposal for a regulation will now enable us to create the necessary legal basis to establish an Accession Partnership, in order to help Turkey fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
It will do so not only by intensifying the Customs Union, but also by promoting economic and social development, which are essential aspects of an effective partnership.
We therefore support the rapporteur' s proposals that complement the spirit of the Commission' s initiative, particularly those that are designed to ensure that Turkey will benefit from the support provided by the Pre-Accession Structural Instrument and from the Special Programme for Agricultural and Rural Development.
Nevertheless, within the development strategy that we are advocating, the path towards economic and social development must go hand in hand with political development, in other words, the exercise of democracy and human rights.
It is in this context that we wish to emphasise and support the content of Article 4 of the proposal for a regulation.
We also feel that by playing a more effective role in this process, the European Parliament can make a contribution and provide certain guarantees.
Mr President, I have a dream.
A dream of democratic European cooperation in which Turkey too participates on an equal footing, for Turkey is a part of Europe and has a lot to contribute to European cooperation.
Turkey must make a choice, however: a choice between the future and a past characterised by ethnic oppression, torture, the death penalty and absence of legal security.
The hunger strike in Turkish prisons - I myself spoke a short time ago with prisoners, their families and lawyers and a range of politicians when I travelled as part of a delegation to Istanbul - is an expression of a conflict which should belong to the past and which it will not be possible to solve until Turkey no longer opposes cultural, ethnic and political pluralism but instead uses these as a positive force in the development of a Turkish democracy.
I should also like to call upon Turkey and the Commission to make special efforts to reconstruct the villages destroyed by Turkish authorities in eastern Turkey.
I should also like to ask for efforts to be made to help the population to resume their normal lives in these villages.
This might, for example, be via the project developed by, for example, Erik Siesby at the Danish Centre for Kurdish Human Rights, and I know that they have sent details of the project to the Commission.
Mr President, now that the Helsinki European Council has confirmed Turkey's status as a candidate for accession which must fulfil the same criteria as the other candidate countries, it is logical that Turkey should also benefit from a pre-accession strategy and an Accession Partnership.
The Swoboda report is one outcome of the Helsinki decision and is therefore important.
Let me repeat, the issue is not "whether" there should be an Accession Partnership and pre-accession strategy, but "how".
In one respect, the Swoboda report goes far beyond the Commission's proposal in that it calls for Turkey to be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments.
This would have two consequences.
Firstly, the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments would have to be cut back, and secondly, the Berlin financial agreement would have to be cancelled.
Both are highly unlikely scenarios.
On the other budgetary aspects, I go along with the Swoboda report.
I also think it is important that there should be no discrimination against Turkey.
But SAPARD and ISPA are designed for transformation societies which are evolving from a communist planned economy to what is hopefully a social market economy.
And of course this does not apply to Turkey.
The purpose of the pre-accession strategy and Accession Partnership must be to achieve convergence between Turkey's political, economic and social conditions and the EU.
It is essential that all candidates for accession are treated equally.
But this does not require any additional resources, e.g. from PHARE, ISPA or SAPARD; it requires the same procedures as apply to the distribution of PHARE funding.
I therefore call once more for Amendment No 1 of the Swoboda report to be rejected.
Mr President, I will continue where my colleague Mr Stenzel left off.
We had concerns about Turkey's candidate status, but now it is here, and Turkey therefore also has the right to be included in the financial instruments.
I say this without any ifs and buts.
I welcome the fact that this regulation has now established clarity, especially as the European Union has actually done very little to fulfil its financial commitments towards Turkey since the conclusion of the Customs Union Treaty five years ago.
So this is a fresh start which has our full support.
As far as the two programmes are concerned, I wish I could agree with my colleague Mr Stenzel, but I must also point out that it is not enough for us to view the 177 million already envisaged for the pre-accession strategy as a general framework. As Mr Kuckelkorn has said, new money, i.e. additional funding, must be made available to Turkey for economic and social cohesion.
This is our common concern, and we therefore support Mr Swoboda's report in general terms - not in every respect, and not all the proposed amendments, but its general trend.
The regulation includes an Article 4 which allows funding to be suspended under certain circumstances.
This Article 4 is necessary, and it is now up to Turkey to answer all the questions which we have been asking for years, and make progress with regard to a basic democratic structure, the role of the military in the National Security Council, and human and minority right.
To our great regret, I believe that relatively little has been done in these areas in recent months; on the contrary, we have the impression that the progress initially achieved in the second half of 2000 has now been reversed and that the Turkish side - the government itself - has lost the courage to adopt these measures swiftly and resolutely.
Article 4 is not an instrument which can be used indiscriminately; it is only intended for the event that very serious shortcomings become evident in the pre-accession process, and I hope that it will not need to be used in the near future.
But one thing must be clear: Turkey's accession to the European Union can only take place under the conditions set by Europe, not simply on Turkey's terms.
So far, neither politics nor the government has addressed this misconception held by the Turkish public.
So I would also ask our colleagues on the rostrum to help dispel this misconception at last.
Accession will only take place on our terms.
Commission.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Swoboda on his report and to thank Parliament for an extremely constructive and responsible debate. I think you have sent a very positive and also a very clear and unambiguous signal to Turkey.
I believe that, at the end of this debate, we can say that consensus regarding our policy towards Turkey has become much broader.
We agree that the current situation regarding human rights, the protection of minorities and the quality of democracy and the rule of law in Turkey is not what we would wish for.
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in that regard.
There is no point glossing over this fact or remaining silent about what is actually happening.
Because the situation is as it is, because it is so unsatisfactory, we have endlessly debated what political possibilities we have of changing it.
This brings me to my second point.
We also agree that it is not only in Turkey' s interest but in the interest of Europe as a whole, and especially in the interest of the European Union, to have Turkey as a stable and reliable partner in the long term.
I am sure everyone in this House will agree with me when I say the long-term stability of a state can only be guaranteed if this state is founded on the values we all share, such as democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of minorities.
Thirdly, I think we agree that the prospect of membership of the European Union has been the central and most important catalyst for reform; at least this has been the case throughout the entire history of our enlargement process.
If you look at the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the tremendous pace of reform they have embarked upon and the enormous success they have had, this has only come about because they had membership in their sights.
The question we must now answer is: can we achieve the same with Turkey?
In Helsinki we said, yes, we should give it a go.
We are now at a stage where the strategy adopted in Helsinki has become operational and we can therefore actually implement it.
So there is little point in talking today about whether the strategy adopted in Helsinki has changed what is happening on the ground in Turkey or not.
It simply has not.
I would never say it has changed it, but the instruments of this strategy are just not in place.
That is why one cannot say either that it has not had any results.
With what is being discussed here today and what you will subsequently adopt, you are paving the way for the entry into force of the central element of this strategy, namely the accession partnership.
The Accession Partnership sets out our expectations of Turkey.
It lays down what Turkey must do so that we can achieve the result that Turkey fulfils the political and other accession criteria.
Once this document has been formally adopted - indeed it has not yet been adopted as we are waiting upon Parliament to express its opinion - we can expect an immediate answer from Turkey.
This document will be the most important document in the history of Euro-Turkish relations over the past few decades.
What I have learned so far leads me to the belief that we are quite possibly on the brink of the most far-reaching political reform in the history of modern Turkey.
That is not to say that today we can discover whether everything that Turkey says to us in its reply will be fully in line with our expectations.
In this respect, Mr Swoboda is quite right when he says that the ball is now in Turkey' s court.
It is really now up to Turkey what steps it takes, what rhythm it adopts and what qualitative efforts it puts into fulfilling the conditions for taking up negotiations on its membership of the European Union.
That is why I underline what a number of speakers have already said.
Turkey is an important country.
Turkey is of particular strategic importance.
But that does not mean that, because of Turkey' s strategic importance, the European Union can change its inner character.
That can and must not happen.
It is only right and proper that Turkey wants to join the European Union and not the other way round and that, for that very reason, the accession conditions we have drawn up for all are equally and fully valid for Turkey.
Turkey will not become a member until it has fulfilled these accession conditions to the letter.
Neither I nor anybody else knows whether the strategy we adopted in Helsinki, which is fully supported by Parliament, will have the desired effects.
But we have for the first time reached the stage where Turkey must present us with a binding programme and must tell us what it intends to do to change conditions in Turkey.
It will give us the opportunity to bring influence to bear on this programme, because it is a jointly agreed programme, because it is jointly financed by us and because we have the opportunity to influence it and monitor it.
That is why I believe that we have made enormous strides.
As far as the financial and budgetary aspect is concerned, questions have been raised, which I will be pleased to answer.
Firstly, all those who say that it would be logical to channel pre-accession aid for Turkey, Malta and Cyprus through the relevant Heading 7 of the Financial Perspective are quite right, as we are clearly dealing with pre-accession aid.
The Commission would like this to happen too.
But I must make it clear that this would not alter in any way the amount of money that was available.
It would simply mean reducing the relevant Heading 4 and increasing Heading 7, which would not be of much benefit to Malta, Cyprus and Turkey, who naturally want more money.
They do not want us to change the Heading, but more money.
But we do not have more money because the programmes in the Financial Perspective which was adopted in Berlin have been established. Nor are there any budgetary reserves.
A Member of this House asked this question. No, we do not have any budgetary reserves in the pre-accession instruments.
They have all been paid out.
Only SAPARD was paid out rather late.
That was because of the regulation for this instrument, but the funds that have been planned for 2000 will be fully paid out during the course of 2001.
But we do not have any budgetary reserves there.
We could only satisfy the desire, which was expressed by Mr Swoboda and is shared by many of you here, to increase pre-accession aid to Turkey, Malta and Cyprus in order to make the ISPA and SAPARD instruments accessible, by making available more budgetary resources, money which the Commission, at any rate, does not have. This must be discussed with the Council.
The need may well be there, but I could not, at the moment, accede to the request. I feel bound to say in all honesty that the Commission would not be able to implement such a resolution because it simply does not have the money.
Mrs Stenzel was quite right to point out that naturally there is a difference between the candidate countries of Eastern and Central Europe, and Turkey, Malta and Cyprus. The candidate countries of Eastern and Central Europe not only have to adapt to the acquis, they also have to transform their entire economy.
That is, in fact, the political basis for the situation we have today.
May I say finally that, in my estimation, in the year 2000 we set something in motion in Turkey.
We, as politicians, know that the start of a political movement cannot be measured initially in real changes, be it in terms of prisons, NGOs, schools or whatever. No, the start of a political movement can only be measured in the way a society talks about the issues, what issues it talks about and what long-term objectives it sets itself.
In this connection we can very clearly discern in Turkey a massive movement in the year 2000.
In my opinion, the correct response for the European Union is to support such a political movement and to make the instruments available which we need to bring about tangible concrete results.
I would like to say one last thing.
We will not be able to measure the success of our pre-accession strategy towards Turkey by the promises made, i.e. we will not be able to measure it in terms of the editorial content of Turkish newspapers. But we will be able to measure the success of this strategy in what changes in concrete terms for the Turkish people, whose situations under current conditions are deplorable and in need of radical change.
It will be measured in real structural changes and in real changes to people' s living conditions.
When we see these changes, the time will have come to talk about the next step, but not today.
I am pleased to have discovered such a broad consensus regarding this matter in this Parliament.
I believe that it will help us a great deal if Turkey realises that the Council, Parliament and the Commission have, on this matter, adopted a firm common stance - at least in terms of the basic issues.
Our steadfastness in this matter will help us to reach our goals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by wholly echoing the thanks which Commissioner Verheugen addressed to Mr Swoboda for his excellent report on Turkey' s pre-accession aid which has been discussed in this Chamber.
I am convinced that your report, Mr Swoboda, will play a key role in the difficult discussions we are all so involved in, namely how best to bring Turkey closer to the EU.
I asked to speak in order to reply on behalf of the Council to the question which Mr SacrÃ©deus addressed to the presidency concerning religious freedom and tolerance between religions in Turkey.
Let me just say that we in the Council naturally see these issues as being extremely important.
Our discussions with Turkey on religious freedom are, of course, based on the fundamental Copenhagen criteria and on what we encounter in the partnership with Turkey concerning fulfilment of the requirements to respect the rights of minorities.
Mr SacrÃ©deus takes up the important issue of how to stimulate dialogue between different religions in Turkey and generally.
We see this as an important element, not only in the partnership with Turkey but generally in Europe-Mediterranean cooperation.
As far as the Swedish Presidency is concerned, we have tried to build on some of our own experiences.
For example, there is the Euro-Islam project and the conferences against intolerance which were recently held in Stockholm, and of which Mr SacrÃ©deus is no doubt aware.
We have tried to build on experience from these and to introduce a number of similar ideas into the partnership with Turkey in order to highlight the importance of respect for religious freedom.
Mr SacrÃ©deus also takes up the important issue of the trial of a Turkish priest.
The Council is monitoring this matter extremely carefully.
We know that the next trial hearing is on 22 February.
The Council will be monitoring what happens then very carefully and we will react in a way we believe is appropriate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Lisbon
The next item is the joint debate on:
Report A5-0034/2001 by Mr Bullmann, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the spring 2001 European Council: the Lisbon process and the path to be followed;
Commission statement - synthesis report on progress since Lisbon and future measures;
Report A5-0020/2001 by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the impact of liberalisation and the economic reform process on economic growth in the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Summit has bequeathed a great heritage. It defined a major task and disseminated a courageous idea: that by the year 2010 Europe will become the most competitive area in the world.
The summit placed its bets on the best Europe has to offer.
It stated that we are on the road towards full employment.
It also made it clear that we want to stake our hopes on the innovative power of the people of the European Union, on their ability to educate and train themselves, to take their destiny into their own hands, and to bring about their own prosperity and that of their families.
This is the strongest productive force that Europe can release.
