They are interacting facets of one and the same process along this path to success, and they must be of mutual support.
They must not be played off against each other.
For many of us this is a challenge to our way of thinking.
Many people who have striven their entire lives to achieve a common liberalised market will have to make some mental effort to realise that only social cohesion and employment policies can produce the social productivity which will make the common market a success.
Others, who have prided themselves all their lives on the achievements of the Member States, will also have to make some mental effort to realise that the new enlarged common market calls for concerted efforts and new rules to ensure that the process to achieve success can be implemented everywhere.
The Stockholm Summit comes precisely at this decisive moment.
It will decide whether the ambitious goals of Lisbon can be implemented, or whether the citizens of Europe think that we are dealing with nicely worded but empty statements which would have no real impact on political reality.
Those who want success in Stockholm must measure and compare how far we have come along the road to success.
Above all, they must have the courage to set new ambitious targets so that we can move further along the road to success.
We are told that concrete objectives are difficult to set.
Of course they are. But just take a complex issue like inflation rates, which is dependent on many decentralised actors making clever decisions.
On the way to economic and monetary union we clearly managed to introduce a very successful process which has led to success which we would not have believed possible up until a few years ago.
Take a complex issue like interest rate trends or the dismantling of excessive national debt.
We have achieved all this with a common effort, and these are all complex matters which call for more than one participant.
If we can achieve all this, then we will surely manage to give every schoolchild in the European Union access to the Internet.
We will be able to set up conditions in which all schoolchildren will not only have access to the Internet but will make decisive progress in the rest of their school curriculum to ensure that, when they enter the European labour market, they will have the opportunities they need.
If we can achieve all this, then we will surely be able to offer every entrepreneur in the European Union a clear, easily comprehensible and simple regulatory framework, which operates in exactly the same way in Spain, Greece, Italy and Germany alike.
If we can achieve all this, then we will surely be able to call upon the strongest productive power in Europe.
We will be able to offer the still more than 14 million unemployed in the European Union real opportunities of taking part in this process of bringing about success.
We still have an employment rate of over 8% and I would like to draw your attention to a situation which was given short shrift in the debate in the Commission: the fact that we have a youth unemployment rate which is twice as high.
This is a major problem, especially since we are saying here today that we want to make the demographic change manageable, and we want to rely on the intelligence in people' s heads and invest in heads.
Much more could be done in practical terms to combat youth unemployment and to invest in the future of Europe.
But for that very reason it is also proper for the Commission, in a preparatory paper in the run-up to Stockholm, to propose that in Stockholm we should look at very specific goals to increase the employment rate to 67% by 2005 and to strengthen the participation of women in the labour force to 57%.
These are the right goals to set and we, as the European Parliament, as the representatives of the people of Europe, want to see these goals documented in the final report of the Stockholm Summit.
We think it is important that the people of Europe read about targets which they can readily understand, with which they can identify and in which they can see that their prospects of success in Europe lie.
This will also help us to decide whether there is acceptance of the necessary enlargement of the European Union, which we all want. But we must also send out a clear signal that all who are currently disadvantaged and who want to contribute their resources will have the opportunity to do so.
Whoever wants to must move forward courageously and overcome the rivalries between the European institutions.
The people of Europe do not understand the petty jealousies over the allocation of competences.
It must be made clear that the European Council is assuming its leadership role and that Parliament is taking up its proper place, the place to which it is entitled as the directly elected representative of the people of Europe.
Mr President, Mr Bullmann, Mr Cocilovo, Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, first of all I should like to thank you for the chance Parliament is giving me to debate with you the Lisbon strategy, the system we have established to monitor what was decided there and how it is being put into practice.
Last year in Lisbon, the European Union, as Mr Bullmann has pointed out, set itself a goal which meant achieving over the next decade the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, allowing us to achieve sustainable economic growth with the creation of more jobs and greater social cohesion.
Mr Bullmann has stressed this global vision, a vision that I share absolutely, to which, of course, the Commission' s synthesis report responds.
In this synthesis report the Commission not only tries to define the progress made so far since Lisbon but also what our next goals are.
And Mr Bullmann has stressed this point too.
In Lisbon people said we should set some structural indicators that would enable us to draw a better comparison between the situations in the various countries.
In Nice we defined 35 structural indicators, which are the ones the synthesis report is based upon.
There is no doubt at all that they are useful tools for seeing the progress that has been made, the concrete objectives defined and the timetables for achieving them.
They are also a reference for the progress we can make in the next few years.
It is true that in the way we designed them these indicators are not solely for use in the synthesis report; they will also be used in other Commission reports, such as the report on the implementation or fulfilment of the obligations resulting from setting the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines in motion.
The report - I am not going to repeat it - highlights what we consider to be the positive progress achieved during this period.
There are clearly some elements, such as the progress made on certain liberalisations, that are without any doubt clearly positive.
In other cases things are moving too slowly.
While success may focus, for instance, on the improved reorientation of the economic policy guidelines, taking the Lisbon objectives on board, or on subjects such as the approval of the taxation package, the European company statute or the adoption of the social Agenda in Nice, it is also true that there are areas where we are lagging behind, such as the Community patent, the Galileo programme, or others as significant as the lifelong learning strategy or the tax benefit systems, which are certainly fundamental for growth and employment.
In any case, the synthesis report highlights the good performance of the economy, the growth achieved last year and that expected next year, and the creation of 2.5 million jobs, which is, without any doubt, a fundamental point.
In any case, the synthesis report aims to stress that the Lisbon objective is a global objective, as Mr Bullmann has pointed out.
We must not just think exclusively about growth and forget about the other aspects of Lisbon.
There is no doubt that macro-economic growth and stability are fundamental elements, but employment and social cohesion are too.
We have included in the synthesis report, as Mr Bullmann has mentioned, a series of specific proposals, ten priorities that the Commission would like to see approved at the Stockholm European Council, so that they will enable us to make progress in strengthening our commitments to structural and social change, which is fundamental for the sustainable economic growth that will enable us to reduce unemployment and improve cohesion.
As the Commissioner responsible for Economic and Financial Affairs I should like to say a little more about three points that I think are relevant: first of all, the maintenance and strengthening of a stable macro-economic framework.
In addition to the objective already mentioned of achieving a knowledge-based society with better jobs, I believe it is important to achieve a stable environment allowing us to achieve the objectives of price stability and healthy public finances in the medium term.
In the current favourable economic climate, despite the slowing of American growth, I believe we have to continue the processes of fiscal consolidation and improving the quality and sustainability of public finances, taking into account aspects as important as the ageing of the population, for instance.
When I say quality, I mean especially a fiscal policy aimed more towards creating jobs, supporting research and innovation, and increasing investment in human resources.
When I say sustainability of public finances I mean the ability to meet future obligations.
The second of my concerns is that we have to strengthen the potential growth of the Union.
It is a fact that good progress has been made on the reforms needed so that we can maintain a model of permanent growth.
Yet in this period of economic boom we have a unique opportunity to improve the internal market for services and achieve greater openings in sectors such as energy, transport and others that benefit the consumer.
We are aware, of course, that any liberalisation process has to be accompanied at the same time by a regulation control plan, which in the end will allow us to achieve positive effects without a negative impact on society.
My last comment refers to job creation and a rise in the activity rate: we must remember that two thirds of the difference between the gross domestic product levels of the United States and the European Union is due precisely to the different use of the work factor.
It is therefore absolutely fundamental to set in motion all the necessary fiscal and social reforms, including early retirement, pension plans or labour regulations, which will enable us to improve this situation.
Also fundamental are elements like education and training, business incentives and also public investment, essential for job quality.
All this should enable us Europeans to make progress along the line defined in Lisbon, which we all want to be consolidated in Stockholm.
The reports we are dealing with here, the Bullmann report and the GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm report, include a large number of suggestions that are very close to the content of the synthesis report.
My idea is to take into consideration all these references and indications, some of which refer to specific indicators, and analyse them to see to what extent some of the elements put forward can be incorporated in our future reports.
Parliament is right when it points out that for the Lisbon strategy to be successful it is absolutely essential to have the commitment of all the players involved in the process.
From this viewpoint the two reports presented to the House today are without any doubt basic elements and a clear expression of Parliament' s commitment to cooperate in the Lisbon process, which - as I said earlier - we hope will continue and improve with the decisions made in Stockholm.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, last year' s Lisbon European Council established a process for the European Union to reach the same level of competitiveness as the United States, or at least for us to achieve this level by 2010.
I believe that both Mr Bullmann' s report and my own make a positive and constructive contribution to our thinking on how to achieve this goal and our ability to take stock and analyse the situation after the past year, before the Stockholm European Council.
The strategic goal of the European Union economy is to turn itself into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
All these objectives are highly demanding.
The European Union will not give up its level of social cohesion as an economy based on well-being, which is one of the great features of European society, achieved and consolidated during the second half of the last century.
At the same time it is a clearly dynamic economy, as it has been demonstrating over these last years.
But nobody can fail to see that having such strong social commitments, ensuring sustainable growth and also being the most competitive economy in the world are three highly demanding objectives, and to meet them we must therefore keep well on top of any possible obstacles to achieving this.
In my view, something that may jeopardise the joint achievement of these three objectives is if the basic factors that ensure the competitiveness of the European economy are not implemented rigorously enough.
I believe there are basically three of these factors.
First of all, there are some markets that are still not open enough to competition, and given that they are basic to our production structure they have a negative effect on cost structures, including unit prices for goods and services.
Mr Solbes has mentioned them: energy, transport and telecommunications.
They are obviously fundamental factors, and if we compare them with the other leading world economy, the United States, we still have a gap to make up, clearly preventing us from approaching this desired level of competitiveness which we have set for 2010.
In second place is a subject that concerns me greatly and is very well expressed both in the Bullmann report and my own: employment.
It is obvious that we cannot give up the idea of raising employment levels, which is one of the major goals set by the Swedish Presidency.
But it is also obvious that to achieve this level of employment - and as both reports point out, with a more highly qualified labour force - we have to find a greater willingness to adapt, both socially - there are countries within the European Union that have very interesting formulas in this respect - and, as the 1995 Delors report said, in the sphere of labour market flexibility.
This is an essential factor in achieving two objectives, that is, a higher employment rate and greater competitiveness throughout the productive structure, where of course the labour dimension is fundamental.
Lastly, education.
I shall not labour this point, since the Bullmann report has mentioned it, as has Commissioner Solbes. This third essential element is that of quality education at all levels, from occupational training to specialist studies in higher education.
This must lay the foundations - I am finishing here, Mr President - for us to get what we really need, something that Europe has not yet achieved in comparison with the United States. Although we have a very high level of scientific training and scientific innovation, we still have not closed the gap on the United States, nor have we overcome the existing difference to achieve a kind of technological development that can be turned into competitive goods and services.
This is the third fundamental recommendation in this analysis and stock-taking of the Lisbon European Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great interest that I take part in the debate on Mr Bullmann' s report on the preparations ahead of the Stockholm European Council and on the report from Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm on the significance of deregulation and economic reforms on economic growth in the European Union.
I have listened with particular interest to Mr Bullmann' s report on Parliament' s contribution to the Stockholm Summit and would particularly like to welcome the holistic approach of the report, namely that all parts of the agenda floated in Lisbon must be implemented if Europe is to achieve the ambitious target which we drew up, i.e. for Europe within ten years to be the world' s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, with the opportunity of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and increased social cohesion.
Full employment must constitute a fundamental aim for EU economic and social policy.
The strategy adopted in Lisbon is an important milestone in the development of the EU.
With regard to the employment targets in the Lisbon strategy, the Council agrees with the Bullmann report' s proposal for intermediate targets.
We hope that the Council will be able to decide on this in Stockholm.
Today' s Europe is better equipped than it has been for a long time to extend the opportunity to work to everyone who wants to, and is able to, work.
The outlook for the European economy is still good. Public finances are strong.
Prices are stable. Reforms of the product and capital markets are well underway across Europe.
However, there is no room for complacency, as 14 million people in Europe are still out of work. Unemployment is a massive waste of economic resources and - what is worse - of people' s skills and ambitions.
Having a job means the chance of providing for oneself and, in the long term, is the best way to achieve a society in which everyone can feel they are taking part.
The Stockholm European Council on 23-24 March will be the first in a series of spring summits aimed at encouraging development towards the strategic aims established in Lisbon.
In Stockholm we should openly and critically assess the progress made in the last year.
We intend to move the work forward both through Community legislation and what is known as the new open method of coordination.
The Swedish Presidency will work on not letting the Lisbon strategy be derailed by adding too many new issues.
Nor do we need any new processes.
Instead, the Stockholm European Council should highlight certain prioritised areas.
Full employment and increased competitiveness will be achieved through economic reform and open and functioning markets, combined with a healthy macro-economic policy which stimulates growth and employment.
I was interested in what the report from Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm had to say on economic reform and growth and agree that the role a policy on economic reform has to play in growth and employment must not be underestimated.
However, I would like to stress that economic reform must take place in conjunction with investment in training, a modernised social security system and improved welfare.
This also requires a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new growth companies.
I want us in Stockholm to highlight the directions for further progress in these areas.
Let me name a few.
In Stockholm we expect to be able to establish the timetable for liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets.
We aim to push on with reform of the financial markets, with regard to which the important Lamfalussy report will provide the foundation for discussions in Stockholm.
Furthermore, we need to continue work on opening up the transport markets.
However, opening up the product and capital markets is not an end in itself. Instead, there are two reasons for this action: it is a tool for growth and increased employment.
It is also a tool for increased consumer benefit - lower prices and a greater range and better quality of goods and services.
In this context, we are also aware that external trade policy has a role to play, and we hope to be able to shed light on this issue too in Stockholm.
The Stockholm Summit should also emphasise the significance of new technology by developing the action plan for e-Europe and removing obstacles to the growth of biotechnology and its significance for innovation and growth.
However, we must also take into account the moral and ethical dimension of biotechnology.
Expected demographic development in Europe poses a growing challenge.
Low birth rates and an increasing proportion of older people threatens to considerably increase the maintenance burden for people of working age from around 2010 onwards.
Demographic development must be tackled on a broad political front right now.
This will require an extensive review of pension systems and systems for health care and care of the elderly.
It will also require measures to increase participation in the labour market.
The significance of improved conditions for families with children, increased equality and lifelong learning should be highlighted more clearly as means of meeting the demographic challenges.
As more people take up employment, the focus on working conditions increases.
The aim in Stockholm is to be able to agree on a definition of the concept of quality at work and its significance for growth and employment.
I would also like to stress the vital importance which the successful development of economic and monetary union has for stability and welfare in Europe.
The Swedish Presidency will be actively working to ensure that the introduction of notes and coins in euros in the currency union at the start of 2002 is an unqualified success.
This is in the interests of us all.
Mr President, I do not know how convincing I can be in just four minutes.
However, I shall at least try to make my position clear on some aspects of this report which have concerned Parliament in reaction to the Commission' s initiative and the commitments announced by the Council.
Other Members have effectively summed up the most significant results of the Lisbon Summit already.
The goal of full employment is once again proposed as the object of common attention and common commitment. We all know it will not be achieved tomorrow, but we declare it achievable under certain conditions.
We have found a new determination to build the most open and competitive economic area in Europe based on the information and knowledge society, and updating the package of operational instruments which accompany that effort.
But above all, we have asserted that these results can be achieved without adding a fourth process to the existing ones, through a solid combination of policies. There needs to be a complementary approach in economic policy, employment policy and social policy, and of course the policies being associated and combined to achieve the objectives must be compatible in terms of internal consistency.
Finally, the special spring European Council provides a clear opportunity for everyone to take stock of progress made and of the effective implementation of the processes and decisions which have been taken, noting any successes and any delays, through the open method of coordination.
I would like to talk about that for a moment, because open coordination is certainly different from superimposing Community policies and guidelines on the policies of the national states and societies that operate within that framework, but it is also something more than empty coordination.
Open coordination cannot be a magic formula, nor can it be an empty declaration, and it should mobilise public opinion in support of a European project that guarantees transparency and effective opportunities for verification.
It is not acceptable for the stability pact and convergence parameters to be backed by instruments and offices for checking, measuring and, where necessary, censure.
They are backed by weapons and police forces, whereas economic policy choices consistent with the aims I referred to earlier, supporting competition and growth, active policies on employment, investment in human capital, investment in lifelong learning, equal opportunities and regaining regional structural advantages, are very often largely dependent on commitments that are so solemnly affirmed and proclaimed but so little verified or verifiable.
That would disarm our advocacy, however prophetic, of the virtues of the European economic and social model.
Instead, comparable data should be made available, together with a rigorous social glossary which would make it impossible to go on using the same words with different meanings, as has sometimes happened, but, most of all - which is worse - to go on using the same words and doing different things.
Hence the importance of the proposal on indicators to stop us constantly changing policies to maintain the scientific phenomenon of perpetual motion, that strange experiment which keeps a process moving while at the same time preventing it from reaching any goal.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Bullmann on having produced a report which manages to keep consistently to the main point and address all the consequences of the very important resolutions passed in Lisbon.
The rapporteur proposes a dynamic combination of measures based on a complementary perception of economic reform, employment and social policy, illustrating the added benefits for each of these sectors.
We can only hope that future follow-ups to Lisbon will apply the same policy and demonstrate the same soundness of judgment and consistency.
I should like to comment, in particular, on the importance of the knowledge economy and of investments in human resources as a basic element of European policy.
Lifelong learning is a prime means for the European economy of developing the human capital which a knowledge society needs at its disposal.
We need more educated, suitably trained workers in all leading-edge sectors.
Lifelong learning is not a new philosophy; it is a serious political proposal to allow human resources to adapt and evolve in the face of new developments.
We also need to ensure that suitable information networks are created, to which all citizens have access, without exclusion and without a cost barrier.
All current obstacles to lifelong learning should be dealt with and removed.
This is a social cost which we need to bear in the belief that it will yield a maximum return, for the benefit of the European social and political model.
Another important point which I should like to highlight is the free movement of students, teachers, instructors and researchers, in order to strengthen the role of education in the nascent knowledge-based European society.
However, measures must also be taken to avoid the obvious danger of information poverty.
Care must be taken to ensure that labour market flexibility does not lead to new forms of insecurity and marginalisation for workers.
In today's era of globalisation and huge technological changes in everyday life, citizens need to be given more opportunity to adapt and evolve and additional cultural choices.
We need to strengthen culture in general in Europe and the cultural environment which is directly linked to the economic and social situation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in an age of globalisation and digitalisation, and we talk about a knowledge-based society.
The whole of our society, our economic life, is on the threshold of major structural changes.
What we have become used to is disappearing; things are changing.
A policy to establish a regulatory framework is now more pressing than ever.
The European Union has set itself the ambitious target of becoming the most dynamic economic region in the world by 2010.
To this end, a number of conditions need to be met and we need to do our homework.
The policy on training has already been addressed on a number of occasions.
The resource Europe has is knowledge.
This is where we must invest in our young people, in particular.
We talk about new technologies such as the Internet.
But we also need to talk about equipping people with new ways of thinking.
My generation and the generation before that did not concern itself very much with the idea of being independent or becoming an entrepreneur.
I think in future we should make young people in school more aware of this idea so that it becomes quite natural for them to embark upon an independent life.
But we also need to talk about flexibility in our labour markets.
I fully concur with Mr Bullmann, when he talks of targets, but we are constantly experiencing just how little targets match up with concrete actions.
We are all in agreement on the objective of making labour more flexible.
But if we take a look at Germany and the new Industrial Constitution Act, then we realise that targets and actions do not always tally, which makes it all the more difficult simply to orient policies towards targets.
We also need to make more effort in the area of high technology.
The Internet has been mentioned.
Access to the Internet in Europe is still too expensive.
Its use in comparison with other countries is still too limited.
Our approach to new technologies, such as biotechnology, needs to be more aggressive and more optimistic.
But we should not restrict our investments to new technologies.
We should also consider how to bridge the gap between the new economy and the old economy.
I am fundamentally opposed to this demarcation.
In Bavaria there is a carpenter who already achieves 70% of his sales via the Internet.
If I may ask the experts here, does he belong to the old economy or to the new economy?
I think he simply belongs to the economy.
We need to bring them together and make them viable.
But - and I would like to warmly congratulate Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm on his report on deregulation - we need to become competitive. We need to make our structures competitive.
We have had very positive experiences when it comes to air transport, telecommunications and energy, and other markets such as transport, gas, the postal services and finances are also being considered.
Ultimately though, our goal must be to have competition only where it benefits the consumer.
I would like to offer a word of warning that not every sector should be deregulated straight away just for the sake of positive competitiveness.
An example is water.
Water is a limited resource.
We certainly cannot abandon the water market in Europe, with its high quality standard, to the vagaries of competition overnight in a sector specific or even case specific way.
In this connection I support the issue of limiting competition - of limiting general European competition law to local and regional public services.
Social structures and evolved structures are a form of capital for Europe: good training, good health, social tranquillity.
We should not maintain structures just for the sake of maintaining them, we must develop them further; they can incorporate competitive elements.
We can make them more effective and structure them positively.
But we must not abandon political responsibility.
It is a difficult balancing act.
We will raise this issue again later in the year in the liberalisation debates in this House.
But I think it must be possible to combine competition, subsidiarity and political answerability on the ground.
I believe this is the route Europe must take to become more competitive and yet maintain cohesion.
Mr President, it is sometimes said in the debate in my home country that the EU cannot be changed, but I think that the political agenda we are now discussing shows that change can be made.
In 1995, when I was new to this Parliament, we almost exclusively discussed stabilisation policy.
This area remains, but stabilisation policy has been supplemented by issues regarding growth, employment and social welfare.
A changed reality has made this possible, but it is also a matter of political priorities.
This has come about via Amsterdam and Lisbon and is now continuing in Stockholm.
It is sometimes said that the issues which we are now addressing - issues of employment and social welfare - are exclusively national.
Yes, to a large extent they are local, regional and national issues.
However, by setting out targets for meeting common challenges in the future, we create added value through a European policy.
We do this partly through straightforward legislation in areas such as the work environment and labour law and partly through the open coordination method, which means establishing common targets for various matters.
The process of monetary union and targets for inflation, interest rate development and budget deficits have proven the success of the approach.
Now we are doing the same thing for employment levels, exclusion and demographic issues.
The Lisbon process comprises three parts: economic policy, employment policy and social policy/social cohesion.
It is important that there be a balance between these three areas, which are all vital to the process.
I would like to thank rapporteur Bullmann for highlighting, in his report, this balance and the importance of maintaining it.
I would like to emphasise two points in particular: education policy in a knowledge-based society, which is incredibly important, and, as I have said, the significance of tackling the challenges with regard to demographic development right now.
In Stockholm we need to focus, as we cannot manage everything at once.
So let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion.
Indicators are not an end in themselves, but simply a means of achieving established targets.
I would also like to emphasise the role of Parliament.
We have a role in legislation, but we have no clear role in the issue of the open coordination method.
As this becomes increasingly important, we must have an Institutional Agreement in which the role of Parliament is strengthened.
However, one ingredient is missing - we mention it in our report and hope that the Gothenburg Summit will address the same aspect - and that is also to link the ecological aspects to this process and to these issues.
Mr President, the Lisbon European Council gave a clear message to the people of Europe: Europe is to become the most competitive economy in the world.
This is the right ambition to have and must now be followed up effectively in Stockholm.
However, it must not be the same as so many other EU documents - words without concrete results.
We now need firm proposals.
The 14 million unemployed have had enough of grand resolutions.
I must admit that we Liberals are taking a rather guarded approach until we see the results of the Stockholm European Council.
I would like to stress that Mr Bullmann has done a good job, but the report has become too wide in its scope and the large number of proposals has meant a loss of focus.
We would have preferred a more concentrated approach and a clear list of priorities.
We fully support the Commission' s criticism of the slow speed of reform in Europe.
In this context the Council deserves the most criticism, but Parliament is also at fault.
Allow me to highlight a few important measures aimed at getting Europe moving: there needs to be further liberalisation of the energy markets, and the post and telecommunications sector - an area in which Mr Danielsson can act on his strengths.
Other issues include reduced taxes, particularly on work, better conditions for small and medium-sized businesses and a more flexible labour market.
In addition, we need to create a common financial market - an area in which very little has happened so far - and a connected e-Europe.
Biotechnology must also be stimulated.
A more liberal Europe means a Europe with greater cohesion and greater social security, which means that people' s willingness to take risks and dare to try new things increases.
Europe needs a policy in which jobs are created and citizens can choose their own future.
It is a good idea to set out targets and constantly monitor progress and have relevant statistical indicators, but this never replaces concrete proposals.
As a Swede, I hope that the Stockholm European Council will be a watershed, where decisions will be taken which pave the way for a competitive and liberal Europe.
Finally, I would like to say to Mr Danielsson that a dynamic Europe also requires a common currency.
Do not forget that.
More and more people are wondering when Sweden will fulfil its commitments.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my speech will concentrate on the Commission report on the Lisbon European Council.
I believe that it is an interesting report and the comments that I shall make are intended to suggest a few improvements to the Commission.
It is what is called constructive criticism.
My first point concerns the content of the report. I am extremely surprised that no reference is made to the marked disparities between countries and regions of the European Community with regard to the information society.
It is a fact that the European Union is made up of geographical subdivisions which differ greatly from one another.
The situation of the Scandinavian countries is quite different from that of the countries of southern Europe, and account should be taken of this in order to refine this analysis.
My second point is that the Commission quite rightly talks of an integrated response.
I would like to make some suggestions regarding three broad areas to make this integration operate more smoothly.
First of all, with regard to sustainable development, it is vital that the Commission recognise that the Lisbon process lacks an environmental dimension.
We must ensure that the Gothenburg report rearranges the order of Lisbon' s priorities.
To give a practical example of this, in terms of energy and transport, it is not sufficient to say that liberalisation will enable us to lower prices, and, consequently, consumers and businesses will have greater access. We also need indicators showing the increase in public transport or the growth of truck-on-train technology.
The issue of indicators will emerge and that is why we tabled a number of amendments to the Bullmann report.
Similarly, it is not enough for the Commission to say that it has made a statement on services of general interest.
Parliament is currently considering this issue.
Initiatives must be taken to limit the extent to which competition is introduced into various sectors.
Secondly, there is the role of education and training.
You start off by making a fundamental observation about the general lack of training.
The Commission should look into two issues more closely.
On the one hand, the issue of balancing work, training and leisure time.
Why not have a framework directive, or at least a Commission recommendation, to enable workers and citizens in general to benefit from the different patterns of training, work and leisure?
On the other hand, there is the issue of public and private funding of this training, the problem of the responsibility of businesses, including for the training of their workers, which raises the question whether public money is well spent.
Thirdly, I believe that it would be a good idea if the Commission statement followed the example of the report on economic and social cohesion, in which Mr Barnier discussed European Union enlargement.
Clearly, many of the priorities set out in the Commission statement should be reworded, in view of the European Union' s enlargement, for example, with regard to the labour market - where issues such as health and safety will become fundamental - social exclusion and social protection. This cannot be related to the issue of an ageing population, but simply to the creation of a whole new branch of social security, as the latest report from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has just reminded us once again.
These are a few suggestions, Commissioner. I hope that they will be taken into consideration in the Commission' s next reports, particularly with regard to integration, sustainable development and the knowledge-based society.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the path to be followed after Lisbon?
I would like to give my response in terms of the content, our responsibilities and the method.
First of all, I believe that we cannot regard the European Union' s strategy on sustainable development, full employment and greater social cohesion as set in stone.
The Lisbon process has many virtues and its objectives are extremely ambitious and well founded. It has a comprehensive and open method of coordination and reflects a clear understanding of the challenges of the information revolution.
However, it still contains many areas of bias.
The current framework to monetary, budgetary and financial policies encourages fiscal and social competition; the ability to carry out public policies is still compromised on a national level and is totally obstructed on a European level.
I would say that this is negative integration, in the sense that Tinbergen intended, and it is not wholly positive integration.
These areas of bias are obvious in the current problem regarding indicators.
There are comparable indicators at a national level, which are useful, but there are no European-level indicators to enable us to rank Europe' s position in the global economy and to apply common policies.
Moreover, we do not study the impact that the choices made by one or more countries have on other countries.
Why is Ireland being criticised?
Is it for its policy of public spending in favour of growth or actually for its anti-Community social dumping policy?
I understand why Mr Bullmann says that growth is actually taking place but that we must not rest on our laurels.
In this respect, it is disturbing that the Council and Commission do not evaluate the social and economic impact of the large, integrated financial market or that of the launch of the euro.
That is why we should consider Lisbon to be more of a beginning than an achievement; we must work on ironing out these contradictions and, sooner or later, we will have to change this strategy in order to make progress.
Mr Goebbels and Mr Bullmann have, moreover, tabled a good amendment to enable us to do this.
Secondly, the European Parliament should be able to make straightforward choices.
In my opinion, the two reports, for which the committees voted unanimously, contradict one another.
I support the Bullmann report, which recommends public investment and social legislation.
However, I cannot support the report by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm which concentrates on deregulation and flexibility alone.
I would like to stress, moreover, that if the internal market does not reach its goal in terms of essential services such as energy and transport, it is not due to deregulation, but because of a lack of infrastructure and common public regulations.
I would also like to say that I disagree with the endless reduction in social security contributions, which is still being called for, which absolves businesses of any responsibility and creates poor workers.
Thirdly, and finally, we should indeed help every European social and civil operator to make a choice in terms of economic and social policy.
Yet, people are not familiar with these methods of coordination.
They have absolutely no idea what they entail.
We should, therefore, give thought to our responsibilities.
On this subject, may I remind you that, in December 1996, following a report that I had presented, Parliament voted in favour of a resolution which confirmed its intention to hold an annual conference of the European Parliament on fundamental choices in economic and social policy, following an interactive debate between the various national authorities and a public consultation with the key players in civil society.
I believe that we could take up this proposal again, in order to attract the attention of the citizens.
Mr President, it is difficult to disagree overall with what Mr Bullmann and Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm propose. Apart from anything else, their proposals would at least mean greater transparency.
What is hard to understand is not their work, but why, supporting the outcome of the Lisbon Council, the Union is sometimes out of line with the principles it stands for.
As we know, the 15 Member States do not have a common economic policy so much as a group of Community guidelines, laws and prohibitions.
Faced with the challenge of globalisation, there must be more effort to give the Union common arrangements and policies based on a common history and culture, and every country must adopt a competitive flexibility.
But it is not unusual for both to be harnessed only for purposes of economic growth and not for social progress.
In some cases, public administration needs to be reformed, but in others there is also a need, for the purposes of wealth production, for the individual Member States to reform developing sectors and realise their potential in terms of basic criteria through their infrastructure policy, and move towards a policy of wealth redistribution.
Yet faced with the growth of insecurity and poverty, there does not seem to be anything else to do at national and Community level except represent it statistically as accurately as possible.
However, while virtue in public accounting is fundamental, compared with growing poverty and insecurity, it cannot find meaning only in the reduction of social costs without any non-statistical consideration of demographic growth and of the sometimes strident justifications for the continual requests to reduce labour costs without a concrete participatory system.
Liberalisation enters into these considerations too, because, while we support it in terms of theoretical benefit to the final consumer, in practice it is not reflected in quality, safety or universal enjoyment.
So roll on greater coordination of Community policies and better indicators to demonstrate their effectiveness.
But it remains desirable that the Union should not only determine its future arrangements rapidly but should also make the principles it repeatedly proclaims increasingly applicable, binding and consistent.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I have to say that my assessment of the Lisbon resolutions and, above all, of the goal, so often evoked in this House, of making the economy of the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, can be summed up like this: it is an empty, rhetorical formula with little or nothing to do with what is or is not really happening in the economies of the European countries.
Yesterday, Alan Greenspan told us that the United States economy will only grow by 2.5% in 2001 and unemployment will rise by 0.5%, from 4% to 4.5%. Those are the statistics of a dynamic and competitive economy.
For us, those statistics would represent a boom in economic growth, while the United States economy is considered to be in recession.
I appreciate the work done by Mr Bullmann and Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm - in particular I fully support the GasÃ²liba report - but I think that it may amount to too little because Parliament is given too little to discuss and propose.
For example, the Bullmann report talks about modernising the pension systems, a subject also mentioned by Commissioner Solbes.
Well, if we are going to talk about practical things to be done and not just high-flown goals, Parliament should make its voice heard in a much stronger, more decisive, more rigorous way, and call urgently for a reform which leads to financially sustainable social security systems which are less unfair in terms of balance between the generations.
In Europe, we are irresponsibly consuming the national insurance contributions of young people.
What are they going to get, 20 or 40 years from now, in return for the high contributions they have to pay today?
Reforms are needed, either of the parameters by raising the minimum pensionable age, or of the system by - as I believe would be appropriate - changing to a capitalisation system for compulsory national insurance, and not - that would be the last straw - just for supplementary national insurance.
In the dynamic economy dominating the world today - the United States' economy - there is concern about social security deficits which will begin to show up in 2025 and will have used up the accumulated capital reserves only in 2037.
In Europe and in many European countries - I am particularly thinking of my own country, Italy - we are irresponsibly heading for disaster in the social security accounts.
In Europe, we have no way of defeating the corporate resistance of those - I am thinking primarily of the trade unions - championing pensioners and people retiring on the backs of young workers - the lucky ones - and young jobless, supported by the very high national insurance contributions which depress employment.
I am very much in favour Tony Blair' s proposal for a Europe where people can work after the age of 65, because I come from a country where people retire at 55 and even younger, and their pensions are paid for by the contributions of younger workers.
In conclusion, Mr President, let us talk less about goals we all agree on - who would not want Europe to be a dynamic economy? - and a bit more about the choices, some of them painful and difficult, which need to be made as soon as possible.
Mr President, following the launch of economic and monetary union two years ago, there would indeed appear to be great resistance to the coordination of economic policy.
It seems an almost impossible feat to get 12 different economies with divergent economic situations to sing from the same hymn sheet.
The fact is that the Member States accepted monetary union reluctantly, but are not about to sacrifice even more policy freedom in order to achieve the real convergence required.
The socio-economic performance indicators proposed by the Commission represent an attempt to bring about a form of socio-economic coordination nonetheless, without having to go through a legislative procedure bristling with pitfalls.
It is far from ideal, but better some of a pudding than none of a pie, you might say.
Given this political reality, it is very foolish to nip this convergence process in the bud by proposing a confusing mass of indicators.
The business community is already complaining of fact-finding overload.
The national statistical offices simply do not have the resources or manpower for the job.
And to saddle Eurostat with it would be putting the cart before the horse.
The 27 indicators proposed by the Commission is on the excessive side as it is.
We should start with around ten and then increase the number carefully, and where there is a pressing need to do so.
It is a shame that the Bullmann report is sending the convergence process into the wilderness in its tender youth.
I hope that the Commissioner will shortly explain in clear and specific terms to what extent, and in what kind of timeframe, the far-reaching proposals from the motion for a resolution can be put into practice.
In any case, statistics do not tell the whole story.
They provide a snapshot of reality.
After all, we do not say that the United States has the greatest sporting prowess because they won the most medals at the Olympic Games.
You only have to divide the number of medals per head of population for the US to drop like a stone down the international league table, and for most European countries to emerge with better sporting achievements than the United States.
And of course Belgium has long been renowned for its skating prowess.
In short, indicators are a means of steering policy but not an end in themselves.
I would just like to say that, broadly speaking, my group is able to support Mr GasÃ²liba' s report, although, unfortunately, it devotes far too little attention to the drawbacks attending liberalisation.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have all set ourselves the ambitious target of turning Europe into the most modern and most attractive economic region in the world for enterprises and workers.
As is so often the case, there is conflict not about the target, but about how to achieve this target.
Some people believe that this target will be achieved through completely free entrepreneurial activity: others through controlling and regulating turbo capitalism.
Of course, the truth lies in coming up with an intelligent combination of the two approaches.
To make our economic area the most attractive in the world, our economy needs to be highly efficient. At the same time it needs to be human driven and take the form of a social market economy.
Mr Bullmann has given us a lot of definitions of important structural indicators, which are intended to give us pointers for the correct approach to take.
This in fact gives rise to the problem of increased burdens on medium-sized enterprises.
That is why we support the proposal made by the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party that new statistics must not mean that medium-sized enterprises will have to shoulder a greater burden; existing material must be resorted to.
Too much knowledge leads to all too frequent interventions, and this could blacken the prospects for the economy.
The problem for the future consists in doing the right thing with the data and new facts at our disposal.
It is therefore about fostering competition between systems, and private involvement.
At the same time we also need rules to make sure that our systems are competitive.
A look at my country is enough to show what should not be done: the extension of codecision in Germany.
In my country it is argued that, because of the dynamics of the economy, more works councils should be set up which, for practical purposes, means for all medium-sized enterprises.
Just imagine it if you can: new works councils are to be set up not only for large enterprises, but also for medium-sized enterprises. Now, that is nonsense.
Not even the Bullmann report would argue to that effect, and rightly so. There is everything in there, from the development of research to pension regulations, but thankfully he does not say anything about extending codecision.
By sticking with this concept, the red-green coalition in Germany is treading a misguided path, which is neither covered nor called for by European analyses.
So, on this point, Germany, the biggest country in Europe, is showing itself to be incapable of meeting the new challenges as the most attractive economic area in the world.
No, the red-green coalition is doing this aspect of the European challenge a real disservice.
The token gesture that has been made to the trades unions in Germany because their influence is decreasing, is a poisoned chalice.
Many in our group fear that the report before us contains too much detailed knowledge and detailed analyses.
We must take this problem into consideration.
The basic message that the European globalised world and the Europeans in this globalised world must take with them is that, above all, our economy must remain competitive and must not be restricted by this report.
However, what we also need - which is missing in the report - is the next phase of the analysis.
We need more global rules for global competition.
Mr President, the new European strategy which came out of Lisbon for a competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based Europe stood the test of time in the year 2000 and so, with the help of the synthesis report and the resolutions adopted at Stockholm, it must be further consolidated within the main thrusts of economic policy, which must be more binding this year than they have been in previous years.
Unemployment has finally fallen, even though the still high level of unemployment is deplorable.
Nevertheless, 2.6 million new jobs have been created and the positive economic trends have been confirmed by good economic data, even though the pace has slowed down.
The strategic approach of giving equal status to the policy areas of economic reform, economic growth, full employment and social inclusion has proved its worth.
But it must be consolidated and implemented.
The US economic climate, however, is keeping Europe on tenterhooks.
But a soft landing does seem possible.
Nevertheless, Europe must be prepared for lower demand for its exports.
For that reason, there is no alternative but to introduce structural reforms in the goods, services, capital and labour markets, which must lead to increased output potential and productivity.
Mr Friedrich, extended codecision can even lead to higher motivation among the workforce and thus to increased productivity.
The European Union has made great strides in terms of structural reforms, which is underlined by the most recent progress report of the International Monetary Fund on the euro zone.
This is also true for information and communications technologies and for the labour markets.
At the same time a policy mix must be developed which will help compensate for the effects of a possibly negative impact on the EU internal market from reduced US demand, by increasing domestic demand.
The Bullmann report and the synthesis report, with its ten correctly identified fields of action, rightly emphasise that the future of Europe lies in the ability of Member States to reform themselves, in the qualifications offensive aimed at increasing employment, in the modernisation of infrastructures, the expansion of the information society and in overcoming poverty and social exclusion.
To this end, the instruments of privatisation and deregulation must be exploited to the full.
But new instruments must only be used where restructuring and, hence, regulation are needed.
Especially important is a clear regulatory framework in all areas, most notably for financial services, which have a high priority for increased investment activity, which is crucial in the EU.
This is in the interest of the European model of a social market economy.
It is also important that the open coordination process method is taken a step further.
In this connection, a timetable, together with qualitative and quantitative objects, as well as intermediate goals, are needed.
This proved to be crucial with the advent of the internal market and the introduction of economic and monetary union.
In this case too, it must lead to the streamlining of the domestic market in the interest of the economy and employment. To this end, the European Parliament needs to play an enhanced role and be more involved in the process of coordinating economic policy.
The Swedish Presidency has called for democracy and transparency in this area.
I hope they are as good as their word.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its synthesis report and on keeping up the pressure on the Council and this House to deliver the promises made in the Lisbon process.
However, I would like to address one specific issue where the Commission and indeed all of us are rather weak: that is the issue of regulatory burdens.
We need to be a little better informed about the kind of regulatory burdens which we might be creating wittingly or, more importantly, unwittingly in the legislation that we pass.
I see in the Commission's synthesis report no more than four or five paragraphs on this very important issue.
Regulatory burdens and the reduction of regulatory burdens is a subject which is thick with rhetoric and clichÃ©s, but rather thin on action and practicality.
It means that as legislators in the European Parliament we are often legislating blind.
We often deal with proposals that come from the European Commission which do not have proper impact assessments attached to them.
We then table amendments when we do not know what the effect of those amendments will be.
That is clearly an inappropriate way in which to legislate and not a particularly effective way to pursue the goal of competitiveness.
Therefore, I urge the Commission to reflect on this quite seriously and not dismiss it as just an add-on to the Lisbon process but place it at the centre of its reflections and perhaps think of new institutional ways of creating an agency specialised in these matters.
Commission proposals ought perhaps to be subject to proper impact assessments and, similarly, MEP amendments, so that we actually know what we are doing when we legislate in pursuit of this overall aim of competitiveness.
Mr President, it sounds wonderful that the EU wants to create the most competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based economy.
But would it not have sounded even better if the EU had chosen to create the most environmentally friendly, sustainable, just and equal economy?
This appears not to be the case, particularly not in the report by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, which is an ode to deregulation, privatisation and social cutbacks, i.e. the things which create deep divisions and environmental damage.
For example, my own country Sweden has in the past been a very egalitarian country.
According to many reports since joining the EU, it is now a country where divisions, antagonism and inequality are increasing the most rapidly.
I would like to recommend all market fundamentalists to read the following in today' s Guardian, "California and New Zealand that were once keen privatisers are now both turning their backs on deregulation.
They are ready to renationalize.
California is turning dramatically left.
New Zealand' s experiment in market fundamentalism has failed" .
With this in mind, I wonder what the Swedish Presidency intends to do now.
The Swedish Presidency was in fact recently praised by The Economist for the egalitarian traditions in Sweden.
Are you now going to continue down the EU' s incorrect road towards deregulation fundamentalism?
Or will you instead perhaps regain some sort of tradition of solidarity and try to move the EU in a direction which takes more account of environmental friendliness, sustainability and solidarity?
It would be interesting to receive an answer on this.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Bullmann when he emphasises a number of positive signals from the Lisbon Summit.
I am thinking particularly of the demand for full employment, but also the emphasis on dynamic growth, innovation and lifelong learning.
However, I wonder how this links up with the Maastricht model' s emphasis on stability, inflation control, low wage policy and social savings.
Has this belt-tightening policy been abolished on the basis of the Lisbon decisions?
No, clearly not.
The Commission' s current action against Ireland shows that the Maastricht model lives on, for in many ways, Ireland is a prime example of the growth policy which has been promoted as a result of the Lisbon European Council and which is now being punished by the EU.
My conclusion is therefore that the EU has two contradictory economic models: one which is, for the time being, political reality and another which is a matter of dreams and visions about what is to succeed it.
There is a 'dream of the left' and a 'dream of the right' , which both seem to be covered by the Lisbon concept.
I naturally hope that, at the Stockholm European Council, the Swedish Government will highlight and prioritise the left-wing model which stresses the importance of full employment and a socially responsible development policy and rejects the trend towards liberalisation, deregulation, flexibility, etc. But we will have to wait and see what happens when we get to Stockholm.
Mr President, at the outset I want to take the opportunity of congratulating Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm on the preparation and presentation of his report.
I wish during this debate to take the opportunity of addressing economic growth, in particular in my own country of Ireland.
Let me immediately state that I support the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which call for the need to coordinate broad economic policies of the various participating Member States within the single European currency.
However, any proposals which are brought forward in this regard, whether it be via the European Commission or otherwise, must be fair and they must be balanced.
Ireland has consistently supported the European Union and this has been borne out in all of the referenda in my country, where the citizens - and it does not happen in every country - have been given the right to express their views in relation to Europe.
I do not believe that the proposals which were put forward by the European Commissioner, Mr Solbes, were particularly balanced with regard to these proposed recommendations concerning the workings of the Irish economy at this time.
It is important to substantiate this and it is important to note that for a number of years the economic growth in my country has been between 10 and 12% - in sharp contrast with the late 1980s when it was 0%.
The provision for the current year is for a growth of around 8%.
Unemployment figures are as close as you will get to full employment in today's Union.
We are one of the few Member States making massive provisions for future pensions.
We are proud of the fact that many countries in the world are desperately trying to improve their economic situation and they are using the Irish model as a reference.
And yes, Mr President and Commissioner, our inflation is falling.
It is falling significantly - and am I wrong in stating that other Member States have higher inflation rates than ours?
I did not hear that mentioned recently.
It seems to me that the biggest sin we have committed in our country is to reward the people with tax cuts and increases in salary.
Here, the Commission conveniently forgets that before the economic boom the citizens of our country were required to make major sacrifices in order to achieve that boom.
But according to the Commission there can be no question of them reaping the benefits.
Are we to be the victims of our own success?
It is for these reasons I believe that those detractors who are voicing concerns about the operation of the Irish economy are over-reacting.
The majority of the people in my own country support our Minister for Finance and the only people who do not are those in opposition in my country and they are using the recommendation of the Commission for what they deem to be short-term political advantage.
Any suggestions from any quarter that Ireland should suffer as a result of the success of the Irish economy is a very serious threat.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have set themselves the goal of turning the European Union into a truly dynamic, competitive, knowledge-based economic area over the next ten years.
We will have to make enormous efforts to achieve this and it will only be possible if we succeed in mobilising the forces which are currently slumbering in European enterprises and in European research and training establishments, in the context of an open market economy.
We are on the right path.
I found what Mr Prodi said yesterday very encouraging.
Soon, the single currency will be introduced and an optimum currency area will be created through enhanced mobility within the European Union.
We are moving forwards in terms of protecting intellectual property, which is also important if we want to mobilise research.
I believe that the European patent is an important step along this road. We also need to move more quickly in liberalising telecommunications, energy and the postal services, if we want to get closer to these goals.
We also need to create a European economic policy based on common principles and I am convinced that can only be done in terms of a social market economy.
But the question is this: who is responsible for this economic policy?
Or are the responsibilities different?
There are areas which are clearly allocated to the European Union: the area of competition, where the European Union has the strongest powers; the area of monetary stability, which is monitored by the European Central Bank, and the Stability and Growth Pact - these are the most important instruments.
They are the areas which fall to the European Union.
There are other areas where responsibility clearly lies with the Member States, such as taxes, social security systems and training.
Here, Europe can only make a contribution through dialogue; it is not empowered to make decisions.
As far as the collection of data is concerned, which Mr Bullmann proposed, my opinion is that, clearly, for us in the European Union, the areas where the European Union makes decisions must be given top priority.
In areas in which the European Union contributes through dialogue, the collection of data need only be accorded secondary priority.
Where do I think these priorities lie?
In which areas will we need more information before long?
We need more up-to-date information for example on the development of GDP and its components.
We need more data on the growth of services in the European Union.
We know a great deal about production in the European Union but too little about the development of services. At the moment, we have inadequate data on the balance of payments of Euroland, and these are fundamental principles which underpin decision making, for example when the European Central Bank takes its decisions on interest rates.
As regards other data, the essential thing is to get a dialogue going in order to come up with the principles of benchmarking.
I must make it very clear that, in the case of data collected in this area, I would regard it as disastrous if, once it is available, such data was misused for planned economic intervention in the economic affairs of the European Union, and we need to build in the relevant safeguards in advance.
This data, which I believe, in full agreement with Mr Bullmann, we need, must be used to increase competition between Member States.
By having common borders on the outside and open borders on the inside allowing the free circulation of people, goods, services and capital, we in the European Union have created competition not only between enterprises but also between Member States, which is aimed at offering the people of Europe the services they expect from the state at better prices and under better conditions.
It is my firm belief that the data mentioned in the Bullmann report should be used for this purpose.
I shall give the floor to Mr Rack for a procedural motion.
. (DE) Madam President, over the last few days you have worked miracles time and again.
For instance, you managed to get Air France to bring Members to the Chamber on time.
Perhaps you could work yet another miracle.
We have just tried to come down into the Chamber using the lift.
From the eighth floor it was full to capacity, nobody could breathe, but nevertheless it stopped at every floor.
We managed to get here, but might it be possible to tell the lift to go faster.
VOTE
Madam President, following yesterday's constructive debate, we meet today for Parliament to vote on this directive which will be a cornerstone in the establishment of a harmonised legal framework on copyright in the digital environment.
As we indicated yesterday, the Commission is in a position to accept all the compromise amendments of the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that have already been adopted in the Legal Affairs Committee, that is to say Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and 15.
However, the Commission has concerns about some of the other amendments adopted in the Legal Affairs Committee and therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 11, 12 and 13.
Moreover, a series of further amendments, Amendments Nos 16 to 45, have also been tabled for the plenary session.
All these further amendments are unacceptable to the Commission.
Today's vote is of utmost importance for the future of copyright and related rights in the information society.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes, and I shall give the floor to Mr Cashman for a procedural motion.
Madam President, I would like to inform the House that, as a substantial rightholder in the audio-visual sector, I have a direct financial interest in the issue before the House and will accordingly be abstaining throughout.
Thank you, Mr Cashman, for sharing this information.
. (DE) Madam President, I would like to make a similar announcement to this House.
I think that many in this Chamber are affected, as authors.
But as far as Amendment No 33 is concerned, I am particularly biased.
I will definitely not be voting on Amendment No 33.
Thank you too, Mrs Echerer, for your honesty.
Madam President, I would like to declare my economic interest and for this reason I will not be taking part in the vote.
Madam President, there will of course be many Members who will have some direct or indirect financial interest in this matter, in most cases to a rather small extent.
Parliament's Rules of Procedure however state that Members must declare their direct financial interests if they are going to speak in the debate.
I refer to Article 1 of Annex I of our Rules of Procedure.
The Rules do not require us to register such an interest before voting.
If every Member who has an interest is now going to get up and declare it before we start this vote, we will only start the vote at 1.00 p.m.
Such interests are registered in the written declaration of Members' interests, so they are there for the public to see; that declaration will also soon be on the Internet following the vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week.
Given that this issue is very clearly understood, I think that we can agree that all Members who are in this situation should abstain.
There is no need to declare this before the vote; if you agree, we shall proceed in this way.
Otherwise, we can continue; I have a long list of Members who have requested the floor.
I only hope that there will be some Members left to vote.
Madam President, as I have declared it to other people already I thought it was only fair to declare it to this House that I will be abstaining because of pecuniary interests.
Madam President, the same applies to me as a major international publisher and broadcasting company.
I shall be abstaining.
Madam President, I would willingly have gone along with Mr Corbett' s suggestion but, since everybody else is doing it, my financial interests are obvious.
I will be abstaining.
Madam President, I would also alert you to the fact that I have a vested interest in copyright matters in connection with Danish Radio, and I am therefore abstaining from voting.
Madam President, I am actually in the same situation.
At the same time I would be interested whether there is some borderline, and indeed to know where it runs to mark where the advantage is so clearly perceptible that one should abstain from voting on this very important matter.
Now that we have started, I think that the Members who wish to declare their interest explicitly may do so, unless they choose otherwise.
Madam President, following a point of order made by Mr Corbett, entirely correctly referring to the Rules on this, I should like to draw to the attention of the House that on the previous vote of the Bowe report, if everybody in this House who had an interest in pharmaceutical companies through shareholdings had declared an interest, we probably would not have arrived at the majority required.
It is therefore important that Members do not need to abstain on the vote.
They need only to make a declaration of interest in committee or in Parliament if they speak on the matter.
Otherwise we shall find we are short of majorities on a number of votes where people legitimately have interests.
Mr Blak, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, Mr Turchi, Mr Speroni and Mr Blokland are in the same position.
We can now, therefore, proceed to the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment No 11
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to table an oral amendment. I have the English text in front of me.
After the phrase, "their own past archive productions produced or commissioned" should be added, "no later than December 1996" . Then it goes on, "by them under their own editorial control" .
The background to this is quite simple, in December 1996 the WIPO Agreement was concluded.
We want to ensure it only covers archive productions which were produced before December 1996.
Mr Lehne, in your speech, you made it very clear that you are proposing an oral amendment.
Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to say that we are against the tabling of this oral amendment.
Mr Medina Ortega, in the circumstances, I do not think that it is necessary to ask 12 Members to rise; I imagine that there will be at least 12.
Nevertheless, we shall conduct the test, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure.
(The President noted that more than 12 Members rose to oppose moving the oral amendment)
After the vote on Amendment No 32
Madam President, it is with regard to Amendment No 32 in which the English uses the phrase "may use works" and the Swedish uses "tillgÃ¥ng till" [literally "access to" ].
This is not the same, so I request correction in all language versions.
Ideally, this point should have been made before the vote.
I think that you are absolutely right in stating that this must be investigated properly before voting.
However, in this case, Amendment No 32 has been rejected, and that settles the issue, I believe.
Before the vote on Amendment No 38
Madam President, the Dutch version of Amendment No 38 has not been correctly worded.
It should follow the English version, which reads, "a natural person for his or her private use" .
The words "his or her" are not present in the Dutch version, so this must be adapted in accordance with the English text.
Indeed, Mr De Clercq, we shall do that if the amendments are adopted.
Before the vote on Amendment No 35
Madam President, I would just like to say that here too the German version is incorrect.
We are sticking with the English version, in which the words "his or her" have been added.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended) President.
I note, from the Members' comments, that we must pay particular attention to the consistency between the various language versions.
Recommendation for second reading of the report (A5-0039/2001) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and the Council relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of persons comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC [9012/1/2000 - C5-0456/2000 - 1997/0176(COD)]
Madam President, as my colleague, Mr Liikanen, announced in the debate that took place yesterday, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 7 and 8, and it can also accept in principal Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10.
The amendment that the Commission cannot accept is No 9.
Madam President, I just wanted to explain that this directive on a uniform bus for Europe was rejected by all groups at first reading.
Then there were 90 pages; today there are 150.
That is why the European People' s Party has brought in Amendment No 9. I support referring this draft directive back to committee because, after the standardisation of the European cucumber, we do not want the standardisation of the European bus as well.
I call on my colleagues to vote against it.
(Applause from the right)
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Report (A5-0025/2001) by Mrs MÃŒller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements [COM(2000) 222 - C5Â­0234/2000 - 2000/0080(COD)]
Madam President, the reason why I have asked permission to speak is because, pursuant to Article 144 of the Rules of Procedure, the EDD Group is requesting that the matter be referred back to committee.
The background to this request is important and something of a matter of principle inasmuch as the proposal for a directive is alleged to have been issued pursuant to Article 95 and therefore to be a proposal for an internal market directive. In fact, the directive in view is overwhelmingly concerned with health policy, which is why, legally, it pertains to another part of the Treaty, namely Article 152.
This is an issue which is not unimportant as a matter of principle because Article 152 makes it clear that harmonisation cannot take place within the health sphere.
However, a series of other measures may be adopted.
What is worth noting and justifies the group' s request for the matter to be referred back to committee is the fact that no light has been shed anywhere, either in the Commission' s proposal or in Mrs MÃŒller' s report, on this crucial issue of where authority basically lies, and I would refer to a whole range of decisions from the European Court of Justice concerning this line of demarcation.
The least we must demand is that the issue be investigated, and we would therefore ask for the matter to be referred back to committee.
Mr Krarup, on behalf of his group, has just moved a request for referral back to committee.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I shall put this to the House.
Is there a speaker in favour of this request?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during yesterday evening' s sitting, Mr Krarup tried to refer the Commission proposal, the directive and the report back to committee and to block them.
I regret this very much because the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities was not involved in the early phases of the work on the report, either in committee or through the tabling of amendments.
Secondly, I would like to point out that we are not dealing with Article 152 here, on health, but with Article 153, which concerns consumer protection.
For this reason, I ask that we vote on this report today and that we do not refer it back to committee.
Mrs MÃŒller, the rapporteur, has spoken against the referral back to committee.
Is there a speaker in favour of the request?
Madam President, I should like to speak in favour of the proposal for I believe that, if the least suspicion can be created that we are exceeding the legal basis for our work, then we have a problem in a Parliament which takes a serious approach to its work.
I believe that, as long as this matter has not been fully investigated, it is wise not to take a final decision, and I am therefore warmly in favour of referring the matter back to committee.
Madam President, I am sorry.
I did try to avoid this, but perhaps we should base our arguments on the facts and on the system of law in the European Union.
In the context of the internal market we are obliged to work at harmonising legislation in the area of consumer protection too.
That is exactly what we are doing with the present legislation, for which Mrs MÃŒller is the rapporteur.
We are harmonising existing legislation on food supplements in the Member States and one of the reasons why we are doing this is to protect consumers.
The intention is not to overstep the competences of the European Parliament, and we are simply doing what we are doing in other areas.
The Court of Justice will agree with us at all times.
Anyone who today tries to postpone it and to get it taken off the agenda is doing so using invalid arguments.
Before we proceed to the vote on the motion for referral back to committee, Mr Corbett has requested the floor on a procedural motion.
Madam President, I ask if Amendment No 3 has been checked for admissibility, as it is wholly discriminatory on grounds of religion.
I shall ask Mr Swoboda.
I believe that this amendment is admissible.
Madam President, I do not discern any discriminatory content.
It was accepted almost unanimously in committee, in the presence of Baroness Nicholson in fact.
I do not see a problem. This is the first time that something like this has arisen.
That is what I think as well. However, thank you, Mr Swoboda, for your comments.
Madam President, my apologies.
Amendment No 9 is discriminatory, in my view, on grounds of religion.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
. The European Parliament has been asked to give its assent to this agreement between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of higher education and vocational education and training.
As rapporteur for the European Parliament I gave my support to this agreement as cooperation of this kind is essential in today's global society.
I believe that there is a great deal to be gained on both sides with this agreement.
European skills in business and technology can be enhanced both by learning from American teachers and with American students.
The same model could be reversed to help improve American knowledge of language teaching methods and working in multi-cultural contexts.
This is borne out by the agreement itself, which was inspired in the United States by their observation and admiration of the ERASMUS programme.
I am sure that the European Parliament would welcome a greater involvement in the discussions for this agreement, and hope that MEPs are consulted at an earlier stage of the proceedings than for this set of negotiations.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport was notified of the agreement only a few weeks before the negotiations with the American authorities.
The agreement is to receive EUR 8.6 million for its five-year duration.
I would propose that research be carried out from next year into how private funding can be used to supplement this figure.
Discussions with the Commission and the American authorities have shown enthusiasm for the idea, and I hope it is one that the European Parliament, European Commission and US Administration can cooperate on.
As I set out in my explanatory statement, the programme would also benefit from being given a name that would help raise its profile among students, universities and the general public.
Part of the reasoning behind the programme is to serve as a symbol of cross-Atlantic cooperation, and so it needs to be as widely known as possible.
In this, too, I have received positive feedback from the other concerned parties, and I trust that it is one that can be discussed in greater length in time for the next agreement in 2005.
I personally think we should consider the following names of statesmen associated with US-European relations: Churchill, Eisenhower or Lafayette, any of whom in my opinion would be an appropriate name for this programme.
Bowe report (A5-0032/2001)
Madam President, Bonino List Members have voted in favour of this directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.
It is certainly an important vote because this directive takes account of the precautionary principle without confusing it with prohibition, and, after three years of work, we believe we have taken an important step forwards.
However, Members will allow me to hope that Parliament is willing to grant the same openness to research into biotechnology in the medical and health field.
When people talk of bioengineering they are actually talking about a huge sector which is opening up, not only in food but also in medical research, and I hope this Parliament will want to reverse its decision to block research and therapeutic cloning.
That is what today' s vote means.
I hope the vetoes and bans will be removed in this way, but, above all, I hope this openness will not just apply to agribusiness but also, and as soon as possible, to the field of medical research, and that it will not be overshadowed by clerical or religious vetoes.
Madam President, the Pensioners Party has voted in favour of opening up the production and marketing of GMOs, the subject of Mr Bowe' s report.
Why?
Because pensioners are waiting for the wine that rejuvenates; pensioners are waiting for the wine that does not intoxicate; pensioners are waiting for the wine that does not damage the liver, the wine that makes men fascinating, and indeed the champagne that makes women, even mothers-in-law, utterly beautiful.
And finally, Italians are waiting for GMOs to make bistecca alla fiorentina completely harmless so they can consume that choice Italian and European delicacy without a care in the world.
. The ban will remain because new GMO approvals are not acceptable until an adequate EU biosafety framework has been completed and been implemented by all Member States.
Such approvals would, in fact, contravene the precautionary principle to which the new directive makes explicit reference and they would put the environment and consumers' health at risk.
The Member States should resist any attempts to lift the de facto moratorium by 'gentleman's agreements' with biotech companies.
Due to Green efforts, the new directive will also require all locations of GMO releases to be recorded in a public register.
It will also ensure new and higher safety standards for the protection of the environment and human health, it is based on a broadened risk assessment approach and introduces new concepts of traceability and monitoring which might help to identify and remedy adverse effects of GMOs at an earlier stage.
However, elements of this framework, the traceability and labelling of GMOs and their derivatives, the liability for damage caused by GMOs and the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety have not yet been addressed through any legislation.
To vote in favour of the directive would be like buying a pig in a poke.
More than 6 000 hectares of farmland in four Member States of the European Union were sown last year with oilseed rape varieties contaminated by genetically modified plants.
Under the directive Member States are required to terminate such unauthorised releases.
. There is much to be welcomed in the new directive when compared to its predecessor.
I particularly welcome the recognition of the possible wider direct and indirect effects and risks of the release of GMOs into the environment.
I am pleased that there will be a public register of the location of GMOs whether deliberately released or placed on the market.
The requirement concerning the termination of unauthorised releases also clarifies the need for a consistent response.
However, I regret the delay on the ban of antibiotic markers and the qualification attached to this ban, the streamlining and setting of shorter deadlines for the authorisation procedures and a number of other factors in this final result.
I have therefore abstained in the vote.
The whole regulatory package is not yet clear: for example in relation to liability and the export to non-GMO states.
Neither am I convinced that the research capability currently exists to fully assess the factors contained in the directive.
The needs of our environment and biodiversity should be paramount in this area.
I do not believe that is the currently the position of Council.
- (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats are voting in favour of the proposal approved by the Conciliation Committee.
This is not a stand for or against genetically modified products, but a way of regulating our current reality.
We have a responsibility as politicians to ensure that this area is regulated.
The result of not approving the new text is that we retain the old legislation, which has not kept up with new developments in the field of gene technology.
We must trust that the Commission will present a clear proposal regarding traceability and labelling, as it has promised.
Consumers must be able to choose whether or not to buy GMO products.
We believe it is important to establish clear rules in this area.

Once again, I refused to approve the draft directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as it stands following the work of the Conciliation Committee of the Council and the European Parliament. I also refused to approve it at its first two readings in the European Parliament, which were held on 11 February 1999 and 12 April 2000.
Quite apart from the strategic reason that I already explained in the course of the main debate (we risk being duped if we accept the implementation of an authorisation procedure and then, tomorrow, the moratorium is lifted without further guarantees), the content of this text, in our opinion, still appears to be far from satisfactory.
Admittedly, we noted that some progress has been made on the timetable for the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant markers in GMOs.
However, there are still some disturbing grey areas.
First of all, no progress has been made on the issue of liability or any requirement for those who release GMOs to take out insurance.
The Commission has merely made a rather vague promise to "bring forward proposals" , but these certainly will not be regarding the requirement for insurance, which neither the Commission nor the GMO producers want.
Furthermore, authorisations for placing products onto the market are based on a ten-year period, which is far too long, and this is Parliament' s fault, since it has let itself be influenced by pressure groups.
The national safeguard clause in Article 23 is too weak, as a Member State may find itself bound by an authorisation for placing products onto the market that would be valid throughout the European Community.
To sum up, of all these disheartening provisions, we support those which are concerned with keeping the public informed, i.e. notifying the relevant authorities of the locations where GMO crops are grown for commercial purposes and having these locations "made known to the public in a manner deemed appropriate by the authorities" .
In other words, in this matter, there will be no requirement to give honest and open information.
This policy of restricting information reminds us of the method the Commission already used at the beginning of the 1990s, when the mad cow epidemic was spreading.
There is no doubt that the European authorities are repeat offenders.
Our vote against this report is not a vote against research into agriculture or against the scientists who carry out research in this area.
However, the results of this research are inevitably used by agri-foodstuffs corporations as the results strengthen their dominant role in the agriculture industry, because farmers must increasingly go through these corporations to buy seed etc.
We have absolutely no trust in the agri-foodstuffs corporations, who are motivated solely by research and optimising profits, even at the expense of consumers' health and the environment.
Yet, there is nothing in the proposal for a directive which convinces us that releasing GMOs and, more importantly, placing GMOs on the market, will be subject to strict monitoring, leading to an outright ban if this were shown to be in the interests of society, even if this means a clash with the interests of the agricultural food corporations.
The fact that these agricultural food corporations continued to sell bonemeal, despite having been proven to be harmful, and the lax attitude, even complicity, of Member States and European institutions towards this issue are already sending out warning signals and we will certainly pay a high price for this in the future.
We therefore voted against this report.

We shall vote against the report that Mr Bowe presented on behalf of the Conciliation Committee, since the revision of Directive 90/200 on deliberate release of GMOs has not met its anticipated objectives. Yet, with regard to a question that is so fundamentally important to our citizens, the European Parliament should have reached agreement on all the issues that were raised and on the simultaneous implementation of all the measures which safeguard the precautionary principle.
Admittedly, some progress has been made on the previous directive (such as exemptions for pharmaceutical products and renewal of authorisation). However, we would not want to accept a directive that did not ensure traceability, labelling or the responsibility of producers.
How can we contemplate releasing GMOs if manufacturers do not accept their full liability and if we do not have a directive which regulates the issue of traceability and labelling of GMOs.
The Commission has made known its intention to table draft directives - but when will these be approved?
What provisions will they lay down?
We cannot vote on the release of GMOs without these guarantees.
We should bear in mind the consequences of the BSE crisis, the precautionary principle, our standards regarding food safety and inevitable risks of spreading disease to other crops, in addition to the effects on human health.
At any rate, five Member States have already stated their determination to retain a strict ban on putting GMOs on the market in the future, even if the revision of the directive should be approved, and I would like to congratulate them.
This draft directive constitutes more of a threat because of what it omits rather than what it contains.
During the conciliation procedure, the European Parliament did, however, insist on clear labelling and traceability rules for GMOs, which are essential for consumers who can only take a decision about whether to buy products containing GMOs if these products are properly labelled.
This then really is a fool' s bargain.
It is more important for the precautionary principle to take precedence over the commercial interests of various multinational companies and that the protection of European consumers is the only aspect that we take into account.
The compromise that the European Parliament and the Council have reached is clearly inadequate, even though the content of this proposal for a directive is an improvement on the original proposal and, above all, because it is more comprehensive than the previous directive.
We must bear in mind, however, that there is currently a moratorium on GMOs, which, it is envisaged, will end as soon as this new directive comes into force.
Since the Commission has made a commitment to presenting appropriate legislative proposals on labelling and traceability in 2001, which will complement the current labelling system in line with the White Paper on food safety, the moratorium must be maintained, at least during the process of drafting and adopting this legislation.
The new directive on deliberate release of GMOs aspired to "include all direct and indirect ecological aspects" .
I have to remark that the end result is still a long way from the stated objectives and that the niggling issues have been brushed aside.
Therefore, the issue of environmental liability covering damage resulting from GMOs has been postponed to a later date, as has consideration of potential cumulative long-term effects associated with the interaction of various GMOs.
It is clear that we are allowing the release of GMOs in agriculture without being fully aware of the risks that we are taking and without knowing who shall be held legally responsible for the damage either.
The authors of the directive express doubts, proving once again that a moratorium must be imposed on the production of GMOs, for ecological and public health reasons.
By merely attempting a half-hearted restriction on the release of GMOs, the directive denies the need for a moratorium, and that is the main reason why I am voting against the report.
Furthermore, the social and democratic implications of the spread of GMOs are clearly understood; spreading GMOs strengthens the domination of the agro-industry over farmers and consumers.
As such, the directive gives more than a fair share to big business and that is the second reason why I am voting against the report.
. (NL) When it comes to genetic modification, the choice now seems to be between maintaining the old regulation, which is inadequate I know, but which does not pose a risk because it includes a moratorium, and a new regulation, which is slightly better but does not guarantee the continued existence of the moratorium.
I made the point in Tuesday' s debate on this subject that the real choice is quite different.
One possibility is to permit commercial applications, accept uncontrollable changes in nature and promote the sale of new products with a still unknown risk to unwitting consumers.
The other possibility is to extend the moratorium on commercial applications, whilst scientific research alone is conducted in the meantime. This scientific research will be necessary for a long time to come, in order to chart what the potential, long-term positive and negative effects of genetic modification will be.
I would go for the latter option, but that is not, by any stretch of the imagination, what is being put to the vote today.
As I see it, the majority of Members of the Group of the European United Left, as well as the majority of Members of the Green Group, have allowed themselves to be thrown into confusion due to this lack of choice, which will now lead to abstentions.
My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, thinks that is no kind of solution.
Hence I will vote against the proposal.
.
(EL) The final version of the new directive on genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) certainly has some good points, such as improved controls, public registers, the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant gene markers etc. Nevertheless, it allows for consent to be granted for mass cultures and, in my view, does not apply the precautionary principle in full.
The debate illustrated the considerable risks from GMOs without throwing up any definitive or persuasive arguments to the contrary.
We refer to the risks to public health (allergies, increased resistance to antibiotics, possible toxicity), and, in more general terms, to the ecosystems in which GMOs are released (threat to biodiversity etc.).
Add to this the fact that current knowledge on GMOs is still - and generally admitted to be - inadequate, in that there is no systematic or confirmed information on how the overall genetic material introduced into the gene acts and develops.
'Accidents' or 'surprises' have already been recorded in specific cases of this sort of genetic manipulation in the USA, Australia and elsewhere.
Even the Council's common position was adopted despite the fact that Member States such as France, Italy and Denmark stated that they felt that a new five-year moratorium was needed.
All this reinforces our reservations and our belief that, quite apart from the need to strengthen controls and monitoring, the time has not yet come to legalise the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.
Furthermore, we are by no means convinced that GMOs can contribute to agricultural productivity and development; we are barely even convinced that they can help reduce certain pesticides, as is already being stated in American studies on a large number of areas cultivated with GMOs.
Clearly, one of the main reasons for insisting on the dissemination of GMOs is that it gives certain companies the opportunity to register patents and exclusive rights to varieties containing GMOs, as the Italian Minister of Agricultural Policy recently remarked in the Italian press.
It is for these reasons that we are unable to vote in favour of the common position on the new directive on GMOs.
GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo report (A5-0033/2001)
Madam President, we approved the report as it is an important instrument for rewarding businesses which go further than other businesses.
The eco-management and audit scheme will be an incentive.
But we are disappointed that the principle of the best available technique is not incorporated into this report. We are also very disappointed that there is no support for it in the major groups: it would have been a further incentive for businesses in fact to use the best available technique.
Great success has been achieved, however, in that this will hopefully motivate businesses to take part in EMAS, since registration in EMAS is stagnant at the moment because of the competing ISO 1400 system.
This decision will hopefully help to rectify this situation since EMAS is much better than ISO. EMAS ensures that the best are singled out, while ISO only singles out those businesses which are better than they were, even though absolutely nothing is said about what they used to be like.
That is why we voted in favour of the report. We hope that registration in EMAS will increase, especially in Germany, where it is already very widespread.
We also hope that this will serve as an incentive to enterprises to really improve their environmental instruments and to do what is best for the environment.
Madam President, I voted against the report on the regulation allowing voluntary participation in EMAS.
I have voted against because I am opposed to the word 'voluntary' which appears in the title.
Now is the time for European environmental legislation to get really serious.
The damage caused by the heedlessness of the past and by governments' lack of determination to respect the environment have brought about the terrible, dreadful situation in which we find ourselves.
I believe directives and regulations inducing respect for the environment should be compulsory and cannot be entrusted to voluntary action and the good intentions of companies to respect the rules.
Who is responsible for assessing how environmentally-friendly companies are?
The report produced by the Conciliation Committee deems the outcome of the conciliation procedure highly satisfactory.
This relates to the compromise, in which amendments were adopted and withdrawn.
One of the withdrawn amendments concerned a desire expressed by Parliament at previous readings to be able to allow independent accountants and environmental accountants, as well as large verification institutions, to participate in a Community environmental management and audit system and issue certificates.
The possibility exists in Germany, but in the Netherlands and Denmark the large institutions are trying to block it.
I would remind you of the amendment tabled by the former MEP Mrs Van Putten, of the PSE Group, which was designed to prevent individual countries from continuing to exclude independent accountants.
I note that this aspiration was not given due attention during the conciliation procedure.
This would appear to put the ball back in the court of the two Member States concerned.
However, this strategy will not succeed because the excluded group of interested parties will continue to point out that there is now a European regulation.
I expect there to be some differences of interpretation regarding this, as yet, unresolved problem, in the time to come, and will therefore ask the Commission for clarification before long.
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/2001) by Mr Boselli
Madam President, I voted in favour of the report on protecting copyright.
I am in favour of European regulation of this important sector, but I have to say that, after I had voted, I was assailed by a doubt which, I hope, can be resolved in the future.
Before coming into the House I met a young man, Marcello, from Pescara.
He told me - you will not believe this, Madam President - that he pins up my declarations of vote on his office wall.
I am not making this up, it is true!
Obviously he finds them interesting and worth exhibiting.
Well, what I want to know is this: does this directive also protect Mr Fatuzzo' s copyright when he presents his explanations of vote?
I hope so.
If so, I will be even happier that I voted in favour of the motion.
Madam President, it is always a difficult task to strike a fair balance between the necessary level of copyright protection and protecting everyone' s right to knowledge and learning.
My friend Mr Poos and I voted against almost all the amendments that were tabled by the parliamentary committee and by other Members, because we believed that the first common position was very fair and well balanced.
I am pleased to see, however, that, after the battle over the amendments and all the pressure from various groups, the common position has hardly been changed.
I believe that it provides Parliament and the Council with a good starting point for resolving this difficult problem.
Madam President, I also welcome today's vote on copyright and the information society.
This has been a very controversial and difficult area to legislate in but today we have achieved a victory for common sense.
We can be confident that in our vote we are providing - for example, in Amendment No 5 - protection for rightholders against potential Internet piracy and we have also knocked out some amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group which would have been very damaging for rightholders.
At the same time we are not denying access of citizens to the brave new world of the information society and, in particular, to the more disadvantaged users and communities.
Today's vote means that we can now sign up to the WIPO Treaty and we can give international copyright protection to our creative industries.
The computer games industry in my own region represents a third of the computer games world market.
We need to protect these industries which create jobs and boost our economy - not just locally, but in the European domain.
We can now look forward to future reviews of legislation and the work of the contact committee to ensure that there is no violation or abuse of copyright on the Internet or any limitation on genuine private use or fair use.
. Irish superstars Boyzone and the Corrs have asked the European Parliament to protect their music in the age of the Internet.
It is very important for Ireland's music and publishing industry that music can be accessed through the Internet legally.
It is especially important that the success of young up-and-coming musicians and performers is not jeopardised by piracy.
The music industry would crumble without proper protection from piracy on the Internet.
The rights of authors and creative people of all kinds are a priority but the directive also aims to allow libraries to continue to make copies available for private use.
However, the libraries have accepted that the rights of authors are a priority.
- (DA) At the second reading of amendments to the directive on copyright in the information society, the Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of securing the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the rightholders' entirely justified interest in protecting their rights in relation to the new opportunities offered by the Internet and, on the other hand, the public' s interest in using these opportunities to benefit that exchange of information which is the prerequisite for the development of the knowledge-based society.
In the vote, we have voted in favour of amendments that will make it possible for public service stations to develop what are known as their 'on demand' services. We have done this because we think it important that no unnecessary obstacles should be placed in the way of public service stations continuing to be a part of the overall media picture.
We have attached crucial importance to public service stations naturally having to pay for the use of materials to which others have the rights.
In the vote, we have also attached importance to no unnecessary restrictions being placed upon education, research and library work, two of the cornerstones of a modern democracy.
. In the digital age it is important that copyright and intellectual property problems do not prevent broadcasters using their archives.
In the UK we do not have this problem, but understand it may be a difficulty elsewhere.
Based on UK experience we see no reason why that need be so, which is why the British Conservatives are now voting against Amendment No 11.
If, however, this matter cannot satisfactorily be dealt with without legislation, we believe it should be reviewed as part of the review of the directive in 18 months time.
We obviously support the right of authors, artists, composers, performers, writers and journalists, etc., to make a reasonable living from their work.
That is why we support their calls to defend copyright.
Very often, however, large record companies and publishers of books and CD-ROMs, media and Internet giants brandish copyright in order to conceal their own interests and they take their profits from authors themselves, at the expense of the consumer, who is, moreover, often put off culture by the cost of books and CDs, etc. To these large companies, copyright simply means their own right to maximise the profits they make from authors and the general public as well as organisations such as lending libraries that attempt to make works of art available to the general public, who would otherwise never have access to such material.
The text is an attempt to reconcile the interests of the information industry capitalists with the interests of authors and the public and we abstained on several amendments, but voted in favour of the ones which do actually protect the interests of authors and the rights of the general public.
. I declare an interest in the matter of copyright.
I am advised by a legal advisor that I do however have the right to vote as an individual author.
I am not a paid lobbyist.
. Like other Members who spoke at the beginning of this debate, I have abstained in the vote because I am a rightholder in the field of television documentary archive and books.
None of these interests are directly involved in any financial gain for me should the amendments be passed, and in any event - in common with the rapporteur, Mr Boselli - I am opposed to many of them.
Nevertheless, it is the wisest course to abstain and to congratulate Mr Boselli on his successful negotiation of a report which comes so close to the common position and the balance which it achieved.
I would like to take the opportunity of the vote on the Boselli report to state that this report, and the ensuing debate, raise the issue of the future of European culture, one which is very closely related to the resources granted to creative artists.
The report does not fool the cultural world and creative artists and they have joined forces with great enthusiasm.
I met several of their representatives and have read their statements. I believe, as do many Members of the House, that they are, generally, in the right.
Naturally, it is in everyone' s interest for works of art to be widely distributed, particularly by the new methods of communication.
It should not, however, lead to daylight robbery.
That is why it is absolutely necessary to control the process properly and, in particular, to ensure that private copying retains a status that is truly private.
Despite today' s vote, the battle is still far from being won.
That is another reason why citizens should continue their battle for a European Union that is not just an economic, financial, cold and heartless monster.
.
(PT) The creative output of writers and artists in general cannot simply be considered to be merchandise, and we therefore have to find technical solutions that will guarantee and promote literary and artistic creation and, at the same time, ensure that the works that are produced are distributed.
These aspects must be borne in mind even when the new technologies are used.
Protecting the interests of users in itself requires the existence of high-quality work, the promotion of creativity and, of course, support for the distribution of these works.
We therefore regret the fact that some of the proposals tabled by the GUE/NGL Group, of which I am a member, which were designed to improve copyright, have not been approved.
In any event, despite the limitations of this directive, we acknowledge that some positive changes have been made to the final position and we hope that the Member States will pay particular attention to this aspect of artistic and literary creation and to promoting the distribution thereof, whilst respecting copyright.
. (NL) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on the result they achieved with this important report, which was very nearly the focus of more lobbying than any other report has been.
Why was there was so much lobbying?
Because the legislation stemming from this report will have an enormous impact on society, and the lobbyists must act as the mouthpiece of this self-same society.
Ultimately, I myself am very satisfied with the result achieved, which struck a fair balance between the interests of the consumer, industry and the rightholders.
Although I advised the Liberal Group to stick to the line of the common position, including the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur, and to reject the remaining amendments, in view of the attitudes within the group, I have taken the liberty of deviating from this line with my vote on the latter
I believe that the purpose of copyright law is to protect the rightholders, and this could be done more effectively than the strategy adopted by the report.
I have some concerns about the multiplicity of potential exemptions per Member State when it comes to copying rights, and about the possibility of being able to intervene in technical measures, because I feel this could disrupt the principles of the internal market.
Reasonable recompense will always have to be paid in the case of exemptions imposed by the government, regardless as to who picks up the tab, because I think it is unjust that rightholders then have to offer their work for free.
Regarding Amendment No 2, I believe that double payment must be avoided.
The purpose of Amendment No 1 appeals to me a great deal, but the wording goes much too far for my taste in this case.
Naturally it is desirable to be able to listen to, or watch, old recordings via the digital highway as well, but only with due recompense for the rightholders, and if they are demonstrably difficult to trace it is important to have a collective licence system in place which functions as a safety net.
In the matter of caching, I would have thought it more desirable for this report to tie in more closely with the e-commerce directive.
The digital techniques will ultimately start working in a self-regulatory way and I do not see that as a risk but as an opportunity for the further development of our society.
All in all, I am very satisfied with the outcome, and I feel that it will give Europe legislation that strikes a better balance than the much vaunted American legislation.
Protecting copyright and related rights, which plays a part in the creative process, is in itself a problematic issue.
It becomes more critical in the new information society, as it is called - inaccurately, for that matter.
The new technologies, symbolised by the Internet, appear to grant absolute freedom, which favours the consumer but prevents creative artists and industries receiving all the due profits from works of art and reproductions.
That is why it is difficult to reconcile the divergent interests of consumers, industries and rightholders.
How can the profits of the so-called cultural industry be protected without putting an end to the freedom that allows people to collect all the works of arts they find whilst surfing the Internet?
For an industry that is making a profit out of information technologies, as they are pompously known, the Brussels proposal for a directive on copyright is a fair compromise.
For authors and composers, this compromise weakens copyright protection.
For instance, radio broadcast archives would be excluded from protection, as would short-lived reproductions and works of art referred to in libraries or multimedia libraries.
Authors are quite rightly demanding fair compensation for the losses they will incur because of the exceptions.
In the case of authors, compromise will have to be reached between the three parties by way of contracts.
Exceptions to protection would, in fact, be subject to expropriations for which there should be compensation.
. (NL) It is not for nothing that so many different interest groups have circulated their voting recommendations on the amendments on copyright.
Creative producers' interests are different to those of consumers, and together their interests are different to those of dealers in music, written works and productions.
For artists, the work they produce is their income.
Society exempts them from doing other types of work by paying them for their products.
If they lose this money they will have to look for alternative work.
Consumers, on the other hand, would prefer to get hold of these products for free.
Whilst they still accept that you have to pay for a book or a trip to the theatre, and that museums are paid for by public funds or by charging an admission fee, a great deal has changed with the spread of photocopiers, video recorders, recordable compact discs and downloading from computers.
People pay the manufacturer for these appliances of course, but they would rather not have to pay those whose work they are appropriating in the process.
There are also companies that use artistic products to make money from the distributive trade, or as a way of luring clients for other purposes.
When it comes to the vote on copyright, I shall be voting in accordance with the wishes of the trade unions and artists' associations, for the sake of the producers and consumers, and not for the sake of business.
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0039/2001) by Mr Miller
Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the name of my group.
Yesterday in the debate, constraints of time meant that none of us were able to speak, but this is a proposal which we have supported wholeheartedly in committee and which we supported wholeheartedly today.
I was particularly glad that Amendment No 9 was defeated and that we carried the directive substantially in the form in which it left the Legal Affairs Committee under the able guidance of the rapporteur, Mr Miller.
This is a long-awaited directive and it is extremely important to disabled people.
Our own disability intergroup has been campaigning on it for a long time and so has the European Disability Movement.
It has taken nine years to get this far.
What we are accomplishing are secure, minimum safety standards for the design of buses operating in Europe and secure basic requirements to ensure access for disabled people and others with reduced mobility, including older people - Mr Fatuzzo and others no doubt - and parents with children using urban buses.
This is really important.
My group wishes to declare its solidarity with all those who will be assisted by this.
One of the marks of enhanced civilisation in my lifetime has been the far greater attention that we pay in public places and public activities to ensuring that our fellow citizens, who have the grave misfortune to suffer from one or other kind of disability or handicap, are fully admitted to public life in our societies.
We can be proud of that and glad that this directive has been passed.
Madam President, last time this came before us, i.e. in 1998, Parliament rejected the common position.
At that time there was widespread support in the House for the Commission being forced to take this way of reducing regulation in Europe seriously.
We in the PPE-DE Group still take this line.
I am surprised that Parliament is not now taking the same stand with regard to this very complicated, highly technical and over-detailed proposal.
I do not believe it is fair to the voters for Parliament to devote itself to adopting a position on whether the gangway slope should be 12% or 12.5%.
This is why I believe it was important to keep to the approach decided by Parliament in 1998.
I am concerned that people change tack so quickly in the second reading.
This is something which I believe the Commission really must take on board so that we can achieve a better method of creating regulations in Europe.
Madam President, I voted in favour of this report with great pleasure. Amongst other things, in addition to meaning that the design and other technical characteristics of buses with more than eight seats can be controlled, it ensures that elderly and disabled people can use these vehicles.
I also voted against Amendment No 9 calling for no debate on this document.
It may be true that the European Parliament sometimes overdoes the legislation on technical points, for example when we debate the curvature of bananas and cucumbers, as mentioned by President Prodi yesterday, but that is certainly not the case when we are debating whether people affected by disabilities should at last be able to travel on buses.
. (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say that we endorse the position expressed by Mr RÃŒbig before the vote because I would find it totally absurd were it not also somewhat amusing.
I do not think that the Members of this House can be called upon to be standardisation experts on technical issues.
This report says, for instance, that parents with children in prams are people with reduced mobility.
The question I ask myself is this: is the childminder, or the uncle or the grandfather who looks after this child for a day also a person with reduced mobility?
Joking apart, I believe that the people of Europe who are following this debate are quite right to ask whether we in this House do not have more important things to do. We should leave things where they belong.
Subsidiarity should not be just a nice word; it should be implemented.
. This Parliament can be proud today that it has voted to enhance disability rights.
In particular, this report is a victory for disabled transport users.
It has taken nine years to get this legislation.
The new technical standards we voted for will ensure that wheelchair access is available for public transport.
It creates minimum safety standards and puts in place access requirements which will be good for elderly people with reduced mobility and parents with prams boarding urban buses.
It is regrettable that the PPE-DE tried on a technical issue to get rid of this legislation with Amendment No 9.
The European Disability Forum and Parliament's Disability Rights Intergroup have campaigned long and hard on this issue.
It is cynical political manipulation to play games with disability rights.
With the vote on this legislation we can as Parliament say we are legislating for all citizens for equal access and equal rights.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of the common position because it addresses many of the demands by the Disabled People' s Associations. It does away with exemptions laid down in the proposal for a directive and establishes principles that are to be complied with in order to guarantee greater accessibility for disabled people.
At this second reading, the rapporteur is insisting on extending the concept of the 'passenger with reduced mobility' and on conditions for greater accessibility, in line with the view of associations working in this field. This is something we welcome.
Finally, I must point out that our position has been completely the opposite of the view put forward by the PPE-DE, which sought to destroy the common position that had already been reached. This approach jeopardised the rights of the disabled.
. May I wholeheartedly congratulate my Labour colleague Mr Miller on his report improving accessibility in vehicles with more than eight seats.
I fully support measures to improve accessibility for people of reduced mobility to urban buses with the introduction of ramps or lifts and low floor buses.
This will transform the lives of older people, people with disabilities and parents with children living in towns across the North-West who will now be able to use local buses as easily as everybody else.
Moreover, it is not just elderly people, people with disabilities - including blind people - and parents with children who will benefit.
We are seeking to broaden the definition of "people with reduced mobility" to include everyone who has difficulty when using public transport, such as those with heavy luggage, pregnant women and people with shopping trolleys and shopping bags.
We have all experienced getting on the bus laden with shopping bags from the local supermarket, and I for one certainly hope my bus ride home will be made easier and less stressful.
These are simply common-sense measures that will make life so much easier for people across Europe, particularly in Britain where buses are an essential way of getting around our towns and cities.
The bus and coach directive will secure minimum safety standards for the design of buses operating in Europe and basic requirements to ensure access for people with reduced mobility, such as the continued manufacture of existing low-floor buses and better facilities for passengers with mobility difficulties, especially wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs.
I give the green light to these measures and look forward to a more pleasant bus ride home from Bolton town centre after a Saturday afternoon's shopping spree.
- (SV) We believe that Parliament lacks the necessary competence to adopt a position on technical details of such a specific nature as in the case in question, although in principle we support the regulations which follow on from the proposal for a directive.
Therefore, we support the amendment aimed at rejecting the common position.
MÃŒller report (A5-0025/2001)
Madam President, I have closely followed the progress of Mrs MÃŒller' s report through from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I voted in favour of the regulation on supplements because it is right that they should be controlled.
So many women take this pseudo-medication to slim, become more beautiful, more slender, more agile, and they sometimes do not realise that a bit more weight makes them more attractive.
So I think certain substances should be controlled.
Substances are added to foods to make them aphrodisiac. Substances like Viagra are on sale.
The pensioners of the party I represent have no need of these food additives and supplements.
So they are calling - and rightly so - for their regulation.
- (SV) We have voted against the report by Mrs MÃŒller on food supplements.
We believe the legal grounds for the decision are incorrect and that the EU lacks the competence to push through harmonising legislation in this area.
The question of food supplements is a public health issue which should wholly or in part be decided on the basis of Article 152 of the Treaty on European Union, in which harmonisation is ruled out.
. (DE) The report on the proposal to approximate the laws of Member States relating to food supplements is one more step in the right direction of disclosing the unnatural content of foodstuffs.
But quality not quantity matters.
Food supplements should be ruthlessly declared and officially monitored. They should not be added to foodstuffs until they have been reported to the competent authorities.
The annexed list has been drawn up for this purpose.
There is no reason not to introduce the duty to report in the same way in all Member States as quickly as possible.
My group has said it is in favour of implementing the White Paper on food safety in a more forward-looking way, not only to avert distorting the market, but also to implement the overall concept of the White Paper more ruthlessly.
The checks and balances within intracommunity trade, which have been created by necessary laws, are inadequately enforced by the controls which are currently in place.
That is why the measures to set up the already approved food standards agencies must be implemented.
After BSE, inter alia, the confidence of consumers must be regained through more transparency in the food production chain, safety and proper labelling.
I would like to point out that I cannot concur with the speech given by Commissioner Fischler.
European agricultural policy has been reduced to the lowest common denominator. Europe must not shirk its responsibility.
I am firmly convinced that the public debate is only just beginning.
Food supplements are a sensible option which allow us to avoid possible dietary deficiencies and to stay healthy as well as prevent premature ageing.
Obviously, they should not present a health risk.
Furthermore, I approve the attempts to establish a European basis for food supplements, given the differences in relevant national provisions.
However, we should refrain from working towards European legislation that is too restrictive.
I have consulted specialists who confirm that taking vitamins and minerals orally presents virtually no health risk.
We must also avoid undue restrictions and administrative hassles that prevent us, in the European Union, from monitoring scientific discoveries and passing on the benefits of these to the consumer.
Basically, a food supplement should be considered to be something that enhances one' s diet and testing should concentrate on the quality of ingredients and manufacture, rather than on what the supplements contain.
We must also avoid drawing up a list of vitamins that is too restrictive.
Why are Vitamins E and D not included when, at the moment, because of fears relating to exposure to sun light, there is a serious deficit of Vitamin D which causes a higher risk of osteoporosis?
I am not a doctor, nor do I consider myself to be an expert in this subject, and so I have to place my trust in scientists.
I do not understand, however, how Members of the European Parliament can hope to be involved in the choices made by scientists in areas such as minimum and maximum doses or criteria of purity, as suggested in the explanatory statement.
I voted in favour of the report, but I wanted to make these comments in the hope that the Commission and the Council will understand that overzealousness and excessive restrictive regulation are out of place in this matter as they are in others.
Lange report (A5-0015/2001)
Madam President, I voted in favour of the directive which regulates the characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles, and I can state that with serenity, conviction and satisfaction.
Firstly, because my nostrils are still full of the dreadful smell these motorcycles discharge into the air of our beautiful cities, and secondly because I was urged to vote for this directive at Bergamo airport, before I left for Strasbourg, by a pensioner who knew we were due to vote on it.
He also stressed that there ought to be regulations on motorcycle noise.
Pensioners appreciate silence, bicycles and quiet motorcycles.
I suppose that it will not hurt for us to agree with a proposal for a Commission directive, as long as it is just this once.
It is not because we are looking favourably upon the statement from the Commission - you know our views on European integration in general and on this institution in particular. We must admit, however, that for once the Commission has made an effort in terms of prior consultation with users and manufacturers, cost-benefit studies and realistic economic and technical alternatives.
This approach is only rarely seen in cases that we deal with here.
On the other hand, we do not agree with Mr Lange, as we do not really know if he is doing this to drum up popularity or if he was hired by our competitors to discredit European manufacturers.
If he carries on in this way, he is going to be demanding that motorcyclists stop breathing so as to stop CO2 emissions.
So we say yes to cleaner motorcycles, yes to new testing procedures that are more in line with actual usage of vehicles and yes to a timetable that manufacturers deem realistic.
However, we say no to unrealistic emissions limits, no to additional provisions that are not imposed on other means of transport and, in short, we say no to Mr Lange' s amendments.
Jensen report (A5-0018/2001)
Madam President, I voted against this report on Community incentive measures in the field of employment.
EUR 55 million are to be spent and not a single job created.
EUR 55 million are to be spent on publishing, printing leaflets, statistics, and talk, talk, talk about how to increase employment.
I think the European Union should move on from words to deeds.
. I fully support proposals to encourage an employment strategy across the European Union.
We can only fight the scourge of unemployment if we work together right across the 15 Member States.
Jobs, jobs, jobs.
That is what it is all about.
That is what the Labour Government is campaigning for and that is what Europe is working for.
It is our top priority and we must move heaven and earth to make it happen.
The goals set at the Lisbon Summit last year were a crucial step forward in establishing the right conditions to achieve full employment, whereby the Heads of State and Government set the EU the objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth accompanied by quantitative and qualitative improvement of employment and of greater social cohesion.
The forthcoming Stockholm Council in March will continue to develop the European agenda for a flexible economy, liberalisation of gas and electricity markets, postal liberalisation, reform of the financial services sector, proposals on telecommunications and e-commerce, measures to create a favourable environment for SMEs, and targets for employment rates to benefit all our citizens in the European Union.
Cooperation throughout the Union is essential for exchanges of information and best practices, providing comparative analysis as well as promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences.
In Britain, our Labour Government is leading the way towards job creation and full employment.
Not only has youth unemployment been halved under Labour, but the government is now introducing vocational training for our young people to benefit from new skills in a high-tech and evolving job market.
The aim is to create a flexible, high-skilled workforce in Britain.
Madam President, I fully endorse this report which is yet another benchmark in our progress towards full employment in a dynamic knowledge-based economy.
The very title of this report arouses distrust because, generally speaking, incentives for employment are actually about granting employers aid, tax relief or tax advantages for job creation, when, in fact, they do not create any.
Of course, the text is not particularly explicit in this regard, and the basic intentions are wrapped up in general considerations, some of which are pertinent, particularly on the lack of equality between men and women in employment.
The expression of good intentions does not a policy make. Even more, this may indeed conceal a policy which provides no solution to the problem of unemployment.
In order to solve this problem, binding measures should be implemented with regard to those that hold the key to the problem, i.e. the major industrial and financial groups.
But to expect this of the European institutions is to ask the impossible.
We therefore voted against this report.
The report on which we voted today deals with a Commission proposal to implement Community employment incentive measures (EIM).
This proposal is intended to implement the provisions of Article 129 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (the legal basis for necessary expenditure on employment) and to develop the activities highlighted by the Lisbon European Council in the context of the European Employment Strategy.
The objective is to promote cooperation between Member States and support their action in the area of employment.
Such measures will be funded from the Community budget to a value of EUR 55 million for the period 2001-2005 (or EUR 10 million annually, with an initial allocation of EUR 15 million in 2001).
Measures focus chiefly on the development, programming, monitoring, follow-up and assessment of the European Employment Strategy, with a forward-looking emphasis.
More specifically, the following actions will be covered:
1) Analysis and assessment of employment trends, general policy conditions, assessment of policy options and of the impact of Community policies;
2) Assessment of national action plans;
3) Collation and transfer of national experience as defined in the annual employment guidelines issued to Member States;
4) Technical and scientific schemes required to develop common indicators, to improve and coordinate statistics, to rate performance and exchange information according to best practices.
In addition to implementing this range of measures, it is important for the Commission to take account of the statistical information, studies and actions produced by international organisations such as the OECD or the International Labour Organisation.
I also consider it essential to encourage the widest possible distribution of the results of any projects completed.
Parliament has also recommended that the Commission take steps to ensure that all the planned activities are consistent and complementary to other Community programmes and initiatives.
The planned activities shall, moreover, be open to the participation of EEA countries and those of Central and Eastern Europe countries subject to arrangements, especially financial arrangements, to be agreed with these countries.
I would also argue in favour of our Mediterranean partners being involved.
The European Parliament awaits an interim report from the Commission on 31 December 2003 and a final report on 31 December 2006.
While we all have in mind the preparations for the extraordinary Council meeting on employment to be held in Stockholm in March, I voted wholeheartedly in favour of these new measures to promote employment.
The proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment is in keeping with the rationale of the Luxembourg Compromise (1997), which initiated a process of assessment and comparison of 'best practice' between Member States.
In this context, the amendments seeking to inform European citizens better, to act in cooperation with the social partners and local or regional authorities, or those seeking to promote an increase in awareness of the position of women and professional equality by means of studies of the causes of career breaks, parental leave and part-time work are positive steps, and I shall vote in favour of them.
However, we oppose a method which seeks to subordinate employment and social rights in general to the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) and the stability plans.
We refute the logic enshrined in the four pillars of the Luxembourg Compromise (entering the labour market, enterprise spirit, business adjustment, equal opportunities) which are used as the criteria for assessment between Member States and will serve to support the development of a European labour market subordinated to the liberal economy.
I therefore abstained.
The purpose of this proposal for a European Commission decision is to implement the provisions of the new Article 129 of the EC Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam with the intention of intensifying cooperation between the Member States in the area of analysis, research and verification of labour market policy, while developing a knowledge-based economy, identifying best practice, promoting exchanges, transferring experiences and implementing an active information policy in the said sector.
It was important to emphasise the need for a European strategy that would be accessible and transparent.
This report also calls for a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of that strategy, and an analysis of needs, so as to put in place a made-to-measure plan which takes account of overall economic policy.
It therefore emphasises the possibility of using the strategy as a method to be applied to other areas and establishing an analysis of the types of factors which indicate the employment trend.
In order to consolidate the employment strategy at local and regional level, the rapporteur suggests using part of the appropriations at that level to promote cooperation, improve knowledge and the exchange of information and good practice, and evaluate the results of the application of national programmes benefiting employment at local and regional level.
The text, unanimously adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also highlights the need to guarantee consistency and complementarity with other Community measures and initiatives.
I also support the topping-up of appropriations for the implementation of the activities, to provide an overall figure of EUR 65 million rather than the 55 set by the Commission.
It is the duty of all Members of Parliament to work to boost employment for the good of our countries and Europe as a whole, to give the rising generations fresh hope.
That is why the Union for a Europe of Nations Group has supported this report.
Swoboda Report (A5-0024/2001)
Madam President, I voted in favour of the report implementing the next step in Turkey' s candidacy.
I am in favour of Turkey joining the European Union, but I ask all those concerned to add a clause to the agreement between Italy and Turkey.
I hope Turkey will be asked to commit its citizens to abandoning their dreadful custom of abducting the most beautiful Greek women, something they have been doing since the days of the Trojan War.
Their entry into the European Union will then be received with greater satisfaction.
Madam President, I voted against the report, not because I have anything against the Turkish people but because I am against the institutional system, which prevents true democracy.
As long as Turkey is not a truly democratic state and does not respect minorities or prisoners, political or otherwise, I consider this accession inappropriate.
In addition, we know that Turkey is hostile towards some Member States of the Union, when all they have done is recognise the Armenian genocide, which is a historical fact.
That is why I tabled an amendment calling for an investigation of Turkish democracy, like the one carried out for Austria.
If we want people to join us, they must be genuinely democratic, and Turkey is not.
Nor indeed is Italy, in certain respects, as the recent trials in Verona against my party demonstrate.
Madam President, I have voted against this proposal because of the profound contradiction that arises from the fact that this morning all the Members that have taken the floor on the proposal dealt with in Mr Swoboda's report have directly or indirectly recognised that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria.
Article 4 of this proposal includes a type of suspension clause if there is insufficient progress toward fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.
Now this proposal has been accepted I ask for Article 4 to be implemented and for aid to Turkey to be stopped until it meets the Copenhagen criteria.
Madam President, we remain concerned about Turkey.
On top of everything that has already been said, I would like to highlight the case of Kurdistan and the continued suffering borne by the Kurdish people at a mafia level: subjected to genuine genocide and forced to emigrate to other countries, leaving their own land.
And the Turkish Government has never done anything to stop it: indeed, as far as we know, it encourages it.
So, setting aside the past, setting aside what I represent as the heir of the Repubblica Serenissima which stood against the Turks in those days, there is very great concern, and I want to ask you, Madam President, to make absolutely certain that we are not going to have a serpent in our bosom in the near future.
. While I voted in favour of the Swoboda report on financial assistance for Turkey for the pre-accession strategy, I believe that the EU should be talking more toughly to the Turkish Government about its human rights abuses especially towards the Kurds.
It should also monitor fair distribution of the money.
In view of renewed military repression in the Kurdish south-east - with the probable aim of provoking the PKK - and recent arrests and disappearances of activists in HADEP (a legal political party) it seems Turkey is going backwards rather than forwards in respect of the Copenhagen criteria.
