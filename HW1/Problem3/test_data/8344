It is essential to consolidate those features which will allow European textile companies to compete on the open market.
The only possible methods of maintaining and increasing the significance and importance of the textiles and clothing sector in the European and world economies are research, technological development, information technology, training and professional development.
The institutions concerned should guarantee that conditions favour competitiveness and respect for international commercial law.
In particular, they should combat starvation wages and child labour, as well as promoting improvements in welfare and health benefits, guarantees of basic employment rights, and the adoption of anti-fraud and other provisions.
In the specific case of Portugal, the next step should be a round of multilateral negotiations, under the auspices of the Doha Development Agenda, which will then be translated into tariff harmonisation and removal of non-tariff barriers.
In practice, this will allow access to the market.
We are aware of the great challenge we are facing.
We maintain that future negotiations should be conducted thoroughly, without rushing, in order to achieve a balance between the Doha development commitments and the interests of the Union textile and clothing industry.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some of my fellow Members have already commented that 2005 will be a key date for the textiles and clothing sector.
The Commissioner's speech soothed and calmed our worries, but did not banish them completely.
The proposals and strategy he set out for us here today seem to be moving in the right direction.
The European textiles and clothing sector has been tossed on many threatening and stormy seas.
We must also remember that it was the first sector in Europe to be affected by the industrial revolution.
This sector should be treated with care, not considered redundant, as occasionally seems to be the case in the discourse of certain Eurocrats and negotiators.
For it is exposed to competition from products which, as we all know, are produced at minimal labour costs, in truly dire social conditions.
Naturally, Commissioner, Portugal appears anxious and expectant, as do other European regions and countries.
Some of my fellow Members have already said that this is a vital issue for Portugal, especially for northern areas of the country, and this point always bears repeating.
Are other countries, such as France, for example, not worried by the liberalisation of agricultural markets?
Does France not fight for the famous principal of cultural exception?
Since that is the case, it should come as no surprise that other countries of the European Union, with very significant industries and sectors in social and economic terms, demand justice and the proper defence of their rights, and will not make exceptions.
Encouraging poorer countries to develop is an ideal shared by all of us, particularly those on the left, such as myself.
Not, however, to the detriment of the most vulnerable economies and poorest citizens in the European Union.
That is false justice.
The cost of the complete liberalisation of the textile industry will not be distributed fairly if the negotiations are badly managed by all countries and companies involved.
Some will lose more than others, and the European spirit will be the weaker for it.
I wish you every success in the negotiations, Commissioner.
Moreover, when we are able to assess their results, we hope to be able to praise and applaud you as we have done in hope here today.
Madam President, I too appreciated Commissioner Lamy's statement, although I am quite aware that the future of textiles and clothing companies, which are already in difficulties because of the appreciation of the dollar, will depend on the decisions made within the WTO.
Removing quantitative barriers should provide a chance of growth even for the small and medium-sized enterprises which operate in the textiles regions of Europe.
These enterprises must be able to extend their interests to new markets and invent new forms of cooperation with the countries entering the international market.
The abolition of the MultiFibre Agreement will, however, lead to a situation which is characterised by more intense, concentrated competition in the mature markets.
We are not, of course, asking for protectionist measures; on the contrary, we are calling for more open, transparent markets, as Mrs Ferrer has said.
It is inevitable that globalisation of the markets should facilitate the decentralisation of many traditional activities towards developing countries, where production costs are lower.
The fight to eradicate poverty and disseminate prosperity must be furthered by the elimination of customs barriers, but the fact cannot be disregarded that the activities of many European industries are under greater threat from social and environmental dumping than from economic competition.
We would therefore like to focus on a number of points mentioned by the Commissioner.
Access must be improved for Community products, which are usually of higher quality, to third markets, many of which are protected by high duties and non-tariff barriers.
The liberalisation process must go hand in hand with a guarantee of reciprocity, as the Commissioner has rightly said.
The textiles and clothing industry must be shielded from unfair competition, which means that minimum standards of protection of the working environment must be guaranteed.
Lastly, given our experiences in other fields, not least, we should explore the possibility of launching a process which makes a quality label mandatory for textiles and clothing products, to provide a guarantee to the consumer but also to curb the flows of illegal imports which jeopardise economic growth and the proper functioning of international trade.
Madam President, Commissioner Lamy, your position deserves to be welcomed unreservedly, especially in that everything in the negotiations is to be based on the principle of reciprocity and in that you have also mentioned a point that strikes me as very important - the fact that additional accompanying measures are to be taken in order to make the textile industry more competitive with effect from 2005, and that this is already happening.
Whether this amounts to the creation of clusters or to something else, this is a very important measure, but it will probably need money.
Perhaps, Commissioner, there is one thing that I should point out.
Let us assume that, in 2005, European tariffs on textiles will be the lowest, and that barriers to trade, whether these be in the form of tariffs or not, will be being removed.
What I say to you, though, has to do with the history of the European Union's textile industry; it is that we will still, probably, have to deal with protectionist measures, or with the maintenance of protectionist measures, on the part of the United States or of Japan.
That is my main concern in all this, and there are signs that this is again happening already.
It is something we have often seen over the past twenty years.
How many times, or for how much longer, must these two textile power blocs be allowed to do as they please with Europe's textile industry?
I see that as one of the core issues.
What we need when it comes to the removal of barriers to trade, whether these be in the form of tariffs or not, is fairness; that is what needs to be promoted in this regard, both here and in the accession countries, where, I believe the main development in the textile industry will be.
I can see China and India being another major problem with which we will have to deal.
If China in particular is not induced to accept mechanisms of self-restraint, Europe can write off even its top-quality and most capital-intensive textile industry.
We should not lose sight of that when we go to the negotiating table.
Last, but not least, I would like to point out, having just come from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that we continue to be concerned that core labour standards and principles of human rights should not be shelved, and that they are of great importance, particularly where China is concerned.
We trade unionists in the textiles industry have made a series of documentary films in countries such as Bangladesh, showing where problems with child labour and discrimination are really to be found.
Madam President, for us in Greece, the textile sector is particularly important, both for our industry and for the economy as a whole.
Unfortunately, the Palko clothing factory closed recently, turning hundreds of workers out into the street.
In the face of this worrying picture, there are a further two elements which, I think, add to our concerns.
First, we have what is, of course, an unavoidable reduction in duty from the end of 2004, beginning of 2005, on third country imports and, secondly, we have the perennial problem of third countries, especially Pakistan and the countries of the Far East, giving their textile industries visible or invisible subsidies.
Obviously, this situation needs to be addressed.
I shall refer, by way of example, to four areas of action.
First, an observatory needs to be set up on our part so that we can monitor third country subsidies and report them both to the World Trade Organisation and wherever else necessary.
Secondly, a systematic effort must be made for our quality products to penetrate third countries, by dealing with the various ways this effort is being circumvented by third countries.
Thirdly, we need to turn our attention to imitation products.
A proposal has already been submitted for a label which should be adopted on our part.
Other proposals can also be adopted, but the most important thing is for us to agree on the objective and, fourthly, given that this sector is important for employment, I think that the European Union should use European Commission programmes to help reinforce the sector.
This can be done both through the community support framework and outside the community support framework, especially in the field of research and technology and innovation so that we can reinforce the sector as regards competitiveness, which is the key word.
I think that the Commissioner is moving in the right direction, but we all need to urge him to step up his efforts so that we can address the huge problem that we appear to face.
Madam President, I too welcome the Commission statement and particularly look forward to the post-2005 report about the future of the textiles industry.
Like other speakers, I also represent one of the regions of the European Union which is heavily dependent on textiles, the East Midlands.
There are 2 000 textile companies and 60 000 people directly employed in the industry.
It contributes GBP 4 billion a year to the regional economy.
Opening up trade and access creates challenges.
Some of our companies have responded by developing new types of technical textiles, for example a Hinckley company developed special flight socks, and a Derby company developed special heat-resistant clothing for use by firefighters.
But we need to recognise within the EU that not all companies are able to evolve in this way.
The Commissioner mentioned the essential sector of textiles for developing countries.
It is true that developing countries' economies could receive a huge boost for a more open trading regime, but this is not automatic and not without its problems.
If we are not careful, we might end up with increased mobility of exploitation, which would hardly achieve either the goals of the EU or the legitimate goals of the poorer and poorest countries in the world.
We should, of course, endeavour to use trade agreements to spread core labour values and to carry out the delicate task of improving conditions for workers in developing countries who often see such moves as hidden protectionism.
We still see child labour, serious union repression and predominantly low-paid women.
Those three factors, incidentally, are also present within the European Union.
Commissioner, you have a Herculean task ahead of you to reconcile all of this, and we very much hope you are going to have success.
It is necessary for textile workers within the EU and those many in other parts of the world who seek to earn their living and improve their own economies and their own lives through the textiles industry.
Madam President, I would like first of all to thank the groups that have expressed their support for this strategy, which I have tried to outline in answer to your questions.
I will now respond to the few further points raised in your speeches.
Mrs Ferrer, I share your vision for the future of the textiles and clothing sector in Europe.
There is a word for it: dynamism.
It is a vision of an industry on the offensive.
The textiles and clothing industry is not an industry of the past whose gradual shrinkage needs to be managed as painlessly as possible.
That is not my view of it, and it is not yours.
It is not the idea behind our commercial and industrial policies.
It is also what I understood from what Mr Lage said.
Mr Berenguer Fuster, indeed, we will continue to lower our tariff protection only if others do the same.
Whether you call it reciprocity or you call it something else, it is the basis of our policy.
And you are right to stress, as Mr Hatzidakis also does, that there are intellectual property issues behind all that and that it is important that we continue to fight - as we are doing over geographical ascriptions, for example - to ensure that everything that makes for quality, everything that is of good taste, everything to do with design and that is often our comparative advantage is not illegally imitated and therefore, in a way, stolen.
Mrs Figueiredo, yes, we are working on the impact of further liberalisation on employment, on the regional fabric and on skills.
It is in fact part of the idea we are working on with Mr Erkki Liikanen for a post-2005 strategy that we would like to be able to present in the autumn of this year.
Mrs Lambert and Mrs Read have stressed the link between trade and fundamental social norms.
To the question: can we make this link? I have a very clear and very frank answer.
Yes, we can make it in our unilateral commercial policy.
When we give advantages, we can give additional advantages by establishing this link, and that is what we are doing.
Yes, we can do it at bilateral level.
When we enter into association agreements or trade agreements with some third countries, observance of fundamental social norms is part of our bilateral agreements.
Yes, we can do it by working, as we have started to do - and as Mr Bodrato has suggested - on fair-trade labelling, which allows consumers, citizen consumers, to choose between products manufactured under conditions that are more or less sustainable from a social and environmental point of view.
On the other hand, no, we cannot for the present do it multilaterally.
We have tried, we Europeans.
It was virtually the only failure at Doha: on this point we came up, at multilateral level, against a coalition of refusals formed by the United States on the one hand and the developing countries on the other.
This link is not therefore part of the programme that will take us to the end of 2004.
We will have to come back to it later.
Mr Bastos, I agree with your concept of fair negotiations.
But we must make a distinction, in social matters, between, on the one hand, the basic social norms - child labour, equal pay for men and women, trade union rights, a ban on forced labour - that are part of the multilateral commitments given by most of the countries on this planet, and, on the other hand, wage norms.
We know that wages in the developing countries are lower than here.
In a way, they are lower by definition because otherwise they would not be developing countries.
That does not mean we do not all want to see them rise.
Mr Ettl is right: non-tariff barriers often replace tariff barriers when they are removed.
A lot of governments play that game.
In a way, we have become experts in detecting, attacking and dealing with this kind of device, and we are constantly improving our information system, together with our partners on both sides of industry, so that we can detect such practices better, sooner and more quickly, since in many cases they are in fact incompatible with international trade rules.
These are the answers I wanted to give.
I will conclude by saying that in a sense this sector is a textbook case of globalisation as we Europeans and the European Commission conceive it.
Yes, globalisation has its effects.
Yes, globalisation results in relocation.
Yes, it is a challenge to our competitiveness, our creativity and our skills.
That is why we need public policies to create a framework that will allow the sector to continue to move upmarket, to continue to create added value, to continue to increase in quality.
That is only possible if the rules of the game are established and followed.
That used to be true at national level.
It has become true at European level.
It is in the process of becoming true at world level.
Thank you, Commissioner Lamy, especially for your straightforward reactions to MEPs' points of view.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9.05 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0170/2003) by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, I do indeed wish to take the floor on a point of order, specifically to invoke the Rules of Procedure.
We were surprised yesterday to be presented with a new and very lengthy set of amendments.
These were tabled as compromise amendments, but they are not in fact compromise amendments, since no compromise was reached on any of the amendments tabled in Parliament.
They represent a whole new approach, which we know to be the clear result of the last Council meeting.
When there are more than 50 amendments, Rule 130a of our Rules of Procedure gives the President the right to request that the committee meet to consider the matter.
We believe, then, that this would be the correct procedure if we are to operate democratically and openly.
Given the number of amendments tabled, we should discuss the matter again in committee.
We could then vote on the report during the July part-session.
We cannot understand why we are due to work under the conditions anticipated for this evening and tomorrow.
They are difficult for us to accept.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro, in principle, we will do what we can this evening to ensure that no difficult situation arises and I will raise this issue with Parliament's President.
We will adhere to the Rules of Procedure, but today we shall interpret them in such a way that the debate can go ahead as well as any relevant resolutions, if appropriate.
We take very good note of Mr Ribeiro e Castro's words.
On behalf of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio has the floor.
.
(ES) Mr President, the aim of this proposal is to implement once and for all the aims set out in Amsterdam in Article 191 of the Treaty on European Union.
This article was supplemented by the Treaty of Nice when the latter added a legal basis for adopting the necessary legislative measures through the codecision procedure and qualified majority voting.
Political parties at European level are an important part of the democratic structure of the Union.
They are a factor for integration.
They contribute to forming a European awareness, to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union and to promoting political debate at European level.
To be able to do this they must have resources.
It is therefore appropriate and necessary that they should be helped to carry out the tasks conferred on them by the Treaty and that they should consequently receive at least partial financing from the Community budgets.
The Regulation seeks to establish a solid and transparent legislative framework for the recognition and financing of European political parties.
We are not starting from scratch, ladies and gentlemen; this new proposal is based on the constructive work undertaken by Parliament and the Council in 2001, particularly during the Belgian Presidency.
I wish, in this regard, to congratulate Mrs Schleicher, who served as rapporteur at the time.
We have taken advantage of the new opportunities provided by majority voting in comparison to the 2001compromise to propose higher thresholds for obtaining financing.
Our basic proposal has sought to avoid political requirements that are too restrictive for European political parties for two main reasons: firstly, we want an open and plural system in which all shades of opinion can be represented in the European debate; secondly, if things were done otherwise, the debate in Council and in Parliament would be drawn out unnecessarily, perhaps even beyond the 2004 European elections.
All three institutions agree that a European political party that wishes to be recognised as such and to obtain financing from the Community budget must fulfil certain minimum conditions.
We have sought to establish conditions that are not too restrictive but which are coherent and fundamental.
Parties must be representative, must have a statute and aims, they must prove their intention to stand in European elections, they must have clear rules for their financial management and above all respect the democratic principles established in Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
At the same time, there must be a reliable verification system.
Parliament must be able to verify whether all of these conditions are met before registering a party.
Furthermore, there is a special verification procedure for cases in which a minority in Parliament rejects the initial decision.
In order to receive financing, we propose that the parties have representatives elected at European, national and regional level in one third of the Union's States, because these are supposed to be European parties and this is the European arena and, therefore, the arena that needs to be boosted.
In line with Declaration No 11 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Commission proposal prohibits the cross-financing of national political parties.
It also prohibits political groups from raising financing by providing services, unless these are paid for in a verifiable and documented way, in other words, through bills.
Article 8 sets out strict control and auditing measures to strengthen the transparency and legitimacy of the system; we consider that parties should not depend completely on public financing and we therefore propose that they should raise at least 25% of their budget themselves.
We have made a balanced proposal on the controversial issue of donations in line with the 2001 compromise and consequently propose that donations should be permitted, although only if they satisfy strict conditions of transparency.
To conclude, Mr President, I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved, on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament, in which the Commission played a part and which should, we hope, enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading.
I congratulate Mr Leinen and the Presidency, and on behalf of the Commission I wish to express our full acceptance of and support for this compromise, which we consider to be appropriate and which will meet the needs of the various players involved in this complex matter.
.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mrs de Palacio that, without European parties, there will be no European democracy.
That is why it is vitally important that this House should, tomorrow, approve this act on the statute and financing of European political parties, for then, as soon as this summer, something that is, in particular, a corner-stone of greater transparency in European politics can become effective, and the parties will have enough time, between now and the elections in June 2004, to adjust themselves to the new arrangements that this law makes necessary.
By adopting this act tomorrow, Parliament will also be honouring a promise, made to the Court of Auditors, that it would, within the life of this Parliament, submit a new basis for the financing of European political work and put an end to the cross-subsidisation of party work via this House and the political groups within it.
The fact is that, in all our countries, the functions of parties and parliaments are kept separate, and this law will give us the opportunity to both distinguish between the different functions and roles of parties on the one hand and parliamentary groups on the other, and also to make them a reality, at EU level as is the case elsewhere, by means of the new basis on which they are funded.
Thanks are due to the political groups for having, so to speak, acted as midwives at the birth of the European political parties.
Without them, there would have been nobody capable of funding them.
The draft now before you is something we regard as an acceptable compromise.
It complies with the conditions imposed by the majority on the committee, and minor changes have been made to it.
There are compromise motions that we are putting forward, which we can vote on tomorrow, and indeed we are meant to.
The reduction of the threshold for a European political party's representation in the European Parliament from one third to one quarter of the Member States enables smaller political parties to participate in this system of financing.
One quarter is, however, a necessary threshold even if we want to prevent the fragmentation of the party political landscape while taking into account the fact that we are also incorporating the regional parliaments and also the regional assemblies into the system.
I believe that one quarter makes for a sensible compromise on which to agree.
Donations to political parties differ widely from one country to another and are another sensitive and highly controversial issue.
The draft act has, I believe, come down decisively on one side of the line.
Donations to the European political parties are to be made as transparent as possible.
We have compromised on a ceiling of EUR 12 000 per annum for each donor; although some find it too high, and others too low, no political party can be bought for EUR 12 000.
It is my belief that support must also be given if political work is fostered by society rather than only by the State - that is right and proper, provided that transparency exists and controls are in place.
The way is now open for the European political parties to expand their activities in the run-up to the European elections.
There had at first been some doubts about this, and those who jeopardise this are also putting in question the reason and purpose for European political parties' existence.
I believe that this document makes proper provision for such matters, and it will be important even after the draft Constitution has been produced, as the European Parliament of the future is to elect the President of the Commission.
The parties will of course be very important in this regard.
Let me also point out that there is a fly in the ointment.
This statute does not yet confer European legal personality, but the financing sees us taking the first step, with the second step, in the form of an actual European statute, perhaps yet to come.
I have always maintained that the European law on political parties must be to politics what the European Company is to business.
We will get back to the subject when Parliament draws up a report in two years' time.
I also have to thank the Commission for having come up with the proposal, and Mrs de Palacio and Mr Fitzmaurice many times over for their constant active involvement.
I congratulate the Greek Presidency of the Council and all the governments who were ready to accept this compromise; Mr Nikos Matthioudakis was my constant partner in the truest sense of the word, and he and I were able to hammer out this compromise together.
Let me also thank my fellow-Members: Mr Dimitri Tsatsos, whose report many years ago laid the foundations for this whole topic; Mrs Schleicher for her report two years ago; and also the political groups, the shadow rapporteurs, and the secretariat, which has done outstanding work on this.
Tomorrow, we can vote in favour.
I hope that we will.
We will then have taken an important step for political work at EU level, and thus also for European democracy.
Thank you, all those who have helped in this!
.
(DE) Mr President, this Statute is important, and it must not be allowed to go under.
That is one reason why I am sure that by far most of our committee can live with the fact that this compromise takes no account of a number of our important points; this is, though, a parliament and not a meeting of diplomats, and that is why a certain number of things remain to be said.
In the committee, we favoured putting the financing of European political parties under the Commission's budget rather than Parliament's.
In this afternoon's debate in this Chamber on the outcome of the Convention, Mr HÃ€nsch told us: 'The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century.'
We have to remind ourselves of this when discussing the question: what about the requirement that parties be independent of the state?
If we take that as being fundamental, we may well get different answers to that question at European and at national level.
It may be that the reasoning underlying the imperative that states should be at arms' length from political parties and their financial arrangements, is best satisfied if, at European level, they are linked to the Commission rather than to Parliament.
Our committee was in favour of incorporating tougher sanctions in the event of political parties failing to comply with the requirements of financial transparency.
We wanted the money not merely to be repaid; we wanted it to repay twice the amount.
If there is not to be too great a temptation to do this, then sanctions must really hurt.
That is why it is regrettable that it was not possible to negotiate this with the Council.
There are two further comments I would like to make on the questions that have cropped up.
The way the Commission said that the doubling of the amount was not on, because there was no provision for it in the Financial Regulation, reminded me of encounters with people who say such things as, 'that is how we have always done it', 'we have never done it like that before', and 'who knows what would come of it?'
Those are the sort of archetypal experiences that you get with bureaucracies.
Or what was said on the subject of the question raised in the original draft, to the effect that 'you in the political parties can do anything except fund election campaigns'; if that was the line taken over a long period of time by the national governments and the Commission, then that is another reason why the bureaucracies of the Council and the Commission were known and feared throughout Europe for their capacity for innovation, and I think we should not forget that, when it comes to taking decisions, a bit more awareness of real life would do us all some good.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if, tomorrow, we adopt this compromise in the form in which the political groups have joined in presenting it, we will have reached the end of a never-ending story, and it is to be hoped that the ending we will give it will be a happy one.
It is in fact Parliament that is the heart of the European parties, for it was in Parliament that the need arose to develop commonalities within Europe, and, if you bear in mind that 133 political parties are represented today in this House, united in seven political families, that alone shows how there are no limits to the work done for Europe, in this House, by the political groups, which, in the European Parliament, bring together the states whose political parties are elected to the European Parliament.
That is, in itself, unbelievably laborious work, and I believe that we sometimes undervalue it.
Why has this been a never-ending story?
It was Mr Tsatsos - and let me say that I believe this has been his life's work - who produced the first report to this House aimed at fostering awareness of how necessary European political parties are.
Then we had Amsterdam, which made it possible to get an initiative going, but, as the Council at that time was unable to come to an agreement, Parliament's report was left high and dry in the Council.
I would now like to extend warm thanks to the Commission.
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February this year, the Commission presented a proposal in the shortest conceivable time; now that we have considered it, I can tell you that they made a very quick job of it.
The end result has been that we have not only considered it, but will - it is to be hoped - be finalising it tomorrow.
I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his considerable efforts, and I can say on behalf of all of us that, even though we have not got everything we wanted, we still want a solution, and, as I see it, we need one in view of the fact that the Court of Auditors has ended up presenting us with the prospect of having, at the end of this year, to abandon the current practice, which gives the parties stability, and if we do not find a solution, we will then be facing oblivion.
That is why, yet again, I would like to ask all those among you who still have doubts, to lend a hand in the completion of a work and in finding an eventual solution, one that is clear and open to scrutiny and, therefore, one that has to work.
I would therefore like to thank not only Mr Leinen, but also the Greek Presidency of the Council, which, with all the work it has to do - and there are many other matters to deal with -made a real effort and did everything possible to get the Council to come up with a joint resolution.
I do think that we in this House should not only express our appreciation of this, but should also say that it is because everyone has done their bit that we are now coming to a conclusion.
In every democratic state the world over, this political order, which secures for the people freedom and co-determination, is founded upon political parties and guaranteed by them.
We simply have to see that, as the European Economic Community developed and expanded into the European Union, it was therefore hardly surprising that European political parties should undergo a parallel development.
It is for that reason that I am appealing to all those who may perhaps still harbour doubts to play their part in helping us, tomorrow, to achieve a result that will lay a foundation, one on the basis of which political parties can be funded, one that will make the future continuation of this work possible.
So, again, I thank all those involved and all those who will, tomorrow, help us to achieve this outcome.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying immediately on behalf of my Group that we accept the compromise that has been so skilfully negotiated between the rapporteur, the Greek Presidency and the Commission on this text.
I would like to congratulate those involved on having worked so hard to make it possible for us to reach a first reading agreement so that this legislation can be adopted in good time before the next European elections.
I would like to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur, Jo Leinen, in this respect, and indeed to all those who came before him in preparing the way, notably Professor Tsatsos in his report a number of years ago.
This is an exercise in transparency, no more, no less.
It puts on a clear and transparent footing the method by which the Union will finance trans-national European political parties.
Up to now it has been done indirectly via the political groups in the European Parliament, henceforth it will be done directly according to clear criteria and clear procedures set out in this legislation.
That is why we welcome it.
My group also accepts the various compromises that have been made as regards the detail.
Frankly, we would have preferred a higher threshold in Article 3, as regards the representativity of European political parties, but we are happy to accept, in the spirit of compromise that is necessary in the European Union, that this somewhat lower threshold will apply.
We are particularly pleased that the issue of donations has been settled, and that a clear, transparent and limited system where any donation to a political party is limited in level and also has to be registered on a register is laid down in the text.
There are a few strange little things in the text where I think the lawyer-linguists need to look at some of the translation versions.
It is not a matter of amending the text formally in the plenary, but when the toilettage of the text is done I would like them to look notably at Article 5(2), where the English version specifies that Parliament verifies that a party meets the necessary conditions by a majority of its Members.
Is that a majority of Members needing to accept that a party meets the conditions, or a majority of Members needing to challenge that a party no longer meets the necessary conditions?
The text in the English version is not clear and it would be useful if that were tidied up when the translations are verified.
Similarly, that Article makes no mention - it may just be a typing error - of the verification of Article 3d. It mentions 3a, 3b and 3c, but 3d seems to be missing.
No doubt this can easily be corrected.
Finally, on Article 6, point (c), the fourth and last indent in the English version reads as if it almost contradicts the previous indent.
I think it is clear what the intention was in drafting it this way, but it has not been very well rendered in the English language version and it would be useful to correct it.
Those conclude my comments on behalf of the PSE Group.
Mr President, I had no idea that I had that effect on microphones!
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work. I would also like to congratulate the Council for having finally seen sense, assisted, it must be said, by the introduction of qualified majority voting.
There are great lessons there for us in the Convention and in the IGC.
The Council has finally moved to a common position which the large majority of Liberals are able to accept fully.
The first draft sought - absurdly - to outlaw political party campaigning with public money.
What on earth are political parties for if they are not for campaigning?
The new draft, however, has corrected this and is allowing sufficient possibility for political parties to receive modest private donations.
The question of the threshold is settled quite reasonably in favour of small political movements with real and serious European objectives.
Certain other officious bureaucratic provisions have been removed.
This is good news for parliamentary democracy in Europe.
Trans-national political parties are a vital sinew of democracy, articulating the anxieties and the aspirations of the citizen on a European scale.
The constitutionalisation process in which the Union is presently involved requires the engagement of mature European political parties.
This report is a breakthrough and should be supported by all those who wish this institution well and who subscribe to the principles of transparency and accountability.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you will be aware that there are, within my political group, differences of opinion and diverse views on the purpose of European political parties, and of the rationale behind them.
I am, myself, in favour of them.
I am convinced that, as integration continues to progress, they will be able to help our continent to continue to grow together and also help, progressively, to foster European awareness in every Member State.
That is why I also think it a good thing that this overriding idea should be incorporated in the Convention's draft for the Constitution, where it is enshrined in law in Article 45(4) in the section on 'Democratic Life in the European Union'.
I wish to add my gratitude to that expressed by Members of this House to the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, to the Greek Presidency of the Council and also to the Commission, for enabling an acceptable compromise to be worked out yesterday.
I see this as being very important in terms of this House's political credibility.
As those who spoke before me have pointed out, this problem has been pursuing us for a long time, and it must now be sorted out once and for all, as it is, above all, in the public's interest that there should be nothing that the Court of Auditors might criticise in future.
It is for that reason that I support the text of the regulation.
In particular, the provisions in Article 3 on the 3% threshold and on the parties being represented in at least one quarter of the Member States are really important, especially to the smaller political parties.
Commissioner De Palacio is of course quite right to say that it is an absolute requirement that the regulation should take political pluralism into account.
I regard the proposed rules on donations as clear and unambiguous.
Above all, they safeguard the transparency of party finances, which is indispensable and - as you will be aware - a sensitive point, perhaps the most sensitive of all.
This House should, in my view, speak out in favour of all information relating to donations being accessible to the public at any time.
It would be for the best if, when the regulation takes effect, the political parties themselves were to undertake to post on the Internet all data relating to income from donations.
With this in mind, I wish to express my endorsement of this proposal for a regulation.
Mr President, I represent as you say, a composite group in this, the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance, and I would like to thank personally Jo Leinen very much for his colleaguely courtesy and goodwill in carrying out this work.
Undoubtedly, unlike Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I think that what has been produced is a genuine attempt at a compromise and one which I believe a majority of my Group will be happy to accept, although other colleagues who will speak in the debate will draw attention to particular points of concern.
From the point of view of the European Free Alliance which I particularly represent here, there are, however, genuine concerns about the way in which the criteria are chosen: the way in which one specifies what counts.
Currently in this Parliament, the European Free Alliance represents a wide range of what we would think of as distinct countries within the European Union - Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Flanders, Galicia, Scotland and Wales, to take them in alphabetical order in the English language - but of course, from the point of view of a criterion based upon States, that is only three States.
When I look at the new flags beautifully adorning the podium there, I see that there are flags of many countries which are present or future Member States and which are actually, in terms of either territory or population or both, considerably smaller than the countries I have mentioned.
So the kind of movement in thought - and it is a European movement in thought - which the European Free Alliance represents is actively discriminated against by a criterion specified simply in terms of a proportion of the total number of Member States.
That really is something that needs to be reflected upon.
A Parliament of this kind and a Union of this kind must have a very particular regard for the interests of minorities and for fairness to minorities and the rights of smaller groups.
I know that the compromise has aimed to move in our direction and I appreciate that very much, but the fact of the matter is that there is still a serious difficulty from the point of view of this genuine European tide of opinion.
The European Free Alliance has been recognised for a long time as one of the original Europe-wide political families, and yet we will stand on the margins of being excluded and de-recognised under these proposals.
I am afraid we cannot support them in this form.
Mr President, the supranational political parties are artificial products that are in no position to collect voluntary contributions from ordinary people.
They must, therefore, instead receive contributions from big business and trade unions and be able to dip into EU funds.
Those who are to use the money can themselves decide how much they want.
Under the new constitution, 13 countries will be able to vote down 12.
The large parties will be able to use their majorities to prohibit subsidies for the smaller parties.
They can also declare parties supported by the electorate to be un-European and take their subsidies.
The Council meeting also removed a ban on involvement in national elections.
The supranational parties can thus turn the national parties into their compliant subsidiaries.
The proposal has totalitarian features.
Let us put together a coalition to bring the matter before the Court of Justice.
The proposal before us contravenes the principle of equality.
In my opinion, the legislation is unlawful and should therefore be tested by the Court of Justice.
For example, it is impossible for national minorities to obtain subsidies, even if they carry on appropriately cross-border activities.
This makes matters impossible for new movements and parties, and difficult for others.
There is a lack of equality across the board, and there needs to be such equality, in accordance with my own constitution, the existing treaties and the draft constitution that is now on the way.
They all contain a principle of equality that also applies to this proposal.
Mr President, as I said in my minority opinion attached to the Leinen report, the action of political parties at European level ought to be fed from the base, that is by the national political parties and the citizens, and not from the top by the European institutions.
That is the first condition for encouraging a living democracy instead of creating an artificial democracy from scratch.
The second condition would be to reject the idea of a statute for political parties, which was introduced by the Treaty of Nice; it seems to have more to do with bureaucracy than with a free society.
Apart from this objection of principle, we also have a strong objection concerning the details, because the Commission's proposal does not seem to us to be in conformity with the treaties.
It wants in fact to finance European political parties, whereas the treaty uses a much broader expression, 'political parties at European level', which includes action at European level by national political parties.
In our opinion, that constitutes real discrimination.
Finally, Mr President, I support Mr Ribeiro e Castro's request that this text be referred back to the committee pursuant to Rule 130a of the Rules of Procedure, since 75 amendments have been tabled, which is far more than the limit of 50.
I have heard Mr Leinen's reply that some of those amendments are compromise amendments, but that concept does not in fact exist in the Rules of Procedure.
Whether they are simple or compromise amendments, the text must be referred back to the committee if there are more than 50 amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, ladies and gentlemen, last week - last Friday - the Convention, with the consent of the representatives of the governments and national parliaments of 28 countries, of the European Parliament and of the Commission, adopted the draft constitution for the EU.
Many of us see this as having been an historic day.
This draft, which brought the Convention's labours to an end, is meant to make Europe more transparent, efficient and democratic, and to bring it closer to the people.
In our own time, parliamentary democracy is characterised by political parties campaigning in elections and by parliamentary deputies - nominated by these parties and directly elected by the citizens - joining together in political groups in the parliaments.
The Convention is strengthening the European Parliament by extending the codecision procedure, conferring upon Parliament full budgetary powers and giving it the right to elect the President of the Commission after the results of the elections to the European Parliament have been taken into account.
Although we have spent the past few days applauding that this is so, and rejoicing that we have at last reached our destination, we have had, to date, no legally binding statute for Members of the European Parliament, because the Council is blocking it.
Up to now, there has been no regulation on the legal status and financing of European political parties.
We have no uniform right to vote.
There are no European lists on which we can vote for candidates.
Parliament's adoption, during the last part-session in Strasbourg, of a Statute for its Members, closed a loophole.
When, as I hope we will do tomorrow, we adopt the resolution on the legal status of European political parties - and especially following the Council's decision on Monday, which we very much welcome - we will be closing a second loophole in democratic politics.
My group supports the document before us and the compromise motions, having vigorously campaigned to get this loophole in democratic politics closed.
In doing so, we have done what Amsterdam and Nice have required of us.
We are fulfilling our promise to the Court of Auditors by putting a stop to cross-subsidies between groups and parties, where such a thing still exists.
By doing this, we are creating greater transparency, openness and clarity in political work and in the way in which political parties' activities are funded.
By doing this, we are helping to make the national political parties more European and the work at European level more democratic.
We are, then, creating the conditions for European lists and for a uniform European right to vote.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is glad that a distinction has been drawn between the work of the Groups in this House and that of the political parties, as also between the functions of national parties and the work of European ones.
We rejoice at the clear demarcation between European election campaigns and those in the nation-states.
We welcome the clear rules on what donors can do.
We welcome the clear qualitative and quantitative criteria and the requirement for democratic legitimacy, both of which must be provided for and complied with if a party is to have European status.
This does not amount to discrimination against small groups, for a party is European only if it operates not only at national level, but also in a specified number of Member States in which it enjoys democratic legitimacy and has partners.
This leads me to ask you all, tomorrow, to close the continuing loophole in democratic politics and thereby to ensure greater transparency and clarity.
Mr President, I warmly recommend voting in favour of the excellent Leinen report.
In his report, Mr Leinen explores the history of the institution of political parties.
We owe him our thanks.
With this proposal for a vote in favour tomorrow, the European political parties will acquire a legal basis and will strengthen the democratic character of the European Union.
Again, my warmest thanks to Mr Leinen, as well as to Mrs Schleicher and Mr Corbett for their courteous reference to my somewhat older contributions.
I will not conceal my personal satisfaction.
I must also praise the work carried out by Mrs Schleicher during the previous stage.
The European Parliament should be satisfied with the Council of Ministers' wording on both the questions at issue, both on the minimum number of Member States in which the party is active and on the sensitive issue of funding.
Besides, the compromise amendments submitted resolve any problems there may be.
The democratic benefits of giving European political parties a legal status are many.
I would refer to the following: there will be a deepening of the legitimacy of the European institutions.
Giving the European political parties a legal status is a valuable complement to the constitutionalisation of the Treaties.
In the field of the European political parties, the principle of solidarity between peoples at social level will be implemented via the substantial political rally of the national parties of the Member States.
The role of the European citizen will no longer finish when he votes in elections to the European Parliament; it will extend to his mobilisation within the framework of the European political parties.
The European citizen will turn from a citizen into an active citizen.
On the question of funding, it brings transparency and protection of the party institution from unknown or questionable financial sources.
Only with the institution of the European political parties can the process of unification in Europe finally become our affair, by which I mean the affair of the European citizens.
I would like to finish by congratulating the Greek Presidency, the excellent diplomats Messrs Mathioudakis and Venizelos, and also by informing the House of the personal interest of President Kostas Simitis who, both as a politician and as a specialist, had paid a great deal of attention to the institution of political parties.
It was his particular wish to be able to count this law among the successes and work of the Greek Presidency.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that I am in favour of simple, clear, transparent ground rules for the political groups in the European Parliament.
I am, however, opposed on principle to the use of taxpayers' money for political parties.
It is quite simply a question of whether parties are to be supported by public funds or by members of the individual parties.
I believe they should be supported by the latter.
In this matter, it is not the people, or the electorate, that have created a need for publicly financed political parties.
The need that has arisen in this case has been created by professional politicians, and that is, as I see it, an artificial need.
For what is a European party?
For the individual taxpayer, it exists solely on paper and is a mere mirage, devoid of substance.
In financial terms, there are no large amounts involved - as yet.
This is the thin end of the wedge, however.
I anticipate the aid increasing all the time, and it would grow at a rate in excess of the general rate of inflation.
I also think a question mark can be placed over the democratic element in this proposal.
The principle must be that, if we absolutely must give taxpayers' money to European parties, all parties should be given it, and that would not be the case under the proposal.
I am in favour of clear transparent rules, but I am not in favour of aid for European parties, and that is why I also reject this proposal.
Mr President, the large groups in this House must be feeling like the cat that got the cream, for there will now be millions pouring into their party coffers, and they will be able to afford fun and games throughout Europe.
The result of our debates is, then, that the taxpayer will have to finance and pay for all manner of banquets held by European political parties.
It is annoying, but there is no altering matters.
It is therefore our most important task to ensure that the aid is transparent.
It needs to be possible for any citizen to check all donations to the parties on the Internet and, in the same way, the European parties' accounts must be accessible to anyone curious about them.
Matters are not very satisfactory at present.
For example, the accounts of the three big political parties are closed and opaque affairs.
This is something we need, of course, to sort out, and I should therefore like to call for detailed monitoring of, and clear rules governing, what the money is used for.
Allow me therefore to call upon everyone to take a look at the parties' accounts in order to see whether they can in actual fact deduce anything from them.
I can tell you now that they will not be able to.
All they will be able to do is hope that party members will have had some really good junkets and beanfeasts around Europe at the taxpayers' expense.
Mr President, I would like to begin by showing you these: empty envelopes.
I will explain why when I have finished what I have to say.
I would also like to congratulate my friend Mr Jo Leinen on the quality of his work.
It is almost faultless.
He was right to draw attention to the importance of European parties, which are a vital structural tool in our continental debate.
I think the representativeness threshold is right, with the reference to regional parliaments and setting a 3% threshold for European elections.
The clause on checking conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights also seems a good one to me.
On the other hand, I am still waiting for just one fellow Member to explain to me why a company would spontaneously give money to a political party.
It seems to me that when you have to render account to shareholders and you give money, it is in return for a service.
It also seems to me, as a mere democrat, that when an elected representative receives money for a service to be rendered, that is called corruption.
Then people say to me: yes, but it will be transparent.
I am not sure that transparency in corruption is a great step forward.
They also tell me it will be very, very little money, the amounts will be tiny.
If they will be so very small, why not none at all?
If it is as little as that, let us do without that little and let us not prime the pump.
Especially since the pump will be directed essentially at the parties in power, who will be able to return the favour.
It will then be even easier for them to hold on to power because they will have money.
They will be able to render more services and then we will be back where we started.
This brings me back to my envelopes.
Like those I have in my hand, the envelopes will multiply, fill with money and circulate, because it will be so easy to break amounts down to avoid all the ceilings and evade all the transparencies.
I therefore give you due warning this evening: a day will come, ladies and gentlemen, when the newspaper headlines and the courts will be full of scandals involving the hidden financing of European political parties.
I know that democracy, which serves the public sphere, has a cost, but that cost must be borne by the public sphere and by it alone.
Mr President, accepting for a moment the rapporteur's central premise that political parties play a central role in contemporary democracy, the role played by them is on a national stage, even MEPs belong to national parties, and they represent their national electorates.
On the other hand, European political parties simply do not exist in any coherent form except in the minds of enthusiastic integrationists.
The proposed European Union Constitution prohibits 'any discrimination based on any grounds such as sex, race, colour, political or any other opinion'.
It also says that political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union.
Two recent opinion polls in the UK gave figures of 92% and 96% as wanting to leave the European Union, and yet this proposal would deny funding to any party who should dare to represent the views of that very large proportion of its citizens.
It therefore goes against not only the spirit but the very letter of your Constitution.
It does not promote democracy, it reduces it.
With this proposal, you are travelling down a very slippery slope.
Mr President, much as I respect Mr Leinen, I have rarely seen such a lousy draft as the one about European political parties.
Moreover, it is not by chance that this debate is taking place at 10 p.m. and in secret.
EUR 8 million are being shared out among us and it is clearly being done with the utmost discretion.
Sharing among us is of course a manner of speaking.
There are about 20 Members present and at least six or seven of those 20 Members are not destined to get any.
It is not clear why.
We are all Members of the European Parliament, we have all been elected, but we are not worthy of this party funding.
Mr Karas has presented a democratic argument in favour of this great European project and it is a pity that the party he belongs to in his country will not get that money.
Perhaps you know that, Mr Karas.
Is that democracy?
They are elected representatives and they are denied the means of survival.
But they exist, Mr Karas, they are even your allies at Austrian level, but at European level they do not exist, they have no right to funding.
This Leinen report and the consequences that flow from it are quite bizarre.
What is more, we are discussing it in secret.
That being the case, my dear Mr Onesta, where are these European political parties?
Do you know them?
Can anyone join one of these European political parties we are talking about?
In my country, I can join my national parties, you can join your national parties, the French Greens.
We can join the trans-national radical party, and some Members have done so, but we cannot join these so-called European political parties that are going to receive a pile of cash for what are really meetings of amalgamations of European political parties.
We saw clearly enough, during the Gulf crisis, for example, how these European political parties behaved.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists, I take my hat off to you!
Bravo for your united stance on the Gulf!
The same goes for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Is there a single activist in these parties?
That is still all very unsound, ladies and gentlemen.
I do not mind a bit of an effort being made to bail out the confederations of parties, but in the light of the European ideal it is not very fair, not very worthy.
Incidentally, together with other colleagues from parties which - for reasons unknown - will not be getting any money, even though they are represented in Parliament, defend ideas here, are elected by millions of people, we intend bringing an action before the Court of Justice and we will see who wins!
I will end with a final word to Mr Leinen.
You were very passionate in insisting that it should be the Commission that manages this money, that a directorate general should look after the parties' statute.
The Council said niet, and it seems you have tabled an amendment with the result that we no longer know who is going to give the money to the European political parties you are so fond of.
It is not Parliament and it is not the Commission.
Your compromise amendment is somewhat bizarre.
I wonder who will give the money?
Perhaps the Court of Justice when we bring our action and perhaps we will also claim damages.
I am joking when I say that, but I also want you to know that the battle is not over.
I think this report is seriously flawed and does merit recourse to the Court of Justice, and we will see then whether we are right to say, regardless of the contents, that it is quite wrong to propose financing two thirds or three quarters of this Chamber while disregarding the other third or quarter.
Thank you very much, Mr Dell'Alba.
I would simply say to you that although this is a late hour, there is nothing secretive about it.
This late hour receives all the publicity available to Parliament, through all of its mechanisms.
Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that the British Conservatives will be voting against this proposal tomorrow.
We think it is wrong in principle to take people's money through taxation in order to synthesise an artificial sense of European identity.
Many of my constituents, and, I dare say, even some of the constituents of the honourable Members who will be voting for the resolution tomorrow, would be horrified to learn that their taxes were subsidising European political parties whose programmes they might fundamentally oppose.
Furthermore, we believe that the bill introduces a dangerous principle of political discrimination. It discriminates overtly against some parties on the basis of their beliefs and covertly against all parties which see themselves principally in national terms and are accordingly reluctant to form trans-European blocks.
So much, perhaps, will not surprise you.
I accept that the British Conservative Party is in a minority in this Chamber in championing the primacy of national democracy.
I know that most Members of this House believe that a working democracy at European Union level is feasible and desirable: that is a perfectly honourable position, but I would appeal to such Members to ask themselves whether these proposals are truly democratic.
In a pure democracy there should be as few restrictions as possible on how people choose their representatives.
Having been elected, politicians should be free to associate in any combinations they wish.
They should be able to express their opinions openly and they should be allowed to raise funds through any method that their voters will tolerate.
Laying down legal criteria for recognition dilutes democracy and infantilises the voter.
If a politician expresses noxious views, it should be up to his constituents to remove him, not the courts, let alone his political opponents.
If he is thought to be financially dependent on some vested interest, then that too should be a matter for his voters, not the authorities.
The bill before the House tonight traduces these principles.
It goes so far as to introduce a mechanism where parties which are at odds with the political convictions of the majority may be disqualified, a measure surely more in keeping with the old Warsaw Pact than with the democratic Europe to which we are notionally devoted.
In a free political market place, good ideas will triumph, not because bad ones are suppressed, but because people are able to distinguish between truth and falsehood.
If our constituents are not able to make that choice for themselves, their moral capacity is diminished and a measure of their freedom is lost.
Democracy is not just a slogan, a trite word to attach to any idea of which we happen to approve.
It has a very specific meaning and it is incompatible with the measure before us tonight.
True Europeans, honest democrats and sincere lovers of freedom should vote against it.
Mr President, after the Council's failure to achieve unanimity in 2001, new perspectives opened up at Nice. A new legal basis was created and qualified majority voting came into force.
This is the background to our current debate on the new proposal for a Regulation.
This proposal does in fact signal some progress in Europe, but I cannot forbear registering my disapproval - consternation, even - on noticing that the recognition of European political parties as legal persons has not yet been confirmed.
Furthermore, we have only just reached the stage of dealing with their funding ?
These are the reasons why this report, and the perseverance and tenacity it reveals on the part of the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, has earned my full support for the clarity and even-handedness with which the original proposal is explored.
I am referring particularly to the report's discussion of recognition of the parties' legal personality, clarification of the scale of the resources available to them, and openness regarding their Community funding, which should be subject to normal audit inspections.
The report holds the Commission responsible for administering financial resources, relieving the European Parliament of that burden in order to avoid giving rise to unnecessary suspicions.
Unlike the proposed Regulation, the report permits European political parties to use their funds to subsidise the activities of national parties and conduct European election campaigns.
The approval of this Regulation will be the first great achievement of the institutional framework on which European democracy rests.
It paves the way for the urgent completion of the Statute for Members and the essential uniform electoral law for the European Parliament.
I hope that the institutions involved in the legislative process will now assume responsibility for their actions.
Mr President, a statute for European political parties, with transparency of financing as its principal theme, is urgent and essential.
Mr President, it is a little odd, for it sometimes sounds as if it is a question of being either for or against European parties.
I think that is absolute nonsense, because we are at present in a situation in which we have no financial aid for European parties and yet we do in actual fact have European parties.
It is not up to the Commission or the Council or the European Parliament whether or not we are to have European parties.
It is up to those who are politically active in Europe.
It is, moreover, up to the people of Europe whether we are to have European parties.
Now, we are talking about whether they are to be given money into the bargain.
I think that the view being taken, namely the belief that a European democracy or a European public can be brought about through European parties, is quite wrong in a democratic perspective.
In my view, it is the other way around.
The presence of European democracy and a European public gives rise to European parties.
It is the 'bottom-up', rather than the 'top-down', mentality we should be adopting in this case.
This proposal is unfortunately an expression of the 'top-down' mentality, and I shall not support it.
Mr President, some of the previous speakers have pointed out that, without parties, there is no democracy, and to that I have to add that there is no democracy without gender equality.
We know that women are still very much under-represented, even though they make up half of Europe's population.
If women are not adequately represented in political life, this also shows how little progress the political parties have made as regards gender equality.
The political parties now have the task of making the principle of equality a political reality, and parties funded with European money also have the task of representing the public in an appropriate way.
We therefore want the Statute on European political parties to make the allocation of funds conditional upon a balanced male/female ratio.
The parity that we are proposing should be an obvious thing, and it is indeed regarded as such in a number of Member States, France being an example. The French National Assembly unanimously adopted a law on parity.
We should not merely be paying lip-service by stressing how important equality is.
Today, we have again made this clear in the Convention, where equality of treatment has been set down, once and for all, as a fundamental value.
Nor must we merely appeal to the business world and demand that it should refrain from discrimination, if we ourselves are not willing to do so.
That would lose us our credibility.
I therefore appeal to you to adopt our proposals as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Leinen for his efforts.
Even though I would endorse the report in the light of the undeniable need for the European dimension of political parties at the very moment the Convention is launching the Constitutional draft for the European Union, the system actually proposed can hardly hide the inner tendency to transfer the American way of doing politics to the European landscape.
It is more than evident that even the most acute analysts cannot distinguish the main differences between Democrats and Republicans, as is highlighted by issues such as the recent occupation of Iraq.
The proposal we are dealing with shows a clear will on the part of the European Union's lobbies to abandon the historical European arena and to embrace political confrontation in its stead, following the American model.
The financing scheme leaves no doubt about it.
Furthermore, we should not ignore the fact that the proposed rules discriminate against political parties of its stateless nations, such as the Basque Country, as Mr MacCormick mentioned just a few minutes ago.
Moreover, if amendments such as that proposed by Mr Gil-Robles go through, the question remains: has he asked for respect for the laws of the Member State in which those parties operate?
Certainly, Spanish nationalists have no limits.
Mr President, Mr Churchill, who I think was a Conservative, indicated on more than one occasion that he thought the democratic system was not great, but it was the best that we had and we had to defend it and protect it and, indeed, we have to regulate it.
There is no doubt that all the evidence of history indicates that we have to regulate the funding of political parties.
There is no other way of ensuring that parties are not corrupted.
We have far too many examples right across Europe of private money corrupting politics and the regulators.
A lot of people, certainly in my own country, are shocked that some of the money they have paid for buying a house has been used to corrupt the planning laws.
They will be quite happy to have their tax money used to ensure that the political system remains uncorrupted or becomes corruption-free.
There have been a lot of spurious arguments here tonight, particularly about thresholds for receiving funding.
I am not aware of a single Member State in the European Union that does not have a regulation with regard to thresholds for the funding of political parties.
Indeed, there are thresholds for getting elected to Parliament, never mind getting money for political parties.
The Statute we are dealing with, taken together with the Statute of Members of Parliament and with the very positive outcome of the Convention, indicates a coming-of-age for the European Union.
I hope that the summit this week takes its courage in its hands, approves this Statute and approves the outcome of the Convention.
We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demos, a real public space for the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, the rapporteur is dreaming of a uniform electoral system with transnational lists and, for that, he requires European parties.
Funds from European taxpayers are deployed to accelerate and facilitate the setting up of such parties.
This makes those parties particularly artificial.
The raison d'Ãªtre is not the common goals and activities of the associated members, but the need for a state administration at European level.
My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, is quite happy to work with like-minded Left Socialists in other countries, provided it can do this from the bottom up instead of from the top down.
In our opinion, these arrangements are not the right way forward.
In fact, our objection would be much greater if, modelled on the German system, party structures and the drafting of lists of candidates were prescribed in detail, or if a distinction were drawn between parties which support a Europe that is governed in a centralist and uniform manner and those opposed to this, between centrally organised parties of individuals and loose associations of cooperating national parties or between large and small political movements.
I am pleased to note that this proposal is now confined to a financing scheme and the monitoring of inappropriate use.
.
(ES) Mr President, I shall speak very briefly, simply to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, once again for his work and the Greek Presidency for having smoothed the progress of this agreement.
I do appreciate the point raised by Mr Corbett on the need for the anomalies in some of the translations to be corrected, but I believe that what we can infer from the various speeches that have been made is that - although some Members have certain reservations about the text or even objections to it - most of you, ladies and gentlemen, agree that this is a balanced text and one that will enable us to regulate a specific situation and which indicates the support that should be given precisely to those political parties that shape and promote the idea of Europe, in a transparent and responsible way.
I hope that we can achieve a text that is adopted at first reading and avoid a debate that, as you all know very well, honourable Members and representatives of the Council, has been pursued at great length.
I also hope that, thanks to this debate and to measures that have been adopted recently, we are finally going to be able to resolve the matter and move ahead with constructing the Europe that we all want to see: a Europe that is transparent, responsible and at the service of the citizens.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0196/2003) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and to the Council on 'energy cooperation with the developing countries'.
Mr President, no country has been able to reduce poverty without a significant increase in energy use.
Access to modern energy varies considerably, however.
More than two billion people in the world do not have access to electricity or fuels and are reduced to using firewood and animal droppings for their energy needs.
To mention just a few examples: cooking with poorly vented stoves has a significant impact upon health; hundreds of millions of women and children spend several hours a day gathering firewood for household needs; lack of electricity means inadequate lighting, limited communications and no access to refrigeration and to a host of labour-saving devices and income-generating opportunities.
Modern energy services for these poor countries are therefore a crucial prerequisite for its being possible to eradicate poverty in these countries and for the latter being able to achieve what are termed the Millennium Development Goals.
Most current forms of energy create environmental problems at local, regional and international levels that threaten both the present and future generations' health and prosperity.
To find new ways of increasing energy services for the poor, at the same time as taking increased account of the environmental effects of energy use is one of our most important challenges.
Despite the primary significance of the energy supply for development and growth, energy issues have, in general, been missing from the international development agenda and from the work done to combat poverty.
For example, energy projects have accounted for less than 5% of EU aid since 1990.
Last year in Johannesburg, something of a breakthrough occurred, and both energy initiatives launched by the Commission are more than welcome.
Both the statement we are debating today and the EU's energy initiatives in Johannesburg underline the crucial importance of energy in the fight against poverty.
A proper model is provided in terms of the general trend of the measures proposed, that is to say support for capacity-building, reform of the energy sector, management of the demand side, diversification of supply and the development of suitable regulations, financial mechanisms and public-private partnerships.
Both initiatives suffer, however, from a number of limitations and shortcomings.
In view of the huge challenges ahead, the proposals are not ambitious enough.
No new financial resources are proposed.
No doubt, the majority of the investments on the energy side will have to come from private sources, but there is also a tremendous need for resources in terms of aid.
Otherwise, there is little hope of reaching the poor in rural areas.
Moreover, the necessary transition to renewable energy and more efficient energy use can only happen with the help of specific financial support to help cover the higher up-front investments.
We therefore propose in this report that a special Sustainable Energy Fund be set up, rather as the Commission has now set up a fund, worth EUR 1 billion, for efforts in the area of water.
Another problem is that no clear distinction is made between the requirements in terms of policy development and investments, on the one hand at village level and on the other hand in the modern sector.
The village level needs to be clearly specified and prioritised.
Most of the oil imported by developing countries is used for transportation. The Commission's statement makes hardly any reference to the transport sector.
There are examples - especially from Latin America in the form, for example, of the ethanol program in Brazil - of how, through practical efforts, it is in actual fact possible to bring about environmentally friendly development in the transport area.
I do not have time to discuss further specific proposals and comments.
I just want to sum up by saying that the Commission's proposals are, by and large, encouraging.
If they are to be more than empty words, significant resources must, however, be contributed in order to stimulate investments in new and environmentally friendly technology - investments that are often rather expensive initially but that are cheaper over the projects' total life-cycle.
Moreover, efforts at village level, where the majority of the poor live, must be clearly prioritised.
It is there that the need for resources in terms of aid is at its greatest.
I hope that Parliament will support my report and that the Commission will bear in mind our amendments, above all those concerning the demand for significantly increased financial resources.
We must ensure that these sound proposals are more than just empty rhetoric.
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy cooperation with developing countries is clearly not a straightforward matter, but it is an issue that is crucial to everyone.
Unless the energy dimension, and those of development and the environment are addressed appropriately at the same time we will really make very little progress.
Furthermore, however, I wish to say that unless we address the issue of energy in developing countries, not only will those countries fail to develop properly; we will also be unable to confront problems such as combating climate change in a responsible and effective way.
For this reason I wish to express my thanks to Mr Wijkman, who is rapporteur for the report we are discussing today.
Mr Wijkman's combination of knowledge and persistence has resulted in a document that provides a useful contribution and boost to the work we still have to do to implement the Johannesburg conclusions in particular, on which we are working in the Commission and specifically in the Directorate-General for Energy.
I have chosen to interpret the report as support for the proposal made in the Commission Communication and I have no problem with the amendments Mr Wijkman tabled last week.
When the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport began preparing a document such as this, energy was not on the Johannesburg agenda.
We started working on energy and development cooperation before energy appeared on the Johannesburg agenda.
Energy then became the hot issue, or one of the hot issues, on the Johannesburg agenda, but we in the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport had already been working on it and I must say that I personally pushed for this approach.
It must be made very clear: energy and water constitute life itself.
Without water and energy, not only can there be no development, even survival is impossible.
Having said that, I wish to make a few observations on the substance of the report, which I believe might be constructive and could smooth the way for future cooperation.
Some of the specific proposals that have been made will need more detailed examination to ensure that coherence is maintained with the overall aim of development cooperation, in other words, eradicating poverty, combined with boosting a form of energy development that is balanced and sustainable.
The resolution correctly notes that the Commission has been very modest in suggesting special and reserved funding for energy investment in developing countries.
We are not overlooking the importance of funding; we are convinced, however, that funding must be based on demand.
This is a key aspect of the European Union's energy policy for eradicating poverty and for achieving sustainable development.
Only if and when our cooperation partners define developing their energy sector and make this a priority will the money begin to flow.
What we can do and what we will do is talk to the developing countries, with whom we are already working, to ensure that this happens.
In this context of cooperation I can give the commitment that - together with my colleague, Commissioner Nielson - we shall do everything possible to ensure that the expectations we all share are not disappointed.
Mr Wijkman is quite right to propose that we must at least ensure that unused funds are channelled into useful energy projects instead of remaining unused.
I fully share these positions.
I also wish to say that the energy chapter is indeed still one of the least-present elements in cooperation and assistance for poverty eradication and for the development of the poorest countries.
Nevertheless, I believe it is absolutely crucial - and I say this once again - that we are able to give it a boost.
Energy has a role in education.
Energy is involved in access to some of the new technologies that we must help to disseminate in those countries, precisely in order to prevent a worsening of today's poverty, which can be expressed simply as the difference in wealth between the developed and developing countries.
There is a new divide in relation to the new technologies, which we in the developed countries have and enjoy and to which the developing countries, unfortunately, still do not have access.
Here again, energy has a role to play and hence the importance of having presented this first Communication.
This is the first, but not the last.
I can inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that a new one is being prepared.
The only difference is that, when the time comes, we will be able to present it with the backing of the conclusions obtained in Johannesburg and of the awareness-raising that has been carried out since then.
Thank you very much Mr President, and thank you very much Mr Wijkman for your work.
Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Wijkman and the members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their useful input.
An important report has been developed and improved insofar as development cooperation has been updated and extended to a domain that tended until recently to be governed by free market principles.
From the global perspective in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists approaches the notions of development and cooperation, energy should be seen as a cross-cutting issue in cooperation actions.
This is because it is a key aspect of sustainable development.
The energy currently used in both developing and industrialised countries is polluting and environmentally destructive.
Substantial resources will be needed to remedy the situation, however.
The renewable and alternative sources of energy we advocate are expensive.
The Commission must make available the resources required to finance access to renewable energies for developing countries.
It would then be possible to integrate the environmental dimension into the development process, and it would not remain a pious declaration of intent.
As Mr Wijkman stated earlier this evening, energy accounts for less than 5% of Community development aid.
Public sector involvement in the energy sector is called for.
I should emphasise that public investment is also needed, without prejudice to the involvement of private companies in the production and distribution of energy.
Access to the latter should be guaranteed by the public sector as an essential service.
In this connection, we cannot endorse the Commission's decision that priority should be given to promotion of the privatisation of the sector.
It should be complementary to public action.
Private exploitation of energy sources does not help to alleviate poverty.
There are some appalling poverty indicators for African countries that export energy resources such as fossil fuels exploited by private companies.
Very often these companies are European.
It should be stated that these populations do not have access to electricity, lighting or water.
They do not benefit from other more sophisticated uses of energy either.
Financial support is therefore needed.
The Commission itself does actually recognise the link between poverty, environmental degradation and energy.
The Commissioner referred to this today.
Nonetheless, the Commission fails to make bold environmentally-sustainable proposals.
We therefore welcome this initiative to work together with developing countries regarding energy.
Nonetheless, we regret the lack of a crash programme with additional funding and a proposal that would serve as a legal basis for the action required on this important issue.
Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Wijkman and thank him for being so open to dialogue and willing to listen to the amendments put forward in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
The Johannesburg Summit rightly affirmed that access to energy for the poor has become a priority, since it is so very true that the populations' vital needs in this respect are far from being satisfied and the trend is still away from equality; the main reason for this is the developed countries' fossil fuel consumption, in particular US consumption, which is excessive and very much out of proportion to that of the developing countries.
Life expectancy and development are closely linked to access to energy, to the point that many see it as a real basic human right.
That right must be recognised, guaranteed and protected.
How can we contribute to the existence and development of an efficient energy sector in the developing countries without policies that encourage close cooperation for the exchange of know-how, the primary objective being to meet the vital needs of the populations?
The need for finance is evident.
The creation of a Sustainable Energy Fund and much more consistent participation by the European Union could be a first response.
In particular, as the report rightly says, the existence of a strong public sector in the energy sector is particularly important in the first phase of development.
More than that, as the majority of the Committee on Development and Cooperation has said, I remain convinced that the Commission's options for privatisation of the energy sector are more than dangerous.
The Commission's role is not to promote privatisation in the developing countries.
The exploitation and distribution of primary energy, which is essential for development, must be handled by public or private companies committed to public service and general interest goals.
Such public control is all the more vital because the trans-national corporations that operate in the developing countries are all too often concerned only with short-term profitability, to the detriment of the needs of the local populations and at the risk of plundering their energy resources.
Effective machinery must be deployed to monitor the activities of European undertakings in particular.
I also support the call on the Commission to review deregulation of the energy sector from a human development perspective and to work towards international trade norms which abide by human rights and peoples' rights.
Finally, seeing that next September's WTO Summit in Cancun is not far away, we must refuse to allow the energy sector to be included in the general agreement on trade in services, which would make energy a commodity like any other.
The aim of universal access to energy in the service of development will not be achieved by following a model imposed by the liberal thinking of multilateral bodies like the WTO, but by expanding and guaranteeing the public service to meet the needs of the populations.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Wikjman again, and to respond very briefly.
I have to say that we do not seem to have read the same document.
The two speakers appear to have read a different Commission document from the one I am familiar with.
I find this surprising, because nowhere in the Commission's document does it state that the Commission advocates the privatisation of energy services in developing countries.
That is another kettle of fish altogether.
Please remember that, ladies and gentlemen.
True, we have proposed privatisation.
Actually, it was liberalisation, not privatisation, and the two are quite different.
Further, the proposal was made in the context of energy systems in the integrated European market.
None of this has anything to do, however, with what you attributed to a text but does not actually appear in that text.
Ladies and gentlemen, I challenge you to tell me on which page we advocated privatising energy systems in developing countries.
Give me the page reference please, ladies and gentlemen.
When you come up with the number of the page where we allegedly made that statement, I might be moved to recognise it does not make sense.
I can however assure you here and now that it makes no sense whatsoever.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are today concerned with the millions upon millions of human beings the world over who do not have electricity and are therefore deprived of a whole range of opportunities for their personal development, training and access to technology.
These people cannot take advantage of all the opportunities modern society has to offer.
I put it to you that there is no time to waste discussing what does not appear in the document presented to the House.
We should focus instead on genuine issues of substance.
Please do not confuse a debate concerning regulation of energy markets within the European Union with support for development and the role of energy in promoting development in developing countries.
These are two quite different issues.
Money may be private or public.
What is actually needed however are funds and resources.
I should point out to the House that in the majority of those countries, the most serious problem is the corruption rife amongst the ruling elite, that is, in the public sector.
Such then is the nature of the public sector in those countries.
So, we would do well to deal sensibly with the issues in hand.
I urge you to refrain from commenting on what does not appear in the text, and not to confuse documents.
Mr President, I can understand the Commissioner's annoyance.
It may be due to the late hour or to the fact that she is aware more funds are to be invested to see through the crash programme I referred to.
I am certainly prepared to have a calmer discussion with the Commissioner.
What I actually said was that I believe it is all well and good to resort to private funds, but public funds must be invested also, and that the Commission is prioritising private funds.
I do not of course have any intention of going through the text article by article and line by line.
I am however delighted to learn that the Commissioner is prepared to invest public funds and Union funds to help these developing countries.
Of course I am aware that there are many corrupt governments in Africa and indeed elsewhere.
What the people of those countries do not need, however, is for European companies to exploit their energy resources.
Instead, Europe should support the public services to ensure those populations do have access to electricity and water.
Both are central to the quality of life, and I was delighted to hear the Commissioner acknowledge this.
Mr President, I would just like to add a word to the same effect.
First to thank the Commissioner because I think holding debates in which ideas can contend is the way to make progress.
That is what happened in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Not everyone was in agreement with all the points in the report, but that does not prevent me from wanting the debate to continue, because it must exist.
I mentioned just now the general agreement on trade in services, for example.
The debate on this subject is public, it exists.
I want it to continue.
Like Mrs Sauquillo, I also want to thank the Commissioner for what she said about the Commission's commitment to greater funding.
The needs are in fact so great I think we can agree together to be generous in this.
Mr President, I shall not prolong the debate.
I am grateful for the contributions made.
Allow me merely to make a small point concerning the discussion of whether investments should be private or public.
I believe, exactly like Mrs de Palacio, that we need all the resources we can obtain.
What is important is that there be regulations in each country ensuring that people with small incomes have access to energy, that is to say that we have sound regulations in this area.
I believe that competition between different companies is, then, to be preferred to monopolies, irrespective of whether they are public or private.
Thank you for the debate.
I hope we shall come nicely to an agreement tomorrow in the vote.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0198/2003) by Mr Lisi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this recommendation for second reading on the Council common position on the proposal to amend the 'Seveso directive' warrants a brief synopsis of its history.
In the sensitive climate of the tragic accidents which have affected the chemical industry and, in particular, the communities living in the areas surrounding these sites, as well as the environment, the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal to amend Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996, which lays down provisions, of course, on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances.
The proposal had the merit of being based on very thorough scientific work and of providing a constructive analysis of this sensitive matter.
At first reading, I and other Members explained why it is necessary for the European Parliament to send out a signal loud and clear.
My aim - which I confirm today - is, as far as possible, to ensure that such accidents are never repeated, ensuring both the safety of the citizens and workers at these plants and, of course, environmental protection.
The Council has produced a common position which essentially takes into account many of Parliament's concerns, but a number of grey areas still remain, and these are the following.
Firstly, the inclusion of mining activities and land-fill sites, an issue on which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has decided to retable the amendments from first reading, in other words the inclusion in the scope of the directive of all types of preparation and processing of dangerous substances in these sites - not just chemical or thermal preparations, that is, as envisaged by the Commission.
I would point out, moreover, that we are only talking about active plant.
We are aware that the Commission has, just recently, launched a specific proposal for a directive on the management of waste from mining activities, the terms of which will, moreover, have to be decided together with the European Parliament at the appropriate time, but, until then, there is and will continue to be a gap in the law which, given the recent accidents which have alarmed public opinion, cannot be tolerated.
However, I am not excluding the possibility that the progress of the new directive on mining activities through conciliation might make it easier to reach agreement on this point.
The second question is that of staff training.
Here too, taking the same line as the Commission this time, we have proposed specific training measures on managing emergencies for all staff, including the staff of sub-contracting firms.
Indeed, it is appropriate to provide for adequate measures not just on the handling of dangerous substances but on managing emergencies too, in order to limit potential damage as far as possible and to guarantee workers' safety fully.
However, as rapporteur, I feel it is unnecessary to include the list of training measures in the notification provided for in Article 6 of the directive, which is why I would urge you to vote against Amendment No 3, as at first reading.
The third question is that of urban development planning.
In this area, the Council has already taken into consideration Parliament's desire to lay the foundations for definition at European level of methodological criteria which are necessary to assess compatibility between the sites in question and the areas at risk, not least by means of Union funding.
However, given the great diversity of rules, regional situations, competences and responsibilities which characterises this aspect of safety - situating plant in terms of urban development planning - I believe that we must, of necessity, invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave it up to the Member States to decide on the minimum distances.
That is why I have called for a split vote on Amendment No 6, and will only vote for the first part of the amendment.
As regards the map showing risk areas, the committee believes that the pictorial representation of areas adjacent to the establishments subject to accident risks would be an effective, easily comprehensible measure for all the citizens concerned, who are entitled to greater clarity in this regard.
To this end, the rapporteur has incorporated the wording used by the European Commission in the amended proposal for a directive.
Lastly, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has proposed once again that a distinction should be made between forms of potassium nitrate, with new thresholds, in order to avoid farmers who use a form of potassium nitrate which could not be classed as fuel, falling within the scope of the directive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main points.
Clearly, we are on track for a conciliation procedure.
Indeed, the Council was unable to reach agreement on a compromise package and it did not, if the truth be known, seem to me to be particularly interested in achieving such an agreement with Parliament.
I remain confident, however, that, with a constructive debate, it will be possible to achieve a solution which ensures maximum safety in these plants.
I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on the Environment and the staff of the European Commission, who have been particularly helpful and cooperative.
. Mr President, first of all, a special thank you goes to the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, for his valuable work on this proposal.
As you are aware, the Commission proposal under discussion seeks to broaden the scope of the Seveso II Directive in the light of the Baia Mare and Enschede accidents.
Furthermore, it seeks to incorporate the recommendations of two studies, one dealing with carcinogens and the other with substances which are dangerous to the aquatic environment.
Whilst the Commission proposal did not originally contain measures related to the Toulouse accident, a number of amendments proposed by Parliament have been incorporated into the Commission's amended proposal and subsequently into the Council's common position.
I would like to stress again that it was not the intention of the Commission to effect a major overhaul of the Seveso II Directive.
I shall now comment on some of the proposed amendments.
Amendments Nos 9 to 11 on risk mapping and potassium nitrate were already accepted by the Commission during the first reading and consequently they figure in the Commission's amended proposal.
These were the only three amendments that were fully rejected by the Council when adopting its common position.
The Commission continues to support these amendments and can furthermore accept Amendment No 8 related to training for emergencies.
I am pleased to tell you that a proposal for a directive on the management of mining waste was adopted by the Commission on 2 June 2003.
The measures in the proposal complement those outlined in the Seveso II Directive and include the establishment of a major accident prevention policy and a safety management system.
These measures will apply to those waste management facilities that present an accident risk but will not be covered by the revised Seveso II Directive.
In our opinion, the Seveso II Directive should only apply to the most dangerous mining activities where chemical processes are involved and chemical substances are stored on site.
The Seveso II Directive should not be transformed into either mining legislation or waste legislation.
Therefore the Commission cannot agree to deleting the words 'chemical and thermal' as proposed in Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
We also reject Amendment No 12 which proposes making a reference to Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Amendment No 13, which seems to suggest that there are gaps in the coverage of mining sites through the two proposals.
In our opinion this is not the case.
Amendments Nos 3 and 4 would lead to requiring operators of Seveso lower-tier sites to include information on training measures in the notification and to inform the competent authority in the event of a modification of an installation, establishment or storage area.
In our view this would introduce bureacratic burdens without improving safety.
A notification should only provide certain minimum information.
The issue of training is already appropriately addressed in the Directive; moreover, in the event of modifications, the reviews of the major accident prevention policy and the safety management system are important, not the notification.
I acknowledge Parliament's strong wish to reinforce Article 12 of the Seveso II Directive.
However, the Commission and the Council have already accepted related amendments presented in the first reading.
Amendment No 6 does not constitute an added value; on the contrary, there is no need for separate guidelines setting out a methodology on minimum safety distances, as it should be possible to derive these distances from the technical database that will be created as a tool to help assess the compatibility between Seveso sites and sensitive sites.
Furthermore, the Commission continues to be of the opinion that a development of incentive schemes and/or funding for the relocation of establishments is a task for Member States - this is subsidiarity.
The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 7.
To conclude, let me confirm the Commission's position on all amendments.
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 11.
Amendments Nos 1 to 7 and Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are not acceptable.
I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest to have this proposal adopted and implemented as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Lisi most sincerely for the work he has accomplished.
As has just been said, tomorrow Parliament will have to vote on this report's second reading and, as with other reports, we here are of course divided between the wish to take negotiations with the Council and Commission as far as possible and the desire to get this text finalised quickly so it can be implemented as soon as possible.
At the end of the first reading, the Council incorporated a large number of amendments adopted by Members, but also rejected several proposals.
A few weeks ago, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted by a very large majority a text which confirms the requirements to which we will have to submit if we want to make progress on prevention.
On these questions, the European Union must show its unity and its willingness to improve the legislation in force in answer to the legitimate concerns of the European citizens.
It is also an opportunity for us to give some meaning to this European construction which is often accused of devoting more time to drawing up product standards than to the Europeans' well-being, let alone their health.
I am therefore glad that the Committee on the Environment has adopted the amendments concerning obligations to notify the competent authorities, because we need to be very demanding in this area without, Commissioner, being bureaucratic: there is no reason why we cannot simplify the documents.
The amendments concerning training for all staff, including staff of subcontractors, seem to me to be essential, because it has been evident from several accidents that a lack of training and of information was involved.
On the question of safety distances between establishments and sensitive areas, the terrible accident in Toulouse showed the weaknesses in the relevant legislation and we must include these things in our report, just as we must in future extend the mapping of sensitive areas.
One point presents a problem and seems to be meeting with stiff opposition from the Council and the Commission, as you have just said, Commissioner; it is the question of extending the scope to all mining and waste processing activities using dangerous substances.
The Council and the Commission want to restrict the scope of the Seveso II Directive to the chemical and thermal processing of waste only; they justify this position by the fact that in its proposal concerning mining waste the Commission refers, in Article 6 on the prevention of major accidents, to the provisions of the amended Seveso II Directive.
However, if we want to avoid a legal void concerning certain mining activities and certain methods of processing mining waste until this new legislative proposal is adopted, the European Parliament must vote in favour of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 13 without prejudice to the scope of the future report and with no talk of redundancies.
I would therefore like Parliament to adopt the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, thus strengthening on-site prevention and the safety of European citizens.
Like the Council, we want to reach an agreement in this stage of the legislative procedure but, I hope you understand, not at any price.
Mr President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for the proposed amendment to the Seveso II Directive.
I also wish to thank Mr Lisi for his sterling work.
I nonetheless entirely agree with the rapporteur that the Seveso II Directive should contain those points not approved by the Council and the Commission, partly because of the need to avoid grey areas and partly because it would make for better opportunities to remedy the shortcomings in the existing legislation.
For example, all forms of mining should be incorporated, and there must be more training of staff and more information about the areas of risk that exist.
Moreover, potassium nitrate should also be incorporated.
That is not something in conflict with the objectives of the directive.
Nor is it a question of completely changing this proposal for a directive but, instead, of tackling the problems we have seen in connection with the serious accidents that have taken place in recent years.
I wish above all to put the case for Amendment No 13 concerning a new recital 3a, explaining why we believe it to be particularly important for Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to be incorporated.
The proposal put forward by the Commission concerning the Mining Waste Directive and published, if I remember rightly, on 2 June concentrates more upon the management of waste.
In my view, it does not, however, extend to include, for example, hazardous substances produced in mining.
If it is now to be possible to limit the consequences of serious accidents, I believe it is necessary for these hazardous substances actually to be included.
They therefore belong in the Seveso Directive and not in the usual place for dealing with waste management.
That is why I support, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 13, but also other amendments.
Mr President, more than three years have now passed since the fireworks disaster in Enschede.
We still have not succeeded in laying down an amended directive.
This amendment is essential in order, as far as possible, to prevent the same accidents from happening again.
We should not therefore wait any longer.
The Council and European Commission are apparently of the opinion that Parliament tabled too many amendments at first reading.
Parliament's proposals have not been adopted because they are said to fall outside the scope of this directive.
According to the Council, since it would be too time-consuming to look at these proposals in detail, it dismissed them for the sake of convenience.
It is, for example, beyond me why the Council refuses to accept the addition of potassium nitrate.
The adapted legislation will undoubtedly reduce the risk of accidents, but there will always be risks.
In the unlikely event of a calamity, it is imperative to keep the consequences to an absolute minimum.
It remains therefore of continued importance for minimum distances between hazardous installations and residential areas to be examined carefully.
Of course, I appreciate that the implementation of this is not equally simple for every Member State.
In the final analysis, the economic interests have to be weighed up against public safety.
Safety should assume an important place.
I subscribe to the importance of well-trained staff, so that preventive and emergency measures can be taken as effectively as possible.
In addition, I would like to point out that the enforcement of this legislation by central and local governments is essential.
This also means providing the public with sound information. Clear danger maps, which identify the special risks to residents, constitute a sound addition to this legislation.
The Council should also be able to subscribe to the above.
I would therefore take this opportunity of calling on the Council, and hence the European Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, to adopt Parliament's amendments, thus enabling us to lay down revised legislation immediately without having to go through an extended conciliation procedure.
Mr President, like everyone else I welcome this report and I congratulate the rapporteur for his work.
He has been thorough and consistent and has applied himself.
We have moved a considerable step forward since this Directive was last considered for amendment in this House in Strasbourg in 1994 - I know because I was there.
Events in Toulouse and in Enschede have demonstrated the need for action to amend and reinforce the existing Directive, so as to avoid any possibility of accidents and to minimise damage should an accident occur.
A future directive on pipeline safety and a proposal with regard to tunnel safety will also be very welcome because they respond to promises made during the last reading in 1994 and also to events, some of them very tragic, that have occurred consequently in other parts of the Union.
The common position is, in fact, quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems.
There are still issues that remain unaddressed - issues that are quite clear and evident to us because of events that have taken place in the recent past.
Everywhere else we have responded.
We responded to Enschede and Toulouse with this Directive.
We have responded with directives to events that have caused us to be concerned about tunnel safety and pipeline safety.
We are going to miss the chance to respond properly and completely unless we amend this common position to cover other events that have taken place in recent times within and outside the Union.
The events of Baia Mare in Romania and DoÃ±ana in Spain demonstrate the need to take action with regard to mining safety and mining waste safety.
Until we see the mining waste directive we cannot relent on amendments that we have previously passed in this committee and in this Parliament to ensure that action is taken with regard to those dangerous substances and activities, not necessarily utilising dangerous substances that clearly need regulation.
Put them in the mining waste directive, Commission, and we will relent on the amendments.
That is a reasonable remark.
Other issues have still to be addressed.
In 1994 we argued very strongly the case to have some kind of discussions on distance.
We still do not have a solution on that and that is why we maintain the amendments and insist they are placed in the common position.
Finally, on safety reports and some of the technical issues, I would ask the Commission to think again.
They are produced and directed at you in the light of our own experiences.
Please act on them.
Mr President, we are on the verge of deciding on the revision of the so-called Seveso Directive.
Nearly a year ago, I remarked in this House that we are locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.
This was an appeal to the Council to ensure that we use the revision of the directive as an opportunity to plug existing holes, so that accidents of the kind that took place in Baia Mare, Toulouse and Enschede can be prevented in future.
In Enschede, it transpired that current Seveso legislation is insufficient.
A fireworks factory which did not fall within the scope of the directive destroyed an entire housing estate.
Human suffering was huge, and the grieving for the victims continues.
Residents of this housing estate were not aware of the presence of the fireworks factory.
Authorities were only aware up to a point.
It is therefore logical to tighten up the rules.
Of particular importance, in my view, is the drafting of a method for establishing minimum distances.
The European Commission should set up guidelines for this purpose, because it is about time we knew exactly what a safe distance is.
A safe distance in the Netherlands is considered 25 metres, in France 500 metres and in Germany as many as 1 000 metres.
An objective method for establishing the safe distance is important for those living nearby but, above all, also for the local politicians.
Hazardous factories do not belong in housing estates.
An active policy should be adopted in order to remove them from those estates, if possible with the help of European funding.
In addition, it is important for maps to be drawn up which indicate the areas in the vicinity of an establishment that could be affected after a major accident.
Every citizen is entitled to this information.
Tightening up the rules is one thing, observing them and being accountable is another.
We can lay down rules ad infinitum, but if they are not implemented in municipal practice, they will have little effect in the end.
If nobody feels responsible, if organisations each work in a vacuum, legislation remains a paper exercise.
Safety is not only a matter of rules, but also of culture.
It is a public task to actively promote this culture.
Where safety is concerned, we should not cut any corners.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr President, I do not know if I should read anything into the fact that environmental issues tend to be discussed last thing in the evening.
It certainly is not the best time to do so.
I should first like to say that the Commission's communication describes the current state of the marine environment.
It refers to the pressures and threats the latter is under.
In particular, it highlights the dangers posed by industry, fishing, agriculture, transport, the exploitation of gas and oil fields and the accidental introduction of species.
All these activities can have very serious consequences.
I would remind you of the recent Prestige disaster and the Erika accident three years ago.
Further, this communication recognises the lack of an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment at Union level.
The Commission sets out 14 objectives and 23 actions.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we endeavoured to define these objectives more clearly and to broaden the scope of certain actions.
In general, we tried to work towards a strategy for the protection of the marine environment consistent with European legislation and with the present condition of European waters.
The communication reiterates that the two key references are the Sixth Community Environmental Action Programme and the Johannesburg Summit.
Section 10 of the Johannesburg action plan emphasises the importance of sustainable development.
It states that oceans, seas, islands and coasts are key components of our planet's ecosystems and essential to food safety.
The loss of biodiversity as a result of accidents and the social and economic consequences of this loss have yet to be quantified.
The Sixth Programme contains an important chapter calling for the protection of the marine environment to be strengthened.
It also calls for environmental issues to be integrated into all other policies, and for commitment to a clear plan of action to curb the negative impact on biodiversity.
It also appeals for more sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. In addition, it recalls the Montreal Declaration on the Protection of the Marine Environment.
It is important to describe the relationship between the strategy for protection of the marine environment and all other policies.
These include policies relating to fisheries, agriculture, transport and chemicals.
To this end, environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment should be used when developing activities, plans and programmes, as they are much more appropriate instruments.
Objective 9 concerning transport and maritime security is of particular importance at the moment.
The Committee on the Environment was of the opinion that it should be strengthened.
This despite the fact that in the wake of the Erika accident, and particularly after the more recent disaster involving the Prestige, two reports on the subject were adopted in the last plenary.
A further two reports were adopted in the Committee on the Environment this week.
Nonetheless, further directives and communications are still being debated.
There is a very important report on the Prestige by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and this chapter needs strengthening.
The situation in European seas is not good, even though it has emerged from monitoring and assessment programmes that information on the marine environment is insufficient.
In fact, we are recalling that the principles that should inform this new marine strategy must include the precautionary principle, the 'polluter pays' principle, a clear concept of sustainability, an integrated approach to management of both the coastal and offshore marine environments, strategic environmental assessment and a regional approach taking account of regional diversities.
In addition, account should be taken of all the relevant existing international initiatives such as OSPAR, HELCOM and ICES.
They must not be seen as substitutes, however.
We also believe that the notions of sustainable fishing, the interaction between fishing and sea birds, the balance between fish stocks, fishing effort and the environment are crucial.
Mr President, we realise this is only a first step.
We await a Commission proposal on an effective strategy for protection of the marine environment.
Nonetheless, I would like to thank all members of the Committee on the Environment personally for their effective input.
It is thanks to them that the quality of this document is as good as it could possibly be.
.
Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament and, of course, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez for the work that has gone into this report and the motion for a resolution.
I welcome the overall positive tone and the fact that the report broadly endorses the approach and objectives set out by the Commission in this communication.
I am particularly pleased that Parliament explicitly recognises the need for an integrated approach, a robust environmental assessment and the application of a regional approach, underlined now when the marine strategy is being implemented.
I am convinced that, without a regional approach with full stakeholder input, we will not be in a position to deliver on the commitment we entered into in Johannesburg in this regard.
The Commission will therefore continue to work closely with Member States, the marine conventions and the Arctic Council.
Although we can have common principles and objectives, we must recognise that the situations differ between the European seas from the Baltic to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
I would also like to stress that the Commission intends to develop the so-called ecosystem approach to human activities and this will definitely be one of the main pillars in the strategy.
In conclusion I would like to underline that I consider Parliament's resolution to be a positive signal overall, and that the Commission will closely consider your suggestions.
It will help us to move forward on a solid basis to the next phase in the development of a marine strategy.
Mr President, when you look at the list of threats to marine biodiversity, overfishing is the first problem that is mentioned.
The main environmental damage is caused by overfishing of depleted stocks of commercially valuable fish, not to mention damage to non-targeted species including fish and damage to the marine habitat such as coral beds.
When you actually look at the Commission's approach to the whole issue of fisheries over the last few years, you will see that the Commission in fact used to be the most progressive of the EU institutions, pushing very hard for conservation and reasonable management of fish stocks with, of course, the obvious exception of third-country agreements.
But over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the Commission.
Take, for example, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy: despite all the fine words and the good proposals put forward by the Commission, it is clear, when you actually look at what has come out, that this is really a shadow of what was proposed.
While there are some good possibilities in there, most of it basically requires an effort of political will on the part of Member States.
One just has to look, for example, at the negotiations over cod and other TACs during the December meeting to see that there is no political will there.
It is interesting that the Swedish Commissioner is here.
Take the recent decision by Sweden, seeking to bring in more conservation measures in relation to cod: they were prevented from doing that.
This sends out a very bad signal.
If a Member State is willing and progressive enough to take more stringent measures then surely it should be allowed to do that.
It is a regrettable decision and it is also unjustifiable.
Consider, too, a Member State's commitment in relation to the basic regulation which was reviewed last December: again, they took out the opportunity which was used by the Spanish in the past to ban driftnets.
This possibility was removed and I cannot understand why.
We should also look at the issue of, for example, blue whiting.
Over the past number of years the European Union has been doing the right thing by trying to convince other countries to be reasonable in relation to the kind of quotas they set for themselves.
But if you look at what the Commission is actually doing now, it seems that it is changing its approach to this.
It seems that it has basically decided to participate in the overfishing.
It has indicated that it is going to abandon the idea of restraining other fishing countries and is going to dramatically increase the Union's own fishing activities.
That contributes to the depletion of stocks.
There is a major contradiction in what the Commission is doing and I wish the Commission would revert to its previous approach of being extremely progressive on the conservation of fisheries.
It should try to pull the Member States along, because the Member States are being dictated to by the industry.
We are going to end up with a serious problem in relation to the marine environment.
It is already there and we need to be a lot more progressive.
Mr President, the Prestige disaster cast a harsh light on marine pollution.
It was a dramatic event that figured prominently in the media, and it highlighted institutional and political malfunctions.
But it was in fact only the tip of the iceberg.
Marine ecosystems are threatened by many other polluters besides single hull ships, and their biodiversity, be it marine flora or marine fauna, is at risk.
There are many predators.
First, overfishing and illegal fishing, which exhaust fish stocks, but also discharges from land, fertilizer and agricultural pesticide residues, clandestine degassing of ships, products from oil platforms, all of them human activities that have taken nothing into account apart from immediate gain, which have no prospects for sustainable development and have no concern for the environment.
It is to the Commission's credit that it has drawn up an inventory of these risks, recorded the state of knowledge about them and reviewed the conventions and various laws that might control those risks at different levels: international, European, national or regional.
On the basis of that inventory, the Commission has built a very goal-oriented strategy for protecting marine resources, with clear objectives and an action plan.
Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez's excellent report welcomes this effort, but it also suggests, first of all, that the Commission should go beyond analysis and be tougher and more precise about the action to be taken and, in particular, the time scale for that action.
Especially when there are still gaps in our knowledge of a particular field, the precautionary principle must be followed for rapid intervention, to which we should add the polluter-pays principle and that of sustainable development.
In this context, there is a need for a radical change to the legislation governing international shipping and a review of the old conventions that do not include these principles.
The report's second suggestion to the Commission is that it should expand its communication by stressing various aspects that were perhaps not sufficiently developed. Examples include areas of particular vulnerability (the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas have been listed), dangerous substances that have not yet been mentioned (such as the various nitrogenous substances, hydrocarbons and discharges from land), activities that have remained in the background, such as flags of convenience, or species that are more particularly endangered, such as posidonia.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy received both the Commission communication and Mrs Ãlvarez's report very warmly indeed.
Fundamental opposition from Parliament will certainly not emerge tomorrow.
But while we can hope that the Commission will be firm and vigilant in the matter, we may be forgiven for having more fears about the Council, where there will have to be a real political will to implement this integrated strategy for the protection of marine resources.
The past has shown that internal resistance, sometimes linked to national interests, can hinder the best thought-out European strategic policies.
Hence the GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report's justified insistence that concrete steps be taken right away as part of an integrated strategy at all levels of power, but also at all geographical levels, including local authorities.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Convention proposes that the conservation of the sea's biological resources must be the exclusive competence of the EU, while fishing should be an area in which the EU and the Member States have shared competence.
This issue has been sidelined in the major debate about the future.
Anyone familiar with issues relating to fisheries will find it very hard to understand that the Convention has proposed separating these areas.
Rules concerning the way in which fishing is conducted are the very rules through which we enact decisions concerning the conservation of biological resources.
Through provisions concerning mesh sizes, fishing periods and permitted gear, fishing can be regulated and the marine environment conserved.
What, moreover, is really important for the marine environment is that aid to the floating fish factories should cease.
For myself and many others, it is unclear how the Convention's proposal would work in practice.
What, for example, would it mean for seals and for the fishing industry?
Where these matters are concerned, I hope that, for example, the Commissioner would explain to those who fish in the Kvarken straits, the Gulf of Finland and the archipelagoes what the outcome of this decision would be.
I appeal to the Commission to clarify its positions on these issues too.
If EU measures in favour of the marine environment are to produce results, there must be closer compliance with the rules, fewer exceptions and more effective international cooperation.
We are successful internationally when we cooperate on matters such as the Oil Fund, to quote just one example.
It also means, however, that the Member States must be prepared to take a stand on important proposals, such as the most recent one to impose penalties in connection with deliberate discharges of oil.
Unfortunately, we see, however, the way in which legal hair-splitting constitutes an obstacle to the directive in the Council.
Despite the fact that a Directive on oil reception facilities has been adopted, there has been no reduction in deliberate oil discharges.
Commissioner, I would finally appeal to you to get a firm grip on HELCOM - the Helsinki Commission for Baltic Marine Environment Protection.
It must not be a relic from the Cold War, merely issuing recommendations that do not lead to any measures being taken.
Following the EU's enlargement, it will be possible for HELCOM to be a body attending to its task in accordance with the Water Framework Directive.
If it is to be reformed, HELCOM needs the support of the Commission, especially when, for the first time in history, the new boss, who takes office on 1 August, is a woman.
This organisation can implement the regional way of tackling things that both Parliament and the Commission wish to see.
I would also ask Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m to convince her colleague, Mrs de Palacio, that the Commission must be more active in supporting Finland and Sweden when it comes to ice classification.
Unfortunately, it was only Italy and the Commission that opposed the Nordic proposals concerning clearer shipping rules in this part of the EU too.
Mr President, very little is as yet known about the submarine environment. That is why, moreover, it is hard to organise any sort of viable programme of protection.
Stocks of some monitored, familiar species, that is to say mainly economically important species, have in many places diminished drastically.
How can we protect species, therefore, about which we still do not even know anything?
Protection is nevertheless the starting point for the EU marine strategy.
Consequently, I too have proposed that we should grant sufficient appropriations to enable us to carry out an investigation and draw up an inventory of submarine species.
The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, HELCOM, has made more than 200 recommendations for improving the state of the Baltic.
These are not binding on the Member States but the Commission might examine them and propose rules based on them that are.
In the same way, EU investment is needed for the protection of nature in the northern seas.
This would come about most effectively if the EU joined the Nordic countries, the United States of America, Canada and Russia as members of the Arctic Council.
That would promote shared Euro-Atlantic understanding of environmental problems.
There are environments in the European Union, such as many areas of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, where the natural environment would not necessarily recover properly from a large-scale oil disaster.
That is why we must have more talks with countries such as Russia to develop stricter common standards for merchant vessels.
It is vital that oil tankers sailing in the sort of difficult icy conditions there were last winter are immune to risk.
The Commission should propose an amendment, within the framework of UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would allow intervention with regard to merchant vessels from third countries sailing through or close to EU waters if they are thought to be a potentially serious threat.
In addition to oil disasters we should also consider, for example, the loud noise made by equipment used in mapping the location of natural resources to be a pollutant.
I would furthermore like to draw the attention of the Commission, and the Council too for that matter, to the Member States' unsatisfactory capacity for tackling oil spills.
I myself looked into the situation recently when I sent out questionnaires to those authorities in the Baltic countries responsible for this matter.
The replies made disappointing reading.
The situation was best in Finland and Sweden, where the equipment they have would be sufficient in practice for clearing the oil coming from a broken fuel tank on a large passenger ship.
If there were a major disaster the equipment in these countries would be insufficient even if it were used in combination.
Around 40 million tonnes of oil a year already pass through the Gulf of Finland, for example, and it is supposed that this volume will have doubled in 10 year's time.
The Commission should initiate a survey of capacity for tackling oil spills and adopt rules for sufficient minimum capacity based on regional conditions and volumes of traffic.
.
Mr President, thank you for this valuable input towards developing a marine strategy and special thanks to Mrs Thors because she provided me with an action plan supplementing my own Commission action plan which I also find very interesting.
As regards the deliberations of the Convention, I cannot really know the answer as to why this became the end result of trying to establish a list of competences because, as you rightly say, this looks very curious and very strange to most people.
Maybe, however, there is a deeper legal meaning to it and maybe it will prove to be helpful.
However, I cannot give you a clear reply to that.
You have made a number of important points which we have to follow up and you have also demonstrated the whole width of this issue.
It encompasses, of course, many different aspects of the marine environment and this is what we must now continue to work on very practically.
I have taken note of everything you have said.
Thank you very much for your useful input, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Additives in animal nutrition
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0176/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition [15776/2/2002 - C5-0132/2003 - 2002/0073(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert).
.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is - I believe - an important topic that we have on the agenda this morning: the prohibition of antibiotics in animal nutrition.
