I regret to say that our great economic influence fails still today to be matched by equally effective political action on the world stage.
The Middle East conflict is only the last in a series of cases in which the Union has failed to play a leading role in endeavours to bring peace.
Although it is true, however, that we are still far off the objective of a politically strong Europe, it must be said that the Spanish Presidency has helped us to make some progress.
Prime Minister Aznar's words to the effect that we must all join forces to tackle the extremely thorny issue of illegal immigration are confirmation of the will for Europe to have a single foreign and security policy.
The immigration crisis must be tackled responsibly and resolutely, without populism and, above all, without concealing the importance of the issue, as we are all too often wont to do.
We need increasing cooperation to control the Union's borders and the development of a single border policy - it is the Italian Government's proposal which has been accepted and, I believe, selected by Commissioner Vitorino too - but we also need the costs of containing migration flows in Europe to be shared.
That is not all, however.
President Prodi is right to say that the causes of uncontrolled immigration must be eradicated.
We need to work towards cooperation which genuinely helps the people, not the local dictators, as has all too often been the case. We need to take action to alleviate the debt, as has recently been pointed out at the FAO Summit in Rome too.
However, we must not overlook the need for legislation which combines rigour and solidarity, and the only way to achieve this is to regulate migration flows, welcoming those who wish to work in Europe with great respect and rejecting those attempting to organise unlawful activities which are all too often criminal and are sometimes linked to terrorism.
The European citizens are demanding this.
I am sure that Seville will deliver the response they are waiting for.
Mr President, I also welcome the statement in the Seville declaration concerning India and Pakistan.
It is crucial that Europe takes responsibility and initiative in solving the crisis in the region and does not just leave the peace efforts to the USA and Russia, especially since some of the EU Member States have strong historical links with the region.
I also believe that it is essential for the development of the CFSP that the EU plays a major role.
I strongly agree with the Council's statement about the threat to the whole region and, indeed, the whole world from a nuclear conflict.
President Prodi is correct in saying that we have far more opportunity to influence the situation positively before a conflict breaks out than after.
I wholeheartedly endorse moves by both India and Pakistan in the last few days, to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kashmir.
We have to support these.
However, despite the reduced tension at present, skirmishes along the border continue.
Casualties continue to rise.
So the sooner de-escalation takes place the better.
It is vital that diplomatic relations and transport links between the two countries are restored.
Bilateral talks between two sides need to take place as soon as possible.
Although war seems to be averted for now, tensions could easily rise again, especially around the time of elections in the Indian Kashmir in September.
On that point, it is vital that these elections are demonstrably free and fair.
However, we need to ensure that fighting over the territory of Kashmir is stopped permanently.
A quest for territory was the catalyst for the Second World War and the solution sought to that issue needs to be applied in this case as well.
Just as trade was used to prevent conflict when the European Coal and Steel community was founded, it is vital to consider such means as a peaceful way to keep tensions permanently low.
The GDP of the two countries is very low and poverty remains a major problem.
Despite recent positive efforts, only half the population of the region is literate, which is a major a barrier to economic growth.
It is essential for the EU to prioritise global security through a poverty reduction programme.
The overwhelming message is clear.
War can never be the solution in situations like this.
Any action must be economic or humanitarian with positive steps to resolve the high level tensions.
Let us now turn our attention to the people.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for its statement and thank the President of the Commission for his contribution.
I should like to make a few observations about the Council reforms and the problem of illegal immigrants.
As far as Council reforms are concerned, three issues appear to me to be of major importance.
These are the improvement and revaluation of the General Affairs Council, the improvement of the decision-making procedure and especially the public nature of Council legislation.
It seems to me that the General Affairs Council should be split up as a matter of urgency, particularly because the specialist councils have pulled far too much power towards themselves, and the General Affairs Council seems to have lost its coordinating task.
It might also be helpful if in all Member States, people in charge of European affairs would actually be given the title of minister so that they are put on an equal footing as most specialist ministers.
This would facilitate the coordinating role of the relevant ministers both nationally and in the Council.
As far as the decision-making procedure is concerned, I should like to advise the Council to study the 34 types of decision in order to find out whether improvements can be made in the Council on this score without amending the Treaty.
Decision-making as it stands is totally lacking transparency and the scope of the decisions is unclear.
Measures to simplify these and to promote transparency would be very desirable.
As far as this transparency is concerned, I believe it could be a very important improvement, without changing the Treaty, if public access were organised in the case of decision-making on European legislation.
It is one of the fundamental rules of democracy that a legislator lays down legislation in public.
The Council of Ministers is one of the few bodies in the world that does not do that, and that is really no longer acceptable.
A decision, therefore, to make those components of the Council public that are involved with legislation is required as a matter of urgency.
I should like to finish off with a comment on illegality.
I welcome the fact that border police will be introduced, but perhaps making airports into external borders again could also be considered.
Since at present, security checks are being made at airports anyway, it would be easy also to show your passport.
This may be a little like swearing in church, but in my view, the issue of illegal immigrants in Europe must be solved, and the stepping up of security at airports could be an attempt at a solution.
In fact, I have always been opposed to the opening up of airports.
Presidents of the European institutions, ladies and gentlemen, we must first of all express our support for the intense activity that the European Union has been undertaking, together with the United States, Russia and the United Nations, to prevent a war between India and Pakistan.
I had the opportunity to visit the region a few weeks ago and, from the meetings I held with the parties involved, in my capacity as President of Parliament's Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I can confirm that, beyond the palpable tensions, there is also a genuine desire for peace.
It is true that these two great countries have already gone to war with each other three times: twice over Kashmir and once over Bangladesh.
Now, however, what we would have is not just another war, if I may put it that way, because both countries now have nuclear weapons and the ability to move them around.
As Mr RamÃ³n de Miguel stressed, the possibility of escalation can never be excluded in a military conflict.
We have, therefore, been greatly encouraged by some positive developments that have taken place in recent days. On the one hand, we have the commitment given by the President of Pakistan to stop the infiltration across the line of control in Kashmir; on the other, there is India's decision to reopen its airspace to Pakistani civil aviation, to re-establish diplomatic representation and to withdraw its battleships from the Gulf of Oman.
This Monday's news from the United States, however, linking the terrorist who was planning to manufacture a nuclear bomb with connections in Pakistan, means that we must remain extremely vigilant towards developments in that region.
The world can only gain from having a European Union that is more active on the international stage.
In order for this to happen, however, we must, specifically, improve the coordination of our efforts in external policy and defence, and make real progress towards having a common diplomatic service.
This is the only way in which the European Union will be genuinely able to bring its influence to bear in conflict prevention.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the citizens of the European Union have a right to security and they recognise that the European Union has a very decisive role to play here.
They also recognise that internal security is the sine qua non for stability and economic development in the European Union.
They also showed during the recent elections that those who deny this need and are not prepared to take suitable measures will find themselves ousted from office.
I am grateful to President Prodi for speaking in such unequivocal terms here today and I welcome and expressly support the Spanish initiative to be taken at the summit in Seville.
President Aznar said that immigration is a key problem and he is right.
But what we want are differentiated immigration measures.
We want measures to speed up the asylum process and measures to integrate genuine refugees, but we also want measures to control and limit immigration, depending on the capacity and needs of our individual Member States.
And we want a package of measures so that war refugees can be housed temporarily.
What we particularly welcome is the package of measures designed to combat illegal immigration and trafficking, especially the initiatives you intend to take to set up a European border police force to be deployed in the zones along our current and future external borders which are particularly at risk.
I also welcome cooperation with the countries from which immigrants come, help in bringing about political and economic stability, readmission agreements and sanctions against countries which are not prepared to protect their borders and even encourage illegal emigration.
If a great deal has been promised and initiated in the past and very little achieved, it has nothing to do with the Council presidency and everything to do with individual Member States and national animosities.
I call on you with the utmost urgency to lobby the Seville Summit to put these measures into practice, especially the measures on immigration.
You can count on the full backing of the European Parliament.
Mr President, I welcome the reference to the Treaty of Nice in Paragraph 6 of the joint resolution.
It is an important confirmation by Parliament that Nice is necessary to facilitate a successful enlargement process.
I want to speak directly to the Spanish President-in-Office at this point.
The Seville European Council is important for the many reasons outlined in our resolutions here today.
However, without the stepping stone of Nice, much of that will be in vain.
You must therefore ensure that the Seville conclusions at least include a declaration that Nice does not in any way modify the Irish policy of military neutrality, currently defined as non-membership of mutual defence pacts.
I would also urge that this declaration be accepted as a protocol to the next Treaty changes in 2004.
I know that Nice does not impact on Irish neutrality.
However, considerable anxiety has been created in Ireland by irresponsible scaremongering on this issue by people fundamentally opposed to European integration, people like my colleague in this Parliament, Mrs McKenna of the Green Group, and the ethnic nationalists of the Sinn Fein Party in Ireland.
The provisions of Nice are part and parcel of the ground rules on which the candidate countries are negotiating their membership of the Union.
Ireland's failure so far to ratify these ground rules serves only to strengthen the anti-European Union sentiment in the candidate countries, to the detriment of all Europeans.
I am also concerned at the grandstanding by some Member States, which are resisting the budgetary commitments needed for the successful development of the accession countries' economies.
The public at large does not understand the tactical manoeuvring behind these battles.
What they see is a penny-pinching attitude, driven by an accountancy approach to politics, rather than the statecraft our citizens are crying out for.
If Seville shows some generosity from our political leaders, our citizens will emulate that generosity in return.
Mr President, as Mr De Rossa has pointed out it is expected that the Seville Summit will discuss the holding of a second Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
Such a step, regrettable as it is, would have been unnecessary if the political establishment in Ireland had made any effort to persuade voters to ratify it.
Instead, a diverse coalition was able to exploit unfounded fears, resulting in its rejection and untold harm being inflicted on Ireland's position within the EU and damaging our relations with applicant states.
Successful ratification is possible, but only if a huge effort is put into the 'yes' campaign.
Our task is not made any easier because we are asking the electorate to overturn a decision it has already made.
Additionally, opponents of the Treaty have been strengthened by their electoral success in the recent Irish general election.
The responsibility for securing a successful outcome to the second referendum rests with Ireland's pro-European parties and social partners.
However, the prime responsibility rests with the Irish Government.
Its task is made infinitely more difficult when its main spokesman at the Convention on Europe, former Commissioner Ray MacSharry, has disappointingly made it absolutely clear that his government has drawn a line in the sand in relation to future European integration.
Its approach - to state 'this far and no further' - moves it closer to the British position on Europe, which places more emphasis on a free trade area rather than pursuing political union.
I take this opportunity to warn the Irish Government that it is following a very dangerous path.
Opportunistic Eurosceptic stances by some of its leading members played into the hands of those who opposed the Treaty of Nice, thereby contributing to its rejection.
It does not help that a leading Eurosceptic has been promoted to full cabinet rank.
Pandering to the same prejudices again could well result in a second failure and consequently leave Ireland in a semi-detached relationship with our EU partners, and that would be disastrous.
Mr President, if any of the guests in the galleries who are with us today had attended the debate that took place in this House in March, they would not understand a thing, because today the benches of the Left have piled on the criticisms of the Barcelona process when in March, on assessing that Council, we voted for an extremely favourable Resolution.
I would like to remind certain people that we cannot go against our own acts and that what was good three months ago cannot be bad now.
My second point is the issue of immigration.
I believe that this Presidency has given a fine example of something very important in politics, which is what in sporting terms is known as suppleness.
Immigration was not one of the Spanish Presidency's priorities, but it has noted that it is now one of the citizens' priorities, and it has incorporated it into its agenda.
And furthermore it is true that there are many issues that have been paralysed for some time in the Council.
I believe that instead of criticising that incorporation, we should have applauded the attempt to promote all these issues.
There is a final question, however, which was mentioned by President Poettering, which I believe to be extremely important and which has not perhaps been discussed so much, which is the delay in enlargement.
For a long time, led by this Parliament, we have been asking for enlargement to take place within specific time limits and now, all of a sudden, certain Member States, certain leaders of Member States, want to carry out certain modifications of the common agricultural policy, for example, which will make enlargement impossible within those limits.
Therefore, within the constructive environment of this House, I would ask our friends on the Left to speak to Mr SchrÃ¶der, to Mr Persson and to Mr Blair to see if we can prevent the hindering of enlargement, so that it can go ahead when we want.
Mr President, I will speak very briefly - firstly due to time restrictions and secondly because it would be practically impossible to respond in detail to all the speakers - but I would like to say - in response to all the Members, such as President Poettering, who have said that we will judge the Spanish Presidency on the basis of the outcome of Seville - that the Presidency does not only exist for one Council, but rather from 1 January to 30 June.
Many days have passed, there are still many days left and we are going to do many things.
The impression is always given that the Union rests upon the will of a single country; holding the Presidency of the Union means that one country is responsible for coordinating the activities of the Union, not for carrying out all the Union's duties, because that is done by the Union itself.
There is something else which is not made sufficiently clear: the results of a Presidency - and at the end of the day a presidency is a period of time - are the results of good inter-institutional agreement: the Council can do nothing without the support and initiatives of the Commission, and the Commission and the Council can do nothing without the support of Parliament.
I believe that over these six months - and this is what I should stress most - the Presidency has received great support from the European Commission at all times, and it still is receiving it; thanks to the efforts of the European Commission - and its right of initiative, in accordance with which it has presented its proposals - we have been able to resolve and do many things.
Also on the issue of co-decision and Parliament's legislative duties, truly significant successes have been achieved, which we cannot fail to note: the last sitting approved - without the need for conciliation, and for the first time in history, thanks to the efforts of Parliament - the Research and Development Framework Programme, and also, thanks to the joint efforts of Parliament and the Presidency, the statute on the European Parliament's electoral system, which had been in deadlock for years, is going to be approved today.
I am not going to make an assessment of the Spanish Presidency, of course: that will be done by the President of the Council at the sitting of 2 July, which is intended for just that purpose.
Then Mr Nogueira will have his wish, since he is so keen to see the President of the Spanish Government.
On 2 July, at 10 a.m., we would like to see you here, Mr Nogueira, because, once the Presidency has ended - and it ends on Sunday, 30 June - the President will give an account of its results.
We are now talking about the Seville Council and there are certain issues I would like to comment on.
The President of the Group of the European People's Party - and certain other Members, such as Mr Swoboda - have expressed concern about the issue of interinstitutional cooperation.
I would like to say firstly that it would have been impossible for the Council and the Commission to have made any more effort during this six-month period to reach an interinstitutional agreement.
Furthermore, that agreement already exists, I do not know why we are bringing the issue up again.
We have held a meeting in which the three institutions have agreed to create a high-level interinstitutional group, on three levels: first-level politician (presidents), second-level politician (commissioners, ministers and committee chairmen), and technical (secretaries-general of the three institutions and ambassadors/permanent representatives).
This has now been created.
Who is calling this into question?
By the way, it does not fall to me to explain the conclusions of the Council, that is not my responsibility, but I would urge the Members of this Parliament to read them and, when you have read them, we will speak again.
On 2 July, you will have the opportunity to ask Mr Aznar whether or not that commitment has really been fulfilled.
I do not understand why demands are being made here when things have developed in accordance with the commitments we had accepted.
I would remind you that there was a meeting here in February between President Prodi, President Aznar and President Cox at which the decision was taken.
I do not know why the issue is being raised again now.
The issue of 'better regulation' falls entirely within the framework of that interinstitutional cooperation that we intend to implement.
With regard to other criticisms of the Socialist Group which I have heard, I believe that the syndrome of bringing the antagonism of internal politics to the European Parliament is very bad.
I am not therefore going to get involved in that slanging match about who is performing well and who is performing badly.
I am not going to respond, since I believe that the Spanish Presidency has done what it could and that its results are sufficiently satisfactory and above all I believe that we will be able to see the results of the Spanish Presidency on 2 July.
With regard to the other issues in the Council, such as enlargement, this afternoon we will have the opportunity to talk at length.
I would like to say that yesterday we finished the latest ministerial conferences on accession in Luxembourg, although there will be another, at vice-president level, before the end of the month.
The result is that during these six months 87 negotiation chapters have been concluded.
Of 31 chapters, the majority of the Member States have concluded an average of between 26 and 29.
In other words, an average of around two or three chapters will remain for the Danish Presidency to conclude.
The 'road map' has been completed, and the only thing that remains to be agreed on - and which I hope can be agreed before the Seville European Council - is the common position on agriculture.
We know why the common position has not been concluded: there are a number of countries which wish to ignore the principles of the Community acquis and establish two classes of country - those which receive direct payments and those which do not - seriously discriminating against the candidate countries and taking advantage of the situation, taking enlargement hostage, in order to further their objectives in terms of the reform of a certain common policy.
If they do not agree to what they should agree to, those countries will have to take responsibility for having delayed enlargement and will have to answer to this Parliament, to their respective publics and to the candidate countries.
Therefore, on the subject of enlargement I just wish to add that the Seville European Council only has to begin to talk, to acknowledge that the technical 'road map' has been completed and draw up a great political itinerary: what is going to be done after concluding the negotiations, to see what our perspective is going to be for 2003, how the Treaty is going to be signed, how the ratifications are going to be carried out, how the new candidate countries are going to be incorporated into the Intergovernmental Conference and how they are going to participate in the European Parliament elections.
That is the political 'road map' that the Seville European Council has to draw up; the technical one is finished.
Therefore, you can rest assured, since, with the efforts made by the Council and the tremendous support of the Commission, the Spanish Presidency has been able to fulfil the mandate of the European Council and also of this Parliament.
With regard to the reform of the Council, it is clear that the Council has a dual dimension: executive and legislative.
The legislative dimension needs to be more transparent - we are the first to agree with this - and the reforms of the Council move in that very direction.
They also move in the direction of making it more effective; to divide up the General Affairs Council and the External Affairs Council; to reduce the structure of the Council; to establish better methods for preparing European Councils; also reducing the machinery of the European Councils and making them more effective and smaller; to create a system of conclusions which does not involve an interminable debate on insignificant details etc. All of these are possible internal reforms of the Council which move in the direction of transparency, but which in no way compromise the provisions of primary Law, which fall to the Intergovernmental Conference.
I am not going to continue to insist on the economic issues.
There is an issue which I have not mentioned, since it was the subject of a debate yesterday afternoon in this House: the Johannesburg Summit and sustainable development.
We are very aware of the failure of the preparation conference in Bali, the PREPCON, and we want the Seville European Council to offer clear guidelines in order to re-affirm the leadership of the European Union in relation to the big issues for Johannesburg, which are development aid, respect for the environment and sustainable development.
During this Spanish Presidency, the Union has ratified the Kyoto Protocol and obtained a commitment in Monterrey on funding for development which in reality is a commitment on which we have managed to combine the wills of everybody and by means of which the whole of the developed world has committed itself to increasing its level of development aid.
I believe that these two factors can allow us to go to Johannesburg with the conviction that we belong to a group of countries which lead the world on all the great issues of sustainable development.
The Seville European Council will therefore acknowledge this as well.
Furthermore, I would like to say to Mr De Rossa that the European Council will give its opinion on the particular problem that he has mentioned, on a declaration which may help Ireland to present itself better and to provide greater security for its citizens in light of the ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
This issue will be dealt with and we hope to be able to issue a declaration which is as positive as possible, along the very lines that Mr De Rossa has indicated.
As well as all these issues, there are other external policy issues which we have already discussed.
I have taken good note of the speeches, in particular those which relate to the conflict between India and Pakistan.
I would like to reiterate the European Council's intention to deal with this issue by sending the most forthright and constructive possible message and I believe it is almost impossible to examine everything that is going to be dealt with at the Council in detail, but I believe this Council will be the culmination of an incredibly intense six-month period.
I have not referred to immigration and asylum, but what I did want to say - since I cannot end without mentioning this issue which has been raised by many of you - is that I believe that the situation of illegal immigration is of concern to the whole of the European public, not legal immigration, since that has its official channels and there are millions of immigrants who have already settled in Europe, which has always been a land of acceptance and asylum.
What is raising great difficulties for European society is this wave of illegal immigrants which, precisely because they are illegal, are marginalised, living in illegal situations and are victims of exploitation and therefore suffer to an extent which is intolerable in our society.
We must therefore combat it.
With regard to the Tampere programme, well there it is, and if any part of it has not been implemented, this is due to the fact that it has not been possible to implement it between 1999 and 2002.
Is that the responsibility of the Council?
It will be, but it is not the responsibility of the current Presidency of the Council, but rather the accumulated responsibility of many other Presidencies.
The fact that this Presidency wants to put the Tampere programme on the table and say 'let us do it once and for all', should be praised rather than criticised.
Therefore, I believe that this issue, like all the issues relating to illegal immigration, is of concern to European society today and it is logical that the Heads of State and Government should deal with all aspects of them.
By the way, this is an entirely public dimension, because there are Commission proposals and furthermore I would like to point out that tomorrow and the next day the Justice and Home Affairs Council will meet and deal with all of these issues.
Councils are public and everybody knows the content of their agendas.
I do not therefore believe that there are any hidden agendas in relation to asylum and immigration and all the issues to be dealt with at the Seville European Council.
Mr President, I would simply like to say that this Council marks the end of this period, which has been hard and difficult; let us hope that the Seville conclusions are able to reflect all the work we have done and that they fulfil the expectations which European society and this Parliament have of the work of the Council and the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will try to be as brief as possible for I can see that the Chamber is already preparing for voting time.
I would just like to stress a few basic points: firstly, I welcome our great consensus on enlargement and I would point out, in this regard, that this is our greatest and most important task for the future; secondly, I am delighted with this debate, which will take us to Seville - Parliament, Commission and Council - with a common line on the interinstitutional agreement and the work on better organisation and better legislation that we have to undertake together.
Our common desire to complete an interinstitutional agreement before the year is out will have a marked, decisive impact on the way we work, and I believe it will also help to make the Seville Summit a success.
I want to make it quite clear - and reassure all the Members of Parliament - that none of this will affect the Convention's work in any way.
This is something we must do without modifying the Treaties, and we have a responsibility to do it for we will have to work with the Treaties in their present form for a long time anyway.
I would emphasise once again our joint undertaking with regard to the major objectives, which many speakers have mentioned in relation to Johannesburg.
We have not been treating it as a low priority, but I have to say that we are completely on our own in these international conventions.
And, quite frankly, I want to say before this House that all these summits we have held, which ought to have shown increasingly great attention towards the Developing World, have not yielded the desired results.
Even yesterday, the failure of the largest countries to send representatives to the FAO Summit was a powerful testimony to the fact that this policy needs to be completely revamped.
Of course, there are contradictions on these issues even in the Union's own policies.
I would remind you of some of the issues which have been mentioned in this House such as Mediterranean policy, the difficulties surrounding the creation of a bank - a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank - to boost development in this area, and the even greater obstacles encountered in our endeavours to set up a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for dialogue between cultures, for which some countries were not even prepared to commit EUR 1 million.
With regard to immigration, there is remarkable consensus on the key points: border police, cooperation with the future Member States to combat illegal activity, and an active policy aimed, as Mrs Suominen said, at integrating immigrants and making them genuine citizens of the Union.
This is the shared objective towards which we are all working.
Of course, we have to remember that, if we are to achieve this goal, it is our duty, our responsibility to fight for an active role in integrating immigrants and reuniting families, and to establish, as Mr Pirker said, long-awaited immigration guidelines.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the task we have to tackle together.
It will allow us to reach a goal which we all share: the goal of preparing for enlargement of the Union with institutions which are able to cope with this difficult project.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of speaking, by way of exception, before the vote, because the vote that is about to take place confirms that Parliament, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control were able to carry out proper cooperation and the proper procedure with regard to the Council and the Commission.
At this point I should like to acknowledge the work of my co-rapporteur, Michiel van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, as well as the efforts of Mr Wyn, who chaired the Conciliation Committee, and also the efforts of the two committees which worked energetically with the two principal rapporteurs. I should also like to thank the secretariats of the two committees, insofar as Parliament was concerned.
I should also like to acknowledge the very hard work put in by the Spanish Presidency so as to ensure that we successfully completed the work on this very difficult and very important dossier.
Finally, of course, I should naturally like to thank Mrs Schreyer and the Commission, as well as the Budget Directorate-General, for the cooperation that they gave us to enable this matter to be brought to a successful conclusion.
This report constitutes an agreement on the Financial Regulation of the Union. It therefore concerns a very important subject.
We were able to agree on a formula which shows that there can be excellent cooperation between institutions in several interinstitutional fields.
I hope that it will be possible to follow this example when working on other dossiers which are more difficult or equally difficult.
On the subject of content, I should just like to say to Members that they will be voting for an agreement which makes it possible for our institution to reaffirm and strengthen its prerogatives with regard to budgetary authority and discharging authority.
It seems to me that it is important to emphasise this.
I should just like to add that they have to vote on a Financial Regulation which will be more transparent, so that the rules and procedures contained in that Regulation will be easier to understand and more transparent.
I believe, therefore, that this is a successful result, and I should like to thank all those who took part in this work.
As this concerns the budgetary procedure, the Commissioner responsible for the budget may speak briefly.
Mr President, honourable Members, the new version of the financial regulation is one of the largest and most comprehensive pieces of legislation during this parliamentary term, which is why I should like to thank you on the Commission's behalf for the excellent collaboration which we have enjoyed with the European Parliament and the Council and, most importantly, with the two committees, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I should also like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Dell'Alba and Mr Hulten, on their very clever handling of the negotiations and the positive results for Parliament.
My warmest thanks on behalf of the Commission.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 5, and the Council ought to be able to do so before the end of the Spanish Presidency.
At this stage, however, the Commission believes that Amendment No 6 would run the risk of compromising the agreement obtained with the Council, and is therefore obliged to reject it.
Our common objective should in fact be the rapid adoption of the regulation establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission congratulates the rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², and the Committee on the Environment, on the progress achieved on this important dossier.
We hope that it will soon be possible to complete the work so as to allow the implementation, for the first time, of the new competences conferred by the Treaty of Amsterdam in matters concerning public health.
The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19, 25, 27 and 28.
The Commission is also able to accept, in part, Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 21.
The Commission is unable, for the reasons indicated by Mr Byrne during yesterday morning's debate, to accept Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8, 11, 22, 23, 24 and 26.
Mr President, we should remind colleagues who may not be here for the formal sitting that the vote on the calendar for next year takes place at 12.30 p.m., so everybody should be back and not caught offside.
The sitting is suspended and will resume after the formal sitting.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.58 a.m. for the formal sitting and resumed at 12.35 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order, history seems to be repeating itself.
The vote on the calendar followed a formal sitting last time.
I wish to make sure in this great democracy that you give people time to get back into their seats to vote.
It seems too much of a coincidence that it happened exactly the same this year as it did last year.
I am sorry, you will have to look somewhere else for a conspiracy theory.
I want to get on with the vote.
Mr President, in my idea of what constitutes democracy, there are votes which should be expressed publicly.
(Loud applause)
The secret ballot is reserved for certain appointments, but when democrats are not capable of stating publicly their choices concerning essential political appointments, when they call for secret ballots on points of procedure, even though they claim to be defending transparency, then all I can say is that that is not my idea of democracy, or of transparency, or of a sense of political responsibility.
I want to say publicly, here and now, that I shall be voting against the amendments tabled by those advocates of transparency - a strange transparency indeed!
(Loud applause)
From where I sit it is like the radar screen is lighting up all over the House.
We are here to vote.
We have had a point made by Mrs BerÃšs which, judging from the applause, many colleagues obviously appreciate.
A large number of people wish to speak.
If it is on this, you are not getting the floor.
With regard to the secret ballot, Rule 136 does not limit the scope of the use of a secret ballot.
What it does require is that in order to use a secret ballot, a signed request must be made by at least one-fifth of the Members of the House, namely 126 Members.
The services have received the signatures of 140 Members requesting a secret ballot.
It seems to me in line with the Rules of Procedure of the House that the 140 are entitled to make the request.
It is certainly open to Mrs BerÃšs and others to ask the 140 if they wish to withdraw.
But if they do not withdraw then the Rules are clear.
I would ask whether the 140 have a spokesman to comment on the question of withdrawal?
Mr President, let me say that we will not withdraw the request for a secret vote for the simple reason that in the past Members have found it difficult on this particular issue to vote according to their conscience and we want everyone to be able to vote according to their conscience on this issue.
Mr President, among the 62 amendments you are about to put to the vote en bloc from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is Amendment No 1, but not Amendment No 73.
However, these amendments are complementary.
We should not adopt one without adopting the other because to do so would eliminate roll-call votes.
At least it would eliminate us recording the results of roll-call votes.
I am sure that is not the intention of anybody in this House, nor the intention of the group which asked for a separate vote.
I would ask you to take a vote together on Amendments Nos 1 and 73 and ask the House to vote for them.
It is purely a technical rearranging of the rules.
There is no real matter of importance here, but it is important that we do not make a mess of it.
Concerning amendment 56 :
Mr President, I should like to suggest to the plenary an oral amendment, at the request of a number of Members from several groups.
It would seem that, on such a complex report, there is one phrase which has hit on one of the current provisions of our Rules of Procedure which concerns Rule 108.
I would suggest, with the agreement of our rapporteur, Mr Richard Corbett, that we should add the following words, 'Parliament may, at the request of one tenth of its Members and on the basis of a report, etc?.
At the moment it is actually the plenary sessions which can instigate the procedure, together, obviously, with the competent committee which completes the work.
However, I think that it is important to remember this point.
Mr President, that is not what we agreed on this point in the debates in committee and in the group.
The point is, we do not start this sort of procedure unless there is some prospect of obtaining the required majorities further down the line in this difficult procedure to establish human rights violations in Member States.
That is why we are opposed to this oral amendment.
Mr President, an Amendment No 172 has been tabled, which contains a phrase, in English, which is quite incomprehensible.
Could there perhaps have been a mistake?
I shall read it out to the rapporteur:
This arises because we have agreed with the other institutions two different deadlines for Parliament to object to implementing measures being taken by the Commission.
In the general framework agreement with the Commission, we have a one-month deadline.
However, quite recently we successfully negotiated a longer deadline in the context of the Lamfalussy report.
Mr von Wogau was the rapporteur and will remember that we obtained a three-month deadline for measures that fall within that category.
So rather than restricting ourselves to a one-month deadline in the Rules generally, when you can go further for that category, the Rule is being adapted to ensure that we can go further for measures of that kind.
It is relatively simple and I advise the House to accept the amendment.
I have the impression that the reference you make is to the packet dealing with financial services.
The confusion arises because of the reference to financial markets.
I suggest that the House and the rapporteur agree that we change the word 'market' to 'services'.
I believe that captures both the objection and the explanation.
Let us do that and then vote on 172.
Concerning amendment 144 :
Mr President, we in the PPE-DE Group tabled both Amendment No 142 and Amendment No 144 on this point.
Now that Amendment No 142 has been accepted, we do not, I think, need to vote on Amendment No 144, because it deals with the same issue.
Mr Corbett, does 144 fall in consequence of adopting 142?
Mr President, I am glad that my colleague in the PPE-DE Group has now come round to the view that I put to him yesterday.
Yesterday he thought that we did need a separate and additional vote, but I am happy that he now accepts that we do not.
Thank you for the gracious observations.
Concerning amendment 174 :
Mr President, the services have pointed out that the proposed amendments are identical.
However, that is not the case in all the language versions and, even in the English version, there are interesting differences between the version in the committee report and the version now before plenary.
The point is, do we call for the High Representative to be present at foreign and security policy debates or do we word it more politely by saying he should be invited.
I think that, as we are talking about foreign and security policy, we should opt for the diplomatic wording, as contained in Amendments Nos 120 and 174.
Mr President, Mr Wuermeling is right.
The confusion arises from two different versions of the original having been circulated.
If we take the corrected version of the original then indeed the three amendments are identical and can be voted as one which would be the best solution.
Amendment No 74 reads: 'Any Member ... may give an oral explanation on the final vote ... orally at most twice each sitting.'
I have a vague, a faint suspicion that the intention of the Members who have tabled this amendment is to stop me talking, for I am the only person who delivers more than two explanations of vote.
Although I do not support Amendment No 74, I will try to comply with the wishes of the Members who have tabled this amendment by adopting a silent approach as of now and withdrawing my oral amendment.
Mr President, as is his wont, Mr Fatuzzo has given an explanation of vote, because we have already addressed his cause for concern by rejecting the proposed amendment.
Colleagues, I should like to take up my protocol duties with the King of Jordan.
I am pleased to have been able to get this far into the Corbett vote.
I extend a modest apology to my friend Mr Bourlanges for being at the wrong end of my gavel earlier today but I believe the House appreciated voting expeditiously.
In the end I hope no injury was done to any particular interests.
Mr President, I should just like to make a brief comment here.
The fact of the matter is, we should be obliged to examine the financial impact of committee reports.
Rule 159 refers at one point to legislative reports.
We have already adopted the wording for that.
Article 160 refers to non-legislative reports, but we should ensure that the same wording is used in both cases because, materially, it makes no difference if a financial statement is drawn up for a legislative or a non-legislative report.
In this respect, having voted on Amendment No 88, there should in fact be no need to vote again here.
It appears to make sense to me.
Does the rapporteur agree?
Mr President, this is another case where confusion has arisen because the amendments distributed before the vote do not quite correspond to the amendments contained in the report because there was a linguistic correction in between, but Mr Wuermeling is right.
We should stick to the same formula that we have already adopted so as to have consistency in the text.
We will ensure they are consistent.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Dell'Alba (A5-0227/2002)
. (ES) Very briefly, since the debate we should have had has not taken place on this occasion, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
This is essentially a highly technical report, which will no doubt be ignored by the press, but it is of enormous importance in terms of the good functioning of the European budget in the future.
The rapporteur's work has preserved the rights of Parliament and prevented certain retrograde steps initially proposed by the Council.
I congratulate you once again.
.
(DE) I voted against the recommendation in the Dell'Alba report and, hence, against the new financial regulation.
This new financial regulation no longer makes provision for any independent financial control before payments are disbursed from the EU budget.
This is a violation of the EC Treaty, which requires independent financial control.
With no such ex-ante control, the risks of irregularity and fraud will increase.
The Commission has received warnings to this effect for a long time, most recently from its own accounting officer, who was promptly removed.
The Commission will have to pay a heavy price for refusing to take these warnings seriously.
- (FR) We voted in favour of this report because of the various elementary adoptions of position which it contains.
However, the mere fact that it was necessary to go through the whole conciliation process before the Council would agree to accept a few timid amendments by the European Parliament shows that we cannot count on governments, as represented by the Council, to implement real equality between women and men.
The de facto inequality between women's wages and men's wages bears witness, amongst many other things, to the gap between the hypocritical positions adopted by the policy makers and the reality of the situation.
- (FR) It would be difficult not to give one's full and entire support to this new version of Directive 76/207/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in all areas of employment including vocational training.
Among the many reasons for that support, there are three which are particularly crucial and essential as far as I am concerned.
The first of these is that this text, for the first time at Community level, contains a definition of 'sexual harassment', which is defined as a situation 'where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or offensive environment?.
This directive also defines 'direct discrimination', 'indirect discrimination' and 'harassment'.
The second reason is the fact that this new directive prohibits discrimination against women on the grounds of pregnancy or maternity leave, and lays down the entitlement to return to the same job or an equivalent position at the end of maternity leave, or paternity or adoption leave, when those rights are recognised by Member States.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency is the right move following a number of tragedies at sea over recent years, the worst of which, for Greece, was the shipwreck of the 'Samina' ferry boat.
The Council's position has been improved by a number of amendments made by the European Parliament in connection with transparency, forwarding the agency's findings to the Member States, the role of experts on the agency's administrative board and combating fraud.
The Mastorakis report is a considerable improvement on the Commission's initial proposal, which is why I shall vote in favour of it.
- (FR) Following the shipwreck of the oil tanker 'Erika', the Commission submitted a second set of measures, including the proposed regulation on establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency.
This new agency will provide the Member States and the Commission with the technical and scientific support necessary to enable them to apply Community legislation effectively.
In formulating its Common Position, the Council has generally stuck to the spirit and objectives of the proposed regulation, that is, solving the safety problems of sea transport and protecting the marine environment.
This Common Position therefore expresses our most urgent desire, which is to reinforce both the safety of sea transport and the protection of the marine environment.
For that essential reason I shall be supporting this Common Position.
Of course, one may deplore the fact that it was not possible to tackle the issue of where this Agency should have its seat, and one may think that the option of excluding representatives of the professional sectors and replacing them with professionals nominated by the Commission does tend to distance this Common Position from the proposals made by the Commission and Parliament.
Nevertheless, I shall vote in favour of Mr Mastorakis' report, which approves that position.
Two and a half years after the wreck of the 'Erika', there must be no further delay in putting into practice such important measures.
Transport safety is now at the top of the political agenda of the fifteen governments of the European Union. It is rightly the case as too many innocent persons lose their lives as a result of inadequate transport measures.
Reducing fatalities and deaths on our roads must remain as the central political goal.
This must be achieved by ensuring greater enforcement of our road safety legislation and improving the quality of our road driving.
Maritime safety is also becoming a more important political issue within the European Union.
This is primarily the case because of the disastrous environmental damage that was caused as a result of the Erika tanker sinking of the coast of France a couple of years ago.
The European Commission has brought forward a proposal which is designed to establish a new European Maritime Safety Agency.
This new Agency will provide Member States of the EU and the European Commission with the necessary technical and scientific support in order to effectively implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and to prevent pollution from ships.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) For some companies, it is appealing to carry out their activities in an area where there is little or no government control, so that they are not hindered in their profitable activities which could constitute a risk for their workers, for other people or for the environment.
For a long time, anything that was not allowed on land seemed to be permitted at sea, and certainly when this concerned the sea area outside the territorial waters.
Most of the damage was done and most indignation caused when oil tankers made water, as a result of which their cargo covered the coasts and animals living on them for a long time.
Decisions have already been taken on the use of ships that knowingly dump parts of their cargo that has become unusable, or the remainder of their fuel, as well as on the phasing out of single-hulled tankers.
This has not yet made the maritime environment sufficiently safe.
There are transitional periods, and unexpected situations arise all the time that constitute risks for passengers and crew and for a large area at sea or on the coast.
This is why it is useful that a body will be set up that gathers knowledge and monitors rules.
For too long, all eyes have been on the composition of the board and the differences of opinion on that score.
This is why I can agree in this case on a prompt start and on moving possible improvements to a later date.
We voted against the Commission's Amendment No 7 and against Amendment No 19 because, while supporting absolutely a system in which blood is donated free of charge and regarding it as shocking that anyone could turn it into merchandise, we believe that employees who absent themselves from work in order to give blood should retain their wages.
If a worker is prepared to donate his blood, there is no reason why his boss, in turn, should not be able to donate a miserable few hours' pay.
We would all welcome the setting of standards of quality for blood products.
On a basic human level, a constant supply of good quality products is essential to best provide for the people of Europe who need them because of disease and illness and to that extent we must be able to give certainty as regards the quality of the end product as well as the method of collection, testing, processing and storage.
Therefore I gladly support the proposal before us today.
It should also be emphasised that each of us has an obligation to contribute to the blood supply on a voluntary basis, as it is essential to maintain these services for all.
That being the case, if products are not available in the EU from a voluntary and non-remunerated supply, we should not prevent products being imported from outside the EU for the protection of human health and the delivery of services to people in need.
With this practical caveat, I give my full support to the proposal.
- (FR) The measures recommended in this report will largely make it possible to prevent the sort of disasters that we have seen, particularly in France with the contaminated blood affair.
We cannot avoid thinking about the tragic outcome, which has made such a deep impression on our minds.
We must, then, at European level, establish high standards for the quality of blood and for the safety of its collection, we must be strict about storage conditions and traceability, and we must lay down demanding rules for inspection and monitoring.
Blood is not an item of merchandise like any other.
It is not 'commercial goods', and nothing must be allowed to make us depart from that notion.
I remain firmly opposed to any commercial use of human blood, and I hope that all Member States will stand firm on the principle of voluntary donation without remuneration.
On this subject, subsidiarity applies, but in addition to being a cultural issue it is also a question of ethics, ethics that are shared by many Europeans, and also a scientific issue.
In fact, studies have shown that blood collected by voluntary, unpaid donation is of a higher quality.
In order to promote such voluntary unpaid donation, Europe should encourage all its Member States to promote this principle and should launch huge information and public-awareness campaigns.
Mr President, I would like to point out that the British Conservative delegation in the European Parliament voted against the Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado report because of a number of aspects it contains with which we do not agree.
I will not take up the time of the House by going through the details.
We would have voted for it if it had in any way impinged upon the right of the Gibraltar inhabitants to participate in the next European Parliament elections.
The minutes statement that is attached to this report from the UK Government makes it clear that it is the UK Government's sole responsibility to ensure that the legislation is put in place for Gibraltarians to vote in those elections.
I would like to take this brief opportunity to urge the UK Government to live up to that minutes statement and put that legislation in place so that Gibraltarians are able to participate in the electoral process electing representatives who will have an influence over laws which apply in Gibraltar.
We have voted in favour of giving Parliament's consent to amending the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament.
It is good that these changes are coming about, establishing common principles governing the election procedure.
There are also very good reasons for indicating in Parliament's legislative resolution the importance of the principle of equality between men and women in order to guarantee a balanced representation of both sexes.
We do not, however, consider it unfortunate that the Council chose not to propose a common European constituency for 10% of the mandates to the European Parliament.
We do not believe that a common constituency of that kind would add anything of great importance at this stage.
- (FR) The draft Council decision on the organisation of European elections makes provision for the possibility of regional constituencies, on the initiative and at the discretion of each country.
To the extent that this is a simple option, which in any case is already in use in a minority of countries, this provision may be accepted.
As far as France is concerned, however, we are opposed to such a reform, which would encourage the fragmentation of the country with regard to Brussels.
That was the meaning of the amendment which I had proposed, and which I spoke about during the debate.
The Council has explained that the creation of territorial constituencies within a country should not, overall, undermine the proportional nature of the voting (Article 2).
Parliament has clarified this 'overall' by explaining that it must not 'undermine the proportional representation of political families at Member State level? (Recital C).
We conclude from this that, when territorial constituencies are created, the effects of thresholds must be avoided, for example by introducing a system of 'recovering the residues' at national level.
However, all that would be very complicated.
The current system is simpler, clearer and more effective for the purposes of representing France.
I am of course in favour of direct universal elections to our Parliament and I congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work he has put in to increase the authority and credibility of our Assembly.
There is, however, one fatal flaw in this Parliament's approach to the whole question of universal suffrage.
The problem is that the five European Parliament elections that have so far taken place since 1979 have not included one particular part of the European Union.
I have in mind the 15,000 voters of Gibraltar.
Member States' exclusion of this small territory from the right to vote reflects no credit on them.
And I have in mind successive British governments as well as others.
This report leaves open the question of the Gibraltarian vote.
Although some progress has been made on this matter since the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in 1999, the matter is still unresolved.
No Council decision on European Parliament voting can be complete without recognition of the Gibraltarians' rights.
That is why I shall be voting against this report.
. (NL) Within society, there are clashing views of society and opposing group interests.
All these arrogant politicians, from both Left and Right, have, with authoritarian means, tried to forge unity and lay down definitive end conclusions from the top down.
We have witnessed time and again that this is eventually fought by the majority of the people.
Politics is the organisation of differences of opinion that exist within society, as a result of which they become more readily understood by the public.
Electoral systems that are only intended to form a stable government majority hinder the free forming of opinion from the bottom up.
All structures that try to exclude existing movements from the political debate, however controversial these may be, are objectionable.
This is why I opt for proportional representation.
For the time being, this new Council decision is obstructing cross-border, proportional representation, with multi-national lists for 10% of the European Parliament seats, something that was requested by the European Parliament in 1998.
Despite this, I endorse the decision because public opinions happen to be formed not at European, but national, level.
A major improvement is the fact that territorial constituencies for elections are no longer imposed on the larger Member States and that maximum expenses for the election campaigns can be prescribed.
I totally reject the rapporteur's conclusion that the election campaigns in all Member States should mainly be about choosing a President for the European Commission.
. (PT) Although some progress has been made in negotiations with the Council, there are still aspects that need to be clarified, studied in detail and improved.
One such aspect is the priority 'Global change and ecosystems', given that the fisheries sector was subjected to swingeing budgetary cuts under the Sixth Framework Programme for research, with its budget being reduced from EUR 880 million under the previous programme to only EUR 570 million.
It is equally important, however, that we pay full attention to soil, which is also a component of terrestrial ecosystems and a crucial factor in their sustainable development.
Soil also constitutes the world's greatest reserve of biomass and this being the case, its protection in terms of CO2 retention and also so that it can be harnessed in the long term.
Hence the importance of engaging in research that seeks to provide a better understanding of the functioning of terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
Furthermore, it should be noted that enormous pressure is being exerted by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, which are attempting to strengthen their influence over the programme. This could distort the balance of the final version.
Mr President, we have just voted in favour of a monthly plenary session reduced to four days.
Four days, which means three days of work - is that serious, is it effective?
No, of course not, and in any case those people who proposed it were also proposing to extend other sessions, even though they are aware that the extravagant use of time which we experience during those sessions, and the frustrations caused by the little time that Members have to express themselves, are not reasonable.
The problem is, however, that, using the length of sessions as a pretext, it is the Strasbourg sitting that is being called into question.
In my view, the basic problem, and I am determined to say it because I opposed this decision, lies not in any opposition between two cities, but rather in the opposition between two visions of Europe. There is the centralising vision, which wants to concentrate on a single place, Brussels, on the grounds of alleged rationality, of self-styled efficacy, a technocratic vision if you like, and then there is the decentralised, pluralist vision, the vision of a multi-dimensional Europe which has to be able to work from several centres of decision-making, thereby recognising and respecting the cultural diversities and identities of which it is composed.
After enlargement, it will be not only Brussels, but also Strasbourg, Luxembourg, Frankfurt, and perhaps another location which will have to be established and promoted in order to meet the needs of the enlarged Europe which we are creating.
That is why I opposed this reduction in the length of the plenary session.
Mr President, Mr Cox has apologised to me because I had asked to draw the attention of the House to the Rules of Procedure, which have not been followed.
In fact, I believe that we have contravened our Rules of Procedure.
It is quite legitimate for a fifth of Members to request a secret ballot, even though I, like Mrs BÃ©rÃšs, think that it was not at all advisable in the circumstances.
Having said that, however, Rule 136(4) lays down a specific procedure for such secret ballots.
The counting of any secret vote is carried out by between two and six tellers, drawn by lot from among the Members.
That means that we have here a solemn procedure, a cumbersome procedure, a procedure which is intended precisely to discourage any inopportune requests for the use of a secret ballot.
One does not vote by secret ballot in the same way as one would change one's tie.
We also find that, in the Corbett report on which we have just voted, Rule 136 was not amended.
Therefore the President was wrong not to apply the procedure laid down in Article 4, which is intended precisely to avoid using secret ballots, for tactical reasons, at every opportunity.
Mr Dell'Alba, we are not having a debate on a point of order.
This is just explanations of vote.
Mr Bourlanges can say what he likes in his explanation of vote.
No Mr President, you would have said it yourself, but I am saying it to my excellent fellow Member who is generally always to the point in what he says.
In this precise case, Mr Cox applied the rule.
If he were to consult the rule preceding the one he quoted, he would see that this provision derogates from Rule 136 and allows precisely the procedure which the President followed.
Working in two different places is an operational nightmare for the European Parliament and, more importantly, an unbearable burden on the European taxpayers expected to back the ultimatums of governments in certain Member States of the European Union.
That money should be squandered like this on working premises is intolerable, especially when attempts are being made to cut back on the number of languages used in the work of the European Union, which are vital if every citizen is to be able to enter Parliament, irrespective of his or her level of education, and every citizen in the European Union is to have a full understanding of the work of Parliament.
I believe that the European Parliament should have one seat, especially following the enlargement of the European Union, and that this seat should be located as close to the geographical centre of the enlarged EU as possible and should be more politically balanced between north, south, east and west than it is at present.
- (FR) The European Parliament has just expressed, yet again, its opposition to the Friday morning part-session in the plenary weeks held in Strasbourg.
It does not have the right to do this, because it has to obey the Treaty.
It is, in fact, infringing the Treaty on two points.
First of all, as the Court of Justice pointed out in 1997, when the Treaty refers to the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions, it is referring to existing practice, which is that of periods lasting one week.
Secondly, the additional plenary sessions which may be held in Brussels are intended to provide a supplement when working time in Strasbourg is fully occupied.
It is therefore not possible to get rid of Strasbourg weeks while at the same time adding on mini-sessions in Brussels.
Nor is it correct to plan the Brussels sessions a year in advance, without knowing whether or not the Strasbourg agenda will be full.
I deplore the fact that the previous French Government did not bring the matter before the Court of Justice when the Strasbourg Friday sessions were omitted in 2000 and 2001, and I hope that the next government will do better.
- (FR) Given the low attendance at the Friday morning sittings when they were in force, the question of whether or not to return to five-day periods would seem to be by and large hypocritical.
Moreover, we refuse to take part in the acrimonious little war between Brussels and Strasbourg which lies behind the positions adopted on this subject.
Consequently we have abstained from voting.
On the other hand, it is unacceptable that the staff should suffer the consequences of choices made by Members, resulting either in a reduction of their wages or of certain bonuses, or in an increase in their workload.
If the European Parliament makes the decision to carry on using four-day sessions, we ask that all wages should be returned to the level they were at when there were five-day sessions, and that any resulting disadvantages to staff, whether civil servants, auxiliary staff or temporary workers, should be eliminated.
I was not in favour of the two recent ballots on the calendar of sessions 2003.
I voted in favour of both amendments 1 and 3 for the self-evident reasons that Brussels is a far better place to conduct our business economically and efficiently than Strasbourg.
I will always vote to reflect that view and try to end the mindless and expensive perigrinations around Europe that John Major's government imposed on the Parliament at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992.
- (FR) The UEN Group and the French delegation of the RPF are opposed to any manoeuvre which would reduce the length of plenary sessions at Strasbourg.
In order to correct the annoying precedent of last year, when Mrs Fontaine was President, namely the omission of Friday from the timetable of plenary sessions, I requested, on behalf of my group, the reinstatement of the five-day week at Strasbourg.
We know perfectly well that a plenary session reduced to four days does not allow us to work properly.
However, in addition to this purely technical aspect, which is in itself not a negligible one, I refuse, for serious political reasons, to see a day (whether Monday or Friday) chopped off the Strasbourg sessions, while at the same time the number and length of extraordinary sessions in Brussels are being improperly increased.
In actual fact these practices are covering up an obvious desire to transfer Parliament's headquarters definitively from Strasbourg to Brussels, in spite of what is laid down in the Treaties.
Strasbourg must not be downgraded to become a mere annex to Brussels.
Strasbourg is and must remain the seat of the European Parliament.
- (FR) Once again, the anti-Strasbourg lobby is on the rampage, trying to shorten and devalue the Strasbourg sessions and, in the end, to abolish them.
Anything goes, from the use of the secret ballot to the threat of legionella.
I should like to remind the House that it is not the responsibility of an assembly to decide itself where it should sit.
It is not up to Members to decide, on whatever grounds, whether of comfort, whim or gastronomic preferences, on the place where they legislate.
Just imagine, for a moment, a situation in which the European Parliament decides, because it is more pleasant, to sit in Courmayeur in winter and in Saint-Tropez in summer.
An assembly can only submit to what has been fixed by governments, and therefore by the people, by means of basic texts.
In the present case, the texts in question have laid down that the European Parliament shall have its seat in Strasbourg, and the Flemish-soup lobby cannot be allowed to make Strasbourg its seat in name only.
Mr President, I wanted to say to our rapporteur that his report, as many people wanted it to, has been greatly reduced in the manner of Balzac's peau de chagrin.
I do not know whether that is the correct term in French, but anyway I wanted to emphasise that, thanks to the efforts of a certain number of Members who have Parliament's interests at heart, a number of amendments which were not in Members' interests have been rejected.
Some of those amendments were absolutely ludicrous.
For example, we would no longer have been able to ask for split voting, even though we are a Parliament consisting of experienced Members who just this morning, because urgency required it, had to table an oral amendment.
We therefore had to limit ourselves with regard to the separate votes and other aspects, and to limit the urgent business.
Consequently we are very pleased, even though there are still a number of black spots, that the adopted version of the report constitutes a clear retreat from what Mr Corbett wanted to impose on us.
This report endeavours to rationalise the work of the European Parliament in the run up to the enlargement of the ?U, inter alia by reinforcing the role of parliamentary committees and reducing the work of plenary.
Although the report contains a number of good ideas, it also contains proposals which are particularly worrying, such as:
increasing the powers of the President, who will be allowed to give the floor to those who catch his eye, without abiding by any rules, or decide on the admissibility of questions or amendments, which could well lead to high-handedness;
the need for groups to represent one-fifth of the Member States, thereby discouraging convergence in the European parliamentary area;
restricting the use of all languages in all the work of the European Parliament, irrespective, including representations and so on.
- (FR) The revision of the Rules of Procedure proposed by the Corbett report will have the effect, on the pretext of simplifying and reducing procedures, of strengthening the duopoly of the major groups with federalist majorities within the European Parliament.
In effect, the conditions for forming groups have been tightened up, which makes it more complicated to create small groups.
At the same time, parliamentary life will be made more difficult for minorities and Non-attached Members.
Up to now, the latter have been able to express themselves via explanations of vote in writing.
Yet the tolerance which was traditionally shown with regard to the length of those explanations has been withdrawn by the administration without any clear justification having been given.
This reversal actually penalises minorities and Non-attached Members much more than any others.
Here, as elsewhere, the sense of deliberate manoeuvring is quite clear. A witch hunt is being carried out against anyone who does not bear the federalist stamp.
Finally, as I said in the debate, this revision of the Rules of Procedure expands the rights of the European Parliament beyond what is allowed by the Treaty, and apparently no Member State is worried by this.
I wish to place on record my support and appreciation for the hard work and expertise Richard Corbett has put into reforming Parliament's rules.
As a result of his efforts, Parliament should now function better and hold more interesting debates.
It should now be able to cope with enlargement.
This is a first and important step in making Parliament a more effective voice for the people in EU decision-making.
. (NL) A parliament can only function well if at least the following three conditions are met.
First of all, it must be a recognisable reflection, constantly nourished by society, of the clashing views and interests in that society.
Secondly, there must be sufficient opportunity to make this clash visible in the public debate, which is achieved most effectively if, before the decisions are taken, the Members can react to each other or can ask for clarifications by means of interruptions and a second round of debate.
Thirdly, the electorate must have the certainty that Parliament itself can take initiatives, and takes the final decisions on legislation, budget and coalition forming by simple majority.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament meets none of these criteria, a fact that is not altered by the proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure.
These amendments mainly relate to restricting speaking time, to time-consuming procedures for selecting more rigorously the amendments to be voted on and to opportunities for presidents, on their own initiative, to give the floor to backbenchers sympathetic to them.
These changes benefit the two largest groups, but are disadvantageous to anyone who wants to show what alternative decisions are desirable and possible.
As a result, the European Parliament remains a kind of senate that is far removed from the people, where the tenor of the meetings is the explanations of vote and the communication of faits accomplis.
I am sorry that Parliament has today voted against a proposal concerning the option of six months' parental leave in connection with the birth or adoption of children. Under this option, a Member of the European Parliament would be replaced in accordance with rules governing definitive dismissal.
Under the present Rules, an MEP can certainly be on leave, but he or she is not entitled to be replaced.
In that way, the political group has one MEP fewer, with the same workload having to be distributed among fewer MEPs.
That is especially hard on parties from smaller states with few MEPs.
There is therefore pressure on the MEP concerned to take up his or her place again as soon as possible, to the detriment of the MEP's family and children.
In Parliament, we often state that it must be possible to combine work and family life, and we urge governments to take measures to make that possible.
The same thing must also apply, of course, to Parliament as a place of work.
Just as new parents in other types of work are entitled to leave, so too should Members of the European Parliament be.
We must have Rules of Procedure which reflect a positive view of family and children, something not expressed by the present Rules.
It might, moreover, be questioned whether the latter really are democratic, because they make it more difficult for people who are at an age when they might want children or a family to stand as candidates and assume the responsibilities of MEPs.
Mr President, on this point I should simply like to emphasise - and I say this very seriously - that, like the losing fleet after a war, the Socialist Group has scuttled the report of one of its eminent members, Mr Corbett.
Thus the group voted deliberately against all the amendments to the Corbett report, which can now be summed up in a single sentence.
The European Parliament, through the will of the Socialist Group, is responding to the expectations of the Court of First Instance of the Communities by voting against the report of one of its eminent Members, namely Mr Corbett, and allowing a report consisting of a single sentence to be adopted, at the end of two and a half years of work by the Constitutional Committee.
I wanted to emphasise this point so that it will appear in the Minutes.
Perhaps the cowardly vote which has taken place this morning will be referred to again later, within other bodies.
. (NL) On account of the guarded resistance to the forming of small groups, there are fewer groups in the European Parliament than in some national parliaments.
The advantage is that international groups combine adherents of more or less the same political persuasion, instead of 150 groups of individual national parties.
But it also has disadvantages, such as the position of individual Members who do not belong to any groups or who switch groups from time to time.
In the Netherlands, I am used to a system where parliamentary groups are formed on the basis of the election result.
Every list that obtains seats, even if this is only one, is recognised as a group.
In the European Parliament, on the other hand, groups are not formed until after the elections, and the switching of individual Members to another group is not considered as theft of seats. Since a large number of Members from different Member States are needed in order to be recognised as a group, there will be political movements left over that are too small for this.
This leads not only to the setting up of ideologically-connected groups, within which, based on differences of national public opinions, Members do not always see eye to eye on practical choices, but also to artificial, technical groups, in which parties work together that do not know each other.
In my view, an obligation for all Members who cannot find any groups to join, to take part in a mixed group based on a Spanish model, is complete madness.
The Inglewood motion for a resolution contains mainly technical arrangements concerning the justification of amendments which rationalise how we work, which is why the GUE/NGL Group will vote in favour of it.
However, I should like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the need for proper justification of proposed amendments, which may cover issues which are extremely important to European citizens. This is being jeopardised, especially within the context of the information industry, which alienates Members of Parliament from what they are voting on, often without their knowledge.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
I wish to welcome to the Tribune this afternoon the Chairman of the Russian State Duma Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, led by Vice-President Vladimir Lukin, Mr Alexander Belousov and Mrs Valentina Demina from the Russian Federation Council.
You are extremely welcome here.
In particular, I am pleased to welcome you here, as today Russia celebrates its Independence Day, in commemoration of the adoption of the declaration on Russia's state sovereignty on 12 June 1990.
So you are welcome and congratulations!

Mr President, I think it is well worth restating once again the historic significance, the political importance and the irreversible nature of the process of enlarging the Union.
Having said that, I believe, when it comes to assessing the prospects for the process of enlarging the European Union with a view to the next European Council, that we must begin with the objectives we had set at the start of our Presidency so that we can then consider what we can expect of Seville in light of what has been achieved so far.
You will remember, Mr President, that in the debate we held this morning on the preparation of the Seville Council, I avoided dealing with enlargement issues, specifically so that we could reserve them for this debate, in which we are going to deal solely with those issues.
It is clear that the issue of enlargement is one of the fundamental subjects for the Seville European Council and I therefore believe that the information I am going to give will indicate the key elements of what the Presidency and the Council are going to propose to that Council.
At the beginning of the Presidency we presented a working programme entitled 'More Europe'; that document naturally included the enlargement of the European Union as one of our fundamental priorities, or more than a priority, one of the Union's fundamental objectives.
It stated that the Presidency's objective was to contribute decisively to concluding the negotiations with all the candidate countries which are prepared by the end of the second half of 2002, thereby following up on the conclusions of the previous European Councils of Gothenburg and Laeken.
More specifically, our main task consisted of achieving common positions between the 15 countries on the most complex chapters of the acquis, that is to say, those which fall to us according to the 'road map', those which are most significant from a financial and budgetary point of view.
According to the famous road map agreed in Nice, those chapters - which have fallen to the Spanish Presidency - are agriculture, regional policy and the financial and budgetary provisions, to which we can add another sensitive chapter, which is not sensitive financially, but because of its highly political nature; the issue of the institutions.
In parallel, we thought that we were going to proceed to the provisional conclusion of all those chapters pending at the beginning of the six-month period because - as you and the House know, Mr President - Spain was not only faced with the 'road map', but also with a huge number of euphemistically named 'leftovers', which in fact are unfinished negotiations, extremely important negotiations, which remained following the Swedish and the Belgian Presidencies.
Two fundamental principles must continue to inspire and underpin the entire negotiation process and they are that the negotiations should be carried out on the basis of the current acquis and that the financial perspectives approved in Berlin in 1999 will have to determine the upper limits for the accession of the new Member States between now and 2006.
In this negotiation we also tried to prevent any overlapping or interference by the enlargement process with any possible reforms of the common policies, because if we try to make the reform of common policies conditional upon enlargement we will risk creating a delay with regard to the scheduled timescales.
In other words, the Union has an objective that has the full support of Parliament: that accession should take place during 2004.
As well as this general objective, the specific working programme of the Presidency for enlargement, which was presented to the Council last January, included a whole series of related tasks.
Firstly, compliance with the third requirement for accession which relates to the administrative and judicial capacity to effectively apply the acquis.
Not much is said about this, but it is a very important issue.
This is the famous so-called 'Madrid criterion' which is absolutely essential if enlargement is to work.
During this six-month period, the Commission has drawn up and implemented an action plan for each of the candidate countries and will present a report in this regard in Seville.
Furthermore, a group drawing up the Accession Treaty was scheduled to be set up during the Presidency, and it began its work in March.
Together with the Commission and the Secretariat-General of the Council, we came up with the idea of beginning to think about a working group to draw up the Accession Treaty, so that the drawing up of its text and its relevant annexes should run parallel with the negotiations in order that, when the negotiations are concluded, we would not waste time drawing up the text of the Treaty, because we all know, Parliament in particular, the difficulties involved in the national ratification processes.
We do not therefore have much time if we want to achieve our objective in 2004, especially in order to have everything ratified so that all the candidate countries can participate as full members in the elections to the European Parliament.
Therefore, we had that purpose - which, incidentally, we have fulfilled - and, as has been the case with previous presidencies, the Spanish Presidency has also paid particular attention to four specific cases, because it seems as if the ten countries designated for the first wave are the sole object of our enthusiasm, which is not true.
We must pay attention to Bulgaria and Romania, two countries which have made less progress and to which we have to lend specific support in order to open as many negotiation chapters as possible, and we also wanted in some way to contribute to the efforts to find a definitive peaceful solution to the issue of Cyprus.
Finally, neither must we forget that somehow we must promote the pre-accession strategy with Turkey.
On the basis of these initial approaches, we must ask ourselves what we have achieved so far during our Presidency, since what we have done over these months will dictate how the situation and the perspectives between now and the end of the year are assessed by the coming European Council.
I am pleased to tell you, Mr President, that, with the invaluable help of the Commission - and I would like to pay homage publicly to Commissioner Verheugen, who is in charge of enlargement, who has been truly instrumental in all the progress we have made - the progress made during the Spanish Presidency can be summed up as follows: the Council, in its various guises, has begun to examine the notes presented by the Commission on 30 January on the general financial framework and agriculture, on which there was a clear lack of consensus.
The fundamental difference of opinion - and we are still negotiating in this regard - relates to the provision by the Union of direct agricultural aid to the candidate countries and the fact that this aid may, according to some countries, prejudice the future reform of the CAP.
As a result of these disagreements, we have not yet achieved a common position on the agriculture chapter; I would say we have achieved 95% of a common position, but there is still 5%, relating to direct aid on which we have yet to reach a consensus.
We are trying to promote a compromise formula because we understand the reasoning of the four countries which are blocking the common position, but we also believe those countries must understand that, in agriculture, there are certain fundamental principles relating to respect for the acquis, respect for equality between the member countries and the candidate countries and above all the fact that the 'road map' cannot be delayed.
That is to say that all those countries which for certain reasons are hindering the adoption of the common position on direct aid will have to answer for their political responsibility before this Parliament - and I hope that you will demand it - and before public opinion, for not having made possible a common position which would finally conclude the entire 'road map' for the enlargement negotiations.
We are making efforts, we held a General Affairs Council on Monday, we are dealing with this issue today in Coreper; there will be another extraordinary Coreper on Friday; we are going to deal with the issue again at the General Affairs Council on the 17 June and, if necessary, we will have to take it to the European Council.
We do not want the European Council to become a battlefield for these issues, but everyone must be aware that we have to make a collective effort to completely conclude the agriculture chapter; we cannot say that 95% is concluded and we will conclude the 5% on direct aid later.
It cannot be delayed because it is a question of principle: we must accept the principle although the methods can be discussed later.
Following the first two negotiation conferences in March and April, and the ministerial meeting we have just held, with Commissioner Verheugen and myself, on Monday, and also with Mr PiquÃ©, on Monday and Tuesday of this week, a total of 83 chapters have now been negotiated, of which 49 were provisionally concluded and another eight were opened.
Furthermore, in April, for the first time we dealt with and concluded with certain candidates countries three of the four chapters which the road map assigned to the Spanish Presidency, that is, regional policy, financial and budgetary provisions and institutional provisions.
With regard to the fourth and final chapter, and no doubt the most complex, agriculture, the debate is ongoing in the Council, we have yet to reach a common position and therefore have not been able to conclude it.
Our objective has been to reach a consensus, as I indicated previously in the General Affairs group of 10 June; it has not been possible and we are continuing with our efforts.
With regard to the countries which are most behind, with Bulgaria all the pending chapters have opened, while with Romania seven chapters have been opened, with just 6 still pending; I would like to inform the House that, together with the Commission, we expect to be able to make even more progress this month and certainly before the end of the Presidency, on 27 or 28 June, we are going to hold a new negotiation conference at Vice-President level and it is possible that we will be able to conclude more chapters with Romania and, naturally, conclude a few more other than the ones concluded at ministerial level.
It is therefore very possible that the Spanish Presidency will end with the opening of all the chapters relating to Romania and with the conclusion of between 90 and 100 chapters with the rest of the candidate countries.
Therefore, if we look at the general picture, as I said this morning, the majority of countries have concluded between 25 and 28 chapters; so if we consider that the number of chapters for negotiation is 31, in reality there will only remain 3 or 4 chapters per country to negotiate during the second half of this year, and they are final chapters which, as soon as we have a common position on agriculture and as soon as the Treaty of Nice is ratified, we will be able to conclude immediately since they are the institutional chapter and the financial chapter, which can be concluded very easily.
The committee drawing up the Treaty, which I mentioned earlier, has been working since 13 March on the technical adaptations and the legal details of the commitments agreed so far during the negotiations.
We are leaving the Danish Presidency with a good legacy and we are making it possible for them to conclude the drawing up of the Accession Treaty by the end of the year.
With regard to Turkey, the Association Committee and Council met in January and April respectively.
The most significant element was the adoption of a programme of meetings of the eight sub-committees charged with carrying out the detailed 'pre-screening' of its legislation, in accordance with the Laeken mandate.
The European Union has been insisting on the need to intensify the internal political reforms with a view to full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
Ankara is reiterating its desire to establish in December a date for the start of accession negotiations, but clearly, however much good will it may have, the European Council cannot set dates for the start of negotiations until the Copenhagen criteria have been fully complied with.
Our position will be very clear on this.
We cannot act in any other way.
This is not a case of wishful thinking, but it is an exercise that consists of truly applying the principles which all the institutions are attached to: the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
With regard to Cyprus, the ordinary negotiations have continued normally; I must say that Cyprus is an excellent candidate, the southern part of Cyprus, the Republic of Cyprus, is certainly the candidate for whom the greatest number of negotiation chapters are concluded and which has made the most progress in the negotiation.
Naturally we are still monitoring the development of direct contacts between the leaders of both communities, the conversations which began in January between Mr Denktash and Mr Clerides, which have yet to yield tangible results.
I was in Cyprus myself last Thursday and on behalf of the Presidency I spoke at length with Mr Clerides and with Mr Denktash and we informed them of the Union's position and of the importance we attach to the programme announced by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the importance of there being an agreement on the core issues, that is, on the issue of forms of government, property, territory and security.
Some progress has been made but there have also been some dramatic setbacks in recent days, and therefore I have been there on behalf of the President of the Council, not only to send them a message - a message which will be expressed in some way in the Seville conclusions - but also to listen, so that the northern part of Cyprus can never accuse us of not having been sensitive to their arguments or of not having had time to listen to all their arguments, because, naturally, either party can be either right or wrong, but they each have their views and they deserve to be heard.
I therefore believe we have done everything we can to assist the process and we have supported Ãlvaro de Soto, the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in every way possible.
We believe that things have gone well, but we have sent them a very clear message: we know that the objective of June which they had proposed and which the Secretary-General had confirmed has not been complied with, but we have told them that we cannot wait forever and that we need a clear political signal and that, before 24 October, when the Brussels European Council of the Danish Presidency takes place, the Union needs to see this agreement between the two parties, in order to include the whole issue of Northern Cyprus in the mainstream of the negotiations.
In accordance with the Laeken mandate, the Seville European Council must also give its opinion on the report which the Commission is going to present on development and on its action plan for institutionally strengthening the candidate countries, and the General Affairs Council of 17 June will carry out an initial examination of that report, presented by the Commission on the 5th.
Also in relation to enlargement, the Spanish Presidency introduced for the first time in history the institutional innovation of allowing the candidate countries to participate actively in the Spring European Council - everybody remembers how they participated in the session, not only in the closing dinner, but also in the session itself.
That offered the opportunity to visualise the new Union for the first time.
We have seen, for the first time, a Council with 25 Members and furthermore within a concrete context that affects all of us and affects them, that is to say the Lisbon process.
Finally, I wanted to refer to the bilateral technical cooperation and assistance which has been carried out and intensified by the Member States with the candidate countries in order to prepare the latter for the application of the Community acquis.
Not much is said about this, but we must bear in mind that the progress made, in all the programmes the Commission has implemented, essentially in the twinning programme - which is an extremely important programme, which is really worthy of a debate in this Parliament at some point; and in the ISPA and Sapard programmes there has been spectacular progress both in terms of the Union's cooperation with these countries, and in terms of the bilateral cooperation of the candidate countries.
Given all these factors, and without prejudice to the results of the tour of the Spanish Prime Minister, which is taking place at the moment, we should be able to take the debate on enlargement at the coming Seville European Council much further.
While waiting for the General Affairs Council to adopt a Resolution, the European Council will examine a note to the Presidency on the state of the negotiations which will serve as a basis for the debate in the European Council.
By way of illustration, that project could be based around the following elements: firstly, the recognition of the considerable progress made so far during the various presidencies; we can say that during the Spanish Presidency we have reached a point at which the negotiations are practically finished from a technical point of view.
We have fulfilled the road map and this has allowed the Commission and the Council to bring all 30 chapters with the first ten Laeken countries to the table; the negotiations have entered the final straight.
It is now reasonable to expect that the Danish Presidency may, in accordance with the wishes of Parliament and the European Council, conclude the negotiations by the end of December.
As I have said, we have now begun to draw up the Accession Treaty and it can now enter a final drawing-up process following the Copenhagen European Council.
I do not believe that a fourth period will be necessary, because its drawing-up is now at an advanced stage.
The Council will refer to the adoption of common positions both on those chapters pending from previous Presidencies and on those which are more complex in terms of their budgetary implications.
Naturally, the specific financial aspects will be looked at at a later date, at the end of the negotiations, as is always the case.
We shall reiterate the general principle that any solutions must conform to the current acquis and the Berlin financial framework.
Let there be no doubt that this is extremely important.
We also require a constructive and realistic approach aimed at concluding the negotiations with the ten candidates so that they can also demonstrate that they are fully prepared to take on their obligations.
There will be an assessment of the report to be presented by the Commission on the development of its action plans for the administrative and judicial strengthening of the candidate countries with a view to effective application of the acquis.
In relation to Bulgaria and Romania, we must recognise the significant progress made during this six-month period, reiterate the principle of inclusivity in the enlargement process and commit ourselves to fully supporting their preparation efforts.
With regard to Turkey, the European Union should encourage the Ankara Government to intensify its reform efforts and express its conviction that that would help to consolidate its accession ambitions.
Meanwhile, the Council would invite the Commission to present concrete measures including, where relevant, additional financial assistance aimed at strengthening the pre-accession strategy for Turkey in line with the rest of the candidate countries.
Furthermore, the Council will encourage Turkey to use its influence to promote a speedy solution to the issue of Cyprus.
And, specifically, on the issue of Cyprus, the European Council will urge the two parties to continue the direct talks between Denktash and Clerides and will encourage them to take this opportunity to find a definitive and global solution as soon as possible, as I said, before 24 October if possible, under the auspices of the United Nations.

In its capacity as a Member State, a unified Cyprus will have to speak with one voice and this is an issue which we will stress in particular; that is to say, a future shape of the State of Cyprus is something for them to decide, but we have to make something very clear: any type of State that they decide on between the two communities must be a unified State which speaks with one voice and which is able to apply the Community acquis in a uniform manner, both in the North and in the South.
Of course the European Union, as stated by the Commission, which has set aside additional funds, has committed itself to contributing to the economic development of the northern part of the island, if the negotiations bear fruit.
Apart from dealing with all these issues, I believe that the European Council must now begin to discuss the new 'road map', the political one.
In other words, the technical part is finished, or is being finished, and now we must look to the future, to see what will happen in 2003 when everything is concluded, to say what plan we have for the signature and ratification of the Treaty, to send a clear message to the national parliaments that this issue is urgent, to see how the candidate countries can participate in a future Intergovernmental Conference, to see how they can participate in the European Parliament elections, in a nutshell, to see how, in a political sense, all the results of the negotiations can be put into practice in accordance with the programme which we have drawn up and the ideas we have re-affirmed so many times in this House and also in the European Council.
Mr President, this is a summary of the outlook which is of course approximate, since I cannot anticipate what the Heads of State and Government are going to say.
I can only present what the Spanish Presidency is going to put before them.
But I believe that, apart from any modifications they might make, this will be in general terms what the European Council will say on enlargement.
I hope that what I have said on behalf of the Presidency will be a final contribution to the debate in Parliament today on the basis of so many reports, the authors of which - Brok, BÃ¶ge, Sommer, Turco, GÃ¶rlach and Olsson - I congratulate on behalf of the Presidency, since they have been extremely useful in terms of clarifying our ideas about what we need to do within the enlargement chapter.
I would finally like to thank the Commission for the support they have given us at all times, right from the beginning of our Presidency.
Thank you for a comprehensive and, in the concluding part, an appropriately political summary of what lies ahead.
Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome today's debate on enlargement as an opportunity to send out a clear message in the run up to the European Council in Seville.
The various resolutions to be put to the vote today bear witness once again to Parliament's vital contribution to the quality and pace of the enlargement process and I am grateful for the reliable meeting of minds between Parliament and the Commission on this issue.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank all the parliamentary rapporteurs for working so constructively with the Commission.
I should also like to address a particular word of thanks to your presidents, whose presence in the future Member States is having an encouraging effect and building confidence.
The resolutions and today's debate mark the end of a very intensive procedure in Parliament over recent months, resulting in a clear 'Yes' to the enlargement strategy and timetable.
Our assessment that ten countries will be in a position to conclude negotiations at the end of this year, provided their reforms stay on course, has been confirmed and I am much obliged for the far-reaching consensus in the analysis and conclusions.
Parliament has called on both sides, the European Union and the future Member States, to make good use of the coming months, to keep up the pace and to mobilise all forces in the sprint to the finishing line, so as to ensure that the jointly set targets are achieved.
I would like to join them in that call.
I have referred on several occasions to the period from 2002 to 2004 as a window of opportunity.
A window that is wide open but which could close again if we fail to make good use of the opportunity it offers us.
We must not, under any circumstances, throw this opportunity away.
Everything we have already achieved is at stake including, last but not least, confidence in both the European Union and the candidate countries.
Clearly, we are up against a head wind at the moment.
A chill has set in, the sceptics agitating against Europe in general and enlargement in particular are becoming more vociferous, feeding on uncertainties, fears and prejudice.
My view is that we should join forces to convince the citizens of Europe of the historic need for enlargement and allay their concerns.
Since the Iron Curtain fell in Europe and in this globalised world, European integration is the only way to overcome the problems which are making people twitchy and causing them concern.
The point is, we need more Europe: for peace and security at home and abroad, for growth and employment, for environmental protection, for the highest possible social standards, for equal opportunities for all.
The message must be unequivocal: European integration and enlargement are not the problem, they are a fundamental, inalienable part of the solution.
We have the best arguments on our side.
The Europe of the past has left a trail of deep wounds and scars behind it.
The generation in Europe whose towns were razed to rubble and ashes, who went hungry and experienced the misery of war, flight and persecution, is still alive.
It is the generation which suffered under the most violent ideologies of the twentieth century.
Alongside the memory of this suffering, however, there is another memory still alive in Europe: the memory of good neighbourly relations, of public-spiritedness, of human decency, of resistance against inhumane systems and of individual bravery.
There can be no doubt that, with very different nations living cheek by jowl, all with different memories and ways of life, Europe is a fragile continent.
The wounds have closed, to be sure, but the scar tissue is thin and they still ache. The re-opening of the debate on the so-called Bene? decrees has made that clear.
Parliament still has to look at all the legal implications.
All I want to say is that the fundamental correlation between this issue and successful enlargement lies in how we talk about it.
The debate must be held in a spirit of mutual respect and with respect for everyone's suffering and different experiences.
It must be held so that it heals instead of inflicting new wounds.
It is precisely because of the tragedies which have marked Europe in very different ways that there is only one reasonable way forward, the way of reconciliation.
That is what European unification is all about.
Anyone in Europe today who wants to ensure that old wounds are not re-opened, anyone who wants to ensure that no future generation ever has to suffer what earlier generations suffered must stand for a common future, be prepared to look a truth which has many facets in the eye and hold out a hand to integration and cooperation.
Honourable Members, Parliament and the Commission are agreed: the efforts of the candidate countries to date and the results of the negotiations give us good cause to believe that we shall be able to bring one of the most difficult projects which Europe has undertaken in its whole history to an initial, important conclusion in Copenhagen.
We are on schedule.
The Spanish Presidency has performed exceedingly well and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Spanish Presidency and Foreign Minister Josep PiquÃ© and my old friend RamÃ³n de Miguel for an unbelievably ambitious presidency.
The Spaniards drove us hard - but they are allowed to do that and it is good that they did.
That is what the Presidency is there for and the results were worth it.
As RamÃ³n de Miguel has already mentioned, we have just returned from the latest round of ministerial-level negotiations in Luxembourg.
At the end of this round, the state of play is as follows. We are now entering the final round with ten countries.
The EU has common standpoints on all the chapters being negotiated, including all the chapters in the financial package, with the exception of agriculture, although in fact there is only one point here on which no agreement has yet been reached and that is the question of direct income support.
The fact that considerable difficulties have now arisen on this question comes as no surprise but they are coming to an end.
It is a question of dividing the burden.
I think we have to say in all honesty to the citizens of Europe that the enormous political and economic benefits of enlargement come at a price, as the Member States fully recognised in Berlin in 1999.
Yes, we are being called on to demonstrate solidarity now and it is in our interest to do so.
We need to discuss the costs of enlargement thoroughly, but then, excuse me, we also need to discuss the cost of not enlarging.
The message which came out of Luxembourg last Monday has triggered insecurity in the candidate countries.
There is no point in denying it.
According to the candidate countries, they have been given a promise and they are banking on it.
The promise is that, if they meet the conditions, they can accede.
Obviously, delays can never be completely ruled out but be warned: we do not want any delays because the Member States cannot agree among themselves.
I should like to take this opportunity to add two brief comments. There are two arguments in the current debate, which the Commission cannot accept.
The first is that we cannot conclude enlargement negotiations because we do not know what the financial impact will be post 2006.
That is an argument that belies a very modest intellectual approach, because it applies to all European Union policies.
(Laughter, applause)
There is not a single European Union policy, the financial future of which after 2006 is already known to us today.
I remember quite clearly what the Presidency had in mind in the first half of 1999 following the outcome in Berlin, namely the unification of the European Union on the basis of the financial conditions for enlargement before 2006.
What I want to know is, if we were satisfied with the figures in 1999, why should we no longer be satisfied with the same figures in 2002.
The second thing I want to say is that the argument that direct agricultural payments - leaving aside for the moment whether you like them or not - are not a part of Community law, is one that really cannot be taken seriously.
You just have to read Community law.
It is there in black and white.
Passed by unanimous agreement.
If you say that direct payments are not a part of European Community law, you might just as well say the moon is blue.
You can say it, but it does not change anything.
Honourable Members, 14 technical negotiating chapters have yet to be closed for the first ten countries we hope to sign up in Copenhagen.
I am assuming that this number will be even lower by the end of the Spanish Presidency, by which I mean that we shall achieve our target of making sure there are no technical chapters left on the table for the final stage of negotiations.
That will be a huge achievement.
I am pleased to report that we managed to resolve one of the most difficult and perhaps most important issues in the entire process at this week's accession conference, namely the question of the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania.
I must confess I am somewhat surprised at public opinion in Europe.
To see how much attention was paid to the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, which is generally considered to be safe, and how little attention was paid to the fact that Lithuania has a Chernobyl-type nuclear power station which represents a danger to both Lithuania and everyone else, and a considerable one ?
(Interjection)
Yes, like Chernobyl, a Chernobyl-type nuclear power station.
(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit: like in the Ukraine!)
Yes, but the Ukraine is not a candidate country and I have no opportunity to exert any influence on the Ukraine.
What we were looking to do here was to get rid of this Chernobyl-type nuclear power station during the course of the enlargement process.
This is an incredible achievement on the part of Lithuania, because this nuclear power station is about as important to the Lithuanian economy as the automobile industry is to Germany.
I think that Lithuania deserves a great deal of recognition for the courageous and far-reaching decision which it has taken in the interest of the whole of Europe and I for one am very, very grateful to it.
Honourable Members, we now need to clarify how many countries we can count on for the final round of negotiations in Copenhagen.
This is also crucial for the chapter on institutions.
The Commission will submit its appraisal of the situation in October, together with its recommendations as to which candidate countries we should be able to sign up by the end of the year, shortly before the European Council in Brussels.
I expect that the European Council in Brussels will then take its decision on that basis.
The Commission will be guided in its proposal solely by the negotiating principles.
There will be no political preselection.
The only criterion will be whether or not a country really has met the conditions for accession.
At the same time, we should also have clarified the financial framework and all the related issues by the time the European Council meets in Brussels.
This will ensure that negotiations between October and the beginning of December focus on the few outstanding issues, one being the question of the overall sum in financing.
Once this sum has been set, dividing it up between the individual candidate countries and individual policy areas will be more or less a purely mathematical exercise, thanks to the excellent preparatory work carried out under the Spanish Presidency.
Secondly, and this is closely related to agreement on the overall budget, we need to consider the configuration and size of the budget mechanism already decided in principle under the Spanish Presidency.
Thirdly, we must be prepared for individual issues in the agricultural chapter - I am thinking in particular of quotas and direct income support here - to remain on the table right through to the end.
The months of negotiation ahead of us will be hard work.
But I am positive that, with flexibility and political perceptiveness, reasonable solutions can be found.
But I should like to take this opportunity to state quite clearly that the conclusions of the European Council meetings in Gothenburg and Laeken cannot be interpreted to mean that the European Union will not agree on its common standpoints until Copenhagen; the conclusions of Gothenburg and Laeken can only be interpreted to mean that actual negotiations with the candidate countries will be completed in Copenhagen, so that, as the European Parliament hoped, they can accede in time to take part in the European elections in 2004.
Mr RamÃ³n de Miguel has already referred to Bulgaria and Romania on behalf of the Spanish Presidency.
I can confirm what he said.
Both countries still need more time to meet the accession criteria.
Which is precisely why they need a clear signal that they have not missed the boat in Copenhagen.
The Commission will therefore submit proposals to improve and strengthen the accession strategy for the countries which will be unable to sign up in 2002.
Where possible, we should push ahead with negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and mobilise additional help.
Honourable Members, it is clear - as expected - both from the most recent progress report and from your resolutions that correct application is the biggest obstacle in the candidate countries on the road towards the Copenhagen criteria.
In most candidate countries, the cause of these difficulties is rooted in their past and in the difficult transformation process.
Last year, the Commission proposed mobilising additional funds and announced action plans in order to provide better support for candidates.
A report on the action plans on administrative and judicial capacities, adopted by the Commission on 5 June, will be tabled at the European Council in Seville.
The report states quite clearly, without pulling any punches, which areas in the candidate countries still show signs of weakness which need intensive work in the future.
May I also say at this point, however, that the report also clearly states what complex and differentiated instruments for analysis, verification and control of administrative developments and legal practice have been developed in the candidate countries.
No other candidate even came anywhere close in earlier enlargement rounds.
Never have candidates been so thoroughly tested.
Never before was a prospective Member State exposed under such a harsh light to the critical eyes of one and all.
I think I can also say that never before has a future Member State been better prepared for its new role.
Which is another reason why the current enlargement round cannot be compared with previous rounds.
We are making very high demands.
This approach, however, has borne considerable fruit and has set standards in the candidate countries themselves.
If we keep on working here, and the Commission has proposed that we do so to accession and beyond, it will have lasting effects which may even act as an incentive in the present-day EU.
I know that the Commission reports on preparations by candidates, on technical assistance, on institution building, on twinning, on monitoring and control instruments etc. are not of any particular interest to the public.
But woe betide if we were to dispense with these efforts!
In fact, the credibility of the entire process is at stake here.
We want to be sure that all avoidable risks are pre-empted.
Apart from the negotiations and tasks which are the preserve of the candidate countries, there is homework which we still have to do.
We still have to ratify the Treaty of Nice.
We have known that for a long time.
The European Council in Barcelona confirmed once again that the Treaty must take effect.
But, unlike many observers, my money is on the Irish experience of integration, on Irish support for European integration, on the knowledge that the integration of Ireland has made development possible which nobody dared hope for thirty years ago.
The point is, will the countries of central and eastern Europe be able to catch up as Ireland has done.
That will be decided during the second referendum.
Nor must we lose sight of the fact on our way to Copenhagen that enlargement will bring important partners in eastern Europe closer to home.
In future, the EU will border on Byelorussia and the Ukraine, as well as Russia.
In a few years' time, we shall be neighbours with the Republic of Moldavia.
It is the Commission's stated objective to make full use of the positive effects of enlargement and to further the development of democracy and the market economy in the countries destined to become our future neighbours and we have created the foundations for this by developing a strategic partnership with Russia and the Ukraine.
However the results of the last EU-Russia Summit did not only fill me with joy, mainly because discussions in Moscow on Kaliningrad were confined to the overland transit problem, a question which concerns not just the EU, but Lithuania and Poland also.
As you know, Russia is calling for visa-free access rules; however, Poland and Lithuania have rejected this, as do Parliament and the Commission.
The European Union will decide its final position here at the European Council in Seville.
But I will say that the real problem of the geographical location of Kaliningrad is how the European Union and Russia can join forces to ensure that the situation in Kaliningrad improves and the area can profit significantly in the long term from the development of its neighbours.
I would be delighted if we could start an intensive dialogue with Russia.
Nobody is indifferent to the public's opinion on enlargement.
It depends on a great deal, on information, on presentation, on our ability to give convincing answers.
We know that from our own political experience, which is why the Commission started a communication initiative, with the support of the European Parliament, for the Member States and the candidate countries alike, an implementation report on which will be presented to the European Council in Seville.
But here too we must be honest.
Commission, Parliament, Council, we can all do a great deal.
But there is no substitute for the effort needed by towns and communities, regions and Member States, the economy and science, art and culture.
Recent surveys have shown that there is still an information deficit on enlargement, which is why I urgently call on you to engage in conversation with our citizens, to answer their questions and allay their fears wherever this has still not been done.
Our strategy is the right one and has already had impressive results.
The same applies to enlargement and European integration as a whole. We also have to stand up for this Europe outside the institutions.
Risks and problems must not be swept under the carpet.
But, the fact remains that the greatest risk to the future peace and security of Europe, which is what we all want, the greatest risk would be to miss this historic opportunity to unite our continent because our courage failed us at the last minute.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole, but also the Spanish Presidency, for the very positive progress made in the negotiations in recent months.
After talks with the future Presidency, I hope that the road map originally devised by this House can be adhered to, because the political will is there.
I think that as Parliament, we must attach great importance to ensuring that appropriate pressure is brought to bear.
As Mr RamÃ³n de Miguel has rightly pointed out, a solution must be found in agriculture too, since there will be no chances later.
There is no excuse for delays.
This also applies in many other areas which the Commissioner mentioned, such as institutional issues.
We must put our house in order, whether this is achieved through the ratification of the Treaty of Nice or by other means.
This is the homework which we have to do.
Whether or not it involves a common position in the Council on agricultural policy, budgetary issues or institutional issues, we have an obligation in this regard.
This must not be used as a reason for delaying the enlargement process, for this would meet with incomprehension in the accession countries.
We cannot allow a further delay which is due to our own failings.
Similarly, of course, we must assess the accession candidates by what they have achieved.
As things stand at present, we have thirteen candidate countries; we are negotiating with twelve of them, and ten have a chance of concluding the negotiations this year.
In my view, we should thus be in a position to conduct the negotiations in a way which makes this possible.
That means - as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy makes very clear in its report - that we must not invent any new conditions, whether they are imposed either by the European institutions or by the Member States.
The basis for negotiations is the acquis communautaire, not whatever else might be desirable.
We cannot make additional demands.
These can only be formulated in a political process which involves the future Member States; they cannot be a condition for accession.
Sometimes we must conduct our debates in this house in frank terms as well.
When I look at some of the motions tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, they are all very commendable, like some of the other motions.
I can even endorse them politically.
However, they have absolutely no relevance to the theme of "negotiations on the adoption of the acquis communautaire".
The only issue of relevance is the acquis communautaire.
If the environment chapters are closed, for example, we should not reopen them because we think that a particular road or canal should not be built in a particular country, which is the thrust of some of these motions, if my analysis is correct.
In my view, we ourselves should be precise, honest and coherent here so that progress is achieved.
By adopting this approach, however, this also means that the accession candidates must understand that each individual country will be assessed on its own merits to determine whether it is able to fulfil the conditions.
We recognise that ten of them have the chance to do so.
We also recognise that they are in a position to achieve the smooth functioning of the internal market, fulfil the political criteria and achieve legislative compliance with the acquis communautaire at the same time.
We will also, though, have to look very carefully at which countries are able to guarantee judicial and administrative compliance by 2004 when accession takes place.
This is a key issue.
On these issues, too, no political discounts can be granted.
We must ensure that this is accepted and enforced appropriately.
In the same way, we have a request - for it can be no more than that - to countries which will be part of the first round. We would ask them not to take an 'I'm all right, Jack' attitude once they are part of the European Union.
In other words, they must not take the view that the boat is full after their accession and possibly veto other countries which are scheduled to join in the second round. We should also ensure, in political terms, that candidates which are not part of the first round do not face additional hurdles.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the committee responsible for this policy field, is deeply concerned about a number of problems.
We see that in some areas, minority issues have still not been resolved.
Corruption and organised crime are still major problems.
We attach priority to compliance with the Schengen criteria, because it is also important to make clear to our own citizens that no additional insecurity is being created here.
In my view, we must also recognise that Kaliningrad must not be a reason for enlargement to fail.
However, we must also recognise that the sovereignty of Poland and Lithuania must be accepted, and that an alternative solution must be found, for I see the corridor option as being unacceptable for both legal and historical reasons.
There are so many practical ways of satisfying Russia's justified concerns.
I believe that here, too, we will find an appropriate solution, just as I believe, on a general note, that only Members of the European Union and the various accession candidates have a right to decide who should join the EU.
This is my response to the Cyprus issue as well.
When we discuss issues of discrimination etc. in relation to enlargement, we must also ensure that it is made clear that all citizens of this European Union are equal. There must be no discrimination, either against nationals of EU states or against citizens living in the European Union.
This is the only aspect of the debate about the Bene? decrees which interests me.
Our task is not to examine the past from a legal perspective, but to ensure that no discrimination arises as a result of the current application of the law.
I believe that this should be possible for a country under the rule of law, and if my reading of the Verheugen-Zeman paper is correct, I see opportunities to achieve openings and agreements here too.
Mr President, Commissioner, I support your positions on this issue wholeheartedly, for this is a matter of historical significance.
I would also like to endorse what was said before.
There is no attempt to use issues of history as new combat instruments in the European Union; instead, we must ensure that we learn from history to prevent the suffering, expulsions, murders and wars which occurred in the past from ever happening again, and we must capitalise on the unique opportunity afforded to us through the unification of our entire continent.
From the Coal and Steel Community to European integration, the goal has always been to end the cycle of violence, not to settle old scores. The cycle of violence in Europe must cease once and for all.
The objective is not to abolish the nation-state - the nation-state will retain its identity - but to water it down in such a way that it is never again able to wage war against others.
This is why the legal order established by the European Union is our continent's future.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Council for the diligent way it has pursued this complicated dossier and most especially Commissioner Verheugen and his staff for the phenomenal amount of work they have done on monitoring the progress that has been achieved in the candidate countries.
This has actually brought us to this debate here today.
Without that effort, we simply would not be in this situation now.
On 6 July 2002 a very famous world sporting event will start.
I refer not to the World Cup, the final of which will have been contested between England and Ireland long before 6 July, but to the tour de France.
In many ways the enlargement of the European Union is comparable to the tour de France.
If we were to look at ourselves now we would find ourselves at the last climb, in the mountains, with most of the gruelling race behind us and very much with the finishing line in sight, with the Champs ElysÃ©es in Paris waiting for us.
We have some tough and difficult climbs to get through at the moment.
As anyone who has been on a bicycle knows: if you stop, it falls over.
So now is not the time to stop.
We have to keep moving forward.
The message from my group is very clear, we must keep following that road map.
It is a good road map and it will get us through this process.
We must stick to the timescale that we have set ourselves.
My esteemed colleague, Klaus HÃ€nsch, first raised in this House the date of 2004 as the date for the completion of the first new accession and we must stick to that date.
We must allow no new conditions to be introduced.
Questions of history are important but questions of history are exactly that, historical questions.
Britain and Ireland joined the European Union at the same time, yet the Irish constitution at that time had a claim over British territory.
That did not stop us joining this club together.
Britain and Spain are still trying to resolve the question of Gibraltar that has gone on for three centuries.
These are important historical issues but they are not conditions for accession to the European Union.
Those who use issues of history to try and create new obstacles on our road to the accession of new Member States of the European Union must appreciate the damage that they are doing to public opinion.
I was in Prague recently where there has been a 6% fall in public support for joining the European Union just as a result of the debate over the Bene? decrees.
Both the Commission and the Parliament are doing their work.
We will rigorously assess the case of each individual country to make sure that the tough questions are answered and that we do not shirk our responsibilities.
When we say we agree to a new country joining, we will have done all the hard work so that our citizens can be assured that this is a safe accession that we can all agree to.
While I appreciate the work that has been done in the Council, I have to say there is a great worry within this Parliament that it may now be the Council that is starting to drag its feet.
The Council often talks a good fight on many issues but sadly, in our experience it is often the Council that finds it the most difficult to take the final decisions.
While we understand and appreciate that many issues we tackle over the next few months will be very difficult, please do not let us delay.
Do not try and negotiate, or re-negotiate, the common agricultural policy in the space of two or three months to get us to October and the Brussels Summit.
Do not allow the xenophobes and the anti-Europeans to slow us down.
And, for heaven's sake, do not let us turn around and start blaming you for not actually getting to 2004 on time.
Working together, we can achieve this but I have to say in all honesty that we have worries at the moment about when the Council is actually going to deliver on this.
My one disappointment about the enlargement process is that the passion has gone out of it.
At the beginning of the 1990s, we were all passionate about enlarging the European Union, particularly in the accession states.
It has now become some sort of pragmatic, technical exercise.
We, and the people in the gallery here, ought to be more passionate and expectant about the enlargement of the European Union because it is a historical goal which we can all be justly proud of.
We need to reintroduce that element so that from Galway to Gdansk and beyond we secure that reunited continent.
In 1990, Helmut Kohl and FranÃ§ois Mitterand made a promise that we would have the enlargement of the European Union completed by the year 2000.
We are failing singularly to do that.
The finishing line is in sight, this time it is in Copenhagen.
It is not Paris, but let us keep the peloton together.
There are many candidate countries that would like to be wearing that maillot jaune, I think they are all wearing them.
The important thing is to make sure we get to Copenhagen as a finishing line, not just another stage on our route to the successful completion of enlargement.
Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for a helpful introduction to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteurs for their good work on the reports before us today.
I also take this opportunity to welcome to this House the parliamentarians from the Liberal family in the applicant states who are watching this debate from the gallery and have joined us to debate the issues this week.
That parliamentarians from Bulgaria and Romania are here today is a welcome reminder that we are negotiating enlargement with 12 applicant states, even if the timescales for accession may differ a little.
Those of us from countries that were not founder members of the European Community remember only too well the anxiety and sense of expectation which surrounded our entry negotiations and the decisions to ratify our application.
Coming from a country which had its application vetoed twice, I know of the enduring damage done to perceptions of European integration when a country is rejected.
We should bear this in mind in assessing the current applicants.
We must recognise that the applicant states have worked hard in recent years to reform their economies and consolidate democracy in order to join the Union.
While we expect them to redouble their efforts in the run-up to and after accession, we must also reward those efforts.
That is why Liberal Democrats insist that both the criteria and the timetable must be respected.
We should not apply stricter standards than for previous enlargements, nor pretend that everything in our own gardens smells sweet.
Enlargement is a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam.
There are hotheads and faint hearts on both sides who will seek to exploit difficulties in meeting the Copenhagen criteria.
We must not allow them to derail enlargement.
It is far better to overcome outstanding problems through the enlargement process.
What is important to the health of a country is the direction in which its face is set and the screening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be an ongoing process, part of a wider scrutiny of all Member States - old and new - in a European Union with the Charter of Fundamental Rights at its heart.
Liberal Democrats deplore the abuse of enlargement negotiations to reopen old wounds and animosities.
The infamous Bene? decrees are a good example of this.
It serves no useful purpose to inflame tensions on this issue, which is why my group has tabled amendments to Mr Brok's report to seek to lower the temperature of the debate.
The refusal of four governments - including Mr Murphy's - at the General Affairs Council this week to reach agreement on a common position on agriculture stems in part from the inadequacy of the financing package agreed in Berlin.
We are constrained to live within Berlin's limits, but if a deal is postponed until autumn - as some propose - this would jeopardise the prospect of admitting new Member States in time for the European Parliament elections in 2004.
We support the Commission's proposals to phase-in direct payments but, as soon as enlargement is agreed, we must take forward reform of the CAP.
We need to shift the focus away from the producer onto the consumer, from quantity to quality.
On the controversial issue of free movement of persons, I urge all Member States to follow the lead of Denmark, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands, which have said they will apply no restrictions to free movement.
There are no rational grounds for believing that enlargement will be followed by the mass migration sometimes feared by our citizens.
It is precisely these fears which we, as politicians, have to tackle head on.
We have a responsibility to make the case for enlargement to our electorates and we must not shrink from that challenge.
The adoption of the report to be voted on tomorrow will give the green light to enlargement. The historic prospect beckons of a wider, stronger Union - a bulwark for freedom and democracy in an uncertain world.
Let ours not be the generation which flunks this opportunity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one, particularly not the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, is calling into question the historic opportunities linked to enlargement.
It is exciting, it is fantastic, but this window of opportunity also implies a need to carry out reforms.
If we do not do so for enlargement, we shall be placing Europe at risk.
We shall run the risk of producing a chaotic Europe which will place enlargement at risk.
In addition, Mr President, do not tell us that the principle of direct payments to agriculture is fair, because it is an unjust principle and it must be reformed.
That does not mean that it is not necessary to help farmers, but it means that we must have structural aid for rural development, that we must follow a policy of sustainable agriculture, something which we have not done for years.
We failed to reform agriculture in Berlin.
We failed.
We failed to carry out the reforms.
That does not mean that we are against enlargement, quite the contrary, but we must make the granting of aid subject to certain social and ecological conditions, which we are not doing.
That does not mean that we should spend less money.
We had a financial framework in Berlin, and we reduced it.
We could invest in the countries which are applying for accession, but we have not done so, because of the selfishness of the rich countries of the European Union such as Germany, France or Spain.
Everyone says that they are in favour of enlargement, but when it comes to paying the price of solidarity, political selfishness rears its head.
We are not telling lies here. These are the difficulties which you will come up against in Seville, the same difficulties that we encountered in Berlin on the subject of fisheries.
The thing that annoys me, frankly, is that everyone says yes to enlargement, but when it comes to paying the necessary price of solidarity, in other words the price of implementing reforms to the way in which the European Union functions, then we are much more pedestrian than in our historic, Sunday-best speeches.
I do not want enlargement to be a political undertaking reserved for Sunday-best speeches, while on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday we pursue a policy which is opposed to enlargement.
That is why I say, and why I defend the idea, that in the window of opportunity described by the Commissioner, there is no mention of the need to complete the necessary reforms of the European Union so that the enlargement of the Union to twenty-seven countries can be made to work.
That is what we, the Greens, are defending, because we are keen supporters of enlargement, and keen supporters of internal reforms to the European Union, so that enlargement can work.
That is our task, and we have not yet completed it.
Mr President, EU enlargement is entering its crucial phase.
The reports before us and the speeches by Members do not draw a veil over the unresolved issues, but do endorse the candidate countries' accession.
Our group also supports this position.
The current state of play in the negotiations and in the adoption of the acquis communautaire implies that there are no alternatives.
Yet if we look at the quality of integration and the problems arising in the EU itself, it is possible to arrive at a different view.
My group, for example, does not believe it is right that, as part of the accession process, candidate countries are urged to join the NATO military alliance.
This should not be part of the process, which involves accession to the EU and nothing else.
The EU sets conditions for the accession candidates which are not fulfilled by many of its own Member States.
There is a tremendous backlog of reform in the EU.
The willingness to show solidarity in the distribution of resources is far from overwhelming, and citizens' support for accession has recently been on the wane.
Ascribing these problems to ignorance and a lack of transparency is, in our opinion, too simplistic.
The citizens' debate on Europe which was called for after Nice has yet to take place in any meaningful way, while the burdens associated with the pre-accession adaptation process are becoming increasingly onerous.
The reports quite rightly call upon the candidate countries to adopt more rigorous anti-corruption measures.
What is never mentioned, however, are the causes and sources of corruption, which is due, among other things, to capitalist privatisation and the growing social inequalities between a handful of increasingly wealthy people and the vast majority who face poverty and unemployment.
The lack of impact of the Commission's strategic positions in the accession process is particularly apparent in agriculture.
Anyone who warned early on that some of the elements contained in Agenda 2000 were quite unrealistic was criticised as a troublemaker, but the much-vaunted open 5% have negative and disproportionate repercussions on farmers.
Yet anyone who assumes that, with the exception of agricultural policy, the process of enlarging the EU by up to ten states has been resolved is naÃ¯ve, in my view.
Social inequality is present to a far greater extent.
There is very limited willingness to show solidarity, and in many areas, the Commission's work is much too superficial and bureaucratic to do justice to the new demands of integration.
A considerable number of key issues are unresolved, and what is required is a change of direction.
I hope that this will be achieved in good time.
Mr President, there is no doubt that, between them, the Council and Commission statements and Mr Brok's valuable work have painted a full picture of the enlargement process and the progress of the negotiations with the candidate countries.
The concerns voiced here, however, although, it is true, expressed by confirmed believers in the historic importance of the enlargement process and strategy, relate to the apparent haziness of the situation surrounding the process itself.
To be sure, almost all the candidate countries have put up a commendable performance in developing their legal systems and economies quickly.
In any case, respect for the Copenhagen criteria and assimilation of the Community acquis - which, however, we feel should be interpreted in general terms - are compulsory.
However, what we do not fully understand, less than two years off the first wave of entries, is whether the final decision will depend on practical results or whether it will be affected by the pseudopolitical, not to say paternalistic attitudes which have reared their heads, which are not indicative of the great overall willingness to cooperate which the Union ought to be showing.
Moreover, it is not clear what the result of the entry of - presumably 10 - countries in 2004 will be, in the sense that we do not know what impact the overspending on the part of four countries will have on the current financial planning and therefore on the treatment that will be reserved for the new Member States.
Certainly, a sure response needs to be given at least with regard to the size of the Structural Funds commitments that will be set aside for them in the short- and long-term future, not least to give them time to find responses to the respective problems of social and economic cohesion which are emerging in some of those countries and develop an effective social and employment policy and a code of good practice for undertakings.
Border security, respect for minors, civil rights, the own-resources funding system and an effective judicial system are certainly extremely important, but it is equally important for each of the candidate countries to involve its citizens in the process, to provide them with the right information and to be able to convince them that it is worth making temporary sacrifices now as an investment for future prosperity, if this last is actually the object of the exercise.
The European Union is about to carry its title with far more justification thanks to its predominantly eastern enlargement.
Along with the Brok report, we would underline the strategic goal of this historic process, namely a peaceful and prosperous co-existence of the peoples in our Continent.
I have already brought to your attention the fact that a primarily financial approach to enlargement does not do justice to its importance and character.
Hence my appeal to the Member States not to raise any new obstructions in respect of enlargement.
This appeal includes the demand to review the agricultural policy prior to enlargement.
However, when a common position is adopted on the agricultural chapter, a fair prospect is required for both the candidate countries and the current net payers.
Net receivers could show - more so than is the case at the moment - financial solidarity with the future Member States.
Paragraph 8 of the Brok report is being slightly over-demanding of the candidate countries.
It is downright unrealistic to expect the governments in central and eastern Europe to have resolved the extremely complex Roma issue by the end of this decade.
This, of course, does not detract in any way from the appeal for a liveable situation, where the Roma have their own responsibilities.
As we are now discussing the political criteria of Copenhagen, I should like to ask Commissioner Verheugen another question.
Various radio stations in the candidate countries are indulging in hate campaigns against Roma and the Jews.
Would you mind bringing this to the attention of the competent authorities?
After all, the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism are core values of the EU Member States.
Mr President, the theory of enlargement should naturally be put into practice, for agriculture and in other areas, by the application of identical game rules in both old and new Member States, whilst at the same time managing the necessary transitions in order to avoid, in both old and new Member States, the destabilising consequences of the practical implementation of this historic political imperative.
There are two particularly delicate problems which arise with regard to agriculture.
First of all there is the opening up of the markets of the West to the products of the East.
This opening up has to be conducted industry by industry and country by country, as and when producers are in a position to place on the market products which meet the same quality and safety criteria as those that we already impose on our own producers.
The second issue is that of the first pillar of the CAP, in other words market support and compensatory aid.
Here it is necessary that the principles which govern the CAP, the aid and support which are justified by the environmental, social and health constraints and requirements which our farmers are bound by, should be applied, without discrimination, to both old and new Member States, as long as the latter observe the same constraints.
How long will it take before they are able to do so?
In other words, how long should the transitional period be?
The Commission is proposing a totally uniform transitional period for all countries, as far as the timetable and implementing rules are concerned, which would result, first of all, in an extremely brutal and painful restructuring operation for those countries which have a large number of agricultural holdings.
It seems to us, on the contrary, that this question should be answered on a country-by-country basis, taking into account the special situation and specific structure of farming in each country, as well as the social impact of their suddenly finding themselves in the CAP and the speed which is desirable, desired and bearable for each country's farming sector.
To tackle this problem solely from an accounting point of view, which is what certain Member States, such as Germany and the Netherlands, tend to do at present, shows a narrowness of approach which is dangerous to the future of the Union, because these are essential issues for the future and the equilibrium of societies in the applicant countries.
The enemy of the Greater Europe of the future, Mr President, is the desire for uniformity.
Mr President, the reduced time allotted to the co-rapporteur means that I have to reduce the problem of the accession of Cyprus to a Shakespearian question: one State or two, that is the question.
Obviously accession to the European Union is open to only one Cypriot State as far as international law is concerned.
That means that the representatives of the two communities on the island will have to agree on a constitutional formula which will enable the new Member State to participate in the decision-making process and to assume all its obligations under Community law.
Only a federal model, in other words the model which is recommended in the United Nations Security Council Resolutions, fulfils this objective.
Any theories based on the existence of two sovereign States which would be linked together by a vague treaty of partnership rather than via a solid, democratic and freely accepted constitution, would give rise to fictitious and inoperable structures which would be unacceptable from the legal viewpoint.
We are now entering into the final stretch of the negotiation process.
The current window of opportunity, the opportunity to resolve a forty-year old conflict, will close at the end of this month.
I should like to emphasise here that it is precisely the European dimension which provides the opportunity to transcend the old quarrel about sovereignty.
