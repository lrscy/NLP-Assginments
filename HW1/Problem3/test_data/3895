Jobs are being lost to technology.
How, therefore, can we secure this standard of living today?
We need to find ways that are not obvious from this way of thinking.
We need to realise that we made a mistake when, ten years ago with the world trade agreements, we failed to take this parameter into account, namely their cheap products which are today drowning the market and keeping our products off the shop shelves.
This is a serious mistake which we will have to pay for.
We need to tell European citizens the truth: that we will be unable to make the Chinese into Europeans and that, unfortunately, we shall have to make the Europeans into Chinese.
Â Â  Mr President, please allow me to speak about the European Social model from the point of view of a citizen of a new Member State.
It is said that scientists have identified four different models, namely the Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Continental and Mediterranean models.
Although they differ, they also share some common traits.
I would also add that there is another model, the Postcommunist model, which does not fit in with any of the others.
The Postcommunist model is characterised by the absence of any model at all, where supermarket staff work until ten in the evening, even on the first of May, or work twenty-four hours a day for 200 euros per month.
This is why the creation of a new social model, common to the whole of Europe and its implementation at least on a basic level is above all in the interests of the citizens of the new Member States.
Unfortunately, it is in the new Member States that we see the biggest divergence between quality of work and payment for it.
There is very poor access to healthcare; a lack of a minimum social support for those with inadequate resources, there are very low disability benefits and pensions and, finally, a hidden system of charges for access to higher education.
Sadly, it is in the new Member States that there are the least jobs available and those that do exist are of a poor quality, the pay most often ranging between 200 and 500 euros per month, while the cost of living is almost on a par with the rest of Europe.
Unfortunately, it is in Poland, in the country of the trade union âSolidarnoÅÄâ, that we have the most poorly protected workersâ rights in the whole European Union.
I hope that the European Social Model will ensure that our poorest citizens will not have to fear the news of a further enlargement or of the introduction of the euro.
In this respect, we all need the European Union to play a more significant role.
The European Social Model should aim to increase confidence in European institutions, especially on the part of the poorest citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, two Members of this House, from different political groups, have joined together to draft a report on the future of the European Social Model, and the result has been worth their effort.
The European Social Model defines the unity of values, but also the diversity of the national systems.
The values by which we are guided include solidarity, social justice, access to education and health services, but the manner in which they are put into practice is left to the Member States, with their different models, whether Nordic or Anglo-Saxon, Continental or Mediterranean.
Both globalisation and the disturbing demographic trends put the national social security systems at risk to a considerable degree.
This is where there must be far-reaching reforms if sustainable funding is to be ensured.
The systems must become more dynamic, and must no longer be as rigid as they have been.
What I find praiseworthy in the report is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, which continue to provide most jobs and traineeships, along with 'flexicurity', the innovative approach combining flexible labour markets, modern labour organisation, security and social protection.
There are, however, three problems areas, and it is not just the Germans in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party that regard them as such.
The first is to be found in paragraphsÂ 13 and 14, which discuss the open coordination method, which must not be allowed to become a new lawmaking process, and is acceptable only if it is limited to the exchange of experience and best practice.
Both the national parliaments and the social partners need to be involved in it.
The second is in paragraphÂ 23, which includes an urgent demand â originating from MrÂ Stephen Hughes â for a framework directive on services of general interest, in flagrant contradiction to the current state of negotiations.
Thirdly, there is the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in paragraphÂ 31.
We repudiate the idea that the relocation of businesses should be funded from the European level.
We have no need either of wide-ranging approval procedures or of new bureaucracies, and we certainly have no need of the privatisation of public capital.
Actions to provide workers affected by globalisation with further training and retraining are acceptable, but nothing else is.
We are counting on this House to support this line, and, if it does so, we will then be able to vote to adopt the report as a whole.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Members who have drawn up this report on such an important issue, which lies at the heart of European integration.
This is a very positive report, because the big political families in this Parliament and the enormous majority of Members have managed to carry on working together on a joint approach and commitment.
I believe that today provides a very appropriate opportunity to say once again that the enormous majority of Members of this House see open markets and the European social model as part of an indivisible whole, and that that will continue to be the case in the future.
A reasoned and reasonable report; a reasoned report, looking at the past and seeing that, by means of our model, we have achieved the largest area of economic and social progress in Europe and reached the most important stage in that progress, and a reasonable report because it enables us to look to the future not just on the defensive, but also proactively, in order to make a success of the great challenges of globalisation.
Furthermore, there is no reason not to point out that the report has managed to emphasise the added value that the Union contributes to this model, in which, naturally, Europe does not have the ambition to carry out the tasks of the Member States, though it does have the legal competences required to complement and promote the action needed to achieve the communitised objectives of employment and social well-being.
We have many instruments, including legislation, by means of which we can reasonably champion basic objectives and defend workersâ fundamental rights and prevent social dumping.
We are asking for a new form of globalisation for the whole of the world â one in which we do not have this social dumping that is accompanied by instruments that spoil workersâ conditions; the Union must prevent this phenomenon from arising in its territory.
Mr President, I shall end by saying that I am certain that our reformed model has a future, but this certainty is accompanied by another: not even the economic Europe will have a future unless its social model is respected.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, I should like say that I do not like the fact that the two largest parties prepare joint reports as a matter of principle.
I feel that it excludes other parties from the outset.
As for this report, it is generally ok.
I know that sounds churlish, but I am pleased subsidiarity has been mentioned and we call on Member States to act and not the EU.
However, I have severe reservations as regards talking about a European social model at all.
I know we have common goals, but we do not have common systems across Member States â as other people have mentioned â to achieve those goals.
Neither, I believe, should we have, hence my concerns.
I know others have mentioned this, but I would not like it to be thought, if this report is passed, that we want to work towards a one-size-fits-all European social model, instead of respecting the diversity that we have at the moment.
Common social objectives, yes; a common social model, no.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I would like to welcome this discussion.
There are two standard platitudes that are delivered whenever the European social model or social policy is discussed.
The first is that a social Europe is at the heart of this project.
The second is that it is simply a matter of creating economic resources and that a rising tide will lift all boats.
Both of those propositions are utterly discredited and if you look at the figures for poverty, for homelessness and for social dislocation in this Union, you will understand why.
The reality is that social Europe has been very much a âfrillâ or an âadd-onâ to the broader game plan of this Union.
I believe that, if we are to have a real and fruitful discussion about social policy, we have to ask the fundamental questions and the difficult questions relating to EU macroeconomic policy.
What has the effect of liberalisation and privatisation been on those who are marginalised?
What about the creeping abandonment of the welfare state?
And, is it any wonder that there is such a glaring gulf between the European citizen and the European Union, when the policies we pursue disenfranchise people.
I very much hope that this report will serve as a springboard for the much deeper discussion and analysis that we require.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, experience clearly shows that the European economic model is unsustainable, significantly so in fact.
The social model should work as a safety net, or a springboard, for citizens who cannot work due to temporary difficulties, old age or illness.
It has turned into a comfortable resting place, however, for those who are unwilling to work.
The European social model is an exercise in high-minded populism and operates in debt across many countries.
It does not encourage personal responsibility; it does not motivate people to improve their qualifications and performance; it promotes laziness and a lack of responsibility, making people passive and indifferent, and ultimately it leads to companies pulling out of the EU, resulting in high unemployment in the Member States.
The current populist social system is certainly a vote winner for politicians, but it will not bring future prosperity for our citizens.
It should be stated clearly that the European social model is not, as the politicians would have us believe, a given right.
It is merely a temporary bonus resulting from economic efficiency.
Â Â  It is widely accepted here that there is no single social model in Europe, but rather that we have 25 models.
Similarly, there is an understanding that social policy falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States.
Given these shared viewpoints, the question is not about whether it is possible to achieve the single model, but rather about whether it is sensible to aspire to one at all.
I attach importance to the fact that this report highlights some common fundamental values and objectives of European social models, such as equality, nonâdiscrimination, solidarity and general access to education, health care and other public services.
For our citizens these are the essential ingredients of a successful economy and also of an equitable society.
The Member States are, therefore, making continuous efforts to harmonise economic efficiency, competition and social justice.
Of course, the ways in which we go about this will vary.
Social policy is not an economic burden but a positive aspect of the economic growth of the European Union since it generates social cohesion, raises living standards and guarantees fundamental rights and equality.
Social policy is an important factor in social peace, political stability and economic progress.
It is precisely this issue which is addressed in this report as it calls for the reform of economic and social systems so that they can address the challenges of demographic changes, globalisation and the rapid pace of technological development.
Naturally, the European Union is playing an important role here by coordinating various efforts for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, preparing common guidelines for growth and employment, and ensuring a certain degree of coordination in the field of social security.
This report says that social security is neither the preserve of the right nor the left, but is essential to a modern society.
Every Member State of the European Union is seeking the most appropriate model and this report is a suitable incentive and basis for change in the social models of the Member States.
I should like to thank both rapporteurs.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their work.
With this report, supported by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs â I want to emphasise this â we make a great step towards the definition of a European social model: a balanced combination of economic necessities and the imperatives of social justice.
Too many Europeans suffer from the fact that our Union does not protect them, does not protect their public services, and it does not pay sufficient attention to the consequences of globalisation.
Many fear threats against the most basic structural elements of their social model.
In the face of this suffering, our responsibility is of course to guarantee values, but also to prove our willpower through concrete measures.
It would be against our values and vain to seek the lowest labour costs, the most docile employees, the weakest taxes, and the most lax environmental, social, health and welfare standards of our competitors.
On the contrary, our identity and our strength contribute to the excellence of our working standards of production.
This report shows that, beyond our differences, we have a common attachment to a society which is not solely organised by the law of the market, but by solidarity and redistribution and by the protection of our fellow citizens, that is to say our human capital, the most rich and important capital we have.
Europe has shown that social security, protection against life's risks and the right to retirement for everyone have been the ingredients of a recipe that is good for citizens, good for society, good for the economy, and one which will remain the path to follow for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, we are dealing with a very important topic, although I am sure that we have not dealt with it thoroughly enough and will have to return to it again more than once in the future.
Nevertheless, I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the rapporteurs and the results of their work.
I am one of those who consider that a European social model exists.
However, it is a composite rather than a monolithic model.
It is a model where a diversity of experience is based on a commonality of values.
This model should be improved and adapted to the challenges of today, but the improvement must not lead to its weakening.
These are the most significant conclusions that I think we should draw from this very important debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the co-rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, talked about the need for a âdecent societyâ.
That phrase was very much paralleled and echoed by the Council when talking about the need for âsocial justiceâ.
I hope that on all sides of the House people would agree on the importance of those phrases and agree that they should not just be empty phrases but concepts of real meaning.
I hope also that people on both sides of this House would recognise the importance of their applying to everybody in real social inclusion.
In other words, that they should apply not just to those people who are in work, not just to those people who are not able to work, but also to those people who want to work but are unable to find work because there are too many obstacles in their way.
That is why I would also like to congratulate â in addition to the first co-rapporteur â the other co-rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda.
When he spoke he referred to the need to reform the social model.
That phrase was picked up by the Commissioner himself, who talked about the need for reform.
What particularly impressed me about the Commissionerâs remarks was that he said that the status quo is not an option.
He specifically referred to the 20 million unemployed, because they are indeed a constant reminder of the biggest social injustice of all.
Something has to be done.
We must help to do it.
To my mind the key word is âreformâ.
I have tabled an amendment, with the help of a dozen or so colleagues from different countries, to insert into Amendment 1 on recital F the phrase âmodernisation and reformâ.
The good news is that Mr Hughes has confirmed to me this afternoon that the PSE Group will support that phrase.
We have the chance, as a House, to show that we all support that phrase and that it is not empty of meaning, but a phrase of substance.
Our constituents want reform.
Let us show tomorrow that we want it and are going to vote for it too.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to come back and respond briefly to the debate so far.
I have to say I am relieved that Mr Clark and Mr Helmer find the report irrelevant, because I was afraid that there was so much praise for the report and that I must have done something wrong, if they also found it acceptable.
I am really pleased with that.
I am curious and dumbfounded that some of my colleagues on the left in the GUE/NGL Group also seem to think the report is irrelevant, but perhaps that is a reflection of the point I made that the dividing line between left and right is changing in this modern world of ours and that it is not that there are no differences but that the lines are shifting.
Mr Crowley welcomed the report.
However, at the risk of losing a vote, I should say that perhaps he misunderstands the report, because, while the issue of support for the poor is important as part of the European social model, I do not agree â as he seems to â with the theory that the rising tide lifts all boats, because, in fact, it does not.
We do not have the time to go into that.
However, it seems to me that what is intrinsic to this report is the point that social policy is intrinsic to a prosperous Europe and that it is not a question of one or the other, or of waiting for one to deliver the other: we must deliver both and we must find ways to do that through reform.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, our social security systems increasingly appear to be in difficulties.
Recurrent economic crises, demographic changes and immigration processes are forcing us to rethink the European social model, partly because the European Union contains both the wealthiest and most highly developed areas in the world alongside others marked by high levels of poverty and pre-industrial development.
That is why we are seeking a model that can guide development and wealth towards benefiting the many.
What should its features be?
At the centre of the relationship between the people, society and the State we need to place the concept of subsidiarity, by means of which all Europeâs citizens can express their own freedoms guaranteed by non-oppressive institutions.
Social solidarity needs to be promoted, so that social progress and increasing wealth are governed by respect for the dignity of every individual and by the help that social groups can provide for people in difficulties.
This can be entrusted neither to an exclusive role for public institutions nor to self-regulating market forces, but to solidarity of three kinds: individual solidarity, spreading positive values among people; the solidarity of social groups that organise themselves into social networks; and institutional solidarity, with few essential and universally accepted rules, for a State that can make the most of all its societyâs energy.
European businesses also form part of this design, because full employment is a cornerstone of the social model; small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important as the backbone of a system combining economic entrepreneurship with the solidity of the social fabric, working towards a new European social model that, through a diversity of forms and of organisational systems, promotes the well-being of everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, this report that we are debating today on a European social model for the future, in relation to which I would like in particular to acknowledge the consensus that has been achieved between the two large political groups â and I would like especially to mention MrÂ JosÃ©Â SilvaÂ Peneda and also MrÂ ProinsiasÂ DeÂ Rossa for their efforts â is good news, since it is destined to contribute to solidarity, greater social cohesion, greater quality of life and a more sustainable future for Europeâs social security systems.
There is no doubt that the Europe of the citizens to which we all aspire requires more and more coordinated policies that allow us to tackle the new challenges that we face every day.
For example, demographic change with higher life expectancies, which has been mentioned here this afternoon, undoubtedly obliges us to adopt new policies, and not just health policies, but also socio-health care policies which will allow us to combine the higher life expectancy with greater quality of life.
Full employment, temporary work, youth unemployment and womenâs unemployment require an ambitious employment policy, which promotes the stability and security of jobs.
The same goes for the incorporation of women into working life, where we need innovative formulae for reconciling work and family life and for making working hours more flexible.
We must also deal with immigration, which I see more as a challenge than a problem.
This summer, more than ever, we are witnessing the drama of immigration in my country, and it is causing serious human problems.
Without prejudice to the attitude of the Spanish Socialist Government, which has raised false expectations and has therefore helped to aggravate this serious problem, this situation affects the whole of Europe and hence requires cooperative and effective measures on our part.
I believe that it is important that we consider a European immigration policy, and it is important that we say so today, when we are talking about the European social model, because the phenomenon of immigration is going to have a great impact on the European social model throughout Europe.
I therefore believe that we should continue working in favour of this European social model, while taking account of all the challenges facing us, and that of immigration in particular.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this extremely lively debate which has looked at the European social model from a range of perspectives.
I believe I can sum up my opinion as follows: the voices disapproving of the European social model seem to be very much in the minority, while a majority spoke in favour of the European social model as a significant factor in our lives.
The latter is the opinion held, broadly speaking, by the Commission.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to come back to some of the important points that came up in this debate, so that I can use the time allotted to me to highlight the most significant areas.
I feel that it is important to acknowledge that the EU on its own is a highly original product, a highly original political entity that cannot easily be described in the kind of terms conventionally used in political science.
It is inappropriate to describe it as an international treaty, or to talk about it in normal political terms.
The same is true of the European social model.
It is much too complex to streamline into a simple theme.
I therefore wish to express my appreciation for the rapporteurs, who have drafted a text that tackles this question extremely thoroughly, in my view.
Another major theme of this far-reaching debate was the realisation that the European social model is not merely a statistical entity, but that it is, broadly speaking, founded on active participation, and in some cases is founded on work.
This is because work, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard today, is more than just a job; it has a clearly defined ethical character and it is precisely this ethical activity and ethical solidarity which underpins the social model, a fact which came through clearly during the debate.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will note the outcome of your vote with interest, and as I have already indicated, many of the approaches and positions already drawn up by the Commission more or less tally with what has been discussed here.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda and MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The reform of the European social model is today at the heart of the debate in Europe.
As a matter of fact, there are a great many challenges in the social changes consequent to the necessity to adjust to globalisation, demographic evolution and technology innovation.
At this stage, we support the rapporteur when he stresses that the Union should not only preserve but enhance the common set of European values that are the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy, and respect for human rights while bearing in mind that the sine qua non for social justice is economic prosperity.
The Union must meet its citizensâ expectations and answer the spreading concerns about employment, the current low growth rate and the need to reform the social protection systems.
The rapporteur wisely underlines that it is time to call for EU-wide renewal of the social dialogue while deepening cooperation and exchange of best practice through the enhanced open method of coordination as the key policy-making instrument in the fields of employment, social protection, social exclusion, gender equality in the labour market, pensions, and healthcare.
Â Â  â It is undeniable that the European social model was a crucial factor in the rebuilding of democratic Europe during the post-war period and that many millions of people have benefited from its success.
It is also undeniable, however, that having been set up during a time of overpopulation and relative immobility in the business and industrial sectors, it needs to be brought up to date at a time of major population decline, of a highly competitive global economy and of constant demand for adaptable resources.
Reform is all the more necessary in light of the increasing number of relatively new factors of social concern such as the unsustainable nature of pension systems, long-term unemployment, unemployment among the young and unemployment among those with qualifications.
The gradual reduction of the power of the State and the redefinition of its model, greater freedom for economies and the encouragement of private initiative, creativity, competitiveness and investment play a central role in meeting the challenge of catering to the new reality.
Notwithstanding the need for flexibility and the need to contemplate the future reduction of some rights that previous generations took for granted, I also feel it is vital that the most vulnerable sections of society be protected and championed.
Â Â  The PenedaâDe Rossa proposal is an outstanding one not only in professional and political terms but also as a moral achievement.
In our view, the European social model does not mean closing the gaps among the redistribution systems.
The report considers the social model to be a major means of upholding European values, which we can only preserve if Europe continues to follow the path laid out in Amsterdam and Lisbon, and if no ultimate choices are made within the false dichotomy of competitiveness or solidarity.
For the mission to succeed, it is necessary to see economic competitiveness and human security as mutually interdependent elements that jointly create the conditions for a life of human dignity.
We wish to express particular thanks to the authors of the proposal for having formulated the statement in such a way that the new Member States can also identify with it.
The analysis of the PenedaâDe Rossa report closes the debate over whether the aims of cohesion can be reconciled with other, secondary objectives.
The statement is unambiguous: Europe's identity and credibility depend on whether we allow countries, regions and socially vulnerable groups to go under.
The reform of the social model is but a tool and not an end in itself; it is a tool for meeting the new challenges presented by a multinational Europe and by globalisation and the information explosion.
The statement considers the need to avoid the poverty trap that threatens the new Member States in particular as a serious question weighing on Europe's conscience.
We know that the ageing population of Europe is itself producing the threats that make people's futures increasingly hopeless, the greatest of these threats being that of child poverty.
The Europe of which this statement speaks cannot acquiesce in a poverty trap that will swallow up future generations.
Â Â  I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the deep and thought-provoking analysis regarding social Europe.
I agree that the social model is first of all about values.
These values, however, of which the old continent is so justifiably proud, today faces serious threats that can only be averted by common effort.
Although economic growth and increased competitiveness are indeed preconditions for safeguarding the achievements in the social sphere, these in themselves can no longer raise up those social groups which have fallen behind or are unable to keep up with or even participate in the ever-accelerating competition.
On the contrary, they further aggravate these social cleavages.
A frightening reminder of this, in Western Europe, is the tragic situation of refugees and migrants, and in, Eastern Europe, that of the Roma.
The creation of new jobs can, in the absence of suitable guarantees, still lead to the trap of exploitation.
The creation of a level playing field does not by itself lead to true equality of opportunity for those who start out with disadvantages.
On the contrary, it preserves and even heightens differences.
The preconditions for reducing these inequities are the major social support systems, and above all making high-quality education accessible for everyone.
Yet even the victory of those groups that are competitive is a Pyrrhic one: the glaring differences and ever greater decline destabilise society, tearing apart its connective tissue.
The upheavals in France showed us that even the greatest wealth cannot protect you in the midst of a raging crowd.
At the same time, even squeezing wages down to the lowest possible level will not make a socially discontented society attractive to entrepreneurs.
For this reason, although I agree that the source of the tribulations of social Europe and of the possible solutions lies in economic growth and competitiveness, we cannot fall into the error of treating these as absolutes and as ultimate goals.
This was perhaps best expressed by the former president of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Robin Cook: the economy must always serve the people, and never the people the economy.
Â Â  â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme: national allocation plans (2008-2012).
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the Commission and the Presidency to this debate.
I have to ask why there was this last-minute inclusion on the agenda last Friday, without the proper teeing-up among the various political groups.
Was it purely technical, to comply with your obligation to revert to Parliament by 30 June, even though you are a couple of months late?
But I will move on as time is too precious to waste.
The PPE-DE Group fully supports the emissions trading scheme and our objectives under Kyoto and agrees with the need to keep downward pressure on every one of the 25 Member States to meet their targets in relation to greenhouse gases, as agreed under Kyoto.
Please take that as a given.
I note what the Commissioner has just said concerning the conclusions of the 2000 review: âthe system works well, the results were good, the system is up and runningâ.
Commissioner, I do not know whether this is a PR exercise and we do not really want the truth to get out to those who might be listening.
I completely support a fully effective ETS, as do all my colleagues, but the system is not working well.
I know these are early days, which is a genuine caveat for anything we say after what has been a very short 18-month review period.
The theory is good, but the practice has been awful and has not matched the theory at all.
We need to look at this situation urgently.
The idea was that at the end of each year the amount of carbon dioxide actually emitted had to match the amount of emission permits a company surrendered to its government.
That was to keep pressure on companies to decrease their emissions.
What has happened?
In the first year, 2005, the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated by the 21 governments in question.
That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market that fluctuated from EURÂ 31 per tonne down to EURÂ 8 per tonne and back up to EURÂ 16 per tonne.
I agree that we need a properly functioning carbon credit market.
We need industry to buy into what we are saying.
We need credibility, in practice as well as in theory.
Could you please detail any amendments you are proposing in the directive before the second period of NAPs?
By the way, Ireland also submitted its NAP on 13 July and you did not mention its name in the countries that you read out.
I would like you confirm that it has done so.
Perhaps they are telling me whoppers in my home country!
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, MrsÂ Halonen, I am pleased with this debate.
I am also pleased to hear that the emission allowance trading system is working well in the eyes of the Commissioner and the Council.
Our group has put its heart and soul into bringing this directive about, and that is why it is important that it works well.
Nevertheless, I would like to make a few observations and, like MrsÂ Doyle, I have a number of doubts.
First of all, it is unfortunate that only nine countries have submitted their plans now.
It is good to know that the Commission is on the case, but disappointing that only nine countries are ready on time.
Secondly, I think that Member States have been too generous in their recent allocations, and that is why the Directive on emission allowance trading has had too little effect.
Another political problem that particularly catches the eye is the windfall profits which electricity companies have made.
Electricity companies have been allocated free allowances, which they managed to sell on to the energy-intensive industry and to consumers too, and that, is of course, hard to stomach at a time when electricity companies are increasing their profits in any case.
Commissioner, I should like to see a full assessment of this directive, and I think that we should also, given this generous allocation and the windfall profits for electricity companies, ask whether it would not be preferable by far to switch to an auction system instead of the grandfathering system we have at the moment.
Â Â  . Mr President, we all knew that this was going to be an exercise in learning by doing and that we would not get it right first time â and indeed we did not get it right first time!
The issue of more allowances than there are emissions obviously risked undermining the credibility of the whole scheme, but now we are on the second round of the process and we need to have learnt those lessons.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for coming here and naming by implication those Member States which have failed so far to meet the deadline for the submission of these plans.
We are not going to go anywhere if Member States do not actually produce the goods they have promised to produce.
I hope that the Minister will put this on the agenda of the Environment Council on 23Â October.
Now that we can see the ministers on television I look forward to seeing the embarrassment as you point your finger at them, Minister, one by one, and ask them for an explanation as to why those plans have not been submitted.
All too often these plans are coming in late and they are coming in lax.
The Commission has got to be fair, but it has to be tough.
Parliament expects you to ensure that these national allocation plans meet the goals required of the emissions trading scheme, and many Member States which are genuinely committed and have submitted their plans already will be backing you and want you to ensure that there is a level playing field and that the others fall into line.
Whatever they may say, many Member States are looking for an escape route from the emissions trading scheme.
It is up to you to make sure that the exit doors are all closed.
Â Â  . Mr President, as Greens we are pretty much on the same line as our colleagues.
We are at a critical moment: the cheating is over.
What France, Poland and Germany have done with over-allocations cannot continue.
However, I will use my speaking time to point out another issue, namely that of market distortion.
If you look at the German allocation plan, there is a special clause for RWE, which gets four years of an old power plant allowance.
On the other hand, they have completely emptied the new entrants.
The German power market is already completely dominated by four companies.
The German second allocation plan has a hidden agenda â not to allow gas power plant investment in Germany, because that is exactly what those four big companies are afraid of.
Therefore, the Commissionâs Directorate-General for Competition has to be fully involved in the review.
You made another point: why do we do this â to put a price on CO2 or in order to have investments in efficient technology?
You have to look at the Polish and German allocation plans.
What do they do?
For a coal power plant investment in Germany, they give 14 years of full allocations.
There is no price incentive at all to switch from coal to gas, which was the cheapest option available in Europe to cut down CO2 emissions.
The German and Polish allocation plans are scandalous.
They destroy the whole system of incentives.
Commissioner, you bear a great responsibility at the moment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on emissions trading plays an important yet dangerous part in the issue of the Kyoto agreement.
We are highly critical of what may turn into a mere trade in the right to pollute, on top of the harm done to countries suffering from underdevelopment.
As we have heard, it is utterly ineffective in actually reducing emissions.
We need to be quite clear about this, above all on the eve of a conference of the parties, the thirteenth on climate, which, emblematically, is to take place in Africa, in Nairobi.
We should not be setting up a pollution market, but promoting new environmental development based on cooperation policies that should allow the richer countries to produce while polluting much less and the poorer ones to be helped to develop with access to new environmental technologies.
This, then, is a substantial difference on which Europe must have a clear position when it takes part in the Nairobi conference: it needs to achieve a good balance between emissions trading and the promotion of truly beneficial cooperation policies.
Â Â  â () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, climate change is one of the most crucial challenges that politicians such as ourselves have to face.
Although emissions trading was intended to be one of the principal instruments in meeting this challenge head-on, it has to be said that the results achieved to date from its initial stage are not really convincing.
It was planned that emissions trading should start on 1Â January 2005, but there are many Member States in which that did not happen.
The national allocation plans â including those approved by the Commission in the first phase â were not really ambitious, and what really did, of course, annoy businesses in the countries with fairly ambitious plans, was that the criteria for the grant of emissions certificates varied to a very considerable degree, so that, for example, a steelworks or a chalk plant got far more emissions certificates in one country than in another.
These disparities were not merely a consequence of the burden sharing required by Kyoto; in some cases, they had been exaggerated, and that, of course, resulted in competition being distorted.
During the process of framing the resolution on emissions trading, which was done by codecision, this House argued in favour of very clear and precise rules, to which the Commissionâs response was that these were quite unnecessary, and that things could be managed, and excesses avoided, by the use of competition law.
I get the impression that the Commission needs to take another, rather closer look and prevent distortions of competition between the Member States and between enterprises within them.
As far as the next stage is concerned, the objective must not be â as it was in the first â that emissions trading should work more or less; on the contrary, it must work well.
Distortions of competition must, in so far as is possible, be avoided, and, if European policy is to be credible, the maximum possible reductions in CO2 must be achieved.
Â Â  MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Dimas has said that the national allocation plans have been submitted by only nine countries â although, if MrsÂ Doyle is right in what she claims, and Ireland has done so, by ten â and that only six of them did so by the end of June as they meant to.
Our tardiness in matters such as these is particularly disturbing in view of the fact that we have in fact seen a renewed increase in emissions, above all in the old Member States.
What can the Commission, the European Council and the Presidency of the Council do to bring pressure to bear in this area, going beyond merely drafting resolutions to actually putting them into effect?
The second point I want to make has to do with the substance of these national action plans.
What I would like to know is how the Commission or the European Council can ensure that the national action plans are rigorous, that our Member States are required to meet the Kyoto Protocol's requirements, to comply with our own laws, and prevented from buying their way out of their obligations?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like us to take another look at the allocation plan submitted by Germany, and the reason why I want to do that is that Germany will, next year, be assuming the Presidency not only of the EU Council, but also of the G8, both of which presidencies are crucial in terms of climate protection and energy policy.
It is Germany that will be in charge of the preparations for next year's â 2007's â next major UN meeting, and it will be in Heiligendamm that landmark decisions will be taken.
I do not believe that the sort of allocation plan that the Federal Republic has produced testifies to the German Governmentâs suitability for performing such functions.
On the contrary, it is even now plain from the way in which certificates are to be allocated that certain major energy suppliers in Germany are going to use this trading of emissions as no more than yet another justification for price increases of the kind we have experienced already over the past year.
It is also clear from this allocation plan that Germany is neglecting to offer any incentives for conversion from coal to fuels that generate less carbon dioxide.
That I regard as disgraceful and absolutely indefensible in terms of the ongoing debate about the climate.
If the EU wants to do as it should and, in future, once more play a leading role where the protection of the climate is concerned, then the German state â which will, after all, bear vital responsibility for Kyoto and the post-Kyoto process â must be urged to mend its ways.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commission statement on the greenhouse gas allowance trading schemes.
Climate change is having a major economic and social impact.
Consequently, pollution must be made expensive.
One point which strengthens the credibility of the overall scheme is that of the declaration of emissions submitted by every undertaking to the competent national authority.
There are undertakings that submit declarations certified by specialist agencies and firms, while others are not certified.
The Commission therefore has a huge responsibility to safeguard and strengthen the credibility of the trading scheme and we call on it to take the necessary initiatives to safeguard the new scheme from any such distortions.
I propose, in the run-up to the evaluation of the second national plans for 2008-2012, that the European Commission take the necessary measures in order to prevent Member States from granting excessively generous emission allowances to certain undertakings.
I also call on the Commission to supervise the strict application of the methodology provided for, so that emission factors are applied not to combustion installations as a whole but to each combustion unit.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a question of the credibility of the EUâs climate protection policy.
According to the , just five of the emission allowance allocations published by the Member States for the next phase fulfil the main criteria.
We all know that, to protect the planet over the next few years, the largest developing countries have to be persuaded to agree to limit their emissions.
How can we imagine them agreeing to that if the EU fails to live up to its own commitments under Kyoto?
The United States of America is also watching what we do.
Until now, EU action has encouraged Americans who want their own country to be involved in global climate protection, but if we betray our commitments under Kyoto, that will be a victory for the opponents of climate protection in the United States and elsewhere.
The Commission must now show determination and insist that the Member States of the EU comply with the key criteria in emissions trading.
Unfortunately, one of the first Member States where the government has already bowed to the demands of a polluting company in the first phase of emissions trading is Finland.
I appeal to the Commission not to allow this type of Finlandisation to spread.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to say thank you for this excellent debate, some points of which I wish, on behalf of the Council, to comment on.
Firstly, with regard to these levels of emissions, we should not draw over-hasty conclusions after just one year: we definitely need to examine the issue over a period of more than a year.
For example, for us in Northern Europe yearly temperatures â whether or not it will be a cold or mild winter â and the state of the seas, lakes and rivers are highly significant, not just for energy consumption but also for energy production, and thus also for volumes of emissions.
Things can therefore vary greatly from one year to the next because of this.
As has been said in this debate, the Member States are now engaged in allocation planning for the next phase, and, in addition to those countries whose proposals are already with the Commission, around 10 others have already published their own plans and are in the final stages of dealing with them at national level.
The other Member States have not yet got quite so far, but I am very sure that they are making progress.
It should be realised that these figures relate to 27 European countries, and not just 25.
It has been mentioned here that there are flaws in the emissions trading scheme, and accordingly it is very important that the Commission now evaluates its viability very thoroughly and from different points of view.
We are expecting the Commissionâs evaluation to materialise later this autumn, and perhaps quite soon.
We nevertheless do agree that, despite the flaws, this scheme is absolutely necessary, and should be taken in the direction of its original objective, which is that it should act as a genuine incentive for the players involved to invest in carbon-free, environmentally friendly technology.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this afternoonâs discussion.
We see that they are very concerned about this global problem and how the European Union is responding to it.
Before I continue, I should like to assure Mrs Doyle that this discussion was not used as a cover by the Commission, for the simple reason that it was Parliament and not us who asked for this debate.
So it cannot be a cover-up.
Also, concerning my failure to mention that Ireland submitted a National Allocation Plan, I have it in my papers.
I said ten Member States and I thought I mentioned Ireland, but if you did not hear it, then you are right.
Looking further ahead, concerning the review, I am now preparing a high-quality review of the European Union emissions trading scheme to identify improvements to be made beyond 2012.
This could not be done before because until 30 June 2006 we had not even received the actual emissions.
The emissions were reported on 15Â May 2006, but some countries sent their actual emissions on 30 June 2006.
So how could we have the review before we received the actual emissions?
Later this year, following the adoption of the European Union emissions trading system review report in the coming weeks, the Commission will activate a stakeholder group under the auspices of the European Climate Change Programme to intensify the debate on the review.
I firmly believe that we need to focus the review debate early in the process to ensure a high-quality outcome.
The priority issues to be tackled in the review are, therefore, the harmonisation and extension of the scope of the directive, further harmonisation and more predictability of the cap-setting and allocation process â including consideration of competitiveness, more robust compliance and enforcement of the rules and the linking to trading schemes in third countries and increased involvement of developing countries.
The Commission has already confirmed its intention to address aviationâs climate change impact through emissions trading.
There are a number of good ideas to make emissions trading more effective, including giving longer-term certainty on allocations and increasing harmonisation in a number of areas.
We need more time to discuss and further develop these valuable ideas.
I am therefore aiming for the Commission to present a legislative proposal in the course of 2007.
Here I should like to give a short answer regarding the concern expressed about power companies making windfall profits by pricing in the cost of allocations, although they receive them for free.
Some companies have done that.
The electricity price rose, not only because of the emissions trading system, but mainly because of high fuel prices and because of the lack of competition in the power and gas market â a lack of liberalisation.
However, as one colleague mentioned, perhaps auctioning could be a solution, along with liberalisation, so we would avoid having windfall profits by power companies with consumers paying a higher price for electricity.
According to the directive, auctioning is permitted for the second trading period, up to 10%.
That is going to be one of the issues that will be discussed during the review period of the directive.
Looking back, we can say that the infrastructure for emissions trading is sound and the market in allowances is developing rather well.
In the first year of operations, 2005 â at least according to World Bank data â 320Â million allowances are reported to have been traded via market intermediaries, valued at more than EURÂ 6Â million.
So, no one can say that the emissions trading system has failed.
In 2006, the monthly trading volume has increased steadily, with volumes of 80 to 100 allowances in a busy month.
A number of organised exchanges across Europe are offering platforms for trading allowances and a number of other market intermediaries, such as brokers, are also active in the market.
I would like to say a few words about the so-called âover-allocationâ of allowances to installations that are covered by the emissions trading system.
It is a fact that we had about 3% more allowances allocated than actual emissions.
That could be for various reasons, one of which could be that companiesâ installations reacted to the emissions saving system and the obligations arising from the system, and they have made the most obvious and easiest reductions in emissions by improving energy efficiency, for example, or through other easy-to-take measures.
It was the case in Germany that we had a real reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide from installations.
Another reason could be the very mild winter that we had in 2005, which reduced the cost of heating, and â perhaps the main reason â the companies participating in the system were over-optimistic about their business growth and over-estimated their emissions, while the Member States were complacent in accepting their figures.
But, during the second trading period, we have made it quite clear to all Member States that the 12 criteria of the directive should be kept, especially for those countries that did not contract to achieve their individual quota target, which will contribute to the overall target for the European Union.
Also, the actual emissions that we have now should be taken into full account.
I am going to be tough but fair with Member States regarding the national allocation plans and am very glad for the support for this approach that has been obvious from your contributions today.
The onus is firstly on governments to propose plans to the Commission which ensure that the European Union emissions trading system delivers its contribution to achieving our quota targets.
At the same time, all stakeholders should engage in the process of improving and expanding the European Union scheme, so as to secure a global carbon market that can deliver the emissions reductions necessary to tackle climate change.
I would like to thank you for the rich debate with encouraging and important contributions and for your continued support for the fight against global warming and the threat posed to future generations.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0325/2006).
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . As you know, new Member States have to ensure a high level of border control upon accession.
As far as the lifting of internal border control is concerned, new Member States are evaluated by experts of the Member States and of the Commission, whether they fulfil, amongst other preconditions, the high Schengen standards of external border control.
In January 2006, the evaluation of the non-SAS related of the new Member States started, and a first assessment of their preparation will be available for the Council in December.
I will be reporting to the ministers.
With respect to illegal immigration, the Commission outlined the areas it considers to be future priorities in a communication which, as you know, was adopted on 19 July.
The communication in particular explores how to further secure external borders, for instance by introducing intelligence-led âe-bordersâ management and addresses the possible creation of an automated entry-exit system, the issue of regularisations and the need to tackle employment of illegally resident third country nationals.
In addition, I would like to underline that in July the Commission adopted a proposal on establishing a mechanism for the creation of rapid border intervention teams.
This mechanism, that will strengthen the solidarity between Member States and the Community, will allow Member States which face extraordinary obstacles in controlling their external borders to make use of the expertise and manpower of border guards of other Member States on a temporary basis.
Â Â  Mr President, the events of recent days appear to be demonstrating that the European Union is not prepared for waves of immigrants from areas close to the Union.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania next year, we will have a new European Union sea border on the Black Sea, that there are States on the Black Sea such as Ukraine, Moldavia, Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Turkey and that that sea opens us up to the whole of Asia.
Does the European Commission plan to establish a system for the Black Sea similar to the one it is beginning to establish on the Atlantic in order to prevent an avalanche of immigrants from descending on the European Union from the Asian continent?
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can reply to the honourable Member that one of the priorities on which we are working with the Finnish Presidency is precisely to propose a European model for the integrated surveillance of our maritime borders by December, with an initial assessment in October.
We are aware that a maritime border is very different from a land border or an airport border, and therefore the Black Sea will clearly also be one of the areas to be examined.
May I just say to the honourable Member that I met the Bulgarian minister for internal affairs again just yesterday and once again I told him that Bulgaria and Romania must prepare appropriately for a strong European contribution in controlling an extremely sensitive border.
Â Â  â That the flow of illegal immigrants needs to be cut off is not a matter of doubt.
The example given by MrÂ MedinaÂ Ortega highlights practices in his own country whereby national governments, by proceeding to â as they term it â legalise illegal immigrants, are actually sending out the wrong signal.
Does the Commission see possibilities here, and is it contemplating indicating that a stop should be put to such courses of action, as a consequence of which these illegal immigrants can find their way into all the other Member States of the Union?
Â Â  . You have touched upon an issue which really is a priority.
I have said on a number of occasions that the huge problem of massive regularisations threatens to undermine the principle of solidarity between Member States.
We addressed this issue for the first time in the Council some fourteen months ago.
We decided then that every national measure to regularise illegal immigrants must be preceded by a European consultation that permits the rotating Presidency and the European Commission to give their opinion on the impact of such a regularisation measure on the other Member States.
There too, we spoke of the principle of solidarity, and we approved a document.
This document has not yet formally entered into force, but it has the value of a political decision.
I therefore call upon every Member State of the Union planning to carry out regularisations to comply with this obligation to a preliminary consultation, in order to allow other Member States to adopt measures to take into account the impact of this massive regularisation.
Â Â  Commissioner, considering the huge scale of citizenship granted over recent years in Bulgaria to immigrants from Moldova, Ukraine, Russia and elsewhere, what realistic steps will be taken to control that immigration by proxy through Bulgaria and Romania?
With most other Member States not taking their fair share of immigration under the 2004 enlargement, would countries like mine, the United Kingdom, not be wholly justified in refusing to extend their present open-door policy to Romania and Bulgaria?
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is certainly a highly sensitive subject, and I can confirm that I have personally raised the issue in my talks â including recent ones â with the government authorities of both Bulgaria and Romania.
The answers are reassuring in that both these candidate countries, which are close to joining, realise what impact dual citizenship may have on the other European Union Member States.
They have, however, posed us a problem that the European Union should be concerned about.
It is the problem of countries like Ukraine and Moldova, which are demanding a new facilitation scheme for temporary EU entry visas.
If we do not give serious consideration to these demands for a visa scheme for Ukraine and Moldova, the citizens of those countries will obviously try to resort to dangerous stratagems.
As for workersâ freedom of movement, there are of course references in the accession treaties for Romania and Bulgaria to the possibility of extending, for a transitional period, the freedom of workers to go to other European Union countries.
The European Commissionâs argument, as regards the ten new countries that have been members of the Union since 2004, is that there is no longer any danger of an invasion by workers, and we have published a communication in that respect.
If the two new Member States join at the beginning of next year, as I personally hope they will, they will have some restrictions.
That will be understandable, considering that they will be new Member States within a second phase of enlargement.
Â Â  . It is true that the United Statesâ reserves of crude oil and petroleum products have recently reached record levels.
However, growing reserves of crude oil or petroleum products in any consumer country should normally not put upward pressure on the world oil price.
It is a well-documented statistical belief among experts that prices of oil and oil products increasingly relax with growing levels of reserves in major consumer countries.
That is because risk premium is an important element in the price of oil in the world markets and is priced in by market operators on the basis of evaluations of various risk factors.
Besides due political considerations, the probability of supply disruptions caused by insufficient spare capacities and reserve levels is a primary risk factor.
Hence comfortable or even record levels of crude oil or petroleum product reserves in important consumer countries such as the United States tend to reduce the perception of risk by a vast majority of operators in global oil markets.
Against this background, there was no need to discuss the question of levels of US crude oil and petroleum product reserves at the annual EU-US Summit.
As for the crude oil imports from the US to the European Union, in the past three years the United States has supplied negligible quantities to the EU â less than one million tonnes per annum. That is less than 0.2% of EUâs total crude oil imports.
In fact, the US itself is highly and increasingly dependent on crude oil imports.
Â Â  â Plans for affordable hydrogen-fuelled cars have in fact been lying around in drawers for years now, and some manufacturers are now in a position to put hybrid cars on the market at the same price as conventional ones.
What practical steps is the EU taking to promote such alternatives in order to make us less dependent on both American oil policy and the oil-exporting countries?
Â Â  . It is true that given the situation of oil prices, a number of initiatives have been studied and included in the five-point plan presented by Commissioner Piebalgs since September 2005.
These were further developed in the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy.
The Commission aims gradually to reduce the EUâs dependency on imported oil by creating energy efficiency, on the one hand, and by replacing it, on the other hand, with other energy sources, including biomass and other renewables.
It also aims at strengthening the producer-consumer dialogue with oil-producing countries in order to promote new exploration and development to meet rising global demand; promoting transparency and predictability of the oil market and being well prepared for emergencies, especially by ensuring that Member States maintain the stocks as set out in the relevant EU legislation.
It is important to know that all these policies â the ones on the use of fuel for cars, biomass and all the other measures just mentioned â will have a beneficial impact mainly in the medium to long term and not for the immediate future.
Â Â  â One of our aims, of course, is to make the European Union rather more independent in matters of energy supply, and there is no doubt that branching out into alternative and renewable types of energy would be important as a way of doing this.
Which particular types of renewable energy will you be taking deliberate steps to promote in the near future, and to what extent?
Can you also supply figures for this?
Â Â  . There is a number in the plan of Commissioner Piebalgs in this respect, so I would not, at this point, list which are priorities or otherwise.
The issue of biofuel is one of the priorities in the European Union.
It has been discussed in the College of Commissioners and in the Council, as have other areas such as the use of wind and solar energy.
What I can do, given that I am not an expert on this issue, is to make sure that there will be a written reply from my colleague with more detail on this issue.
Â Â  . I should like to thank Mr Florenz, because every time he asks questions on this subject he really helps our policies.
It is true that it is estimated that 25% of all cancers in the European Union could be attributed to smoking.
The World Health Organisation, the Finnish and German Governments and US agencies have already classified environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen.
As I have said to Parliament on many occasions in the past, action towards a smoke-free Europe is one of my main priorities.
Before the end of 2006, the Commission intends to put forward a document on smoke-free environments, which will discuss the way forward to tackle passive smoking in Europe.
It is true that DG Sancoâs informal consultation did not mention the classification of ETS as a carcinogen, firstly because it had a preliminary and informal character and it tried to get the opinion of selected players.
However, we place great importance on Parliamentâs view that classifying tobacco smoke as a carcinogen would be advisable.
The problem is legal and not political, because we agree.
There is a gap in the European legislation, so I would cover two aspects.
Firstly, we have the problem that the existing legislation in the European Union that deals with dangerous products and substances does not cover smoke as such, but only products placed on the market.
Therefore there is a gap there in the legislation.
At the same time, the approach was similar to the legislation that deals with protection from carcinogens in the workplace.
These two pieces of legislation unfortunately apply only to substances and preparations placed on the market.
Under the purposes and intentions of these pieces of legislation, tobacco smoke as such is not considered a product.
We have two approaches.
On the one hand, in the consultation document we are to bring forward on the smoke-free environment, we shall ensure that we refer to the classification of ETS as a carcinogen â the one made by WHO, the US, Germany and Finland, so that we give the right information.
At the same time, as components and ingredients of the smoke are already classified under European legislation as carcinogens â such as arsenic, butadiene, benzene, nitrogen oxides and other oxides â we shall ensure that we make reference to that as well.
Therefore, legally we cannot say at this point that ETS is a carcinogen, but we can say that ETS contains components and substances which are carcinogens.
I think the message is quite strong.
This is what we can do in the immediate future.
However, in the mean time and in the long run, we hope to find ways and explore the possibilities of how we can use or amend in that respect European legislation so that we have the possibility of classifying ETS as such as a carcinogen.
This can be done both by exploring amendments to our legislation.
There is also an ongoing debate now on the review of the legislation on carcinogens in the workplace, and perhaps we should consider including that as well.
That would apply to the workplace, but it would be a first step.
In conclusion, we will present every possible aspect in the paper which will be published soon â before the end of the year.
However, in the meantime we will look at how to improve our existing legislation to ensure that we also have the legal competence to classify ETS as such as a carcinogen.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, in view of the fact that, in any given year, 10Â 000 people in Europe lose their lives as a result of passive smoking, I am sure you will understand why I am not particularly happy about that statement.
While I do of course understand that there are loopholes in the law, it is â if I understand these things rightly â your job to close them.
Thinking back to how, at the time of the BSE crisis, we responded to a vague suspicion of risk by turning Europeâs whole food policy on its head over a period of one or two years, we really should do more about this issue, where facts are actually to hand in the shape of some 10Â 000 victims per annum.

We can tell you that my group will certainly do something about this by producing an own-initiative report along these lines with the aim of supporting you.
Â Â  . Definitely, I agree.
I could also point to the problems mentioned in a report today, in the United Kingdom press I think, that are caused to the respiratory system and to the lungs and breathing problems caused by passive smoking.
We also know that it causes heart problems.
Our target, as you will realise from the paper we are to produce, is a smoke-free environment in the European Union.
All these arguments help us to move in that direction.
We will continue striving to achieve that target, but in the meantime we will explore what amendments are needed to our legislation so that we can proceed with the classification ourselves.
Member States can do it and other international organisations can do it, so I do not see why the European Union should not be able to do it as well.
Â Â  Commissioner, I wonder whether you saw in the press this week â certainly in the British press â reports of a plan by a German entrepreneur to start smoking flights from Europe to Asia.
Firstly, does the Commissioner condemn this and, secondly, is there anything the Commission can do legally to stop this from happening?
Â Â  . I am afraid not.
I do not know who would want to fly in such conditions.
I conducted a small poll myself.
I asked smokers if they would fly on a smoke-filled plane and they said ânoâ.
As you know, there is no Community legislation on banning smoke on planes.
It is the Member States that decide on that.
Therefore it will remain the competence of the Member States. Given the recent messages from Germany regarding promoting a smoke-free environment, I am hopeful that they will look into that and that special legislation will come into force in 2007.
Â Â  â Although none of us want to live in a world in which everything is forbidden, I do believe that smoking â and passive smoking in particular â are examples of a situation in which our own actions are harmful to others.
European hotels and restaurants have in fact undertaken to set aside certain parts of their premises as smoke-free areas, but this is no more than a voluntary commitment.
Would you consider enacting a Europe-wide regulation according to which certain areas would have to be smoke-free, and with this actually being monitored, since controls on this are, to a great degree, more or less effective from one Member State to another?
Â Â  . I am sure you know I have views on that, but I do not want to anticipate the outcome of the consultation process that will be launched very soon on smoke-free environments.
Based on that we will see what will be the next steps we can take at European level.
I am very much encouraged that one Member State after another is introducing smoking bans in public places.
Lithuania and Slovenia recently took similar decisions, and Germany will also do so in the near future.
However, for the European Community as a whole, the Commission will await the outcome of the consultation process before deciding what steps to take.
As I said in my hearing before the committees in Parliament, my target would be to have a smoke-free Europe and to protect all citizens from passive smoking, not just in some Member States.
My personal view is that just separating smokers from non-smokers is not enough and does not offer sufficient protection.
If we really want to achieve benefits for all we have to go for full smoking bans.
Nevertheless I look forward to Parliamentâs contribution to the consultation process.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by pointing out that the Commission has no direct responsibility where the law on bankruptcy is concerned.
Since, however, this area is one of particular importance to smaller and medium-sized businesses, the Commission is endeavouring to act as an intermediary.
We have ensured that tried and tested procedures have been publicised, and have encouraged Member States to adopt them.
In the Commissionâs view, its work is focused on preventing insolvencies and promoting restructuring rather than on the winding up of businesses.
We are working towards more business-friendly provisions for non-fraudulent insolvencies, and we are, finally, giving consideration to how to support new starts and give businesses a second chance.
Reference is made in the European Charter for Small Enterprises to the fact that some insolvencies can occur despite the exercise of responsible initiative and entrepreneurial risk-taking, and a review of national insolvency laws in the light of proven best practice is accordingly called for.
Various steps have been taken to this end.
Early in 2001, a seminar on the failure of enterprises was held in Noordwijk, at which the most important issues discussed were the improvement of bankruptcy legislation and the prevention of insolvencies.
In mid-2002, the study âBankruptcy and a Fresh Startâ was published, including a collection of data on the legal and social consequences of business insolvencies.
This survey formed the basis for the Commissionâs Best Procedure project 'Restructuring, bankruptcy and a fresh startâ in 2003, which focused on the two issues of to what extent national insolvency law was an obstacle to an enterpriseâs continued existence and to its making a new start, and what effect the blemish of failure has on the prospects for success of a business making a new start after failure and on the culture of entrepreneurship in general.
The outcomes of this project were presented in a report intended to support the trend in European policymaking towards changes in the legal framework of insolvency legislation.
The principal recommendations and benchmarks ranged from an emphasis on the usefulness of external advice in preventing insolvencies via the role of up-to-date and reliable insolvency legislation in promoting settlements and restructuring measures through to the importance of drawing a clear distinction between fraudulent and non-fraudulent bankruptcy, while the report also set out the various relevant legal consequences.
It did indeed help to step up efforts across Europe towards the reform of insolvency law.
In response to a number of positions adopted in the âEntrepreneurship in Europeâ Green Paper, the Commission, in 2004, expanded the Entrepreneurship Action Plan by including in it a priority measure on business insolvencies with three specific objectives.
The first of these was that the Member States should be encouraged to implement the recommendations of the group of experts on ârestructuring, bankruptcy and a fresh startâ. The second was that business failure should be better understood, and the third was the promotion of preventive measures for businesses at risk.
Further to the second and third objectives, the Commission is currently developing, as part of the multiannual âStigma of Failure and Early Warning Instrumentsâ project, an information kit and self-assessment tests enabling entrepreneurs to recognise at an early stage, when the prospects of getting help are still good, the risk factors by which their business is affected.
On 28Â March 2006, the Commission staged a conference in Brussels on the subject of âInsolvency and a fresh startâ, which looked at the methods for preventing insolvencies, the ways whereby the stigma of business failure might be counteracted, and the encouragement of fresh starts following non-fraudulent business insolvencies.
There are positive signs of these priorities being acted on at national level, with the national reform programmes for 2005 in connection with the Lisbon Strategy presented by approximately one-third of the Member States â and I might add that Greece is among them â including plans for the reform of the Member States' bankruptcy laws.
Â Â  â Madam President, thank you very much for the full reply and for the details of the action being taken by the Commission and the Council.
I wanted to ask if the European Union's international obligations contribute towards the insolvency and sudden failure of businessmen.
Â Â  . As I have already said, we have, at European level, no power to deal with this matter, and so we cannot take action, whether through legislation or on the international stage.
The only thing we can do is, as I have explained to you, to ensure, by way of cooperation, coordination and the sharing of experience in the Member States, that better legal framework conditions can be created.
As I told you, there are some countries in which this has already happened, while others are still in the process of doing so, and in some of them the situation is still unsatisfactory.
What I can tell you today is that we will give particular attention to this issue during the preparation of the next annual report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, with particular reference to those countries whose insolvency laws still amount to an obstacle to growth and employment.
Â Â  I have to start by admiring the Commission's capacity to answer detailed and difficult questions on SMEs in Greece.
The best thing we can do as regards small and medium-sized enterprises is to liberalise markets and, in particular, to implement the four basic freedoms that already exist.
My question is can you please guarantee to us today that you will resist the pressure that we are under from many, especially German, trade unions to further water down the Services Directive, which was the subject of such a nice compromise between the Council, the Commission and European Parliament?
Â Â  Although I have to say that the connection between the honourable Memberâs question and the problem of insolvency law, which we are discussing, is not one I find easy to perceive, I am nevertheless able to answer it.
The Commission is quite firmly determined to do everything in its power to ensure that the services directive is adopted in the form on which a compromise has been reached with your House.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, when large firms go bankrupt, it is often the case that many small ones see their bills go unpaid.
Could you envisage the possibility, in such an eventuality, of the European Investment Fund â for a certain period of time at least â being able to guarantee payment or make available an equity replacement loan?
Â Â  I am sure you will understand that this question will have to be examined, for my answer to it would constitute a commitment on behalf of institutions for which I have no direct responsibility.
What I will say, in rather more general terms, is that I do indeed believe that the instruments available to us for ameliorating the consequences of sudden structural change can be used in such cases as well, and so I could certainly envisage creative financial instruments in individual cases, but they really would have to be examined on a caseâby-case basis.

Here too, the problem is that European legislation is not possible under the framework conditions existing at the present time.
Â Â  In a globalised world, the competitiveness of European industry is crucial to growth and employment.
The proposals put forward by the Commission for a modern industrial policy are specifically intended not only to make the fullest possible use of European industryâs potential for employment, but also to extend it still further.
There is, then, a quite direct connection between employment policy and industrial policy.
I am obliged to you for your question, since it gives me the opportunity to clarify that the industry policy to which I am committed â as also is the Commission â is not one that defends the interests of âshareholder valueâ; on the contrary, the object of this industry policy is to secure in the long term high-quality jobs in Europe.
The main goal of the policy I defend is to provide people with good-quality jobs, and enough of them.
Contrary to one point of view that was formerly to be heard in Europe, we are, today, more than ever convinced that this goal will not be achieved without a strong industrial base in Europe, that is to say, industry that is strong, high-performing and competitive.
I would also like to bring to your attention certain aspects of our policy that have to do quite specifically with the connection between industrial policy and employment policy.
One I would mention in particular is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has now â at the Commissionâs suggestion â been set up, the funds allocated to which are primarily intended to help workers affected by rapid structural changes to gain further qualifications or find new jobs.
I would point out to you that the Commission is currently working on a policy intended to remedy the skills shortages in Europe, improving the content of jobs and improving employment opportunities in numerous sectors, specifically in information and communications technology, machine-building, the textile and leather industry and various areas of raw materials production and manufacturing industry.
The European Union is also helping to improve the functioning of working relationships and is strongly supportive of corporate social responsibility.
Your question also provides me with an opportunity to say to European businesses that the achievement of high profits can never be a businessâ sole objective, for a European business always has a social function to fulfil; it has a responsibility to society, and that responsibility primarily has to do with the jobs it provides.
As you can see, considering our industrial policy in complete isolation from employment policy would be a quite artificial distinction to draw.
It can, perhaps, be summed up in a single sentence. Modern industrial policy in Europe is a quite essential and indispensable contribution to the improvement of employment opportunities.
Â Â  .
I can do no more than tell the honourable Member that he and I are in complete agreement; that is precisely what the Commission is trying to do, and his question makes it clear to me that there is a need for more information and better communication.
It seems to me that perhaps not everyone in Europe is as yet aware of what the essential substance of our strategy is, so I will repeat that the fundamental strategy that this Commission is pursuing is a strategy for growth and employment.
That is what it is primarily about; that is what it is primarily intended to do.
Alongside the many other means at our disposal, industrial policy is one of the instruments we use to achieve the goal of growth and employment.
Â Â  I very much welcome the Commissioner's responses, but can I also ask whether he would agree that more flexibility, particularly within the review of the working time directive, would be good for employment as well as competitiveness, and would he give a personal lead in promoting this?
Â Â  .
You will be aware that I have no leading role, and that I in no way wish to trespass on my fellow-Commissionersâ provinces, just as they do not interfere in matters within my remit, and so I will say, by way of reply, and with all due caution, that reference is made, in all the Commission documents on the subject of the need for reforms in Europe, to the fact that â in some sectors and in some Member States, at any rate â labour markets are too rigid, too lacking in flexibility, and that more flexibility in the labour markets â albeit always described very precisely in each instance â would indeed bear fruit in the shape of greater entrepreneurial initiative, more willingness to take risks, and, ultimately, to more jobs.
In principle, then, I can answer your question in the affirmative; more flexible labour markets are, in the twenty-first century, a necessary part of the response to the structural problems that we have.
Â Â  We could have an extremely interesting debate on this, but my answer is a clear ânoâ.
You may be surprised that I am able to give such a clear answer.
It is a fundamental error to think that it is possible to pursue a policy that favours the services sector over the manufacturing sector.
In reality, the services sector cannot be developed at all without strong industry â a strong manufacturing industry â to purchase its services.
If we look at the economic reality in Member States with a particularly high proportion of service industries, we see that many of the activities of the services sector have been contracted out by industry, but are exactly the same in substance as before.
Our argument, therefore, is that, without a strong, efficient industrial basis, it will not be possible to carry out the expansion of the services sector that would be necessary to solve the employment problem by this means alone.
I think that we need to look at these two as being closely interlinked.
Â Â  I have to admit, MadamÂ President, that my problem with this question is that the sheer volume of the Commissionâs recent activities and initiatives on this issue is such that I would need a very long time to relate everything we are doing at present.
I shall give a summary, therefore, which will also help the President save time.
Cutting red tape and reducing administrative costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, including by improving the quality of our legislation, is one of this Commissionâs major political projects.
That is what this Commission stands for.
We have brought about a real paradigm shift.
We are currently undertaking a systematic screening of the whole body of European legislation â and by this I mean really law by law, provision by provision â to see whether it can be simplified, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, and whether it contains requirements that put obstacles in their way.
As the House knows, the Commission has put SME policy in its rightful place at the heart of our economic thinking, as it is they, rather than large enterprises, that are the decisive force in Europe, and what they need is to be given more freedom and more responsibility for their own affairs.
They need an environment in which they can develop.
We firmly believe that the âBureaucracy reduction and better lawmakingâ project is a cross-cutting task for the whole of the Commission, a task that involves all the Directorates-General, and will make a vital contribution to strengthening the role of SMEs and encouraging more people in Europe to start up their own business, to take a risk themselves, and thereby provide jobs for others.
MadamÂ President, in the interests of time, I would perhaps suggest I provide the honourable Member with the full version of my answer, which details all these initiatives, and I am also willing to provide any further information required.
Â Â  I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply, and even though he said it would take him longer to put all the measures together, I am still encouraged by his response.
Commissioner, is it not a fact that the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda are far from being attained, and that we are still lagging behind in measures necessary for the coordination and progress of SMEs under those objectives of the Lisbon Agenda that we initially laid down?
Â Â  I would not now put it as strongly as that.
Last year, I would have said just the same as the honourable Member.
In the meanwhile, however, as he is aware, the Lisbon Strategy â the strategy for growth and jobs I have just spoken about â that was decided on last spring has been undergoing a complete revision.
Without wanting to anticipate the report the Commission is due to present at the end of this year, I believe I can say one thing, which is that positive effects are indeed starting to emerge.
They can be seen in the policies of Member States, and even in the European economy.
I do not know if the honourable Members had the same feeling as I did when reading the newspaper today, but for the first time in a long time we read that production growth in Europe and economic growth in general has overtaken that of Japan and the USA.
We are now, once more, growing faster than our American and Japanese competitors.
That means that the gap is beginning to close, and I hope that this trend will continue.
It is just an initial indicator, but it gives me hope and shows me that we are on the right track.
Â Â  Commissioner, without seeking to be unkind, is it not fair to say that the Commissionâs record on cutting red tape has been very high on promise, but very low on delivery?
Indeed it is not without significance that though you promise us a recital in written form of some examples, you have not been able today in your substantive answer to give a single example of realistic cutting of red tape.
The experience in my constituency is that businesses see no sign of it.
They find themselves more and more burdened in circumstances where it is seriously impeding their competitiveness.
Â Â  I regret that I have to contradict the honourable Member, as the exact opposite is true.
In the relatively short time since the launch of this initiative, we have achieved more than I had ever imagined.
Firstly, as the honourable Member is aware, we have withdrawn one-third of all pending legislation without replacement as an initial step.
Secondly, we have transformed legislative methods and introduced the compulsory complete impact assessment, which in itself brings a considerable improvement in the quality of ongoing legislation.
Honourable Members will notice this here in Parliament when they discuss the proposals presented by the Commission.
Thirdly, the simplification programme is in full swing.
I am sorry to say that the Commission has been making rather faster progress on this than the other institutions.
I always welcome criticism, but this criticism would be easier to bear if the speed of the decision-making by the Council and Parliament on the simplification proposals the Commission has already presented to the other institutions matched the speed at which the Commission presented them.
Â Â  Would the Commissioner accept that his warm words on small and medium-sized enterprises would have more credibility if our own research funds did not discriminate against small companies?
I know of a case of two companies â one large and one small â in the same programme, where the large company is audited at the end of the programme and receives its grants in advance, whereas the small company has to have an annual audit, at its own expense, and receives its money in arrears.
Does the Commissioner not accept that this is a reversal of what the priorities should be?
Â Â  I cannot answer this question without knowledge of the specific case.
I would ask the honourable Member to give the relevant documentation either to me or to whichever of my fellow-Commissioners is responsible â of course, I do not know the field of competence in which this is supposed to have occurred â and then the case will be examined.
At all events, there is no Commission policy of favouring large enterprises over smaller ones.
The exact opposite is true.
The requirements to be met by small and medium-sized enterprises when bidding for contracts and projects are significantly less exacting than those for large enterprises.
SMEs can also receive a higher percentage of support than large enterprises.
I am surprised by the practical example the honourable Member has given.
It cannot be the rule â it must be an isolated case â and I would be happy to look into it.
I would ask him to provide us with the relevant information.
Â Â  Question 45 will be answered in writing.
Since Maltaâs accession to the EU in 2004, thousands of European citizens have been outraged by the decision of the Maltese Government to allow hunting in spring.
MEPs have since been pushing the Commission to ban spring hunting in Malta, the derogation being incompatible with the EU Birds Directive (79/409/CEE(1)).
In its answer to question E-1318/06 in June 2006 the Commission stated that it had severe doubts about the Maltese claim that the hunting opportunities in autumn were minimal and that therefore spring derogation was justifiable.
However, the Commission urged the Maltese authorities to present additional statistics to justify their claim.
Could the Commission tell us if it has received any (satisfying) additional figures so far and, if not, when finally the Commission is expecting to make a decision on the compatibility of the spring hunting derogation in Malta in order to open and shut the case file?
Â Â  The Birds Directive generally bans spring hunting.
It only allows it when certain preconditions apply, the main one of which is that there are no satisfactory alternatives.
Until now, certain Member States which requested this sort of derogation were unable to prove that there were no satisfactory alternatives to hunting, for example in the autumn period.
The reason why hunting is banned in the spring period is because wild birds are migrating to their reproduction sites.
They are birds that have survived the winter and numerous other hardships and are going to the sites where they reproduce.
Consequently, there is a basic reason not to allow hunting of wild birds during this period.
More importantly, as far as Malta is concerned, we asked for information on birds hunted during the 2004 period from the Maltese Government as far back as the autumn of 2004.
The Maltese authorities have sent us the relevant data for the 2004 spring hunting period.
We concluded from these data, which the Commission evaluated carefully in order to investigate if the grounds for a derogation really stood up, in other words that there was no satisfactory alternative hunting during other periods, that such preconditions applied.
As a result, given that during the autumn period there is a significant number of quail and turtle doves which is not very different from the number of birds hunted during the spring period and taking account of the judgments of the European Court of Justice, we concluded that there is a satisfactory alternative and that the derogation is not therefore permissible.
Having established this, the Commission started legal proceedings against Malta in July 2006 for infringement of the Birds Directive on the grounds that it had permitted spring hunting of these two species.
I must say that similar infringement proceedings have also been set in motion against other Member States on the basis of the desired derogation for which the necessary preconditions are not met and that judgments have been returned, for example against Spain and Finland recently, on precisely these grounds.
Â Â  â Madam President, the question I would like to ask following the Commissionerâs answer is whether or not he considers it a crass error to take a decision of this nature solely on the basis of statistics gathered by the hunters.
Would it not be better for the Commission to adopt a perspective that takes closer account of the reality of the situation, bearing in mind what the Maltese press and the birdwatching community have said?
Â Â  . I know that there is doubt about the data submitted to us by the Maltese authorities, but even with these data, we have concluded that there is no reason for a derogation from the ban on spring hunting and we have started infringement procedures against Malta.
What more can we do?
We want to show everybody that we are very serious about applying and enforcing the Birds Directive, which includes that provision.
Otherwise, if we give different signals, many other countries would think that we have watered down the provisions of the Birds Directive and might also ask for a derogation.
So we have started the infringement procedures and we shall see whether the Maltese authorities will comply and ban hunting during the spring period.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we are now talking about 2004, but I read in the Maltese press that in the spring of 2005 and 2006, quite a few migratory birds were hunted, and a number of them shot down.
Can you inform me whether the Maltese authorities have already sent the Commission an exemption report on this 2005 spring hunting, and what their duties are in this respect?
I think that this should have been done by June of this year.
Has it been?
If so, could you give us an idea of its content, and what the reasons are for this exemption?
If not, when do you expect this report?
Â Â  . There will be a meeting between the Maltese authorities and representatives of DG Environment this month.
The various issues will be discussed, including that of the Maltese continuing to allow hunting of turtle doves and quails during the spring period.
Ways of ensuring compliance with the Birds Directive will be looked at.
As to the report and the figures for 2005, they are due by the end of this year.
Â Â  As the following questions deal with the same subject, they will be taken together.
In October last year, the Commission initiated an EU ban on the import of wild caught birds. This decision was made on human health grounds.
This trade should also be banned on the grounds that it is largely unsustainable, causing crashes in the populations of many birds in the wild.
The EU imports an estimated two million birds each year.
The Commission should therefore be congratulated for helping to save over one million birds since October.
When questioned about the conservation impact of this trade, Commissioner Dimas assured environment ministers in December 2005 that the Commission would review the impact of this trade on conservation grounds.
The Commission appears not to have initiated such a study.
Can the Commission explain why this has not been started, and when the Commission intends to honour its pledge?
Will the Commission conduct a thorough study on the effect of the temporary ban on wild bird imports, with data from all Member States?
Illegal trade is difficult to measure, but it has been estimated that huge numbers of protected wild-caught birds are involved, and the argument that a total ban on the import of wild birds would drive the trade underground and cause an increase in illegally imported birds has been widely used by those who oppose a trade ban.
However, preliminary analysis of data collected since October 2005 (when the temporary ban was established) published in a new RSPCA/Eurogroup for Animal Welfare report, shows that in fact the illegal trade has reduced, and that the fears are not justified.
Â Â  I shall try to answer the two related questions relating both to the study and to the ban on birds and the data provided by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
As far as veterinary and hygiene rules are concerned, the Commission took swift and effective preventive measures in October 2005 based on the existing framework of veterinary legislation.
We had granted an extension to the import ban for all birds up to 31Â May 2006; we granted a new extension up to 31Â December 2006 and, due to developments in the issue of the spread of bird 'flu, there will most probably be a new extension.
The Commission also asked the European Food Safety Authority for an expert opinion on questions of the health and survival conditions of the animals which concern the importation of birds other than poultry.
This expert opinion is expected in October 2006.
As regards the protection of biodiversity and wild birds, the Commission, following the Council last December, commissioned a study in January 2006 to examine the efficacy of Community regulations on the trade in wild species of flora and fauna.
The basic framework for taking protective and trade measures is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species or CITES, which has been transposed into the law of the European Union in the regulations on trading in species of wild flora and fauna.
For the time being, these regulations permit imports, provided that they do not endanger the regime for protecting species.
The competent scientific committee of the European Union with which all the scientific authorities of the Member States of the European Union cooperate is responsible for examining imports of wild species of flora and fauna.
That is where the necessary measures are taken relating to imports of species when a problem is identified; this does not only cover birds but relates to all species.
The study we have commissioned will cover from a broad perspective the issue of the efficacy of these regulations for the protection of species of wild flora and fauna, with the emphasis on wild birds.
The results of the study in question are expected to be available by the middle of 2007.
Account will, of course, be taken during the preparation of this study of the conclusions of the report published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the European Group for the Animal Survival Conventions.
Â Â  Thank you for that reply, Commissioner.
I am glad that the study has at least started, despite the fact that we are having to wait until mid-2007, when it was first requested in December 2005.
That seems to be quite a long way away, but let us hope it is worth the wait.
Could you explain why the EU continues to import birds when countries such as the United States, for example, consider that those same birds are not sustainably harvested?
Since 1992 the US has imposed a moratorium on all CITES-listed birds unless it can be scientifically proven that they are harvested in a sustainable way.
Since 1992 not a single one has been proved to be sustainably harvested.
Many developing countries also have bans on the export of those birds. So how is it that the United States has such a different assessment from the EU as to whether or not they are being sustainably harvested?
Â Â  . Firstly, I can tell you that the United States has not signed the Biodiversity Convention.
It has different rules; it has a general ban but it also has exemptions.
We have more or less the same result by having species considered separately.
However, the results are more or less the same because the United States has a lot of illegal trade and we also have illegal trade.
The Commission will look at what the United States is doing and what the results are.
While the United States bans all imports, we have to look at it and see whether, firstly, this general ban will increase the illegal trade.
We do not know.
The study shows that perhaps we have less illegal trade, but we do not know what will happen in the future.
If we introduce a permanent ban for birds we will have to consider how and why they are treated differently from all other species, like corals and reptiles, because we have a comprehensive policy.
The United States has a different approach to this.
We would also like to consider whether an unlimited trade ban by the United States could be challenged by exporting countries, for example within the framework of the World Trade Organization. This might also challenge and undermine our existing sophisticated restrictive measures which make it possible for the European Union to take temporary measures on a consultation basis with the exporting countries.
But still, we will look at a ban with derogations in our study.
Â Â  Whatever the United States may do by way of exemptions, we have a temporary ban which has been shown to work in terms of reducing the illegal trade, but we do not have a permanent ban, and it is we in Europe who are the major importers of wild birds, at 93% - going on for a million a year until 2003.
Between 40 and 70% of those birds die before they are exported and many more die en route to Europe.
Surely it is time that we made our ban permanent and then led the world and set an example for countries like the United States and Australia?
Â Â  . This study has shown that the recent confiscations have decreased after we had the ban for health reasons.
It is difficult to measure exact numbers of illegally-traded animals, since these, by definition, are not known.
The amount of seized and confiscated birds in the European Union may have recently decreased because of the current temporary ban on all imports.
No birds are offered for any import procedures since they would automatically and immediately be refused.
Of particular concern is that birds are still being traded illegally and seized in Member States.
They are imported and introduced without any veterinary controls.
Again, we shall see what the study tells us and whether a ban with derogations would be a better solution than the current system, which is a case-by-case examination of species.
We permit the importation of only those birds that are not in danger of extinction.
Â Â  The Commissioner mentioned that he was concerned about birds threatened with extinction.
He will be aware, however, that I and one of my constituents have written to him several times about the case of a legitimate and legal importer of birds from the United States, legally taken in the United States, who is being put out of business because of this ban â which is a ban for health reasons, for chickens, and which is not relevant to these particular wild birds in the United States.
They are legal, legitimate and do not pose health risks.
Why is the Commissioner imposing this draconian measure on small businesses in Europe?
Â Â  . That is a question for my colleague, Mr Kyprianou.
However, the obvious answer is avian flu and the ban which we have implemented for health reasons.
That ban is a temporary one.
It has to be extended until the end of December, and will perhaps be extended into next year, depending on developments in avian flu.
In this particular case the United States is following a different policy, though the result is perhaps the same.
They have a ban with derogations, while we may permit imports, but on a case-by-case basis.
Â Â  I wonder, Commissioner, whether you have ever considered the possibility of reversing the burden of proof.
My question is that our current system for regulating the wild bird trade requires proof that it is harmful to wild populations before it can be suspended.
Why can we not establish the sustainability of a wild bird or a species before trade begins?
In fact, that should apply to all species, not just birds.
Also, the EU prohibits trade in its own wild birds under the Birds and Habitats directives.
At the same time, we continue to adopt a cavalier approach towards the biodiversity of less developed countries through this trade, even though there is a ban for the moment.
Is that an acceptable way to continue?
Â Â  . World conservation of certain bird species is affected by international trade.
Such species could be proposed for listing under the CITES Convention, depending on the appendices.
Trade for commercial purposes is then prohibited or regulated by a permit and monitoring system.
There is a certain way of deciding this under the CITES provisions.
Species are only listed if specific conservation and trade criteria are fulfilled.
Where these criteria are fulfilled, the Commission would support such listing. Any such listing is subject to a vote in CITES and the necessary majority might not always be attainable.
We should remember that we must act in compliance with the law and meet our obligations under the CITES Convention and we cannot do otherwise if a vote is taken.
Exporting countries are also involved and if we do not act in accordance with the law for a certain species, we may encounter problems for other species, such as reptiles or corals or other animals.
Â Â  I think that the answer is very straightforward.
I could perhaps say in one sentence that the Commission has sent a warning letter as regards the presumed incorrect application by the Spanish authorities of the amended directive on the impact of public and private works on the environment in the case of the project to construct the M30 orbital road in Madrid.
This letter was sent by the Commission on 10Â April 2006, in accordance with ArticleÂ 226 of the Treaty, and Spain replied on 13Â July 2006.
We are currently evaluating the reply given by the Spanish authorities and will shortly be completing this evaluation.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, in view of the response issued by the competent Spanish authorities, I hope that the European Commission will make a quick decision.
I would like to say the following: the Commissionâs letter of notice made it very clear that, in the Commissionâs view, the content of Directive 85/337, which makes environmental impact studies for this type of public work essential, had not been respected.
Since it had not been respected by those carrying out that public work, the legitimate rights and interests of the citizens of Madrid, that is to say, the European citizens of Madrid, were being harmed.
Nevertheless, the is continuing with this work day and night despite the European Commissionâs warning.
In view of the letter of reply, it is therefore essential that that decision be immediate because, otherwise, rights will be violated almost irreversibly; that is what we must try to avoid.
Â Â  . I shall be as brief as possible.
I would like to say that the Commission opened this investigation after you asked a question on the issue.
The dimension and complexity of the project is such that it required several exchanges of information between the Commission and the Spanish authorities in order to gather all the factual and legal information needed for the Commission to properly and duly investigate the case.
We will now perhaps need to obtain more information regarding the opening of the procedures.
We came to the conclusion that the M-30 ring road project was not subject to a proper impact assessment pursuant to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, in particular with regard to some of the subprojects into which the M-30 ring road project is divided.
There has also been a failure to produce an assessment of the cumulative effects of those projects.
That is the main problem.
The project was split into 19 subprojects.
For some subprojects there are impact assessments, but not for all, and there is no overall impact assessment for the whole project.
That is what we consider to be a breach of the directive.
Â Â  Questions NosÂ 50 and 51 will be answered in writing.
Questions NosÂ 52 and 53 will not be taken, as the subjects concerned are already on the agenda of this part-session.
Questions NosÂ 54 to 58 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  .
On 20 June 2006, I had an exchange of views with the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I shared with that committee the Commissionâs concerns regarding the lack of momentum as regards political reforms in Turkey for the moment concerning, for instance, the issue raised by Mr Posselt.
The Commission had hoped that the opening of accession negotiations would give a more tangible impetus to the reform process.
As regards the difficulties faced by non-Muslim and Muslim religious minorities, there is clearly a lack of progress so far.
In practice, non-Muslim religious communities continue to encounter significant problems: they lack a legal personality, face restricted property rights and interference in the management of their foundations, and are not allowed to train clergy.
The Commission would also mention that the Alevi community experiences difficulties in terms of recognition of places of worship, representation in relevant state bodies as well as in compulsory religious education.
Moreover, the draft law on Foundations, currently pending in the Turkish Parliament â and for too long â would only address some of these difficulties, namely the property regime for some of the communities, although not all of them.
The Commission has repeatedly urged the Turkish authorities and the Turkish Grand National Assembly to amend the draft law on Foundations to bring it into line with relevant European standards.
Â Â  â I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his good answer.
I should just like to ask again, in specific terms, whether Turkey has given him an answer, and whether it has had anything to say about what time frame it has in mind for the adoption of appropriate legal provisions.
Or have these been put on hold until after the Turkish elections, or even shelved completely?
Â Â  . We have discussed this matter, in terms of procedure.
For instance, almost a year ago when I was in Turkey after the opening of the accession negotiations on 3 October 2005, we had an in-depth exchange of views on the matter with the relevant committee of the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
Since then, we have raised this issue at various points, including in the context of the Association Council this spring.
In our view, and according to the Turkish authorities, this should be part of the so-called ninth reform package which is still pending as a whole and which should be adopted without any undue delay by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and, in part, by the Turkish Government.
This is certainly a critical precondition for accession to the European Union and we have made it very clear that Turkey cannot join the European Union without respecting this very fundamental principle.
Â Â  â Does the Commissioner think it would be possible to use the European Monitoring Centre in Vienna as a base for undertaking regular monitoring of the situation of religious minorities and commissioning studies on the subject?
Â Â  . Mr RÃŒbig has come up with a very interesting idea.
We are using all the data and analysis provided by agencies such as the one he mentioned in Vienna.
We are also using data from different human rights organisations.
I will look into this matter but, as I understand it, we are already using analysis provided by that agency.
We use a lot of analysis and data provided by bodies such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE, as well as agencies and other think-tanks.
Â Â  â Commissioner, we all know that the Halki Seminary was closed several years ago.
Have you done anything in this direction for the Halki Seminary to reopen?
There is a danger that the Patriarch's ecumenical seat will have noÂ one available in future for the election of the next Patriarch.
Do you have anything in mind that you can tell us?
Â Â  . The freedom of religion and worship is another key issue and we have raised it a number of times with the Turkish Government.
We expect to see not only reflection but also concrete action in order to open the Halki seminary, which is very important for this particular religious community.
Â Â  . As regards the steps taken by the Commission with the aim of facilitating the reunification of the Island and thereby ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community, the following major activities can be reported.
First, the Commission has started to implement the Council regulation that establishes an instrument of financial assistance for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community.
That was adopted during the Austrian Presidency, on 27Â February 2006.
Our programme team responsible for the implementation of the regulation should be operational as of this month.
It will use an EU programme support office in the northern part of Nicosia.
The first projects envisaged for implementation encompass, inter alia, actions in the field of solid waste, energy, local infrastructure, business support and other very concrete measures.
Within this framework, the Commission is also implementing an institution-building programme through the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Instrument (TAIEX), in order to help prepare the Turkish Cypriot community for the future application of the in that part of the island.
The proposed Direct Trade Regulation submitted by the Commission to the Council in July 2004 â over two years ago â is still before the Council.
The Commission supports efforts of the Finnish Presidency to secure a speedy adoption of this trade regulation in order to fulfil the EUâs commitment of April 2004.
We have no intention of withdrawing the proposal and submitting a revised version.
We have been and remain ready to accept and facilitate any accompanying measures that would support reunification and economic development and that are acceptable to both communities and all parties, in order to overcome the very unfortunate current stalemate.
It is a badly-kept secret that the accompanying measures have largely centred on the question of the Port of Famagusta.
In reply to the question by Mr Matsis, the return of Varosha has been linked in the past to the UN-led talks on a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Therefore it is up to the parties involved to decide whether to keep this issue within the framework of the comprehensive settlement or to discuss it separately or to find a way to include it in both concepts.
Where there is a will there is a way.
We now expect both communities to approach the matter by focusing less on past injustice and more on future solutions.
We expect a constructive spirit from all parties.
It is high time to end the division and reunify Cyprus.
Â Â  Last night Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a critical report which notably urges Turkey to âtake concrete steps for the normalisation of bilateral relations with EU Member Cyprusâ.
The report warns that a lack of progress âwill have serious implications for the negotiation process and could even bring it to a haltâ.
What is the Commissionerâs view of this report and the likelihood that a lack of progress could halt talks?
Does the Commissioner agree that as far as the European Parliament is concerned there are still some harmful prejudices about Turkey with Turkophobes willing to seize upon any pretext to block the accession process?
Â Â  . I have been briefed on the results of the vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee on the Eurlings Report on Turkey.
I will comment on that report in the context of the debate at the next plenary session. I will do so when I am fully prepared and have studied it line-by-line and paragraph-by-paragraph.
It is clear that a possible failure by Turkey to meet its obligations as regards the implementation of the additional protocol to the Ankara Agreement would have consequences for the overall negotiation process.
That is almost word-by-word what the Council and Member States decided in September 2005, in the well-known EU declaration of the time prior to the opening of accession negotiations.
Our aim is to avoid a possible train crash because it is in no oneâs interests for EU-Turkey relations to be seriously damaged.
The best way of avoiding that is for Turkey to meet the obligations it entered into before we opened the accession negotiations.
Â Â  I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware that since the opening of the passages from the North to the South in Cyprus, the per capita income of the Turkish Cypriot community has almost tripled due to the contacts with the South despite their purported isolation.
Â Â  . Thank you for providing us with those detailed observations concerning economic growth in the Turkish Cypriot community.
I am glad if the Green Line Regulation and the facilities it opens up for intra-island trade are improving the economic situation of the Turkish Cypriot community.
We want to improve the working of the Green Line Regulation.
At the same time we are working very hard to unblock the situation concerning direct trade and to get all parties committed to resuming negotiations on the comprehensive settlement to reunify Cyprus.
Â Â  Commissioner, you spoke a moment ago of the stalemate in this situation.
I tend to agree and perhaps there are also certain parallels with the position between Transnistria and Moldova, which we touched on yesterday in Parliament.
I visited North Cyprus recently for the first time and found it enlightening to say the least.
Notwithstanding all the other issues, but bearing in mind the fact that the people of the North of Cyprus voted for membership of the EU, could the EU not, at the very least, see its way forward to allowing direct flights to Northern Cyprus?
Â Â  . Thank you for your question, Mr Evans.
Our view on how to end the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot communities is very clear: we want to execute the financial assistance programme now and we want to facilitate a solution for direct trade, possibly with accompanying measures.
At the same time, we trust that this will create confidence so that at some point â hopefully soon â we can resume talks, under the UN umbrella, on a comprehensive settlement leading to the reunification of Cyprus.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  â The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Thierry Cornillet, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the counterfeiting of medicinal products (O-0039/2006 â B60310/2006).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares the great concerns that MrÂ Cornillet has just expressed, and I have come to the same conclusion about the profoundly criminal nature of this counterfeiting.
The question rightly mentions three problem areas.
The first is the fight against counterfeit medicines within the European Union.
The Commission is taking action on this at two levels.
First of all, we have of course reinforced legal protection.
In 2004, new legislation was adopted on the protection of intellectual property, and 2003 and 2004 saw the adoption of new legislation on customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights.
Discussions are currently being held on two proposals on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights.
A recent study in the Community revealed that, within the European Union in the last five years, 27Â counterfeit medicines have turned up in legal distribution channels and 170 in illegal distribution channels.
On the basis of these findings, the Member States are currently developing measures to combat this counterfeiting.
For its part, the Commission, together with the Member States, the European Medicines Agency and international partners, is investigating what measures will be necessary in future to protect public health.
The issues being considered in this regard include the enforcement of existing legislation, cooperation between the various authorities, and also communication and awareness-raising.
Nor do I exclude the possibility that the existing legislation will have to be further developed, and that we shall have to consider amending it.
More effective customs controls are an important instrument for curbing the trade in counterfeit medicines.
I am pleased to say that the quantity of counterfeit medicines seized by customs is already increasing.
The Commission communication on a customs response to latest trends in counterfeiting and piracy that was issued recently addresses the problem of counterfeit medicines, and recommends specific measures to combat this growing threat.
In the experience of the customs authorities, a large proportion of the counterfeits are transported through the EU and are often destined for developing countries.
The fight against imported counterfeits is particularly difficult in that they often enter the EU in small quantities, and customs authorities have to detect the illegal goods in a very large number of small consignments.
The Commission encourages right holders to take full advantage of the protection afforded by Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1383/2003.
On their application for action by customs, right holders supply the information the customs authorities need in order to perform a targeted search for the highest-risk consignments.
The second area concerns the issue of what we are doing for the poorer countries, which are actually the main victims of these counterfeit medicines.
What are we doing to help them regulate and monitor the quality of medicines in their own territory?
As a matter of principle, we of course endeavour to work at multilateral level.
The Commission therefore supports the initiatives of the World Health Organization to combat counterfeit medicines.
The WHO Conference held in Rome in FebruaryÂ 2006 created a platform for specific action.
Accordingly, the Commission supports the launching of a WHO taskforce to combat counterfeit medicines at international level.
The results of the work of this taskforce will benefit all WHO members, including developing countries.
The Commission will play an active part in this taskforce and provide the necessary information.
In addition, the Commission is carrying out projects supported by the European Development Fund, particularly the EC-WHO partnership on pharmaceutical policies.
This partnership is intended to enable ACP countries to render more effective their legislation and quality assurance systems for medicines, and to improve aspects such as their controls, their action against substandard or counterfeit medicines and their information management.
EURÂ 2.3Â million have been provided for this.
The third issue is the idea of an international convention against counterfeit medicines.
The idea of such a convention was discussed in detail in the course of preparations for the FebruaryÂ 2006 WHO Conference and at the conference itself.
Most participants, including the Commission, were of the opinion that an international convention is not, at present, the most effective means of combating the growing threat from counterfeit medicines.
The taskforce set up at the conference is in a better position to gather and pass on information and work out the urgently needed solutions.
Finally, may I reassure the House that the Commission shares Parliamentâs concerns and is prepared to take up suggestions and take further initiatives.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too should like to express my concern about the problems surrounding counterfeit medicines.
Counterfeit medicines are manufactured and traded illegally without any form of supervision.
Their effects cannot be checked, which makes them a potential risk to public health, and so this piracy should be stopped.
MrÂ Cornillet already broached the subject, the Commissioner mentioned it as well and I welcome every measure the Commission takes to tackle this problem.
Since problems mainly occur in the developing countries, the poor countries, that is also where I can foresee the biggest problems when it comes to dealing with this piracy efficiently and adequately.
In those countries, the supply of reliable, legal medicines is often not organised as well as it is in Europe.
That is why traders in counterfeit medicines have relatively more scope to sell their medicines, the effect of which cannot be checked and can, consequently, even be harmful to public health.
In addition, developing countries often lack an adequate legal framework.
Their laws are simply not adequate to the task of addressing this problem effectively.
Even when these are in place, monitoring leaves a great deal to be desired.
In developing countries, there is a need for affordable, effective and, of course, legal medicines, and that is why I should like to mention the scope which generic medicines offer.
They cannot make the problem go away, but can go some way towards alleviating the need that exists.
Unfortunately, little use is being made of them at the moment.
More could be done perhaps in that area.
The Commissioner claimed that an international convention or standard is not enough, but I can well imagine that one could make a difference, and if it proves inadequate, then more should be done.
I take the view that a clear and universal approach is extremely important.
Europe will need to do its bit, and that also involves the transfer of knowledge, in order to address the fight against counterfeit medicines more effectively.
I would like to know â and the Commissioner has already partly answered in his explanation â what the new plans are for tackling counterfeit medicines and the organisation in this respect, particularly where criminal activity is concerned, in future.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to start by expressing my gratitude to MrÂ Cornillet, whose initiative we have to thank for the fact that we are discussing this important issue today and shall be adopting a resolution on it tomorrow.
At the start of his speech, he gave the World Health Organizationâs definition of what is to be understood by counterfeiting of medicines.
I think that this is very important, as the discussion of this issue could easily become sidetracked, with many of us believing it was about saying âyesâ or ânoâ to generic medicines.
By giving this definition and through his stance, he made it clear that counterfeiting can affect both patented and generic medicines.
As has also been said already, in developed countries it is predominantly so-called lifestyle drugs that are counterfeited, and no doubt we all have our own tales of deleting thousands of spam e-mails offering medicines at low to very low prices.
In developing countries, medicines intended to treat diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/Aids are being counterfeited.
Sometimes counterfeit medicines for simple illnesses such as coughs can even cause umpteen deaths, as they have had toxic chemicals added that are normally used in products such as antifreeze.
According to the World Health Organization, 30Â people died in Cambodia inÂ 1999 after taking counterfeit malaria medicines.
There is a whole list of tragic cases such as these and, in addition, there are probably many cases going unreported, as it is not possible to compile statistics on the problem of these criminal activities.
This problem affects all regions of the world, but developing countries of course bear the brunt of the damage.
Once again, the reasons are poverty and lack of access to health services.
When people cannot afford the medicines they need, they will try to obtain them unofficially at lower prices.
For this reason, it is impossible to combat this phenomenon properly without effective health services or affordable medicines.
The measures to enhance intellectual property rights are good and are suitable as part of the strategy, but do not tackle the problem at its roots.
It is important â and I should also like to thank CommissionerÂ Verheugen for stating this so resolutely and specifically â that we assist the countries concerned in building their capacities for producing safe medicines in, and importing safe medicines into, their own countries.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I too should like to thank my colleague, MrÂ Cornillet, for having opened this crucial debate.
We are all of one mind in saying that pirate medicines â and I am in complete agreement with what MrÂ Cornillet has stated â are a scourge that kills, above all, of course, in the least developed countries.
Unfortunately, this potentially lethal counterfeiting is not widely known about and, in the majority of cases, goes almost unremarked.
We are a long way here from the spectacular legal actions â recipients of much media attention â that have been brought by the manufacturers of luxury products and that, in a number of cases, have also been transferred to higher courts â actions that, it has also to be noted, have not met with much success.
When it comes to antibiotics, the Pill, steroids, powdered milk for babies, anti-malaria drugs â which have already been talked about â vaccines â a counterfeit Tamiflu, for example â and Viagra too, the counterfeit medicines industry is quite amoral in the way it copies everything, since this is done without the consumerâs knowledge.
MrÂ Cornillet quoted a whole range of revealing figures.
I noted the EURÂ 25Â billion per year represented by this traffic.
Worldwide, one antibiotic in three and one medicine in ten are counterfeit.
Over and above the damage to the economy obviously represented by these figures, the big issue here is the disastrous impact of this counterfeiting in terms of health.
At best, these counterfeit medicines are ineffective. At worst â as I said â they kill, especially when it is a question of medicines used in the case of mortal diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis or AIDS.
In China alone, the hub and empire of counterfeiting of every kind, 200Â 000 people were dying each year after having been treated with pirated medicines, including in a number of hospitals administered by the Chinese Red Cross.
So much for the observations that can be made.
As for the causes, these are known, at least in part.
MrÂ Cornillet referred to them at length: the absence, still scarcely remedied, of any real will on the part of national governments to combat this scourge; the absence, too, in many countries of legislation that might genuinely act as a deterrent; the ridiculously low cost of these counterfeit medicines; and, above all, the poverty to be found in the countries concerned and the fact that the most vulnerable population groups, which are crying out for accessible medicines, find it impossible to gain access to health systems.
In a debate such as this, no one claims to have the solution, or at least a ready-made one, but a responsible policy needs to be proposed, given the urgency of the situation.
In April, while denouncing all forms of counterfeiting before this Assembly, CommissionerÂ Frattini took a tougher stance in terms of sanctions against Europeans and developing countries.
The European Union must take the lead and, in close cooperation with the WHO, put a global strategy in place to combat this scourge effectively.
Certainly, judicial and police coordination needs to be set up and sanctions put in place, but people also need to be informed and, above all, warned.
Today, the difficulty consists in making essential high quality medicines available to the whole populations in the countries concerned.
Â Â  . Commissioner, the counterfeiting of medicines is, indeed, a particularly serious scourge and one that, unfortunately, is not new and that has even been known about for several years.
It might therefore be hoped that our fellow Memberâs timely question will finally lead to some results.
That being said, the main motive for counterfeiting medicines has to do with the fact that they are much too highly priced for poor countries and their populations.
The first tactic should therefore consist in ensuring that poor countries and the most impoverished populations have access to generic medicines. This is something that my fellow Member has spoken about.
Generic medicines still do not have a significant enough place on the medicines market.
Furthermore, I would not want the fight against counterfeiting to consist in reinforcing the protection of patents in the pharmaceutical sphere and so protecting the future development of the already considerable profits made by the pharmaceutical industry in many sectors.
The priority is, therefore, to encourage the development of public health policies in the countries concerned, as well as to encourage the establishment of states governed by the rule of law.
That is indeed the priority. Nothing is possible unless viable states and public health policies are established enabling, in particular, medicines to be monitored and pharmacies to be set up in accordance with properly laid down rules.
This issue of a public health policy is one basic element, the other being prevention.
Indeed, health is not just about medicines.
In other words, swallowing medicines is not the only route to good health.
For example, unclean drinking water is at present a cause of death in a number of developing countries.
Another example relates to AIDS. The counterfeiting of medicines is highly developed in this area, and the recently held Onusida conference placed great emphasis on prevention.
It is therefore also through policies of prevention, information and education and by relying on the practical knowledge present in local communities that attempts might be made to solve the problem and not merely through putting dozens of substances on the market at prohibitive prices.
In conclusion, I think that, in the fight against counterfeiting, we have to begin by strengthening existing measures and coordinating them better.
Then, we must above all help the developing, or poorest, countries to establish viable states and to put public policies in place covering all health problems and not only that of access to medicines.
Â Â  â I have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by John Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on improving the mental health of the population â towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union (2006/2058(INI) (A6-0249/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much appreciate Parliamentâs active participation in the consultation on the Commissionâs Green Paper on mental health.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his excellent report.
It is almost a year since the Commission presented its Green Paper on improving the mental health of the population.
The Green Paper was also a response to the WHO ministerial conference, which involved all EU Member States.
In the declaration it adopted, the conference called upon the Commission to support the Green Paperâs implementation.
The Green Paper presented mental health as a central part of overall public health and a key determinant of quality of life in the European Union.
It argued that public mental health was also a key factor in the attainment of the EUâs strategic objectives â prosperity, solidarity and social cohesion, as well as justice.
European values and the European social model demand that we give the necessary support to those who suffer from mental disorders and to promote social inclusion.
Perhaps this is one of the basic messages to emerge from the consultation process and from the report and resolution, namely that tackling social inclusion and the stigma attached to mental health problems is a key factor in our efforts to deal with this whole question.
Because of the stigma attached, people who suffer from mental health problems do not admit to them, do not seek help.
As a result, not only do they not get treatment, but also the reality and effectiveness of the statistical data are distorted, which in turn means that the matter is not always a priority for Member States and governments, since sometimes the figures may appear misleadingly low.
Therefore, dealing with this stigma and dealing with social inclusion is not just a human rights issue and not just an obligation, but can also have practical effects in our efforts to give priority and emphasis to actions and activities designed to tackle this problem.
The Green Paper pursued three objectives. One was a broad discussion of the importance of exploring whether a on mental health strategy should be developed at EU level and identifying what the priorities of such a strategy should be.
We held a full consultation.
We had more than 150 contributions. One of the most important contributions, of course, will be Parliamentâs resolution.
The draft report that has been tabled for todayâs debate addresses mental health in its full complexity.
I welcome the fact that it includes a number of very concrete suggestions. That is very important and helpful to us for the next steps we are to take.
I agree with almost all the points contained in the report and the Commission will give due consideration to these proposals when deciding on the next steps to be taken.
We are now in the process of analysing the results of the consultation and as of yesterday, if I am not mistaken, all the contributions are available on our public health website.
A document summarising the consultation outcomes will be prepared and published in the autumn.
I can say at this stage that the preliminary results of the consultation showed very strong support for the development of an EU mental health strategy.
I hope to present a Commission White Paper on mental health during the first quarter of next year presenting a strategy and proposing a framework for sustainable cooperation between Member States, policy fields and the relevant stakeholders.
I am firmly of the opinion that what we need most in order to promote positive mental health in the community and encourage social inclusion is dialogue, consensus-building and more importantly, action.
That is extremely important.
Raising awareness and exchanging approaches and good practice are important steps and in the long term can be more powerful than any other initiatives.
I look forward to the debate. Once again, I thank Parliament for this initiative.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his words of welcome on this report.
Colleagues, 450 million people in our world live with a mental disorder.
One in four of us will suffer from one during our lifetime; 58Â 000 people in Europe commit suicide every year and ten times that number try to.
More people die needlessly from suicide than from road accidents or Aids.
Three in every hundred of us will have depression; one in three of us going to our family doctor will have a mental health problem, but only one in six of us will be diagnosed as such.
That does not mean that two out of three of us will have good mental health: it means that we may not need, may not seek, or may not be offered treatment.
It may mean that we are given inappropriate treatment with drugs, therapies, institutions and laws that at best may do no harm, and at worst may lead to physical and psychological damage.
It almost certainly means that we are labelled, patronised, despised, feared and to a greater or lesser extent segregated in society, within our family, at work, at play and even within our health and social services.
In a perverse reversal, we can hide but we cannot run.
We cannot perform, we cannot contribute to society as we would wish, we cannot lead full and fulfilling lives, as we would want.
It also means that we have barely scratched the surface of creating a policy to promote mental wellbeing among our citizens from their early years, through the adult years of work and leisure and into old age and the years of increasing frailty.
That is why I welcome what has been achieved, firstly by a sequence of Council Presidencies â starting and culminating now with the Finnish Presidency â and by the Commission, where this Green Paper was drafted and will be driven through to active policy-making in the coming months.
When as a child I first came across mental illness, it was something you did not talk about.
When I first came across mental health policy it had not progressed far from the locks, bolts, restraint garments, isolation rooms, powers to detain, forcible administration of drugs and so on â or so it seemed.
In fact mental health policy has been on the move since the 1960s, with more humane surroundings, treatments and therapies.
Patients have been on the move too, going into community housing or back to their own homes.
The public has not always liked that.
No longer âout of sight, out of mindâ, it became âout of his or her mind and living next door to me and my childrenâ.
If modern, humane mental health policy is to work, it must have a spectrum of care and a range of health and social services, housing, training, transport and other services working in partnership.
It must have trust between professionals, patients and families, and it needs our resources.
To get those it needs political awareness, and that needs public consent and professional support.
A service that does not gain professional, public and political support fails patients and their families doubly.
It fails to treat and care adequately and it prompts a downward spiral of public confidence and so reinforces stigma.
Stigma is rampant in all our countries.
It is a human rights abuse.
It is unintentional, borne out of fear and ignorance, but just as damaging to the individual as any other form of abuse.
We all contribute to the stigmatisation of people who, if they had a physical problem, would receive our sympathy and support.
However, with mental illness we so often turn away and hope that someone else will cope.
Living with mental illness is tough enough without adding to the burden of illness the pain of rejection and stigma.
And so we must listen to patients and service users.
They should be our partners and not just our patients.
We have legislated against discrimination for people with disabilities.
Perhaps we need to do so for people with mental health problems â both those in hospital and those in the community.
My report is about these things.
It points the way forward to some of the changes we need.
If the public believes, they will put pressure on governments, and those governments will then invest in good services.
That makes public belief possible.
We know that neuro-psychiatric disorders are responsible for a third of disabilities, 15% of in-patient costs, a quarter of drugs costs, half the caseload of social workers and so forth. I want to be sure that if I, my wife or a member of my family has this problem in due course, as one of us is quite likely to, then I want a system in which they are hugged rather than rejected, loved rather than forgotten; a system in which it is not the case that they do not know people or do not know where they are; a system in which they are not within blank, cold, alien walls.
I would want them to have hope and not self-fulfilling despair.
If we understand that it could be any of us â and it will be many of us â then we will seek a better service.
In my report I quote those words of Stefan Heym from Alexanderplatz in 1989 East Berlin:
(In these last weeks we have regained our power of speech and learnt once more to walk with our heads held high.)
The stigma of mental health is as repressive a regime as East Germany was.
It stills our tongue, makes us hide our head and our task is to make sure that people with mental health disorders will, with our help, find their voices once again, their dignity, their self-respect and walk once more with their heads held high.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I have worked for many years on issues of concern to people with disabilities and those who serve them.
Some progress has been made for some people with some disabilities.
Sadly, this progress has not for the most part been shared by people who experience mental illness.
Judging from the keen interest in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members are aware that in our very midst people with mental illness are being subjected to the inhuman abuses of involuntary institutionalisation and hospitalisation, compulsory drugging and other medical treatments, physical restraint and force, while also being subject to discrimination in the workplace, exclusion in the community and suspicion on the part of public services.
Fortunately, there was a real sense in the committee that this must change, that priority must be given to approaches to treatment that enable people to achieve remission and recovery, as well as to inclusion, the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health.
Finally, there must be recognition that every human person is valuable and worthy of respect and that this respect demands that we allow people to speak and decide for themselves whenever humanly possible.
As we work through the process of formulating a European mental health strategy, the most important question we should ask ourselves is: will this make someoneâs life better?
I should like to congratulate MrÂ Bowis on his report, which contains many good things: an admittance that pharmaceuticals can cause more mental illness than they cure; a recognition of the importance of childhood for mental health with a call for support for families; a recognition that employment can affect mental health for better and for worse; and the need to consult those who have recovered from mental illness to learn how recovery happened.
This is a good start but, if we are going to truly help someone with this strategy, then we must take into account the whole person and to do so the strategy will have to include concepts like nutrition and failure, especially student failure, and for this reason I particularly support the amendments by Mrs Breyer.
We also need to look at concepts as yet unmentioned, such as hope and fear, creativity and expression, faith and spirituality.
It amazes me that we can write a whole strategy without ever mentioning the words âspiritâ or âspiritualityâ.
It is important for us to accept that there are moments of crisis, sorrow and strain in all of our lives and that when we experience them we may need support and we may need understanding, but we do not always need a diagnosis and a drug.
Getting it right is so important.
When we consider suicide, then we see that getting it right can even be a matter of life and death.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality has held a passionate debate on the mental health strategy.
In the short time allowed to me it is difficult to summarise the richness of the debate, but I am pleased to highlight the unanimous vote, which, extremely briefly, suggests three basic points.
The first point is the strong consensus for the proposal to deinstitutionalise psychiatric services; the aim of abolishing the internment and segregation of the mentally ill is seen by the committee as a step forwards in affirming the dignity of the person and, for that reason as well, Europe is fully entitled to deal with it.
The second point is a strong emphasis on a wide range of approaches with regard to the need for prevention and for users and local services to be actively involved at all levels in the global strategy, and even more so in the area of prevention.
The third point is a call to take the gender dimension into account, which is the most glaring omission in the Green Paper.
We claim that the proposed measures need to include systematic research with specific studies on women, since problems such as eating disorders, neurovegetative diseases, schizophrenia, depression and suicide have not yet been studied from a gender perspective and that means that the progress made in prevention and treatment is less significant than is needed.
Hopefully, though, we are making headway.
Â Â  Commissioner, you will allow me first of all to congratulate my colleague, MrÂ Bowis, who has done a remarkable piece of work on a particularly important subject that affects us all, since a quarter of all Europeans will have mental health problems during their lives, with all the considerable repercussions that these will involve for those close to them.
I fear that this subject in reality affects everyone. Whoever we are, mental health affects us.
For a very long time, we have, however, closed our eyes to these evils.
Poor mental health was supposedly just a difficult patch people went through, or not even that.
These people felt stigmatised inasmuch as they had to keep their suffering secret. This oppressive silence ought no longer to exist nowadays.
To dare to talk about mental health problems is already to have taken action.
Talking about these illnesses is a first step towards curing most of them.
To isolate people with mental health problems and to discriminate against them is like pointing a loaded pistol at their heads.
I am thinking of the young man with a promising future whose life is suddenly turned upside down when, on reaching adulthood, he proves to be schizophrenic. This is distressing not only for him but also for his family.
The number of suicide attempts ought to make us reflect on the importance of this problem. Moreover, a certain amount of crime is a result of the increase in certain types of mental health problem.
The ageing of our populations ought also to give us pause for thought as it is, unfortunately, accompanied by an increase in mental illness.
We must take this phenomenon into account.
The European Union may develop its measures to prevent poor mental health, but it must also help researchers confront this phenomenon in order better to understand the factors that affect mental health, particularly during early childhood, to manage patientsâ progress more effectively, to promote the most suitable medicines available and to support efforts directed at training health care professionals.
