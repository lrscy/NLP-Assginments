It is not our function to carry out investigations with the exact attention to detail of a state prosecutor and eventually produce a statement of facts and a charge sheet; what we must do is to make it clear to the citizens of the European Union, once our work is done, what, to our knowledge, has taken place and what political conclusions should be drawn from it in order that we may continue to hold fast to our values and principles, and to demonstrate the European Unionâs readiness to defend and guarantee freedom, security and democracy.
It appears, though, that there are some in the House who have not yet even begun to grasp what that might mean.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Fava, for his excellent work and his cooperation with us.
I would also like to thank Mr Coelho for his assiduous and steady chairmanship.
The area of justice and human rights in the EU is not working effectively.
On the one hand, some Member States have not implemented EU anti-terrorism laws passed five years ago, so we are not equipped throughout the EU to investigate and prosecute terrorist offences.
In some Member States there is not even a definition of terrorism, so terrorists can escape conviction and imprisonment.
Mr Fava recalled the London bombings, which we will sadly remember on Friday; we also remember the Madrid bombings.
If the same thing happened in some of our national capitals, there would be no prospect of terrorists being convicted.
I hope Mr Gawronski and his friends are knocking on the doors of those national capitals which have not implemented the framework decision on terrorism.
At the same time it is apparent on the basis of credible indications that gross human rights abuses have taken place in the name of fighting terrorism â the so-called war on terror.
The EU has allowed a situation to develop where we cannot prosecute terrorists, but we can persecute terrorist suspects and deprive them of their rights.
What credibility does this give the EU at home or abroad, either for effectively combating terrorism or for upholding human rights?
Let us be clear: what we are saying in this report is that we have heard testimony and seen corroborating facts, such as flight logs, which attest to extraordinary renditions having taken place in Europe, and it is highly implausible that governments or their agencies had no idea what was going on.
We have not implied we are a court or we have the powers of an investigating police officer or prosecutor, but we have done enough in cooperation and in complementarity with Dick Marty in the Council of Europe, with national MPs and judicial inquiries, to shift the burden of proof.
Once allegations are no longer speculative but are shown to be credible, as is the case, then under European and international human rights instruments Member States have a positive obligation to investigate and to punish anyone responsible for human rights abuses.
I hope that in private the Presidency is saying something different to its 24 EU government colleagues than it is saying here.
I hope it is saying this conspiracy of silence must stop.
To say, as the Minister did, that the Treaties do not give the EU any powers is untrue.
If that is the case, then why did governments unanimously insert the human rights clause into the EU Treaty and a clause, Article 7, which provides for sanctions for breach?
It is true that we lack the monitoring mechanisms to connect the obligation to the powers and that needs to be filled in.
It is pathetic that Javier Solana and Gijs de Vries are obliged to come to us and say, âwe do not believe there have been any violations, but we do not have the competence to ask Member States the relevant questionsâ.
I am quite happy to accept Mr Gawronskiâs amendment in this connection, since it shows up the ludicrous nature of the gap in competence.
I am not reproaching them, but I am accusing the Council and Member States of being guilty of creating a lot of hot air and rhetoric about the EU as a beacon of human rights without delivering the results.
If you want our citizens to relate to the EU, I give you a cause worth championing.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with warm thanks for the outstanding work done by our rapporteur MrÂ Fava and also for that done by MrÂ Coelho, the Chairman of our Committee, although I would also, while I am on the subject, like to include in that expression of thanks Senator Dick Marty and Mr Terry Davis for the excellent cooperation with the Council of Europe and its Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights.
I believe that this cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Parliament points the way for future cooperation in the defence of human rights.
Let me begin with a general observation.
There are legal ways of handing prisoners over to foreign authorities.
The transfers that this committee has had to consider amount to something more than the transport of a suspect from one location to another, for the practice that we have had to consider, far from being provided for in relevant legislation, actually circumvents the principles we sum up under the heading of the rule of law, namely the right to appropriate legal representation and to proper legal proceedings in court, and it is no more consistent with the stipulation that nobody may be extradited or taken to a state in which he would be exposed to the risk of being tortured or subjected to any other inhumane treatment.
Most of the victims of these transfers were illegally arrested from the very outset, some of them having been abducted, and all of them were taken from one country to another in an unlawful manner.
Many of them have since disappeared.
Those victims who testified to our committee spoke of torture and other inhumane treatment.
In the final analysis, it can be said that this practice was intended to âoutsourceâ torture and make it more difficult to establish where the responsibility for the violation of human rights lay.
There are many who say that it cannot be determined with any precision how many people in total were arrested, abducted and taken to other countries, and they may be right, but, by the very same token, it is also true that we can regard enough instances in which human rights were violated as proven, and about these the report has things to say in very blunt terms.
The Chicago Convention allows private flights throughout European airspace without the need for further permission; the CIA exploited this by deliberately declaring its flights to be private, while many states â among them Member States of the European Union â acted on the basis of the Chicago Convention in letting the CIA do whatever they wanted.
In so doing, these states disregarded other provisions of this Convention that gave them the right to search aircraft where there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the plane was being used for illegal purposes.
The Member States of the European Union are bound by various international treaties, in particular â as made quite plain in ArticleÂ 6 â by the European Convention on Human Rights.
The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly emphasised that every state is under a positive obligation to intervene, investigate, and take legal action against the persons responsible, whenever people need to be protected from torture and other forms of inhumane treatment.
It is perfectly clear that there were many Member States of the European Union in which this was not done.
Italy has recently done what the law requires of it, and for that it deserves gratitude and respect, but I also â and I believe that I am speaking for the majority in this House when I say this â expect other countries to follow its example.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Fava and Mr Coelho, for the work carried out in this committee and for the fact that this work has shown us that extraordinary rendition is part of a mistaken strategy employed in the name of the fight against terrorism.
It is a mistaken strategy because it is based on the theory of pre-emptive war and on the erosion of the rule of law.
Rather than weakening terrorism, this strategy has fed and radicalised it, thereby contributing to the achievement of the very objectives set by the terrorists.
Just a few days ago, following its GuantÃ¡namo judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States told us that, between 2001 and 2003, more than half of the prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo were taken there from Afghanistan, which means that Europe was the place of transit for over two hundred prisoners, European airports were used for stopovers, and US and NATO bases in Europe were used as outposts.
Our committee has also ascertained that there is no doubt that there have been abductions, including the obvious case of Abu Omar.
We have investigated the facts in great detail and have ascertained that, as John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have said, US intelligence activity has been carried out with the involvement of national governments.
John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have explicitly stated that there has been no breach of national sovereignty.
This should also be mentioned, MrÂ Gawronski, not just extracts from MrÂ Siftonâs speeches.
I think it has emerged beyond a shadow of a doubt that European governments have aided and abetted the actions of US Intelligence on European territory.
An Italian policeman has confessed and today the deputy head of the Sismi, the Italian intelligence service, has been arrested.
I think that we need further clarification.
The head of the Italian intelligence service, DrÂ Pollari, either lied to our committee or did not know about the activities of his deputy; each possibility is equally serious.
The same applies to Commissioner Frattini, who should clarify this point.
At the time of the events, Commissioner Frattini was Minister for Foreign Affairs, so either he did not know, as he told the committee, or he was unaware of the agreements ...
Â Â  . Mr President, I urge greater moderation in the tone of this report.
It makes too much use of the language of certainty and fact in places where suspicion and doubt would be more appropriate.
According to the previous report of the Council of Europe, we are dealing with a dozen such cases of rendition, affecting some 17 people.
Not all of these cases are blatantly breaches of international law.
MrÂ Arar, for example, was handed over by order of an immigration court, so he hardly qualifies for inclusion in the group of extraordinary renditions.
Until we know the exact extent of the phenomenon, we have no authority to make the assertion contained in paragraphÂ 6 of the report, which states that serious and inadmissible violations of fundamental rights have taken place on several occasions.
The US Government interprets the Convention against Torture differently, which is its right.
The committee on this convention has not questioned this interpretation, which is backed by many years of practice, a Senate decision and Supreme Court judgments.
I would like to see the report give space to a broader description of the context of the matter in order to avoid caricaturisation along the lines of âEuropean Union good, America badâ.
We should underline the key role of the fight against terrorism in world security, and the positive results of collaboration between European and US security services.
In confronting terrorism, Europe and America are sometimes forced to step into a legal void.
Europe wants to treat terrorists like criminals who should be given defence lawyers and all the rights of due process.
The American practice is closer to the traditions of military rule, which in my view is more suited to these circumstances, but which leads to legal acrobatics.
If we want to avoid such disputes and conflicts between Europe and the US, we have to add new regulations to international law.
Without the amendments proposed by MrÂ Gawronski and myself, the report is not worthy of support in tomorrowâs vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners appointed for four months by the European Parliament has failed to fulfil its brief.
In all its work to date it has not succeeded in acquiring a single item, and I stress, a single item, of previously unknown information.
As a result the committeeâs report presented here today is nothing but another piece of uncorroborated media information.
There is nothing to indicate that extending the committeeâs mandate will bring any concrete facts to light.
It does not have the tools for activities of this type.
Why should we carry on wasting taxpayersâ money to prolong its existence?
Why support a committee that is toothless?
There are no rational grounds for doing so.
Any extension of the committeeâs mandate would be for political and propaganda purposes.
Its activities are in any case already being used by the socialists and liberals for their own ends.
They will use any pretext to attack the United States and its European allies.
In this way they seriously undermine the only common front that has been created in the fight against the exceptionally grave threat of terrorism.
This should not really come as any surprise to us.
Historically, ever since the turn of the last century, the socialists themselves resorted to acts that today would be regarded as terrorist acts.
Sympathy for such political methods persists, even in this House.
It is no coincidence that the lines of division on this report are based not on its merits, or even on nationality, but on ideology.
It is fundamentally a division between socialists and conservatives.
In deciding to terminate the work of the Temporary Committee we will be doing a great service to the societies of our countries, and that is what I appeal for.
Â Â  Mr President, our interim committee has failed to pin anything on the CIA in terms of its involvement in torture or associated illegal activities here in Europe.
Suspicions, indications or even insinuations are all we had to go on.
Some Left-wing Members of this House wanted to take advantage of the activities of the interim committee to indulge in cheap anti-Americanism, of which this biased report is a manifestation.
Moreover, the way in which the committee has worked to date has raised a few questions.
Witnesses were sometimes accompanied by lawyers who ensured that difficult questions remained unanswered.
On more than one occasion, the vagueness of those involved meant that we were unable to gain a clear picture of the facts with which they were charged, or of their political background for that matter.
Other people who appeared before the committee, including High Representative Javier Solana, were so predictably noncommittal that their input was a waste of time for everyone.
If the inquiry is to continue, it would be preferable if it were to be conducted by the national bodies that competent in this area.
Â Â  â Madam President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking MrÂ Frattini for his excellent work with our committee, and I hope the Council will follow his example in the second period of our work.
I should first like to echo the words of MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, and say that this is an interim report.
This document could not be accused of not containing the kind of conclusions found in a final report.
I should also like to thank all the members of the committee that I chair and in particular the rapporteur MrÂ Fava for his high-quality, dedicated work in committee.
I also wish to thank all of those who helped us.
Thirdly, I wish to point out that in the hearings, there were 70 testimonies made, 50 hours of statements given, two foreign missions undertaken â one to the United States and one to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia â and thousands of documents analysed.
As things stand, I feel that quite apart from the fact that the committee has justified its existence, illegal acts have taken place in Europe that need to be assessed in terms of their scale and the extent to which the Member States were involved.
Furthermore, control of air space and airport facilities needs to be stepped up, the democratic control of the activities of the secret services should be strengthened, as MrÂ Frattini said, and the activities of foreign secret services on European soil needs to be more closely monitored.
In adopting this report, we are asking the Board to put in place the conditions to discover the truth about what happened, and with the key amendments tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats we are contributing towards a balanced, accurate and fair report.
After all, we do not want this thorough, dedicated work to be mistaken for some kind of political propaganda.
Â Â  Mr President, 11Â September this year will mark the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attack against America.
A legitimate fight against terrorism goes hand-in-hand with reflection on the means used to conduct this fight, on the state of democracy, the rule of law and on civil liberties in situations where special services are given special authority and where general surveillance is carried out.
A new kind of community is arising on both sides of the Atlantic â a community of lawyers, journalists and politicians from different sides of the political scene, activists from humanitarian organisations and citizens who are against the recent infringements of human rights and political and civic freedoms by some European governments and the US Government.
Last week the Supreme Court in the USA pronounced the special military tribunals appointed by President Bush in November 2001 by way of a decree, bypassing Congress, as illegal and contrary to the Geneva Conventions and the American system of military courts.
The ruling of the Supreme Court is proof that we are not condemned to a tragic choice between security and freedom.
The Temporary Committee appointed by Parliament on 18Â January this year has completed the first stage of its work.
The interim report concludes that illegal practices affecting citizens and residents of Europe were carried out in Europe.
I would like to underline that the committeeâs report is by no means anti-American or ideological, and it is not aimed against any country or government.
The report was based primarily on around 50 hours of hearings involving lawyers, journalists, representatives of non-governmental organisations, alleged victims of special rendition proceedings, representatives of the governments of the Member States and representatives of the European institutions.
I would also like to stress that in its interim report the committee does not once mention the name âPolandâ, unlike Dick Martyâs report before the Council of Europe in June this year.
However, our report does assert the need to ascertain whether there is proof that secret prisons are operating in some European countries, as some journalists and bona-fide non-governmental organisations claimed in the course of the investigations.
What is particularly worrying is, as Senator Martyâs report points out, Warsawâs unwillingness to cooperate seriously with the European institutions.
The Temporary Committee should now proceed with the rest of its 12-month mandate, during which it should make official visits to various countries, including Poland.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Claudio Fava, and the team from the secretariat that has supported him in his wonderful work.
Despite what may be gleaned from the brief speech by the representative of the Council, we do not look to Washington.
We look to the European capitals.
We look to the Council, in Brussels, waiting for it to commit itself to the truth which has not yet come, to explain to us the why and the how of what we now know.
Because, just like archaeologists who gradually go on digging up small items through small excavations and then put all of that information together to produce a map of a city that had been hidden and the precise whereabouts of which nobody knew, the Commission, with the invaluable support of other people, of NGOs, in cooperation with the Council of Europe etc., has managed to draw up that map, to uncover and bring to light that hidden city, which is a plan designed for the systematic violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens on the theoretical premise of protecting our fundamental rights; we should protect our rights and our security by violating the rights of others.
That is the approach our work has been taking.
That is something that could not have happened without the active support or deliberate passivity of the Member States of the European Union.
That is our conclusion.
That is our moral conviction, and noÂ one will be able to take it away from us, with or without votes.
We are dealing with a great jigsaw puzzle in which it is not sufficient for any State to say that no crime has taken place on their territory, if it turns out, for example, that the role played by that State in this overall plan was to give logistical support to the aircraft so that the people taking part in this great drama could rest beforehand or afterwards.
We are therefore still awaiting coherent explanations from the Council and the Member States so that we may know the truth and guarantee respect for the European Union's fundamental values, for which we are all supposed to be fighting.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate and praise the rapporteur, MrÂ Fava, and I would like once again to express our full support for his report's fundamental approach.
In the hearings that we have held over recent months it has become clear that we cannot carry on talking about alleged practices, but rather we must discuss and analyse specific facts and call the relevant people to account, as other Members have also pointed out.
As the report stresses, it seems extraordinary to us that the governments should not have known what was happening, and I would like once again to express my surprise at certain governmentsâ â including mine â repeated denials of facts that CIA officials themselves have demonstrated and acknowledged.
The detention today in Italy is simply the tip of the iceberg, and we hope that everything else will come to light soon.
I would insist that it is not a question of knowing whether these practices have occurred, but of who in Europe knew about them, and often collaborated in them, and also who, since they must have known about them, evaded their responsibilities.
The reportâs conclusion is clear: the work we are doing is necessary and must continue.
It is true that we are neither investigators nor prosecutors; we have neither the power nor the means to carry out this action or these investigations, but we can ask the relevant question and raise important issues.
In order to be able to do this work, the investigation must continue and I would therefore say once again that we must support this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the CIA â in the name of freedom and democracy â has abducted people, transported them, made them to disappear, and has not only caused them to be tortured but has also done the deed itself.
If there was even one Member of this House who was not already speechless with fury, the hearing of Khaled El-Masri must have had that effect.
What, though, did our governments do?
They did nothing.
The El-Masri case was the subject of canteen gossip in Skopje; German officials knew about it, but the German Government, no doubt for reasons of state, left MrÂ El-Masri to his fate.
Let me put it bluntly: every government has the duty of protecting its citizens from the violation of their human rights by others; failure to do anything is a gross violation of human rights.
Over and over again, evidence is demanded, yet, instead of obliging the government to produce it, such evidence is demanded from the victims.
This is the line taken by right-wingers, not least those in the ranks of the conservatives in this House, but who is to be required to produce the evidence?
MrÂ Marty of the Council of Europe is quite right to say that it is a fundamental duty incumbent on governments to actively investigate all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens.
They have to demonstrate that their conduct has always been correct and that they have acted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the fundamental values shared throughout the EU.
That is why our committee cannot yet declare the case closed.
We must not allow governments to bury their heads in the sand, and that is true whether we are talking about the government of my own country or the government of Macedonia, a candidate country that has tried to put one over on us.
Â Â  Mr President, I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism.
Terrorists do not respect human life, they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights.
We are all behind that fight, but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon.
The American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism.
Unfortunately, the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations.
The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists.
I am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how, by making the wrong decisions, governments can strengthen terrorist organisations.
As an example, the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions, but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again.
The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully.
The interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe.
The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations.
If we are going to fight terrorism, we must all work together within the law.
The committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months.
I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion.
However, the American Government must implement new strategies if it is going to win the war against international terrorism.
There are so many examples of how not to do it, but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated.
Â Â  Mr President, since the outrages of 11Â September 2001, the world has changed.
On that day Islamic terrorists started a global war against Western civilisation, bringing us fear and death.
In this Parliament, we cannot consider todayâs fight against terrorism in isolation from those events.
The fight against terrorism is a consequence of them, and human rights for terrorists should not compromise the effective protection of our families and societies.
We should remember that the terrorists do not recognise any rights, treaties or conventions.
I was concerned to see what went on behind the scenes when the so-called âCIA Committeeâ was established.
Unfortunately its appointment was purely political, with the aim of slurring countries who have actually been involved in fighting terrorism.
As a member of the committee I can see that its activities are a âEuropean witch-huntâ, where the witches being hunted are US allies in Europe, which is a reflection of the complexes and anti-Americanism of a number of Member States of the âold EUâ.
The call to battle was based on unconfirmed information from Amnesty International and press reports.
By naming countries that allegedly infringe human rights, we are exposing them to the danger of reprisals and revenge attacks by terrorists.
The committeeâs report has neither divulged anything new, nor has it proved anything.
In civilised countries verdicts are not issued without evidence, but the committee has taken upon itself to do so.
Our report is based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence, but it makes judgments and even passes sentence with the burden on the accused of proving his innocence.
In a normal system of law, it is guilt, and not innocence, that needs to be proved.
The application to extend the work of the committee for another six months is a waste of taxpayersâ money.
Let us forget about European anti-American bias, and let us join the real fight against terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, we have had 50 hours of hearings and nothing to show for it.
I sent a copy of Mr Favaâs report to a former staffer of mine, Sally McNamara, who is now the international relations director for a major Washington public policy institute, the American Legislative Exchange Council.
I should like to quote her comments to you.
She uses a vernacular word to describe the report and then says: âIf I came up with this sort of report for my boss â devoid of fact and with a hefty dose of moral posturing â I reckon I would get firedâ.
I hope that our rapporteur will take note of these comments.
His report is entirely speculative and circumstantial.
It seeks to present unsubstantiated allegations as fact.
Evidence of flights that have been linked to the CIA is not evidence of rendition, still less evidence of mistreatment.
The committee started from an a priori belief that the USA and the CIA are guilty, and merely sought with little success to substantiate its prejudices.
It has not established evidence, it has merely provided a platform for anti-American bias.
Whether we like it or not, the war against terror is real and it is now.
The US has taken a lead in this war.
It has spent a huge amount of blood and treasure in the defence of Western values.
We in this House should show a little more gratitude and a little less criticism.
I agree with MrÂ Piotrowski.
There is no point in extending the remit of this committee.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the defence of human rights, the maintenance of the fundamental freedoms that protect citizens and respect for our European legal systems are among the principles underpinning the European Union; accordingly, it was and is the function of the CIA Committee to examine whether the Member States had misapplied Community law.
It is unfortunate that its interim report, which we now have before us, is as yet neither even-handed nor complete.
I can live with the fact that the groups in this House attach different values to the statements made to the committee, but it is a fundamental requirement of any balanced report that it should include all statements, including those that do not tally with the committee's preconceived ideas.
Completeness demands, then, that the statements by MrÂ Solana and MrÂ deÂ Fries at their respective hearings to the effect that they were not aware of any breach of the law on the part of any Member State, be included in the report along with the fact that no evidence has been provided, to this day, of the existence of so-called secret prisons in the European Union.
This report must also include the statement made by John Bellinger on behalf of the American administration; after all, the members of the committee had travelled specially to Washington to ask him the questions he answered.
None of the things I have mentioned have as yet been included in the report, for the reason that the majority on the committee found them disagreeable; I dare say that that is hardly commensurate with their task of seeking out facts and establishing the truth.
The justified interest in the investigation of the accusations that have been made must not result in a one-sided approach to the assessment and evaluation of the facts.
If this committee and this House are to have any credibility, then this interim report must reflect objectively all the information available to us; then â and only then â can we adopt this report by a large majority.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki, MrÂ Frattini, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank MrÂ Fava for all his work on the interim report and others for the excellent work they too have done.
When Parliament and we in the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners began our work, I for one did not have very high expectations of what we could achieve, as a lot of the alleged practices had taken place quite a few years ago.
I have been pleasantly surprised, however.
Our work has produced results aimed at making Europe safer and human rights more secure.
For me as a Social Democrat MEP from Sweden and a proud witch, as someone chose to call us, I am particularly pleased that, on the issues of extraordinary rendition and diplomatic guarantees, we have now reached an agreement and that we are making clear the dividing lines between the fight against terrorism, a humane policy on refugees and respect for human rights, which are also in crisis following the terrorist acts of 11Â September 2001 in New York.
In this area, the expulsion from Sweden of the Egyptians Mohammed Al Zery and Ahmed Agiza following a decision by the Swedish Government have pointed to solutions of the kind we do not want to see any more of.
The CIAâs solutions are unsustainable, both in the short and the long term and for both the EU and the rest of the world.
The committee needs more time.
We have learned from the mistakes that have been made and we shall propose measures and safety nets so that we do not end up in similar situations in the future.
Europeans expect a better job to be made of sorting out future crises through cooperation between the Council of Europe, all the countries of Europe and ourselves in the European Parliament.
MrÂ Frattini has some interesting thoughts on the security service, necessary future controls on aviation and getting the balance right in combating terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, that side of the House still seems to be very sceptical about the evidence.
To me, this is like a jigsaw puzzle that is nearing completion.
Although there are still a few pieces missing, we get the general picture.
As it is the Member States who must supply the missing pieces, it is a complete mystery to me why they should be so reluctant to provide the additional evidence.
After all, it is Europe's moral leadership that is at stake here.
Security and human rights are surely the European Unionâs very .
If we allow these things to happen on European soil, we betray those who set out to achieve European integration.
Moreover, the American method proves ineffective because terrorism appears to be a seven-headed monster.
Each time a head is chopped off, another one appears soon after.
The security policy we adopt here in Europe should therefore apply our own standards, our own methods and our own conditions.
Finally, I think it is essential that we, as a matter of urgency, start a parliamentary dialogue with the Americans to discuss security and human rights and the way in which we can, together, on the basis of shared values, fight the monster of terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the issues we are supposed to be looking at is whether the European Union and our own Member States are the good guys in this.
This is a question that we need to ask.
In terms of facts and the political consequences that we should be drawing from this, it is almost irrelevant whether there have been two or three renditions as we were told in the US by the US Administration, or whether the facts unearthed so far reveal two or three renditions, or whether we have found more.
We have discovered that Member States, even if they want to know what is going on, do not necessarily have the right or the mechanisms to find out, let alone the political will.
We have been told by two of our own senior people that they do not have the right to pursue such issues.
We have been told that the law is inadequate in this new era of greater threat.
However, we also need to question whether we are using the law we have effectively and fairly in accordance with international human rights obligations.
The issue is not just about the method â whether it is abduction or immigration problems â but also the outcome.
There is an absolute prohibition on torture under international human rights instruments.
Therefore, what do we make of the memoranda of understanding which are increasingly coming into play and have implications for other areas of EU policy?
These are some of the areas we should be looking at politically.
This is another reason why we need the committee to continue.
Â Â  â Mr President, like Mr Dick Marty in the Council of Europe, MrÂ Fava has the courage to coordinate an investigation with a very clear objective: to establish the truth.
Independently of the position of any particular State or Government, the truth must be established.
At this point in the investigation it is clear that nobody can accept the idea that European governments knew nothing about this great overall plan of the US intelligence services.
During this stage of the investigation, I would urge the governments of the European Union â all of them â to intensify their cooperation with the investigation being coordinated by MrÂ Fava.
In this regard, I do not understand why the intelligence services of my country â Spain â have not yet been heard by this committee.
I believe that, during the second phase of the investigation, it is essential that the director of the Spanish intelligence services appear in order to give all of the information he has, as he has done in the Spanish Congress of Deputies.
I believe that we must support and encourage this investigation so that it can carry on to its conclusion, until the truth is fully established.
Â Â  Mr President, the report we are dealing with today is built on assumptions and allegations the truth of which the temporary committee has no authority and no tools to verify.
Irrespective of the fact that Mr Javier Solana clearly stated to the committee that there was no evidence of the colourful stories we were being told, the report accuses EU governments both of violating human rights and of lying.
What we are really dealing with are two different concepts of the war against terror: the European Parliament model, which believes in fighting terrorism with resolutions and dialogue and, on the other side, the model of the responsible governments, which want to monitor suspected persons, control transfers of illegal funds and, where necessary, arrest terrorists before they can act.
There is one clear message to the terrorists in this report: have no fear of the European Parliament.
We are your safe haven and we will never catch you.
Â Â  Mr President, it was entirely predictable that whatever the findings of this report, it would call for increased powers to be taken by the European Union and, indeed, we were not disappointed.
It states that the rules of cooperation between national security services should be established at EU level, that effective parliamentary scrutiny of national intelligence services should be at European level and that the Commission should immediately legislate to harmonise laws on the surveillance of non-commercial civil aviation.
There never seems to be an ill wind that cannot blow the European Union some good.
The report and the minority opinion expressed agree that some illegal detentions and transportations may have taken place.
However, it is unlikely that the real truth will ever be known.
I have no time whatsoever for illegal detentions and transportations of citizens or of non-EU citizens.
The existing legal means are draconian enough.
In this morningâs , the leader of the UKâs Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, said that Britainâs extradition arrangements with the USA were a constitutional disgrace.
Surprisingly for a lawyer, he does not seem to know that very similar arrangements exist with the European Union.
Britainâs extradition arrangements under the European Arrest Warrant and under the similar and non-reciprocal arrangement with the USA amount to little better than the judicial kidnap of British citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Favaâs report is like a dried lemon â no matter how hard you squeeze it, hardly any juice comes out; even so, it is a better, more responsible and more restrained report than the one presented by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
While their report is blatantly ideological, ours is more political; Senator Martyâs report was based not on facts but on circumstantial evidence, but it still went much too far in accusations.
We are right to say that fighting terrorism is a priority for the international community.
We are also right in saying that the end does not justify the means, that you cannot violate human rights just in order to defeat terrorism, but the main thing is that we respect hard facts.
We cannot build up an indictment against whole countries based simply on conjecture, suspicion, circumstantial evidence or hunches.
This report is an element in the broader debate about relations between the EU and the USA, about boundaries for the legitimate fight against terrorism and about transatlantic cooperation.
The report cannot be separated from the political context.
We cannot pretend that in protecting human rights, we never use them as an ideological tool of anti-Americanism.
I call upon the committee to complete its mandate within the original 12 months.
If there is the will to do so, this autumn the committee will visit Poland and will be welcomed there, because Poland and the Polish people have nothing to hide.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an astonishing report.
In it there is a yawning gap between the evidence collected and the opinions formulated by the committee.
In the report, the committee makes extremely grave accusations, for example, that in Europe âinadmissible violations of fundamental human rights have taken place on several occasionsâ.
On the other hand, it can only confirm exactly four cases of the procedure described as the illegal transfer of persons suspected of terrorism.
Furthermore, the tone used by the committee varies: on the one hand, it speaks guardedly about some facts, such as in paragraphÂ 12, for example: âall the work of the temporary committee so far seems to indicate that European airspace and airports have been used by CIA front companiesâ. On the other hand, it is categorical in making value judgments such as the one in the above-quoted paragraphÂ 6, where it speaks of violations of fundamental human rights on several occasions, although the evidence gathered does not authorise it to make such statements.
No evidence is provided anywhere of use of torture against the suspects, nor is any proof provided of the existence of detention centres in any country where suspects might be held â I mean within the European Union â and, in view of this, we should ask ourselves whether the four cases of rendition of terrorist suspects and several hundred flights by CIA aircraft â and they are something we knew about before the committee started its work â allow the committee to come to such radical conclusions.
I get the impression that the committee is building its own virtual view of reality, and instead of taking the occasion to give EU citizens a view of reality is for some reason, undoubtedly political, putting forward its own virtual view as though it were real, and thereby misleading the citizens.
This is poor practice, since it serves to undermine the authority of the European Parliament.
If the committee carries on like this in the next phase of its work, the prestige of the European Parliament may end up like that of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate would be amusing if it were not so serious.
We can never justify the means we use to beat terrorism by claiming that the ends are noble.
We cannot defend our values by abandoning them and I suspect that some of the people involved in todayâs debate would much rather we abandoned our values just to prove themselves right.
It is regrettable that, for party political reasons, some Members are not willing to recognise what everybody else sees, not just in this House but outside it.
Illegal renditions by US agents have taken place.
Some EU Member Statesâ services have colluded in those renditions, either passively or actively.
The cross-referencing of witness statements and Eurocontrol records has established that some EU states have serious questions to answer and have so far refused to come clean.
This inquiry must therefore continue.
Parliamentary investigations are necessary, particularly in countries like my own, Ireland, where it has been established that 50 CIA flights have landed at Irish airports and that the aircraft used to transfer Abu Omar illegally from Italy to Egypt, via Germany, also landed at an Irish airport.
We have good reason to believe that Abu Omar was in fact tortured in Egypt.
So it is quite ridiculous for Members in this House to argue that this inquiry should not proceed.
The Irish human rights body, a government-sponsored body, has called on the Irish Government to establish a legally enforceable regime of aircraft inspections, which at the moment does not exist.
It has also called for a legally enforceable regime whereby diplomatic assurances from third countries can be challenged in law.
The Irish Government has so far refused to do this.
These are issues that need to be addressed and the Irish Government and its agencies need to be cross-examined by this committee, as, indeed, do many other Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, that this is an emotional debate, and is also being conducted in an emotional way, is something I can understand, but I have to say, in all honesty, that I am horrified by the lack of rationality in it.
Accusing all these Members of being motivated by pure anti-Americanism, accusing others of having an ideological barrier in their heads, is to act like children in a sandpit squabbling over their buckets and spades.
We need to get beyond that stage if we want to be able to produce a balanced and rational report.
I can understand why some, for political reasons, might not share the view put across by the committee, and I can also understand why others might find the failure to share that view something worthy of scorn.
On this occasion, of course, we have done no more than assemble circumstantial evidence rather than watertight proof, quite simply because no head of a secret service is going to come out and say, âYes, of course, thatâs how we did it.
We abducted people illegally.â
There are people in this House who would probably not notice that they had been illegally abducted if they had been confined to an aircraft, been blindfolded and taken away, but that is irrelevant.
There are many legal systems in which circumstantial evidence can be used as the basis of a trial, and there is circumstantial evidence that is so weighty that it virtually constitutes proof.
This is a situation we have found ourselves in in a number of cases.
Not everything will turn out to be the way some people, with their conspiracy theories, imagine it to be, but nor is the world as pink and pretty as those imagine who maintain that these things never happened at all, and so this committee has done valuable work in bringing to light at least the tip of an iceberg, for if we want to win the war on terrorism, we can do so only if we are credible, and we can be credible only if we keep to the rules that we lay down to others.
What I would like to see, then, is for this committee to carry on doing what it is doing and come to an objective conclusion.
I would, by the way, like to say something to the members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: your counterparts in the Council of Europe voted to endorse MrÂ Marty's report, which, as we have just heard, goes even further than the report before this House, and so I find myself wondering how you will be able to justify it if you decide not to vote in favour of this one.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Fava and the Council of Europe rapporteur, Mr Dick Marty.
The investigation to uncover this international parastate must proceed and be extended, despite the reactions of all those who wish to play down and cover up this scandal.
I am truly sorry that some fellow Members in this House refuse to see the facts and the data and prefer the path of ideological fanaticism and prejudice, in contrast to their counterparts on the same wing in the Council of Europe.
We have an obligation to seek the truth and we owe it to European citizens and the long tradition of democracy and humanitarianism on our continent.
Moreover, experience over recent years has shown that infringements of human rights and shrinking democracy ultimately strengthen rather than combat terrorism.
It is clear from the information that the heads of the secret services knew about the activities of US agents and possibly certain people in positions of responsibility in the governments knew and turned a blind eye.
It is not possible for 32 aeroplanes to have made over one thousand flights over five years which no one knew anything about.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say at the outset that I am fully against flights of rendition.
Such a practice is in breach of established international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights.
From an Irish perspective, I am pleased that this report does not come up with any findings against the Irish Government, and this is in line with assurances given by the US authorities.
I totally refute what my colleague Mr De Rossa said here today.
It is unfounded to make allegations like that.
Shannon Airport has been unreasonably treated in this regard and has been the loser, because it has now been decided by the American authorities not to use the airport for refuelling purposes, at a cost of EUR 10Â million to the revenue of that airport.
That is a result of the unfounded allegations that are being made by MrÂ De Rossa and others.
They should establish the facts before they speak in such a manner.
Â Â  Mr President, torture is always wrong and counterproductive.
The US-instigated torture rendition programme is particularly wrong because it makes acceptable a new model in that in the past torture was mainly committed by dictatorial regimes.
Now it is being promoted by democratic states.
If the malpractice of torture is not challenged and reversed, then international laws designed to protect all humanity will be permanently degraded.
Closing GuantÃ¡namo is not the answer because many prisoners transferred will be tortured elsewhere.
Many of the prisoners transferred in November 2005 from the European black site prisons are now in unknown black hole prisons elsewhere.
The EU has a responsibility to ensure that these prisoners do not suffer further torture.
The UN and the Red Cross should have compulsory access to all prisoners everywhere and the UN should have a daily-updated register of all prisoners in all UN member states.
The EU and EU Member States should also provide more finance for the care of survivors of torture.
Â Â  Mr President, the false prophets protecting human and civil rights have multiplied recently.
Many of them â and this is particularly unpalatable â come from the political formations which once were not put out in any way by communism, and which were accommodating and tolerant to the regimes that occupied half our continent for a great many years.
Today these people are trying to create the impression that democracyâs greatest problem, the greatest problem facing human and civil rights, are not dramatic events that affect millions of people in places such as China, for example, but a few unregistered flights by US aircraft over Europe.
This is something that should not be tolerated, and cannot go on.
For that reason I firmly support the idea that this committee, which is regarded by some of its members as a mixture of anti-Americanism and the wish for political influence, be terminated, and that these people get to work in places where human and civil rights really are being violated â and unfortunately there are still too many of those countries in the world.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the committeeâs great claim was that it was in the business of establishing fact, and it has made a credible job of it, with 26 hearings, a visit to the USA, and close cooperation with the Council of Europe and the Commission, not least here in this House, but has anything new emerged from all this?
One cannot avoid the conclusion that what it has come up with is quite negligible, and rightly too, for that only goes to show either that no offences were committed, or that those that were were isolated occurrences.
I was, then, all the more astonished when I eventually came to read the report, which was one-sided, tendentious, and did not reflect that which was brought to light during the committeeâs deliberations.
I would like to ask those on the other side of the House why they refused, when it came to the vote in committee, to incorporate what MrÂ deÂ Vries and MrÂ Solana actually found out, that being that there was no proof.
Why, I ask you, did you refuse to incorporate a statement to the effect that no evidence could be found that secret prisons actually existed?
Why did you refuse to include what was said by MrÂ Bellinger in the USA?
Why did you refuse to include a reference to the fact that it had been established in the USA that that country had not made any use of torture?
Tomorrow will see the European Peopleâs Party making another attempt to introduce balance into the report and to include in it the conclusions to which the committee actually came.
The real test for you will be whether you will vote in favour of the facts and of what was actually said in the committee, whether you want to have broad majority support for this report, or whether you want to leave it as it is â one-sided, tendentious, and failing to set out the facts that actually emerged from the committeeâs hearings.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate forms part of a wider discussion about the best way of fighting international terrorism.
One thing that is paramount in this has also been clearly encapsulated in MrÂ Favaâs report, namely where he states that we can never win the battle against international terrorism if we sacrifice the very principles we seek to uphold in the fight against it.
It is this, then, on which we have focussed.
What are the indications that the CIA, or other security services, quite possibly without our governmentsâ knowledge, have taken action that contravenes the fundamental rights and freedoms?
To what extent has national and international law been violated in the process?
These are very serious questions that fully justify the investigation.
We cannot cover up the questions that have been raised, because that would seriously harm public confidence at a time when we need all the confidence we can get in order to be able fight terrorism effectively, yet fairly, of course.
The interim results of the investigation show the need to resume the investigation after the summer.
There is no doubt that extraordinary renditions via European airports have taken place.
It is highly likely that various European governments were aware of this practice and it is likely that European and international human rights agreements were violated in the process.
Moreover, the investigation clearly showed up the serious loopholes in our legislation and in our monitoring practices.
These activities took place in the twilight zone which we left open.
Following on from the investigation, we will, then, need to concentrate on two things.
Firstly, to what extent were Member States and candidate countries involved in this, and, secondly, what needs to be done in order to plug the loopholes in law and legislation in order to avoid this happening again?
Â Â  Mr President, the evidence of a sinister spiderâs web of CIA torture flights crisscrossing Europe is overwhelming.
I have every confidence in stating that the CIA is directly responsible for the illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of people on the territory of Member States.
It is through criminal intention, implicit approval and gross negligence that such large-scale human rights abuse has been permitted to take place.
Either way, it is clear that security forces in some Member States are working outside the reach of proper and effective governmental control and scrutiny.
Soon we will remember the victims of the London bombings.
The UK response has been the adoption of shoot-to-kill policies on the basis of guidance from the security forces in the war on terror, which has seen an innocent man killed in my own country and another lucky to be alive.
They, along with so many others, are also victims.
Their only crime was to be visibly different from the majority.
Governments have underlined the importance of leaving no stone unturned when justifying the intolerable suspension of civil liberties in the name of national security, rendering certain sections of our population subject to unrelenting, imbalanced scrutiny.
This is where this House must step in for the good of all our citizens.
Now it is time to focus due scrutiny on the actions of our security forces, reining them back to the fold of governmental control so that we can guarantee Community security for the whole of the European Union, preserving the rule of law and our democratic institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the practice used by the CIA that is the subject of todayâs discussion is part of an established tradition in US administrations, from the War of Secession onwards, through the genocide of the American Indians, to connivance with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
The Fava report, substantiated by little evidence because of the obstacles put in the way of the committee by many EU governments, is not in itself sufficient to prove the political dependence of Europe.
Nobody wants to protect terrorists and nobody wants to show out-and-out anti-Americanism, but we cannot help but acknowledge that there have been breaches of human rights and repeated violations of the sovereignty of Member States throughout the EU.
Not to do so would play into the hands of anti-European interests.
Â Â  Mr President, the subject under discussion is of vital importance.
After all, the way suspects are treated is, in effect, at the very heart of the values in which we in the EU share.
It should, therefore, become clear, in the interest of the public and the European Union itself, what has, and has not, happened.
I would, then, congratulate all those who have shown great commitment to the investigation, and who will take it further.
I should nevertheless like to point out that there has been more hypothesis than proof to date.
That is understandable to some degree, for we find ourselves in a tricky situation.
If this proves anything, it is that Europe is not complete.
Commissioners must be given more powers in the area of investigations and should be able to approach the Member States with a view to unearthing the truth.
This House, which is quite powerless in comparison to the investigation methods of national parliaments, should also be given more powers where investigations are concerned.
We should now make do, though, with the means that are at our disposal.
We found the vote in committee unsatisfactory on the grounds that a number of sound amendments we had tabled were not adopted.
What is at stake at the moment is finding out the truth and regaining confidence.
I call on everyone to throw their full weight behind those amendments that narrow the gap between what has already been proven and what is being claimed.
In particular, I would like to see a more realistic reflection of the number of cases in respect of which evidence has been gathered, of the remarks of the terrorism coordinator MrÂ DeÂ Vries, MrÂ Solana and MrÂ Bellinger and also the clear statement that no proof has as yet been found for the existence of secret prisons in Member States.
I think that that would enhance the credibility of the Commissionâs work and, with it, support in the plenary.
It is up to our committee to continue the work, and that can go two ways.
Either more proof will as yet be submitted and sound conclusions can be drawn, or no more proof will be submitted, in which case the conclusions should be toned down for the sake of integrity.
The latter is not necessarily a bad conclusion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, those who have been defending this committee and are now also defending its report are often accused of anti-Americanism, but is the United States Supreme Court anti-American simply on the grounds that it insists on due process of law where Guantanamo Bay is concerned?
Are, indeed, all those in America who look to see whether the war on terror is being waged in accordance with legal principles to be described as anti-American?
No, I really do not believe that they can be!
Secondly, we are then told that we are undermining the war on terror.
We are all in favour of the war on terror, but what it calls for is broad support, popular support, in Europe, so if we want to wage this war, we need support from the people, who have no less interest in the rule of law being upheld than we do.
We must explicitly uphold the rule of law as an essential element in the European Union, and this is a point that Commissioner Frattini constantly, and rightly, makes.
Thirdly, whom do you want to punish?
This should not be about punishing just anyone; let us be frank: in the aftermath of 11Â September and that dreadful deed and the terrorist activities in America, we did perhaps take too relaxed an approach.
It was believed in various European states that rapid action was called for and that we had to support the Americans, and that I can understand.
Now, though, we have to get back to the rule of law, which is absolutely necessary if war is to be waged on terrorism with any success, and one of this committeeâs essential objectives is to ensure that the war on terror can, in future, be waged effectively and in accordance with sound legal principles.
Â Â  Mr President, action against terrorism has eroded human rights and is eroding the protection of ordinary citizensâ privacy in Europe and outside it.
A recent report on human rights produced by the International Helsinki Federation states that in the last three years the human rights situation has deteriorated globally.
The EU must work on the basis that terrorism is to be opposed through legitimate means and in a way that respects both international and national law.
Finally, I would like to quote my favourite American writer, Thomas L. Friedman, from his book âThe World is Flatâ:
The world is flat.
Americaâs role in the world has been as the country that looks forwards, not back.
One of the most dangerous things that has happened to America since 9/11 under the Bush administration is that the United States has gone from exporting hope to exporting fear.
If that is true it is very dangerous.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the important purpose of the report that we are discussing is to establish the responsibility of individuals or organisations for possible offences committed in breach of human rights.
This report, however, cannot and must not become an instrumental act of accusation against the United States and other countries involved in the front line in the fight against terrorism.
The political purpose must never distort the truth out of contempt for the principles of law.
As for the events in Italy, I would like to highlight a few points.
In the first place, the Italian Government and the security services organisation have always stated, at all parliamentary sittings, that they had no connection whatsoever with the events leading to the capture of Abu Omar and so far nobody has been able to prove the contrary.
I would also like to express my solidarity with MrÂ Frattini, who has been attacked by MrÂ Catania: any possible personal liability cannot involve the Institutions.
Secondly, last Monday Abu Omar was again arrested in Cairo because he was considered a threat to the security of the Egyptian State.
Third, the Milanese mosque in Viale Jenner, well-known even outside Italy because it has been involved in investigations into terrorism, today expressed satisfaction at the arrest of the two representatives of the military secret service.
I am also astonished at the rapporteurâs one-sided defence of civil rights in this matter, where, in contradiction to European legal culture, arrest is conflated with conviction, a confusion that the rapporteur did not make, however, in the case of Abu Omar.
Fourth, the magistrate who arrested the two directors of the Sismi at the same time ordered a search to be carried out at the headquarters of a daily newspaper and at the houses of two journalists who had dealt with the Abu Omar case.
This was a flagrant breach of the freedom of the press, in particular because the procedure was directed against a newspaper that is highly critical of the government and involved in combating terrorism.
Finally, it would be a good idea to remember that, in five years of centre-right government in Italy, there were no terrorist attacks, but rather many attempts were foiled.
Many lives have been saved through the sacrifice of the police, the armed forces and the security services.
Â Â  Mr President, the setting up of our temporary committee has allowed us to ascertain beyond doubt that the CIA has indeed seized people on Union territory with a view to transporting them to countries where they could be interrogated.
Laws exist to protect our citizens, but these practices are not acceptable in our democratic societies.
We must send a clear message to the US administration: we are prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism but provided that the rule of law is adhered to.
It is unacceptable for Member States of the European Union to turn a blind eye to intolerable violations of fundamental rights.
That is why we urge national parliaments to take up this issue, in order to shed every possible light on what has really taken place on their territory.
Finally, I am pleased with the work that our temporary committee has done and I congratulate our rapporteur most warmly on his high-quality and tireless work.
Â Â  Mr President, a great deal has already been said about the importance of values based on human rights.
Respecting these values is the duty of all the institutions, countries and citizens of the European Union.
One of these values, which arises from the European legal tradition, is the old principle of innocence until proved guilty.
If we want this principle to be used with respect to persons accused of terrorism, we cannot give a negative example ourselves.
In my view MrÂ Favaâs report was biased, and based primarily on doubt, conjecture and circumstantial evidence.
The report confirms only two previously known facts, the Italian and the Swedish cases, which are already being dealt with by the relevant domestic authorities of these countries.
In this situation, should our committee not concentrate on looking for legal solutions which would prevent any such misdeeds in the future?
Should we not work harder on proper legislation and the use of European air space, try and get the Member States to adopt legislation about common counter-terrorism measures, and monitor the Member States whose legislation does not include terrorism as a crime?
Only such action would provide legal protection for all those we suspect or may suspect of terrorism.
We should ensure that the laws and procedures in the fight against terrorism, even in the area that is by nature kept secret, still provide sanctions and punish breaches of human rights and dignity.
Secrecy should not mean illegality.
However, Member States should themselves deal with punishing the guilty.
Our committee does not have the competence or the authority to do so.
How the governments of the Member States deal with the accusations levelled at them by public opinion, and how they collaborate with the committee, is another matter.
For the Member States this is a test, a check how well their agencies comply with international treaties; if we do not implement this we will always be surrounded by the demons of suspicion and by accusations that are in many cases unfounded.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking in order to express my support for MrÂ Favaâs report, and I hope that he will receive the backing tomorrow to continue his investigation.
The kidnappings of people and the so-called âCIA flightsâ are horrendous and are something that Europe and this Parliament cannot tolerate.
Thanks to the determination and rigour of the US press we know that at least 480 people are in the sinister prison at GuantÃ¡namo, with no legal guarantees.
This is morally and legally monstrous.
Some of those prisoners have passed through Europe under illegal detention; other kidnapped people have been released and have spoken to us here.
There is no question that abhorrent activities are habitually taking place.
This generation cannot and must not tolerate this situation, as some of our predecessors did by not facing up to the existence of death camps.
Crimes against human rights cannot go unpunished, and must never be forgotten, as happened in the case of other flights by former dictatorships in Argentina and Chile.
Certain governments, the Spanish and German Governments, for example, have offered to cooperate with the committee chaired by MrÂ Coelho, and that is something we should be grateful for.
Â Â  â The interim report before us today is the fruit of the work of a committee that unfortunately opted to make up for a lack of investigatory powers by pulling out all the stops to issue political judgment on the activities of the USAâs allies in Europe.
Six months of work in the committee has revealed nothing that had not already appeared in the media.
It irks me that the majority of the committee has drawn subjective, distorted conclusions from a few facts and from a huge number of unsubstantiated rumours.
I fear that the committeeâs irresponsible approach may lead not only to Parliamentâs credibility being eroded, but also to trust between the European and US allies being damaged.
This trust is key to winning the fight against terrorism, to ensuring the security of the transatlantic area and to guaranteeing the stability of international relations as a whole.
I want to emphasise that the fight against terrorism must be pursued in compliance with international law and with respect for human rights.
At the same time, however, it is wrong to present a series of mistakes that may have occurred in the context of complex global antiâterror operations as a systemic problem.
If there are suspicions that human rights have been violated in EU countries, they should be investigated by the judicial systems of the Member States.
Rather than unsubstantiated denunciations of the US secret services, the EUâs political authorities should be focusing on how to prevent terrorism effectively and how to meet their responsibilities as regards world security, in close cooperation with the allies and in compliance with the fundamental principles of international law.
I firmly believe, Mr President, that Parliament should take the opportunity to amend the report to ensure that our work is credible.
Otherwise, I will have no option but to reject this temporary committee report, along with the entire Czech contingent from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has agreed on this course of action.
Â Â  â The Martin and Fava reports confirm that a gang that does not care how it achieves its aims and disrespects the essential values of justice and human rights has infiltrated the Administration of our US ally and has managed to forge the active and passive complicity of our governments and state services in the practice of rape, kidnapping, torture, and other crimes against people suspected of acts of terror, but who have yet to have charges brought against them, let alone face trial.
The US Supreme Court has recently said that in the prisons of GuantÃ¡namo and Kabul, where so-called unlawful combatants are festering, Washington is not only holding them unlawfully, it is keeping them in prison in breach of both US and international law.
It is in breach of laws that have been used, and continue to be used to try and pass sentence on the most odious criminals, including the Nazis.
When it accused the Bush Administration, the Supreme Court also accused European politicians and agents of appalling complicity.
This committee of inquiry, led with professionalism by MrÂ Coelho and MrÂ Fava, can and should demand the parliamentary oversight of the Member Statesâ security services and detailed inspections of airport authorities in order to stop extraordinary rendition.
This committee of inquiry will help to clarify how far and to what level of political authority Europe's complicity went.
The courts can and must do justice, by compensating the innocent people who suffered and by punishing those who twisted rather than promoted the rule of law, and who, worse still, by violating the law and human rights were failing to serve Europeâs security and defence; instead, they were sinking to the terroristsâ level.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcomed the European Parliament's decision to set up a temporary committee to look into alleged abductions of prisoners and violations of their human rights.
I joined the inquiry with great interest and enthusiasm.
I have participated in the vast majority of hearings held by the committee to date, and I have listened with interest to everything the relevant invited guests had to say.
While it was our objective to establish whether the CIA had been using unlawful means in fighting terrorism, unlike a court of law we were not able to interview witnesses under oath.
The key was to ascertain whether the persons detained had been subjected to torture during interrogations and moved to third countries against their will.
I must point out, however, that the testimony given by the witnesses was fairly unconvincing.
Sometimes they would even testify indirectly, and sometimes it would be a lawyer speaking.
On yet another occasion a British diplomat testified, barely concealing his resentment against the UK Government for dismissing him from the diplomatic service.
Nor did Senator Marty persuade me, as his replies were no better than news reports and unable to prove anything apart from suspicions.
I believe that he went too far in attacking the Polish Government despite the fact the Polish authorities have repeatedly indicated that they were unable to prove the existence of detention facilities in their country.
As an MEP from one of the new Member States, I am primarily interested in the human rights and justice dimension; hence, I wanted to know whether my country has hosted any such illegal facility.
I was therefore pleased to learn from the relevant authorities, including the government, justice minister and director of the intelligence service that they could not confirm that any such facilities had been set up in Slovakia or that there had been any secret CIA flights to or over Slovakia.
In the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats we take a critical view of the approach adopted by the rapporteur, who likes to interpret suspicions as hard evidence.
One cannot avoid forming the impression (and I am about to wind up my speech) that in the course of committee deliberations the left-wing MEPs have abandoned fact-finding in favour of maligning the United States, the country that has taken the lead in fighting terrorism.
Unless the left accepts realistic amendments that contribute significantly towards establishing the truth, I will have to consider whether I can support the report in its current form.
Â Â  â Mr President, we usually say, if you want to find the crime, follow the money.
In this particular instance, you have to follow the aeroplanes.
Over recent months a series of apparently innocent flights between Europe and the USA has highlighted the huge issues which arise when you try to combat terrorism while ignoring fundamental rights.
In the first instance, of abductions by the CIA, over 1Â 000 secret service flights landed at and took off from European airports, but were not subject to the slightest check by the competent European authorities which, even if they did not cooperate directly with them, opted for the 'see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing' approach.
In the second instance, in a rare case of hasty cooperation between governments at European level, an agreement riddled with holes was signed with the USA, known as the transfer of Passenger Name Records or PNR, not only without adequate proof of the need for the measures, but also with barely any fundamental safeguarding of binding American obligations for the secure and legal use of our data.
The European governments are today directly obliged, both individually and in cooperation with each other, to take all the necessary measures which will ensure that illegal CIA flights are not repeated.
This requires explicit instructions to their civil aviation authorities so that at least the aeroplanes which we know were CIA aeroplanes and at least the front companies that we know were CIA companies are controlled from now on together, of course, with more efficient and democratic controls of their secret services.
I thank you and, on behalf of all of us, I especially thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Fava, on his excellent work.
Â Â  Mr President, time and again this Chamber has condemned terrorists and therefore it is needless to extend the rhetoric on this horrible phenomenon.
I shall just say that we cannot forget the tragedy of September 11; we cannot forget the London bloodshed; we cannot forget the Madrid massacre.
We cannot, of course, ignore the fact that the USA is the central target of terrorism and we cannot underestimate the fact that the main task of combating terrorism falls on its shoulders.
However, at the same time, we cannot forget that human rights are a cornerstone of modern European political philosophy.
Therefore, despite our understanding of the USAâs role in combating terrorism, we cannot shut our eyes to certain activities that are contrary to European principles, values and rules.
It is a fact that the CIA abused the understanding of certain countries.
We condemn the practices of the CIA.
We strongly condemn the CIA for the acts referred to by previous speakers and in MrÂ Favaâs report: extraordinary renditions, suspicious flights.
We do the Americans no service if we leave the right of criticism of the CIA for acts committed in violation of human rights to those who are passionately anti-American.
I agree with Mr Coelho, Chairman of the Temporary Committee, that in general MrÂ Favaâs report is good.
However, it could be made more balanced if amendments stressing the other side of the coin were accepted.
I appeal therefore to the rapporteur and to the other political groups to accept certain basic amendments proposed by MrÂ Gawronski, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, so that this House votes unanimously on two main points: firstly on the condemnation of terrorists and secondly on the protection of human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, as the final speaker from the Socialist Group, I would like to commend not only my previous colleagues and the rapporteur, but also the balanced approach we heard from Mr Coelho and the interesting comments by the Commissioner on greater transparency and reform of the intelligence services.
It is for all those reasons that we must extend this report.
People opposite have talked about circumstantial evidence.
They must understand that we called on the testimony of 70 people and spent over 50 hours in this committee, not because we are anti-American â and I commend our rapporteur for never, ever, falling into that trap â but because we wanted to get to the truth.
The previous speaker spoke about 7/7 and London.
There are one or two Members in this Chamber who represent the area affected by that bombing.
The people who have written to us are not anti-American; they want anti-terrorism to be strengthened because human rights are being strengthened.
That is the approach of my Socialist colleagues and of many Members across this House.
Why should we continue?
We should continue because of the testimony of people like Maher Arar, whom I listened to and believed.
Do I know that he is telling the final truth?
No, I do not, because we are waiting for the Member States and for those who have not spoken to finally speak.
That is why we need to extend this report and to extend the time we have.
Why else do we need to extend the time?
We are telling European citizens that we will talk about the minute legislative detail, but are we also telling them that, when they are concerned about transparency and human rights and allegations they know very little about, we as a Parliament cannot deal with that?
We have to tell them we can deal with the issue credibly.
We see it happening in the Council of Europe, and they should also see it happening in their Parliament.
On our side of the House, we want to see the report extended, because we believe we have the right approach.
Â Â  Mr President, unlike Mr Moraes I was opposed from the very start to the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, and it should stop right now in its tracks.
It is an expensive exercise, duplicating Senator Martyâs efforts in the Council of Europe, and one driven by a political desire by the left and liberals to bash America, and the CIA in particular, in their efforts to fight global terrorism.
I believe that the Fava report is heavy on allegations and accusations, but light on proof.
In a hazardous project as widespread in the west as fighting terrorism, inevitably some mistakes and excesses may have occurred, but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries.
Furthermore, there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland.
Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact, but not necessarily illegal under international law where torture is not involved.
In any case, I agree with Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Professor of Law, when he argues that there exists a vast black hole in international law as regards combating terrorism, with categorisation of detainees anachronistic and the rules governing how such detainees are treated currently dangerously blurred.
I believe that he is correct in arguing that many of us tend to stick with comfortable old ways, rather than addressing the difficult adjustments to the law that we may need to make vis-Ã -vis the balance we have to strike between human rights and the security of our public.
Furthermore, a recent visit to GuantÃ¡namo by MEP colleagues from this House vindicated my long-held view that immediate, as opposed to long-term, closure of GuantÃ¡namo is not desirable, as many of those held there are extremely dangerous threats to our EU Member Statesâ national security and it is not possible to deport these individuals, as many might face execution or torture if returned to their home countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt, where they are well known and wanted as known terrorists.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the so-called âCIA flightsâ really have got Europeâs political class seriously rattled.
The elucidation of the circumstances under which, in various European states, suspects were alleged to have been seized and their rendition organised, is still patchy, and that may well be because there is in fact less to bring to light than some particularly zealous persons who are critical of America or hostile to it had hoped.
Let me say something fundamental about what has been going on over the past few weeks: Europe in general and we in this House too should not, in a difficult time like this one, be dissipating our energies with enterprises the ultimate motivation behind which is the need of certain persons to distance themselves from the United States.
We still have no certainty of eventually getting the Constitution in place.
There are complicated issues concerning the enlargement of the Union, our common identity and the limits of the European project that we have to address.
As regards all these issues, there are far fewer proposals for solutions on the table than the development of Europe could do with.
With things as they are, it strikes me as reflecting a rather idiosyncratic scheme of priorities for all the European institutions to devote their attention to CIA flights up to the point where the main thing we know is that we know nothing.
Europe has more serious problems to deal with than the question of whether someone or other was flown somewhere or other from one Member State of the EU or another â or was not, as the case may be.
If we want ourselves to be taken seriously, then we should dissolve this superfluous committee at once and, in short order, move on to thinking more about ourselves than about the possible misdeeds of a state that is our strongest ally and will â I hope â remain so in future.
It is with all these considerations in mind that I will be voting against the anti-American resolution with which we have been presented.
Â Â  Mr President, six months ago we set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of extraordinary rendition flights by the CIA and the involvement of EU countries.
There have been many hours of hearings and debates in the committee since then and now we have our first interim report.
An honest assessment of the committeeâs work to date would give a mixed picture, I believe.
On the one hand there has been a certain level of frustration that new evidence and facts have not been forthcoming in most of our hearings.
However, that said, I believe that the committeeâs work has been useful in outlining and exposing all of the facts that are available to date, and certain facts are available.
Even if we are reconsidering evidence already exposed by the Council of Europe, we need to be realistic.
Our committee is not a court of law; we are politicians attempting to draw conclusions based on the balance of probability, given the evidence available.
Investigating the activities of the CIA or any secret services was never going to be a straightforward exercise.
I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues, such as the possible existence of âblack sitesâ in EU Member States.
It is unfortunate that the debate on whether or not to support this report has been reduced by some to a polarising of positions, a pro- and anti-US stance, or even a left versus right divide.
I am sorry that view has developed as it undermines the work of a well-intentioned committee and misses the point as regards what we are trying to achieve.
It is not anti-American to criticise extraordinary rendition or to push to establish facts, particularly if there are accusations against EU Member States in this regard.
I would consider myself a hypocrite as a human rights spokesperson if I did not speak out against extraordinary rendition, even if it means criticising and asking awkward questions of governments that I consider to be our friends and allies.
I include the US in that.
No approach to the necessary and difficult war on terrorism should be supported if it involves acting outside the rule of international law and the various standards that we, in Europe, stand up for.
The interim report is not a perfect one, but the acceptance of PPE-DE amendments will add balance to a text worth supporting.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken; their speeches have given me many useful ideas.
I can confirm that the European Commission is ready to continue working with this Parliamentâs temporary committee on the many fundamental issues that have been addressed.
MrsÂ Ludford has touched on the theme of the implementation of anti-terrorism legislation by Member States, a central issue on which we certainly need to work.
As you will know, unfortunately five EU Member States have not yet even transposed the European framework decision on combating terrorism; you also know that only seven out of the 25 States have ratified the Europe-United States agreement on extradition, an agreement which, if it were to come into force, would certainly clarify the legal framework precisely regarding the transfer of prisoners.
Some speakers, such as MrÂ Swoboda and MrsÂ in'tÂ Veld, have mentioned the possibility and the need to work together for improved security and greater freedom.
I totally agree and I welcome the proposal made for structured, political dialogue with the United States of America on the theme of the fight against terrorism, simultaneously with the theme of safeguarding freedom.
I can tell you that I had already thought about this and as early as last February I suggested that this dialogue should begin at expert level, and it has now begun.
I believe that this dialogue can proceed and I already know that the Finnish Presidency intends to move forward in this area.
I think that it will be possible to exchange assessments with Parliament on the Europe-USA umbrella framework, on the fight against terrorism and on the guarantees of freedom.
Furthermore, I believe that the GuantÃ¡namo judgment handed down by the US Supreme Court proves that the system for legally supervising guarantees and rights under the US democratic system does indeed function and provides a reassuring basis for our joint work.
I am also ready for a dialogue with Parliament on the lines for restructuring the intelligence system, including democratic and parliamentary control of intelligence services; even though, as you know, national legislation alone is competent in this case, I think that a political debate on this subject would be useful.
It will also be useful to discuss the use of airspace by non-civil aviation and I can confirm that there is an ongoing debate on the notion of state aircraft and flights for institutional and State assignments; I have gathered very interesting opinions on the role of national courts, which will have their say in providing a response as to individual responsibility when the right conditions exist.
What I have said confirms my willingness, and that of all the European Commission services, to work with the temporary committee.
In conclusion, Mr President, I have the moral and institutional obligation, above all to myself, to respond to a personal attack on me made by MrÂ Catania, the only one of the 54 speakers who has asked me, for the fourth time, to clarify my role as Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time of the Abu Omar case.
I think that this question, which I have answered several times before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, may well gain MrÂ Catania a mention in some headline in the Italian newspapers, but I would have thought that the obligation to tell the truth to this Parliament would have imposed on him the same duty as it does on me: to remember that the government at that time formally denied any knowledge of the Abu Omar case and did so without there being any proof to the contrary.
Under Italian law, however, and here it is not a matter of opinion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the post that I held at that time, not only cannot but must not know about the operating activities of the Italian secret services.
That is a piece of information on Italian laws of which MrÂ Catania is aware, but of which many of you are not.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 6Â July 2006, at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the interception of bank transfer data from the SWIFT system by the US secret services.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this matter is in many of its aspects important, but, regrettably, the Council cannot confirm the information recently put out by the media regarding transfers of data between the SWIFT system and the United States, nor comment on them.
As all of us in this House know, the Council does not have the means to investigate actions which are contrary to applicable law in this case.
The national authorities are responsible for this sort of enquiry.
If, on the other hand, it concerns actions that go against Community legislation, the responsibility lies with the national authorities and the Commission under the supervision of national and Community courts of justice.
The Council assumes that current cooperation between private companies like SWIFT and the US authorities will be in accordance with applicable law and in compliance with fundamental rights.
The Council, like Parliament, is a legislating body and, as such, it would like to draw Parliamentâs attention to a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds.
This regulation is being discussed by both Parliament and the Council.
When this regulation has been passed, it will apply to transfers of funds in any currency sent or received by anyone offering payment services based within the Community.
ArticleÂ 14 of the proposed regulation states that anyone providing payment services must respond immediately and thoroughly to requests made by the authorities responsible for the prevention of money laundering or the financing of terrorism in the Member State in which they are located and which concern data to be disclosed on the payer accompanying transfers of funds and storing this information.
The Council believes that this Community act, in line as it is with fundamental rights, will strengthen the legislative framework needed to prevent flows of dirty money which come about through transfers of funds and which can harm the stability and reputation of the financial sector.
At the same time, the regulation will prevent all types of illegal action targeted at the Community financing system.
Given how widespread the activity is and the impact it has, the Member States cannot implement the aims of this regulation adequately: it will be effected better at Community level.
It is therefore urgent to pass this regulation.
The regulation is to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure.
On 6Â December 2005 the Council agreed on the general conception of the proposal.
In the wake of some unofficial meetings between representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Presidency hopes that a compromise solution for the regulation as a whole can be shortly agreed.
We will be closely monitoring the legislative work to prevent, , illegal and unjustified activity against the financing system.
The Commission is also debating the Commissionâs Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The Commission put forward the proposal on 4Â October 2005.
The framework decision aims to ensure that personal data on European citizens has a high level of protection.
That requires common regulations, so that we can determine the legality and quality of data being processed by the competent authorities in the Member States.
Although the proposal will not apply to the financing system directly, it will provide for the protection of personal data and may also be important for a case that is being dealt with.
The proposal is being discussed by the competent bodies within the Council.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that our common will is to protect European citizens not only from terrorism but also all kinds of illegal activity targeted at the European financing system, with reference too to Community measures and legislation.
Â Â  . Mr President, on this very sensitive issue, at the moment the Commission has only partial information, which we have already requested to be supplemented as soon as possible, regarding the exact facts as to how the American authorities obtained access to data on financial transactions held by SWIFT.
At present, it seems that there was a transfer of financial information between private companies from the EU to the United States.
I understand that several authorities in Europe, including the European Central Bank, were informed.
I quote from a statement from the American Treasury issued on 23Â June: âSWIFT is overseen by a committee drawn from major central banks, including the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the lead overseer, the National Bank of Belgium.
The overseers have been informed about SWIFTâs participation with the Treasury and the safeguards and assurances put in placeâ.
I repeat that I was quoting there from a statement of the American Treasury.
I can assure you that this information, of which I am now aware, was not passed on to the Commission previously, because the transfer of such financial information falls within the scope of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.
National authorities are primarily responsible for the proper application of the data protection rules.
I trust that European Member States will take all the necessary action to ensure that their national data protection legislation is properly applied and strictly enforced.
I observe that the Belgian Prime Minister has already asked the Justice Ministry to investigate and that the Belgian Data Protection Supervisory Commission is being equally active in assessing the circumstances under which this particular transfer has taken place.
In any case, the Commission will follow the developments very closely and, if necessary, we will make full use of our powers under the Treaty.
I stress that, at this stage, I do not know whether this would be appropriate, as we have first to learn from the Belgian authorities what exactly happened, how and why.
As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, stated on Monday before this Parliament, the regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, on which you will vote tomorrow, contains the appropriate safeguards on data protection and access by competent authorities to such data.
I recalled that the European Data Protection Supervisor provided a positive assessment and did not detect any data protection concerns.
I think, therefore, that the SWIFT affair should not delay the regulation on information on the payer accompanying the transfer of funds, the adoption of which is essential to detecting terrorist financing.
Let me finish by stressing once again my commitment to the fight against terrorism and to the identification of methods used to finance it, acting, of course, within the full rule of law and in accordance with our fundamental rights.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki, SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide International Financial Telecommunication, has stated that it, acting upon a request from the American Department of Finance, passed on to the American authorities a limited amount of information concerning international money transfers.
This information can be found on the companyâs website.
According to the statement by the Belgian data company, moreover, cooperation with the authorities is intended to prevent misuse of the international financial system.
The Belgian Government â according to press reports, at any rate â is already investigating whether the US administrationâs research activities were in breach of national law, and this is something to which Commissioner Frattini has just referred.
The Belgian minister for justice has also set in motion investigations into this matter, and her department is, in the initial stages at any rate, the right one to be investigating this sort of thing, for, according to current law, it is the Belgian legal system that must take action and make inquiries.
Considering carefully what the Commissioner has just again said, and thinking about how much we know about this at the present time, I have to come to the conclusion that we know nothing for certain, and have not yet reached the stage at which we would be obliged to investigate.
We know that there are EU-wide rules on the protection of civilian data, and the planned European legislation on the handling of private data in connection with the prosecution of crime and the war on terror â at least as far as I am aware â is, as things stand, going to contain only rules on how state authorities should handle sensitive data, and so I think we should, as a matter of urgency, aim to use European legislation, once it has been adopted, to intervene and take action at an early opportunity.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we have learned from investigative journalists that, for the purposes of combating the funding of terrorism, the American authorities have apparently put in place a programme for intercepting the financial transactions handled by the SWIFT bank.
This has been confirmed by President Bush and by SWIFT itself.
Data protection is not an obstacle to the work of the police authorities. Rather, it is there to guarantee respect for fundamental rights.
Clearly, European countries were not informed of these activities, but â as you said, MrÂ Frattini â the European Central Bank would have known about them.
The European Central Bank is a European institution.
It has to comply with data protection legislation, and that is why we want the European Data Protection Supervisor to check without delay that the European Central Bank has respected the laws.
Finally, we must make sure that there is no gap in the legislation on the protection of personal data.
Even if we still do not have a European document regulating data protection within the framework of police activities, existing legislation requires respect for national legislation in the case of any exchange of data provided for in the context of public security.
Such exchanges must, moreover, be authorised by the Member States.
I would also draw the attention of the Council, MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki and the Commission to AmendmentsÂ 26 and 58 of my report on data protection under the third pillar.
These are designed to regulate the way in which data is handled when it is collected by private parties in the public interest, and it is in that activity that the problem lies, I believe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly I should like to welcome MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki.
I simply want to say to her that I have listened to what she has said and I think it necessary to point out the following: our government takes the form of the Council of Ministers or European Council.
Although it may not have the legal or political tools to take a decision regarding this scandal â by which I mean the SWIFT affair â which has followed on from that involving clandestine flights, there is nothing to stop it affirming its moral virtue and saying publicly what it thinks about it - something that, as far as I know, it has still not done.
The second thing I wish to say is that I have taken careful note of what the Vice-President of the Commission, MrÂ Frattini, said about neither he nor his department knowing anything about this case.
I share the opinion of my two fellow Members, MrsÂ Klamt and MrsÂ Roure, who have just spoken on this matter.
In Europe, and more specifically in the EU, we have progressively constructed a state governed by the rule of law in which any transfer of personal data to third countries must, of absolute necessity, obey national or European rules.
The first of these rules states that any transfer must be authorised by a judicial authority, and no one else.
Neither a State nor a bank is the owner of the information of which it makes use.
If the data concerned relates to companies, it is the property of those companies. If it relates to individuals, it is the property of those individuals.
There is no authorisation for others to use it in transactions, to appropriate it, to pass it on to others or to dispose of it in heaven knows what other ways.
I would point out that the legal instrument exists, and I would recall what MrsÂ Roure said just now to the effect that it would be a really very important step if we were to succeed in sorting out this matter under the Finnish Presidency.
I should also like to say one last thing.
There is a French proverb that reads, âDo not trust my friends; as for my enemies, they are for me to take care ofâ.
The enemy is terrorism, and our friends are the Americans.
After the clandestine flights, the abduction of European citizens rightly or wrongly under suspicion and the illegal transfers of prisoners using aircraft landing on European soil, we now learn that, friend of ours though it may be, a power in alliance with ourselves has been rooting around in our bank accounts.
When will the blood samples start to be taken?
When shall we start having to submit details of births and so forth?
Emphatically, enough is enough.
Parliament really does need to put a stop to this type of thing.
I shall conclude by saying that, if I have properly understood the matter, terrorism is the enemy of our freedoms and, in return, liberty is the enemy of terrorism.
It is certainly not the enemy of ordinary people.
In this area, too, the United States now needs to decide which side it is on.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we would be making a mistake if we regarded the SWIFT matter as an isolated event.
It is a matter that should be seen in a wider context, referring to PNR, to the control of communications and to data retention, and this subject is not unconnected with the topic of rendition that we were addressing just a few minutes ago.
In fact I would say that the SWIFT affair is the other side of the rendition coin; it may be a less violent operation, but it has exactly the same purpose: to extract information.
The systematic surveillance of the lives of European citizens has now become commonplace and we are facing what George Orwell called âBig Brotherâ, in the name of the fight against terrorism.
I think we should conduct an inquiry into the responsibility of the European Central Bank and national banks, since I believe that this situation is unacceptable.
One week ago, , the Belgian daily newspaper with the highest circulation, ran a headline: âthe CIA lays down the law in Europeâ.
I think that this must be prevented from happening in the name of the credibility and the very future of Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I was concerned at the allegations published in the New York Times about a secret programme whereby the database of the SWIFT organisation â through which most of the worldâs financial transactions pass â was intercepted by the CIA.
This programme was confirmed by both SWIFT and the US Treasury Secretary.
We must restate our determination, on both sides of the Atlantic, to combat terrorism resolutely and effectively, but this must not be at the expense of full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law.
Regardless of my personal opinions on the matter, what appears to have happened is that data has been transferred to the United States with the aim of preventing and combating terrorism and other crimes.
In other words, these are operations relating to public security and the activities of the Member State in its area of criminal law.
If this is the case, it is clearly outside Community law.
This was what I took to be MrÂ Frattiniâs first reaction, through his spokesman, when he mentioned the extra-Community nature of this issue.
I do not know if this was lost in translation, or if MrÂ Frattini actually told us today, that in his view Directive 95/46 applies in this case.
This is an issue that needs to be resolved; either Directive 95/46 will be applied or the situation is outside the first pillar and outside Community law, and therefore the call for this framework decision on data protection under the third pillar to be adopted is justified.
In any event, the Member States must protect these data.
I therefore welcome the decision by the Belgian Government to launch an inquiry to discover what actually happened and the legality in respect of national law.
I await the results of this inquiry with interest.
Â Â  Mr President, it is important that we use todayâs debate to respond to the SWIFT case.
The present resolution contains a number of pertinent questions that have to be asked, because anxiety levels among the public shoot up when they read stories of that kind in the newspapers.
As in the debates held earlier today, this is yet another case of weighing up security interests against the interests of the civil liberties involved in public and corporate privacy.
Once again, this is about activities in the framework of the fight against international terrorism, which may well be carried out behind the backs of the monitoring bodies and may well be in contravention of international agreements guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms.
Although I do not want to draw direct comparisons between this case and the issue of CIA flights, the SWIFT case is not an isolated one, but an example of the way in which the Americans, in particular, hope to fight terrorism.
Todayâs debate is yet again an example of the need for discussing the nature of the war we are waging.
In this case too, we should ask ourselves whether all the rules have been complied with.
There is the suspicion, which has also been confirmed, that the European institutions were informed.
We want to know exactly what their responsibility in this case is and to what extent they have already been involved in monitoring the implementation of existing rules.
Above all, however, we want to prevent a situation in which we all operate in some kind of grey area, with the creation of a legal vacuum in which even the citizens no longer know where they stand.
The draft resolution contains a number of pertinent comments in that respect.
We also want â and this is something that the Commissioner has already mentioned â clarification about the role of the European institutions.
In addition, we want any legal loopholes plugged, thus making sure that if a similar exchange of data were to prove necessary in future, it would only be done with solid underpinning and in full compliance with certain guarantees and minimum standards.
We would also like to see the Member States being called to account about the implementation of the agreed rules.
Once again, we must really prevent people from getting the feeling that they are in a legal vacuum.
All loopholes in legislation must be plugged.
Â Â  Mr President, whether or not it is legal, I want to say that European citizens have never been told about the details of their bank accounts being monitored, and I regard it as a precondition that they should be.
I wonder how we would react if it were not the United States, but another country, that was checking our bank accounts, and whether we would be equally tolerant of that.
Turning to the question of effectiveness, the Council stated a moment ago that this is what is needed in the fight against terrorism.
I would draw your attention to the fact that Stuart Levey, the US Under-Secretary to the Treasury, pointed out two weeks ago that they are very successful in tracing financial transactions.
This did, though, drive the transactions of terrorists underground and therefore out of our reach and field of vision.
In the European Union, we must, as a matter or urgency, adopt cohesive, efficient and common policy that is based on democratic decision-making and guarantees the sound protection of personal data.
This really is becoming a matter of urgency.
Finally, I also endorse the view of those who claim that this is not an isolated incident.
Rendition flights, and also the handling of passenger details, are making it evident that the United States does not hold to agreements.
We in the European Union must speak with one voice and ensure that, together with our ally, we fight terrorism on a legal basis.
Â Â  The press have been writing about the US Governmentâs data mining of private financial records held by SWIFT, but they have not informed us whether this concerns SWIFT in the USA or whether it also applies to Europe.
If this is about SWIFT in the USA, then that is none of our business.
Access to SWIFT data in Europe is a matter administered primarily by Belgian authorities, who should grant all applications for access.
At present, the only thing we know is that SWIFT is supposed to share with the USA certain information related to the financing of terrorism.
There are two problems here.
Firstly, the European Parliament cannot engage in a serious debate about this issue merely on the basis of press coverage and vague statements.
Secondly, it has to abide by its treaties and be aware of its areas of jurisdiction.
We know that the Belgian authorities have launched an investigation into this, but do not yet have any results.
One thing we need to clarify is that access to the SWIFT system does not mean that ordinary transactions, such as the depositing and withdrawal of cash, cheques, electronic means of payment etc., are subject to data mining.
The Socialists and a number of other political groups think otherwise.
They have submitted a joint proposal for a resolution in which they state that US authorities have access to the records held by SWIFT and that this was an instance of the USA violating fundamental provisions on personal data protection.
These words are not, as MrÂ Wiersma says, assumptions, because they bandy them around as if they were facts.
Similarly, they have disregarded the fact that the Belgian Government is in charge of investigating the case and that the European Parliament has no role to play at this stage.
So, in order to preserve the dignity of the European Parliament and out of respect for EUâs , we, members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party and European Democrats, have adopted our own resolution in which we call everyoneâs attention to the rules of the game and in which we say that we should only have recourse to such resolutions when we can operate with incontrovertible facts.
This is the only way for the European Parliament to preserve its reputation in the public eye and ensure it does not turn into a glorified debating society.
I support the views of Commissioner Frattini and call on Members of the Parliament to support our resolution as it complies fully with the and the ethics and standards of conduct of the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, the SWIFT scandal, in conjunction with the problematic recital of the recent decision by the European Court of the otherwise correct rejection of the transfer of Passenger Name Records agreement, highlight an exceptionally dangerous grey zone which is starting to arise around the use of sensitive personal data to combat terrorism.
To be specific, any third country, not just the USA, now appears to be able, merely by citing even fictitious reasons of national security, to define:
- firstly, the decision-making level in the European Union; in other words, if decisions will be taken at Community or national level;
- secondly, which European legislation will apply and
- thirdly, the level, therefore, for permitted access, use and protection of the data of millions of innocent citizens, which are collated and kept â listen to this â by private companies, not even by the police authorities, and for private reasons.
This legal black hole must be closed at once and one very important way is for the bridge or so-called passerelle to function at long last; in other words, for Parliament to have a decisive say.
The pillars cannot apply here.
PNR, SWIFT, data retention: in all these private individuals are collating data and the police are using them on the pretext of terrorism.
There are no pillars. It is one thing.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, Minister LehtomÃ€ki, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should be very worried about the red tape that binds together many of the arguments and debates that we have in this Chamber.
We could make the same comment on the subject that we are analysing now, as we did a short time ago in the debate on the CIA flights, that is that the Union is an area that is bound by the rules and principles of the rule of law and that, therefore, personal data, all personal data, including our current account data, must not be given to third countries, except in the cases provided for under national laws and now under European directives; there are no exceptions, not even in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Anything that goes beyond this constitutes an arbitrary act and an abuse of the system.
I and other Members would like to know what role the Council and the European Central Bank played and how aware they were of the secret agreements made by SWIFT and the United States administration, since the duty of transparency should not apply solely to our dialogue and debates in Parliament, it also has to exist outside this House.
Mr President, I concur with my colleagues in asking the Council to examine and adopt a framework decision on data protection as quickly as possible, because when there is a legal vacuum abuses and arbitrary acts can gain a foothold.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to this debate, and I can see that there is a firm consensus among us that citizensâ freedoms and issues of data security have to be taken sufficiently into account even in the fight against terrorism.
The Presidency takes a very serious view of this, and, as has been said, it is the responsibility of the National Bank of Belgium to oversee SWIFT and we also now await with interest what the Belgian authorities uncover.
If these investigations uncover facts which require legislation at Union level or harmonisation of legislation, this will be considered in the debate on the legislative plans that are being prepared.
This is such an important matter that we need to hold a debate on it in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and that is just what we will do.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the ideas that you have given me during the debate.
I think it can be said that the SWIFT affair has a special feature, which suggests to me that the 1995 âfirst pillar directiveâ on data protection is probably the one that is applicable, since the data was transferred through SWIFT Belgium and SWIFT United States, that is between two private branches of a private organisation.
That is why my interpretation, obviously subject to what the Belgian authorities will tell us, is that there would have been a communication to the Data Protection Authority and the national responsibilities of the competent bodies in this case would indeed exist.
Unlike the PNR affair, which, as we were correctly reminded by MrÂ Lambrinidis, involved a transfer from a private airline directly to a US public body, here the transfer was between two private parties.
It happens that on US territory, in accordance with US legislation, data transmitted for commercial reasons is used for security purposes.
That is the structural difference.
The result, as illustrated by MrÂ Lambrinidis, is that there is a grey area that really needs to be regulated.
In my opinion, there are two immediate possibilities: the first, to be implemented with the help of the Council and the Presidency, consists of rapidly approving the proposal that the Commission has put forward for a framework decision under the third pillar, in order to protect the confidentiality of personal data.
To this extent, it is evident that we will at least have covered one area, the one in which data are transmitted for reasons of security, investigation and to combat terrorism.
That would leave the first pillar part, that is the transfer between two private parties for commercial reasons.
A third aspect would still be missing: transfer between a Member State and a third country, that is not data transmitted from the European Union to a third country, but by an individual Member State directly to a third country.
This is the third aspect that I think should be examined.
If we look at these three points together, which, quite honestly, do not make for a controversy with the United States of America, but they do concern all third countries, we will be able to get a precise handle on that grey area.
Â Â  â I have received five motions for resolutions1 in accordance with Rule 103 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 6Â July 2006, at 12 noon.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Prime Minister Vanhanen said here today, the Finnish Presidency believes that it is a very important objective to make the European Union an area of freedom, security and justice. With this in mind, when the Hague Programme is being re-examined, the Presidency also intends to look at how we might improve the decision-making procedure on cooperation in policing and crime.
On 28Â June 2006 the Commission produced the so-called âHague Scoreboard Plusâ, which evaluates the implementation of the Hague Programme and whether EU legislation has been implemented in the Member States properly and according to the agreed timetable. In addition to this, the Commission has issued a communication which contains proposals regarding both the content of the policies on justice and home affairs and an improved decision-making procedure.
As the President of the Commission has said, the Commission is ready to make proposals with the purpose of making use of the options in the Treaties to adjust the decision-making procedure.
Finland intends to discuss these proposals in depth and in this way respond to the request made to Finland by the European Council at its meeting on 15 and 16 June. This was to work closely with the Commission to examine the possibilities of improving decision-making and action in the domain of freedom, security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties.
The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers are holding a preliminary discussion on these matters at their informal meeting in Tampere on 21 and 22 September 2006. The talks are to be continued in Council sessions in October and December and at the European Council in December.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, we will now aim to put our energies into this, because the time for close cooperation in policing and legal matters is clearly close at hand.
As I said in my original reply, this evaluation of the implementation of the Hague Programme is at present being undertaken and we are aiming for more effective Union-wide cooperation in this sector.

Â Â  President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate your well-informed reply to the previous question enormously. I would like to continue with the subject because the Council is now represented by a Presidency which has a lot of practical experience of its own of the negative aspects of emissions trading, a key instrument selected by the EU to prepare for the Kyoto Protocol.
These negative experiences include distortion of competition, disruptions in the internal market, and the fact that any party that has dealt well with the problem and taken environmental action early can end up paying for it. That is why, whereas the Commission still plugs emissions trading as a success story, Finland should have the opportunity to put this concept into a more realistic framework.
Does Finland mean to do that, and what sort of improvements would you be prepared to propose to correct the problems of emissions trading?
Â Â  .
Mr President, we presume that the Commissionâs report on the emissions trading scheme will be available sometime during the term of the Finnish Presidency, and, naturally, in the debate on it, Finland will have the opportunity also to raise the issue of its own experiences in the national context.
May I say again and echo the words of Prime Minister Vanhanen here today that questions of climate change will be high on the agenda, not only in transatlantic cooperation but in that with Asian countries too, during the Finnish Presidency and, hopefully, afterwards.
How does the Council Presidency assess the current state of the negotiations on the status of Kosovo?

Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union fully supports the negotiations on the future status of Kosovo, talks which are now being conducted under the leadership of UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The European Union urges all parties to participate constructively in the process for determining Kosovoâs status and would remind them that progress in the implementation of standards in Kosovo will be crucially important for taking this process forward.
There is still a very wide range of opinions on the subject, but the technical discussions on status have also been necessary and useful. The Presidency, in particular, wishes the process every success.
Â Â  â Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as you know, the Western Balkans was one of the big issues for the Austrian Presidency of the Council.
Will the Finnish Presidency pursue this issue with the same energy as did Austria?
What, too, is your view on the EUâs absorption capacity? Will Finland be coming up with tangible measures to deal with this, and will it be endorsing the Commissionâs report?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, during the Finnish Presidency the Western Balkans will be a very important issue in many different ways.
The Western Balkans are affected by the EU enlargement process, a detailed debate on which is to take place at the European Council in December.
Finland welcomes the notion that the EUâs absorption capacity has not become a new enlargement criterion but an issue that demands serious attention within the European Union itself.
I can nevertheless assure you that the important role played by the Western Balkans in the European debate will also be continued during our Presidency.
Â Â  â As you will no doubt be aware, Minister, the maintenance of internal security and law and order in Kosovo presents no small problem in terms of its stabilisation and its being accorded a new status.
What aid will you, under your Presidency, be giving the Western Balkans, and Kosovo in particular, in order that, in the spheres of internal security and the administration of justice, standards may be established of such a nature as to adequately guarantee the stability of the region as a whole?
Â Â  â This morning, we had a debate with the Commission on Palestine and the hostage-takings there.
What further action is the Presidency of the Council contemplating taking with regard to the situation in the Middle East, in Palestine and in Israel?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as I stated in my statement on behalf of the Council in the debate this morning, the Council regards it as very important that both sides should immediately commit to action to ease this crisis situation.
The European Union will help in a variety of ways to find a solution to this crisis, but, obviously, the parties themselves hold the keys to that. We will work hard and we hope that a solution will be found.
Â Â  â It often becomes apparent to us that our governments are very poorly informed about the background to kidnappings; first we are told that they are carried out by terrorists, only for it often to turn out that the motivation for them is merely criminal â quite different, in other words.
I would like to ask you whether you might perhaps want to push for better-integrated intelligence services or for better exchange of information between them, so that the rationale behind the taking of hostages might be better known, and so that the right response to them might be more speedily forthcoming.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, as was mentioned slightly earlier on in the debate on the CIA and the rendition of prisoners, the work of the intelligence services and the information which they provide fall, as such, within the competence of the Member States, although it is obviously useful if there can be very smooth and thorough cooperation to find solutions in kidnapping situations just like this and to examine the background to these situations, as the honourable Member said.
In the light of the recent agreement on the EU's external border controls in the maritime areas near the Canary Islands, and given the requirements of the European area of freedom, security and justice, does the Council not believe that the time has come to establish an integrated immigration policy for the Union as a whole, which can both ensure stable labour markets within EU territory and channel the considerable migratory pressures being exercised on our external borders?
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union applies and means to continue to apply a comprehensive strategy and to migration both in the Unionâs internal policy and in relations with third countries and in dialogue with them. This strategy and cover various aspects and dimensions of migration, for example, legal immigration, the prevention and control of illegal immigration, human trafficking and people smuggling.
The European Union naturally operates, as always, within the limits of its competence as laid down in the Treaty.
As regards the action that the Union has taken in response to recent events in the Canary Islands, I would like to suggest that the honourable Member take a closer look at the answers that were given to oral questions H-0440, H-0455, H-0460, H-0473 and H-0478/2006. This number of questions and answers shows that this is an important issue and the debate on it and measures relating to it must be continued.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your reply, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. The specific problem we face in the field of immigration policy is a lack of economic resources.
For this year we apparently only have EUR 5Â 000Â 000 and there is no chance of any more resources until the approval of the new financial perspective next year.
How can we link the immigration policy to the recently approved financial perspective for 2007-2013?
Â Â  â Madam President-in-Office of the Council, further to what you said about your intention of drawing up common rules on asylum policy, an area in which â as you will be aware â some powers are in the hands of the Member States and some in the hands of the EU, will you be holding to the line that it will continue in future to be a matter for the Member States to lay down how many, and which, working migrants will be permitted entry, in order to make integration into the labour market possible and prevent that market from being distorted?


Â Â  .
MrÂ President, mobility of the workforce and the availability of foreign labour in the Member States of the European Union is not just an immigration and labour market question but also very much a question that relates to European competitiveness. The honourable Member asked if this would be an issue for the Member States to decide on in the future.
It is obviously difficult to see far into the future and know what direction these policy decisions will take, but it is important to have political debate on issues that fall within national competence because, as I said just now, decisions that are taken in individual Member States also have a wider importance and influence in the Union as a whole.
What measures will the Council take to ensure that European citizens take an active part in decision-making to change illegal into legal immigration and accept the need to integrate immigrants?

Â Â  .
MrÂ President, it is in the Councilâs interests in general also to support the more proactive involvement of civil society in the integration of immigrants, because there is a desire to promote the transparency of EU administration in relation to the public. It is obviously for the Member States to decide on this and how to create structures for citizensâ platforms at local level, but cooperation at European Union level too will be very important.
During the Finnish Presidency, the work of the Council will be made significantly open, as the debate on legislative matters in the codecision procedure will be open.
In addition, the debate on other legislative plans will be made open. It will hopefully be one channel via which the people can be encouraged to find out about the criteria for decision-making and have an influence between elections as well.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, the link between a border control agency and integration is a trifle distant in my opinion, but during the Finnish Presidency we shall also seek concrete suggestions and proposals for the work of such an agency.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States have the right to adopt their own taxation systems within the limits of Community law. The Council will consider proposals for harmonisation if and when the Commission makes them.
We have to remember that on 1Â December 1997 the Council adopted a resolution on a code of conduct to apply to business taxation in order to tackle any harmful taxation measures that would or could impact significantly on the location of economic activity in the Community.
The working group set up to consider the practical aspects of the code makes an assessment on the basis of the criteria set out in the code of conduct whether taxation measures adopted by one Member State constitutes harmful competition or not. The relevant Member State voids the taxation measures declared harmful by the working group, on a voluntary basis.
The Member States are also obliged to refrain from adopting new, harmful measures.
In addition to this, there are intensive technical preparations under way right now in the Commission relating to the proposal for a common, consolidated, corporation tax base.
According to the Commission, such a tax base would be used to promote the Lisbon Strategy to a significant extent, because it will help to make the internal market more effective, which would lead to an improved EU competitive position in global markets. The proposal does not, however, deal with a rate for income tax.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, the purpose of this common, consolidated, corporate tax base initiative is to create a corporate tax base that would be simple.
The initiative does not go into the issue of tax rates, but a tax base.
Now the technical work is being done.
It is not the Finnish Presidencyâs intention to discuss this in the Council: the purpose is to hear how the technical wok is progressing.
Â Â  â Minister, if the consequence of such varying tax rates is to be that more businesses move elsewhere, is thought perhaps being given to the possibility of speeding these deliberations up? Too many jobs are being lost as a result of what is termed subsidy tourism, and we are currently, with regard to regional policy, giving thought to how we can do away with this.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, this was perhaps more a comment on the Council than a question.
Taxation is, as I stated in my original answer, an important matter both for the functioning of the internal market and competition. It is also important, therefore, to examine taxation at Union level.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as we know, the European Central Bank is an independent body whose main objective is keeping prices stable.
The Council of Ministers cannot influence decisions on interest rates, and, moreover, the independence of the Central Bank needs to be protected, so that it can continue to do its job.
Â Â  â Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if there is parity of exchange with the dollar, it also, of course, has to be borne in mind that Europe pays in dollars when buying oil and gas, and that there is a natural advantage for the European consumer in this.
Do you believe that oil prices in this area are subject to speculation, or that this is attributable to the currency?
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, perhaps it is not my strongest area, and nor does it fall within the competence of the Council, to speculate on future oil prices, but of course the present situation with regard to supply and demand and the direction in which it seems to be headed do not support the hypothesis that prices will quickly drop to a very low level here.
Will the Council review its procedures for answering parliamentary questions put to it?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MadamÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, even though the Members of this House who are speaking in todayâs debate are from different countries and different political groupings, what we all agree on is that more must be done to bring this region, which runs the risk of becoming a black hole in terms of European unification, closer to the European Union.
We are well acquainted with its problems.
We know about the nationalism and the narrow-mindedness, but we also know of the earnest desire, particularly among young people, to enter into this Europe and adopt European standards. It is not only in the interests of these people, but also in our own, that these connections may be made.
We do indeed, then, hope that the Finnish Presidency will continue what the Austrian Presidency â although it did not initiate it â certainly stepped up, and we also put our hopes in Commissioner Frattini, who has shown himself to be very knowledgeable and very willing.
We know from our travels in these countries just what a favourable reception is given to much of what he has said and to the headway he has made where this visa issue is concerned.
Yes, I know, it is the ministers of the interior, above all, who are standing in the way, but MrsÂ Pack was right to say just now that those who have wrongdoing on their minds will get into the European Union anyway.
Let us be honest about the fact that they will obtain a visa by devious means or find other ways of getting into the European Union without one, but those whose intentions are innocent, those who want to study or gain further training, those who want to invest and establish economic links, those who are politically active, must endure the ignominy of spending days, weeks, or even months in their quest for a visa.
I am well aware that there are certain conditions that have to be met.
The countries concerned must also ensure that the obligations to take people back are met and other criteria complied with, but I really do urge both of you to use your influence to ensure that these countries, and their young people in particular, are given the chance to get to know Europe, to become familiar with our standards, and then the process of becoming part of the European Union will be made all the easier for them.
I hope that you will both be very pro-active in bringing this about, not only so that these countries may be helped, but also so that we may be helped to build up, with the young people of the Balkans and of South-Eastern Europe, a Europe in which we can all share.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to speak briefly on the issue of integration. We know from a number of pieces of research and projects done under the Equal Programme â not least the strand on asylum-seekers â that the message coming through very clearly is that integration starts on day one for new arrivals and it starts the day before for host communities.
We have a whole range of good practice there that we should be drawing on, so that this becomes a process that gives us as many wins as possible.
That also means realising that for some parts of the world, migration is part and parcel of development policy.
I think we all agree that people who want to migrate should do so as a matter of free choice.
We know, however, that large numbers of illegal people are actually people who have overstayed their visas; they have not entered illegally.
We also know that there are large numbers of people who are semi-compliant, because rules are not clear or are difficult to access.
Until we start looking at the development aspect of this issue, it will be like squeezing a balloon: if you apply pressure somewhere, you just get a different shape somewhere else.
Therefore, we need to look at this very seriously, and Member States need to stop complaining and start cooperating on a common migration system.
We also need to beware of the commodification of people. When I look at the policies of some Member States that are now considering drawing unskilled workers from new Member States and not using third-country nationals, I am not sure what message that sends out.
Indeed we know that for people from some of the poorest countries, access to work in the European Union is crucially important to their countryâs development, and the remittances that go back can be up to eight times the amount of aid that we are putting in. We know that people are pulled towards rich countries when inequality is most acute.
I am interested in how the Commission is going to approach the development aspect and trade policies, to ensure that our policies move in a coherent way instead of pulling against each other all the time.



Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that Europeâs problem stems from migratory flows; the real problem is not people arriving on our territory, but the large number of people who do not get to Europe, those who die in the Mediterranean Sea or in the Atlantic Ocean.
I have heard Commissioner Frattini confirm the need to patrol our coastlines.
I believe that they should be patrolled solely to avoid people dying at sea, because the number of arrivals is ridiculously low: in the first half of 2006, 9Â 000 immigrants arrived in the Canary Islands, as compared with the 8Â million tourists who go to the islands every year.
I do not think that migratory flows have a very high demographic impact and we should, therefore, avoid talking about an invasion of immigrants and should try to develop a common policy for the entry of immigrants.
Europe, however, has adopted a repressive joint policy, setting up administrative detention centres, implementing a joint policy of mass expulsion often determined at G5 summits and applying the principle of externalising frontiers, which, it seems, will be the main topic for discussion at the forthcoming summit in Rabat.


I am of the view that we should radically change our strategy, with a view to true integration, based on the need to institute a mixed-race identity for Europe, and that we should also consider citizenship through residence, a residence permit to enable people to find work, harmonisation of the right to asylum and the right of immigrants to vote.
I think that this new method of looking at immigration can help Europe in its constituent process.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I realise that the problem of illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, seen from here, Strasbourg or Brussels, in the heart of the European continent, may appear to many to be a marginal issue to be addressed with the cold, formal language of bureaucracy and with the complicity of Community policy, which, at times, can be cynical and hypocritical.
Those, like me, however, who live day and night in Sicily, the furthest point of Europe in the Mediterranean, have no difficulty in declaring, within the plush walls of this Chamber, that a true human drama is unrolling before our eyes.
Only last year, Commissioner, more than 20Â 000 illegal immigrants arrived on our Sicilian shores, double the number of those who landed in all the European countries bordering the Mediterranean in the past two years.
Each day, hundreds of arrivals undergo the same ordeal, the same stations of the Cross: shipwrecks offshore and then bodies washed up onto the Sicilian beaches by the sea currents.
It is a tragedy involving young players and victims, women and children fleeing from their countries, searching for a dream that for none of them will ever come true; first they have to go through the human smuggling racket and then a life of hardship, suffering, privation and exploitation awaits those who manage to avoid the police controls. This tragedy is taking place on European soil and what is Europeâs response?
It responds late and ineffectually.
Only last December, the European Council in Brussels proposed a series of generic actions to be taken in 2006 and invited the Commission to coordinate their implementation. But it is said that resources are limited and additional funds will not be available until 2007.
Too little, Commissioner: we need decisive action and your statements this evening have given us the right to hope. You are known to be a person who is in favour of decisive, practical action and we invite you to give us yet another further demonstration of it.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time in this Chamber that I have advocated a European policy on legal immigration â for humanitarian and economic reasons â and measures to step up the fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings.
The two proposals before us are important and useful.
I should like first to speak about the Lambrinidis report and to say to MrÂ Frattini that the Commissionâs proposal is most welcome and well balanced, although I fear that the rapporteur has gone too far on some points, such as political rights.
Immigrants must be integrated, but we must not forget that this works both ways: host countries must strive to integrate them, but they must also do their bit in the drive towards integration.
I agree with MrÂ Lambrinidis that it is appalling that there is still a consultation process and the requirement of unanimity throughout the area of legal immigration and I agree that the clause provided for in the Treaty should be invoked in order to give Parliament codecision powers.
I wish to highlight the importance of the Gaubert report aimed at establishing a web-based information system on this issue.
Although the implementation of integration initiatives will be done at local level, it has broader implications.
The difficulties experienced by one Member State in defining and implementing their integration policies has an impact in other Member States at social and economic level.
It is thus in the Unionâs interest that the Member States implement effective integration strategies the results of which serve the common interest.
It could and should be the Unionâs responsibility to monitor and assess the results of the efforts of integration. This will contribute towards the rapid adoption of the best techniques.
Â Â  Mr President, sustained immigration is a fact for many Member States, and when managed, it has aided economic output, although it would be foolish to deny that, on occasions, problems of a social or other nature ensue.
I should like to take the opportunity of this debate to condemn unreservedly a series of racist attacks that have occurred in my constituency of Northern Ireland.

Decent people do not want any part of that, and I deplore what has happened in regard to some recent incidents.
I have three points to make in this debate.
First, the control of immigration policy is, I believe, properly a national issue and should not become an EU competence; otherwise, national governments cannot exercise the controls necessary to their situation. Second, it is imperative that immigrants integrate and do not become a debilitating state within a state.
Hence, in the United Kingdom I support Chancellor Gordon Brownâs calls for a willingness and for procedures to embrace Britishness. My third and final point is that with three million illegal immigrants in the EU, this issue has to be robustly tackled, not least because of its association with the odious practice of human trafficking.
It is not acceptable for some countries to engage in so-called regularisation of their illegal immigrants and thereby qualify them for free movement to other Member States.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0210/2006) by MrsÂ Carlotti, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on development and migration (2005/2244(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are 175Â million migrants in the world and that figure has almost tripled over the last 40 years.
This is not a new phenomenon, but it has become particularly widespread within the context of globalisation and above all it is bringing us face to face with human dramas.
Each day poverty and despair bring dozens and dozens of Africans to the northern shores of the Mediterranean or to the Canary Islands, and the European Statesâ only response is to increase the controls and patrols that force the people trying to come here to take even more risks.
This migration policy on the part of the Union is based on an illusion, however!
The illusion that we can make our borders impregnable, which stems from an essentially defensive and securitarian approach and which means that all the responsibility is placed on the States of the South.
Even the Euro-African conference in Rabat, which will take place on 10Â July, will also deal with the issue from the point of view of enforcement and border control, and we will still not hear Africa's voice.
This unilateral and self-centred approach is reflected today in the arguments put forward and in the policies of âselective immigrationâ which are all the rage in Europe.
âSelectiveâ immigration for the North, but rather âsufferedâ by the South, and from now on, therefore, a different approach must prevail in Europe.
It is entirely in that spirit that I have drawn up my report.
It is along those lines that I wish to propose a new approach, new instruments and to turn migration into a lever for development.
First of all we must make better use of the existing tools, but above all we must maintain our commitments in the field of development aid, and, as we know, the initial phase of development will involve an intensification of migration rather than a slow-down.
Of course, increasing aid is not a solution in itself. It is a necessary condition, but in itself it is not enough.
I would like us next to turn attention properly to the AENEAS programme with a view to reorienting it purely towards the development aspect, and also the programme that will succeed it in 2007, but that is far away!
At the moment, that programme is above all used for actions aimed at protecting the borders of the North.
In 2005, for example, just seven of the thirty-nine projects funded related to countries of the South.
Furthermore, if we are to establish one new financial instrument, I believe that we should create a fund to guarantee the continuity of microprojects in the poor countries.
The European Union must also act in the places where migrants are located, in the places where migration begins.
It is easy to target the main regions of immigration â they are often the poorest regions â and to fund the establishment of infrastructures there through targeted budgetary support: drinking water, electricity, roads, health centres and schools, in order to dissuade resourceless populations from leaving.
It is also easy to identify the migration poles. We know them: they are the States or large cities with modern means of transport and communication and which are both points of reception and points of departure towards the great migration routes, from the Sahel towards the North for example.
Once they are identified, we will be able to implement more actions there than we do today aimed at supporting the populations â particularly the most vulnerable, who are women and children â and help them to achieve autonomy, by means other than by mobility.
An information programme on these areas aimed at migrants could also be established.
I believe that Europe must also look to the potential of migrant communities in the rich countries, in terms of what they can do for the development of their countries of origin.
I believe that this is a promising route which has the potential to turn migrants into agents of development, in the name of solidarity and mutual aid.
This is what is known as co-development.
Within this context, we must promote the transfer of funds towards countries of origin, make them more transparent, less expensive, and consider a new financial product that could take the form of a âdevelopment savings planâ.
The Union, but in particular its Member States, must adopt innovative polices such as assuming responsibility for salary differentials for certain migrants who wish to return to their countries of origin, or systems of dual bases for researchers or doctors, within the framework of institutional partnerships amongst research institutes, universities and hospitals.
We must also encourage circular migration to allow migrants to come and go, in cooperation with countries of origin, of course, and ensuring the transfer of social provision.
I believe that this kind of measure will make it possible to replace the current brain drain with a circulation of brains.
We are very well aware that, for many Southern countries, migration means the departure of the most skilled and enterprising citizens.
This has dramatic effects for the poor countries, since this phenomenon often has an impact on essential sectors such as health and education.
From this point of view, I am delighted that the Commission is putting forward proposals aimed at dealing with these challenges.
What I want to see more generally, however, is for Europe to entirely change its thinking and for that thinking to be defended.
We have an opportunity, since in September the UN will deal with the issue of migration and development for the first time.
I would like to thank the honourable Members who have supported me in the drawing up of this report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Development, and in particular MrsÂ Carlotti, on its work.
I can assure you that the Commission attaches great importance to this very topical issue of the links between immigration and development, and I can also assure you that the Commission will take your suggestions very seriously.
This is a highly detailed report that deals with a very wide range of subjects.
Given the time restraints, I shall therefore focus on two very important series of issues.
The first series of issues relates to the coherence of the Communityâs actions.
I would like to remind you that, for the first time, the Commission has established a very clear link between migration and development.
It wanted to send a very clear message about the added value that can be obtained by improving the interaction between migratory phenomena and development.
As your report quite rightly points out, there are two dimensions to this interaction.
On the one hand, development policy can play an important role in terms of migratory flows.
Last year, the European Union firmly reiterated its commitment to an ambitious development policy, which is aimed at promoting economic and social development and good governance.
This policy can thereby contribute to tackling the underlying causes of migration.
This is clearly a long-term project and we cannot expect to see results in the short term.
I have seen that your report contains some interesting suggestions in this field and we shall look carefully at a number of them.
The integration of migration issues into country strategy papers, for example, is something that the Commission has already implemented.
On the other hand, certain phenomena linked to migration may make an effective contribution to the development of countries of origin.
That is what the Commission pointed out last year in its communication on immigration and development.
That document proposes guidelines which may be used in our relations with the countries of origin in question and which may be eligible for Community financial support.
I particularly welcome your recommendation in the field of co-development, an area which the Commission is also examining.
I quote, âthe priority objective must be to promote the âcirculationâ of brains in order to compensate for the negative effects of the brain drain.
One of the most promising means for doing this are âdual baseâ systems, which would allow researchers, teachers and medical staff from the South to spend half of their time working in an establishment in their own countryâ.
This seems to me to be an extremely interesting recommendation.
I consider this particular recommendation in the report, which relates to how to involve migrant populations in the development of countries of origin, to be a very important suggestion.
In this field, MrsÂ Carlottiâs report offers real added value.
The reportâs position is clear: it relies very much on experience of co-development.
The Commission has very little experience in this field and I am entirely prepared to base the Commissionâs considerations on the experiences and examples of best practices developed by certain Member States.
The report proposes the creation of two funds â I am talking about recommendation 15 â the first intended to fund co-development, the second dedicated to a mechanism for guaranteeing the continuity of microprojects.
If I have understood correctly, your idea is to create these funds under the new thematic strategies on migration.
I personally would be in favour of creating two items of this type within the thematic programme.
Nevertheless, I have yet to discuss this with my colleagues MrÂ Frattini and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner.
I must also thank you, on behalf of the Commission, for your reportâs backing for most of the guidelines contained in the Commissionâs communication on migration and development, including the transfer of migrants, the role of migrant populations as factors in the development of countries of origin and the promotion of circular migration and other forms of âcirculationâ of brains.
I must however stipulate that the Commission can only consider actions in this field in strict accordance with the principle of voluntary agreement on the part of migrants and of the independent nature of that agreement.
In a similar vein, the money transferred by migrants clearly cannot be seen as a replacement for public development aid, which is more necessary than ever, and to the increase in which the European Union is firmly committed.
I would like finally to confirm that the Commission attaches great importance to policies aimed at alleviating the effects of the brain drain.
In this regard, I would like to remind you that last December the Commission adopted a communication on the human resources crisis in the health sectors of developing countries.
That communication also contains extremely precise and specific guidelines.
The Commission has established a very ambitious working programme which it intends to implement in close coordination with the Member States, some of which have also launched their own initiatives.
All of these initiatives are being carried out, or will be carried out, in partnership with the countries of origin.
The second series of issues that I would like briefly to discuss with you â and this will be no surprise to you â is the very special place that Africa has in this reflection.
This point is made very clear in your report.
Problems such as the brain drain, the high cost of transfers of money and the weakness of the financial infrastructure on the ground are of very particular significance in Sub-Saharan Africa.
It is perhaps in this field that the involvement of migrant populations, if certain conditions are in place, would be most likely to make a difference.
In its conclusions of last December, the European Council pointed out clearly that the two complementary dimensions of improving the links between migration and development that I have just mentioned must be given a special place in the partnership that we are in the process of building with Africa in the migratory field, at all levels of discussion.
The links between migration and development will therefore be central to the agenda of the Rabat conference that will bring together representatives from Europe, the Maghreb and countries of Central and West Africa next week to discuss the issue of migration.
The links between migration and development are also one of the key elements of the dialogue that the Commission is developing with a number of Sub-Saharan African countries on the basis of ArticleÂ 13 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The Commission believes that these discussions offer an opportunity to hold a dialogue on the specific support that the Community can give to its African partners to help them better to manage migratory flows and in particular to make better use of the links between migration and development.
Finally, these links are also central to our dialogue with the African Union.
This should lead to a ministerial conference that will bring together representatives from the European Union and the whole of Africa.
It is therefore by creating more channels of communication that the Commission is endeavouring to develop what we intend to be an exemplary partnership with Africa in the field of migration.
There is no question that in this way the European Union can make an important contribution to the high-level dialogue on migration and development that the United Nations is holding in New York in September.
In a few daysâ time, the Commission will adopt a communication which will constitute its written contribution to that event.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Carlotti.
I congratulate her for her report and I thank her for taking up the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on behalf of which I am speaking today, in particular noting that the link between immigration and development is an integral part of the foreign policy agenda of the European Union.
It has been so from the time that the Barcelona Process was instituted, but it has continued in all other issues of our relations with the countries of origin and transit.
It is very important to tackle the issue of immigration, to manage migratory flows when we achieve the understanding and the cooperation of the countries of origin and transit.
As has been said by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, remittances around the world to developing countries amount to USD 232 billion per year, which is double the size of foreign aid to developing countries by everybody else.
Therefore, this is the significance of facilitating remittances, facilitating the issue of circular migration, thus gaining the confidence of the countries we want to cooperate with.
We are not aiming at the brain-drain that they are so afraid of; we do not talk only about illegal immigration, but we know how to take best advantage of immigration in view of our ageing population and the need that lies ahead.
I would like to conclude by saying that by putting order in the financial institutions, as regards both the sending and receiving side, we can also deal with the issue of terrorist financing that has been thought to come via charity organisations and so on in Europe.
Â Â  . â I would like to congratulate MrsÂ Carlotti on preparing this report and I would like to thank colleagues from my committee for preparing our opinion.
I also spoke on this matter yesterday evening, but I did not touch on one important thing â the question of qualified migrants or the brain-drain, which can have a negative impact on the development of a country.
However, I do not believe that we need to stop this process, but strive for reciprocal benefits.
Thus, I would like to stress that, in my opinion, it is very important to introduce a clear and as simple as possible procedure for recognising qualifications.
We also need to introduce an equivalent of the USA's Green Card, which would stimulate circular migration.
We need to recognise that, without appropriate conditions for integration, migration is harmful to both sides.
Colleagues, yesterday, the French won â I congratulate them, and in particular the fact that the honour of France was largely defended by players who are themselves or whose parents were migrants.
Now they are French.
This is a perfect example of integration.
Congratulations.
