We also propose a programme geared towards enlargement, a programme of preparatory action, which we would like to be accessible and appropriate.
Furthermore, once a new legal basis for the organisation of EURES is announced, probably in 2002, Parliament will only need to say one simple thing, and that is: Parliament wishes to participate in this redefinition.
Mr President, Commissioner, the free movement of workers - a cornerstone of the Treaties of Rome, and the most important of the four fundamental freedoms in our internal market - can only operate effectively if the employment services also do not end at national borders.
This is the role of EURES, a network which is intended to provide information, advice and employment services across national borders.
We agree with all the key points contained in Mr Ribeiro e Castro's report.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his competent work.
In particular, we share his critical views - which he has just repeated during this debate - under Recital A, which sets out a clear set of conditions for the Commission as regards the provision of objective reasons and statistical information.
This will also make our job easier.
However, the report - like so many others - succumbs to a common temptation: it adds a lengthy list of new demands for future improvements to those already put forward by the Commission.
In my view, the repetition of what is self-evident, and this House's often over-zealous efforts to list every conceivable demand, simply detract from the impact of a report and the credibility of our joint endeavours.
I often have the impression that if the Commission puts forward five demands, for example, this House feels compelled to add at least another five.
I cannot support this approach. What is important is not the number of demands we put forward in a specific case but their practical implementation.
I think it is excessive, for example, to devise and implement permanent information systems, in particular within youth organisations, universities and the media, as demanded in Article 15 of the report.
I think this is something which we can safely leave to the EURES units at local level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
I also have great reservations about the creation of additional operational units, as set forth in Article 16, because they lack substance and are often used as a fig leaf in order to conceal the failures of existing bodies.
The growing importance of EURES' role in the light of the forthcoming EU enlargement must be clearly underlined, as in this report. Sound career advice and employment services can undoubtedly help to channel potential widespread interest in migration.
Nonetheless, the goal of further integration of the labour market within the Fifteen must not slip into the background.
What is absolutely essential is the restructuring of EURES' finances and the reform of its legal basis, as demanded in Article 27.
This is borne out by the problems at local level and the enquiries directed to us as parliamentarians.
As the representation of citizens at local level, Parliament must be given a key role in this area.
Mr President, to begin with I should like to congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro most warmly on his brilliant report and thank him for the excellent cooperation we enjoyed in the committee.
Unlike Mr Stauner I am convinced that he has produced very creative work with the report of the European Commission.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union wants to make the creation of an integrated labour market a priority and that is a good thing.
But we should be aware that people who want to make use of this opportunity are not always wrapped in cotton wool.
It is not at all easy to be mobile in a cross-border way in the European labour market.
If we really want a European labour market, we must work at removing the obstacles, and EURES has certainly won its spurs in this field.
The 450 EURES consultants who have day-to-day contact with people who are mobile, can testify to the difficulties they experience.
But even in their own organisations, whether it be job centres or trade unions, they do not always receive the attention they really deserve.
I believe that policy-makers should make more use of their know-how and expertise.
I am therefore particularly happy that the Commission has agreed to my suggestion that a public hearing should be organised with the EURES consultants and I hope, Commissioner, that the results of that hearing will be of use to the Commission in preparing the new programme.
The Commission has formulated a number of proposals and the honourable Member has supplemented these in a useful way.
I believe, for example, that it is a very good idea to use EURES more effectively as part of our employment strategy and for that to happen the legal basis of EURES must change.
I also think it is important that there is better coordination with other Community initiatives.
But I should like to put special emphasis on two additional elements.
Firstly: I believe that it is definitely necessary to start expanding EURES activities in the future, especially in the context of enlargement to include new candidate countries which we are now experiencing.
Secondly: anyone who talks about the enlargement and enhancement of EURES must also have the courage to talk about additional financial resources and preferably, Commissioner, as part of a long-term plan, since the annual 'carve up' is very difficult to operate for EURES.
I should like to take advantage of this debate to raise two additional issues regarding cross-border mobility, issues about which we are constantly asked by people in border regions.
That is first and foremost, Commissioner, the question of Parliament that has been on the table for years in relation to the introduction of a Europe test, a test which could monitor internationally the possible consequences of social and fiscal legislation in other countries.
The Netherlands recently used that test voluntarily as part of a bilateral tax agreement and in the social agenda we have occasionally asked for such a test to be created at European level.
I should like to ask you again to give this serious consideration.
The second issue concerns the draft for the simplification and modification of the coordination of social security entitlements of migrating employees. This issue has been on the table for years, and we know that the Belgian presidency intends to, and will try to, achieve a political breakthrough in this connection.
That will not be easy while decisions on this issue must be made unanimously.
Accordingly, I should like to express the hope that Member States that are at present dragging their feet will begin paying more attention to the problems of cross-border mobility, and hence be prepared to make some compromises as part of the regulation.
The European Commission promised us that at the end of this year, during the Belgian Presidency, a conference on border work would be organised.
We very much hope, Commissioner, that that conference will contribute, not only to greater understanding and insight into the problems of border regions, but specifically to the removal of the obstacles to cross-border mobility in the European labour market.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his serious and very painstaking approach to this work and would support many of his introductory remarks and also many of those made by my colleague, Mrs Van Lancker.
There is no doubt that working abroad is increasingly popular for young people, in particular, and businesses are also looking to recruit from a wider field, but for this to be possible, people need to feel that they can have accurate, up-to-date information about what working in another Member State may entail, because that information provides them with a real choice as to whether they work elsewhere or not.
At the moment we have a very confusing set of different rules and regulations and it is clear from complaints to many of us and to Parliament's Petitions Committee that clear advice is not always forthcoming from the appropriate authorities, even in Member States themselves.
The apparent anomalies have not helped either in social security coordination and entitlements, even different definitions as to what constitutes self-employment.
The EURES network provides a very valuable resource for potential mobile workers.
It also provides a valuable, if underused, resource for employers.
Many small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity or experience to carry out their cross-border recruitment.
EURES has an important role for them and it is a great pity that employment and employers' organisations are not more involved in the development of these services.
Up to now, it has been particularly important in border regions, but EURES still does not cover all such areas, which is regrettable.
It is obvious, as others have said, that EURES needs to be adequately resourced, expanded and promoted if it is to meet its full potential and respond to the needs of individuals.
We must also recognise that enlargement will bring additional and quite legitimate demands in terms of information.
We support the request for more detailed information to be provided and agree that multi-annual funding is essential to the smooth development of this services.
However, its task would be made much easier if Member States adopted a more determined and coherent approach to making free movement a reality rather than an ideal that they keep banging on about, but seem incapable of delivering.
There has to be positive action by governments in favour of enabling people to experience working elsewhere: Mrs Van Lancker has already refereed to the coordination of social security systems within this.
There is also the question about dealing with tax problems for frontier workers.
We still have enormous problems with adequate recognition of qualifications, particularly vocational qualifications.
Members States must recognise that free movement is not a threat to them, it is not an inconvenience, it is a valuable way to increase understanding and to develop cooperation within the Union.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro for an excellent report.
I agree with most of what has been brought up in the discussion, especially by the speakers immediately preceding me.
I would like to add two comments.
Firstly, I would like to say how glad I am that the report so clearly emphasises that the free movement we want in Europe must be based on the principle of voluntary mobility.
I highlight this particularly in view of the fact that, in my own and other countries, employment services have often been used as a kind of instrument with which to force population movements between different parts of the country through economic means.
I hope that it will never be possible to implement any such measure at European level.
I would also like to emphasise that I am surprised that no-one in this discussion has pointed out that we are now discussing technical and practical obstacles to free movement across borders, at the same time as major Member States are setting up huge practical and political obstacles to free movement between the labour markets of the candidate countries and those of the current Member States.
This suggests, of course, that we are concerned with a political rather than a solely practical problem when we talk about free movement in Europe.
Mr President, the report presented to us today by my colleague, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, is comprehensive in its analysis of the activities of EURES over the period 1998 to 1999 and constructive in relation to the proposal he makes for the future activities of this network.
I commend him for the extensive work he has put into the preparation and completion of this report and I share his view that we need to stress the important role of EURES network, as a means of implementing European employment strategy.
EURES job offers went from 43 000 at the start of 1998 to 166 000 at the beginning of 2000.
The number of placements obtained to EURES, rose from 26 449 in 1998 to 44 460 in 1999: that is an increase of more than 68% in one year and the potential for more placement is much greater.
This is just another example of the many qualitative examples of the EU at work for citizens.
Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland.
The fact that we have come close to full employment is a practical example of what is achievable.
I am confident our people will give practical recognition to this fact when they vote next week on the Nice Treaty.
We want to share the benefits of EU membership with our neighbours from central and eastern Europe: to do otherwise would be to reject the concept and spirit of the Rome Treaty.
Let us not forget their courage and sacrifice in safeguarding freedom and democracy.
This objective surely outweighs other minor or contrived objections to Nice.
One of the key functions of EURES is to make information available on current job vacancies in the Member States.
Yesterday evening, I logged on to the website and there were 7 197 vacancies listed.
Looking at the first 200 vacancies, the range of jobs is extensive.
Vacancies in Ireland, for example, include: accounts assistants, building administrators and sales and reservations.
So for all of the reasons, it is very obvious that this EURES programme has enormous potential.
Again, I compliment and congratulate my colleague, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on his very extensive and constructive approach to this important report.
Mr President, the report by Mr Ribeiro e Castro gives a clear and thorough exposition of the Commission document and its shortcomings.
Firstly, the rapporteur requires more information on the results of the EURES network.
I fully support that, since it definitely remains obscure how the results of EURES relate to the state of affairs in European labour markets.
Secondly, the Commission document shows clearly that Member States could make fuller use of the potential of the EURES network, in view of the differences between Member States in the number of vacancies in the network: international recruitment will not be realistic for all vacancies.

In the same way the call to encourage all border regions to enter into a EURES partnership has not been supported with arguments based on the need for community support expressed by the regions themselves.
The obstacles are not found in the first place between adjacent regions, but concern mobility over greater distances, that is, they are 'transnational' rather than 'cross-border' in nature.
EU enlargement implies that a shift in emphasis from cross-border to transnational mobility will become more likely.
My third point concerns the necessary subsidiarity.
Both the Commission and the rapporteur raise the point that local familiarity with the network leaves much to be desired.
However, local information is the responsibility of the local players.
For that reason, reserving a substantial portion of the budget for promotion is undesirable.
On the other hand, I can fully support the call for decentralisation.
The term of the budget is also a discussion point.
The Commission wants a budget extending over several years as this facilitates planning.
I have no problems with long-term budgets as such, but I do with the scope and nature of the community package of responsibilities proposed by the Commission.
That leads me to prefer an annual establishment of the budget.
In conclusion the attention paid by the rapporteur to expansion has my support.
After the political decision on the free movement of employees is taken for the candidate countries, the mobility of labour must no longer be restricted by inadequate cooperation in employment provision.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s very useful report mentions, in particular, the importance of transparency and the importance of reliable statistics on jobs.
It is true that in my country, France, by massaging the figures and by introducing costly job-creation schemes in the public sector which are no real use at all, the government has been able to announce what it claims is a spectacular fall in unemployment. In reality, unemployment remains stable, and it may even be increasing.
Since the beginning of the year, planned job cuts have been followed by more planned job cuts, at Marks and Spencer, who are relocating, and at Danone, who are planning even further cuts.
We are quick to condemn companies who make staff redundant while they themselves are making a profit, but governments must also bear their share of the responsibility, because the original European plan for free circulation and competition between countries with comparable living standards and social protection schemes has been replaced by the indiscriminate opening up of the market to capital and to products manufactured outside Europe in conditions approaching slavery.
For those companies who are subject to laws imposed by parliaments and states, the employment market is not only European, but world-wide.
For workers, of course, it is another matter, and I note that, quite rightly, Recital C in Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s report says that 'a high level of mobility on the labour market is not an end in itself' .
Two hundred thousand French people, worn down by the weight of taxation and the endless bureaucracy in their own country, did not wait for EURES, but simply left the country, in order, finally to get a job and a better standard of living, at least that is what they were hoping for, in the United Kingdom.
So, while it is certainly useful to have a network which enables those who wish to find a job in another country within the European Union, our first priority must continue to be to make it possible for businesses to create jobs for their own people in their own countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the right and the opportunity to live and work in other Member States of the European Union are important political aspirations for Europe' s citizens.
The basis for the EURES network is the existence of this right, enshrined in law, for workers to move freely within the territory of the European Union and the European Economic Area and the unpleasant fact that barriers to labour mobility remain in place.
This network, which centres on the exchange of information, on providing advice and on support for appointing professionals, is supported by EURES advisers in dialogue and in collaboration with the Member States' national employment services and by an Internet access service. This service must be more widely publicised in future, which will make it easier for the average user to consult and research.
EURES contributes to making the European employment market more flexible and increasingly mobile and provides a range of opportunities for vocational training in cross-border regions.
The positive characteristics of this network, which must be strengthened, as the rapporteur, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, whom I congratulate, quite rightly emphasises, include ease of access and the exchange of information on employment opportunities across this huge area, the multilingual content of the system, which must be regularly and rigorously updated, and legal assistance for citizens, particularly with tax systems and social security.
Having said this, we must not overestimate the value of EURES.
Although this network is a very positive thing, it is merely an instrument for implementing the European strategy for employment.
The truth of the matter is that specific directives do exist in the field of employment, which seek to eliminate the social, cultural, and linguistic barriers that obstruct mobility in the European Union.
Commissioner, Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his analysis of the Commission' s report.
The analysis which he has carried out is very painstaking, and it really does enable us to ask ourselves about the relevance and, the effectiveness of this European Employment Service, both in terms of its strategy and objectives and in relation to the resources which have been used in order to achieve the objective of worker mobility and access to the European employment market.
Like previous speakers, I should like to emphasise the value of the activity report.
I should also like, however, to draw attention to its weakness, which lies in its lack of critical evaluation. However, the text presented by our rapporteur will supplement the report as far as this aspect is concerned.
This report is timely, insofar as it highlights the role which EURES can and should play in the more general context of the European employment strategy, particularly if, as has been requested, the question of its having its formal legal basis in the Treaties is reviewed.
EURES should be entirely integrated into the strategy, defined at Lisbon and reinforced at Stockholm, on the removal of obstacles to mobility within the labour market.
It seems to me that there are three points which need emphasising.
First there is the issue of mobility, which has already been mentioned.
Everyone praises its merits, but I do not believe that it should be regarded as an end in itself, or as a risky gamble on the future, and still less as a choice that is made by default because there are no job opportunities at home.
It must be possible for it to be a positive choice, and in that case mobility should not have to face all sorts of obstacles with regard to consistency between social security systems and taxation systems, double taxation, and the recognition of qualifications etc.
Secondly, let us emphasise the importance of information on the existence of the European Employment Service, particularly in border regions.
Communications must be strengthened, and addressed as a matter of priority to professional organisations, training centres and universities.
The added value of the European dimension is not necessarily clear to see, and yet the fact that this Community strategy in favour of employment is taking the very practical form of providing openings in the employment market at European level is an excellent example of what can be achieved.
Finally, I should like to end my speech by mentioning the question of enlargement.
In view of the fears which have been expressed here and there in certain Member States of the Union, regarding the prospect of the massive and uncontrolled arrival of workers from the candidate countries, I believe that EURES should have a role to play here, by making it possible to anticipate difficulties, whether real or imagined, in particular by facilitating dialogue and by making it possible for the employment services of the countries concerned to work together with the various social partners involved in the major issue of job mobility in the Union as it is today and in the enlarged Union of tomorrow.
Mr President, the report by Mr Ribeiro e Castro has been the starting point for an in-depth debate on a question which is one of the biggest challenges to European policy, i.e. the European labour market.
Until now, employment strategies, guidelines and recommendations have been of a strictly national nature.
But national action plans relate to national labour markets and what we refer to as the European labour market is clearly developing throughout Europe.
By which we mean new demands, identical demands regarding the quality of the qualifications of people looking for jobs throughout Europe.
There is very little mobility of workers within Europe. A mere 0.4%.
The standard response to mobility problems is to cite cultural differences. The question of language, culture and national education systems.
However, there is clearly more to it than that.
There are pension problems and insurance problems and regulations on movements of workers and their pensions need to work better and faster, as we have already heard.
There is the important problem of information, which several speakers have already touched on; the information which jobseekers need to be given on their rights, labour market conditions, accommodation, their children's education, their pension rights and the facility to transfer their rights if they return home.
These are problems of a national and European nature; they are already on the agenda of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but there are still huge differences of opinion.
EURES is instrumental to the creation of this European labour market.
Parliament is supporting the Commission in this endeavour, as it has done since 1993, as can be seen from this year's budget, which is in the order of EUR 13 million.
EURES already has operational experience and there has been an increase in the demand for information, an increase in the movement of information at transnational level, which reached 40% last year, proving that we need to keep and expand EURES.
I should like to touch on certain choices made by the Commission in order to promote and strengthen this tool.
First, there is greater collaboration between the heads of public services, more and more of which are deciding to incorporate EURES in their databases, so that they can provide their customers with common services.
We are currently studying the possibility of extending the range of services to both jobseekers and employers.
The Commission will announce a new EURES service from June onwards which will allow jobseekers in specific sectors in which there is a shortage to file their CVs via the Internet and, at the same time, will allow employers to register for this service.
Now that it has been up and running for 8 years, we have asked the Member States to include problems or new services which might be demanded of EURES in their questionnaires and we shall be presenting Parliament with a report based on these questionnaires.
I should like to close by pointing out that enlargement will force us to reconsider this tool; for the moment, however, we need to develop it between the Member States to the maximum.
Finally, I think it is worth mentioning that the legal basis for EURES needs to be revised, so that EURES can be adapted and improved to meet the future demands on these services.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m..

Corbett (PSE).
Madam President, after we rejected Amendment No 54 to Recital E, you then put Recital E itself to the vote, although there has not been a request for a separate vote on Recital E and although, under our Rules of Procedure, you need not do so.
May I ask you not to put the original recital to the vote unless there has been a request for a separate vote: firstly, because it makes the voting time a lot longer, but secondly, the voting lists that all the groups have in front of them do not have a item for a separate vote on that and it can lead to confusion as to how we intend to vote.
Thank you, Mr Corbett, we shall save precious time.
On the subject of Amendment No 75
Madam President, I have in front of me the English text.
The oral amendment is that where the English text says, 'qualified majority is unworkable' , the word 'unworkable' should be replaced by the phrase 'it is difficult to work' .
Thank you, Mr Dimitrakopoulos.
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?

(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President, I should just like to say that after this vote I hope everyone is convinced of the need to reform our Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, I do not intend in any way to criticise the Environment Committee or the rapporteur, but like Mr Corbett I wish to emphasise that there must be a better way to conduct voting than this.
We need some constitutional change to enable the committees to work properly rather than the House as a whole acting as a committee.

On the subject of Amendment No 70
I have to obtain the assent of Parliament before putting Amendment No 70 to the vote.
Mr President, we in our group discovered, after the group meeting, that there was a compromise amendment, Amendment No 70.
I must explain that we were not invited to participate in this so-called compromise which, for many of us, contains proposals which we are unable to agree with.
Nor does the Commissioner agree with them, as she has told us.
Unfortunately, however, there is no separate vote on a compromise amendment.
I must therefore explain that, for some of us, whilst we agree with the spirit of the proposal that there should be no discrimination against fathers, there is still a difference between paternity and maternity, at least as things are arranged at present, since men cannot become pregnant and they cannot give birth. I should like to say that we have voted freely, because we should have liked to participate in a compromise, because we have an amendment which...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I can also ask my group not to vote to put this amendment in the ...
President.
Mrs Lulling, are you opposing the vote on this amendment or not?

Very well, you are familiar with the Rules of Procedure.
I shall ask Parliament whether it wishes this compromise amendment to be taken into consideration.

On the subject of Amendment No 71
Mr President, it is a minor omission which we can correct, with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr van Hulten. In the last paragraph of Amendment No 71, the text reads, 'The authorising officer by delegation shall, at the same time, forward this report to the internal auditor' , and we should like to add orally, if the House agrees, 'and to the accounting officer' .
We forgot to include the accounting officer, and it would be better to put him back in, because he too is entitled to see this information.
Is there any opposition to taking this oral amendment into consideration?
(Parliament gave its assent)
After the vote on the Commission proposal
Mr President, first of all may I thank you for the brilliant way in which you have conducted this vote,
a fact which seems to have been acknowledged by the House, and to tell you that, as we announced during the debate, and with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, whom I should like to thank very much, and of the other groups, I am requesting the application of Rule 69(2), i.e. that we should not vote on the legislative text, but keep Parliament' s position as it is, and postpone the final vote, so as to allow us to hold what I hope will be effective and useful negotiations with the Commission and with the Council. I think this is justified in view of the lack of response on the part of the Commission to all the points raised yesterday evening.
That is clear.
Does the House agree to the rapporteur' s proposal to apply Rule 69(2)?
(Parliament approved the request)
(Parliament decided to postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution)
Mr President, I would like to clarify paragraph 11 on which we are to vote.
It is not about creating new processes, but about adding the ecological dimension to the Lisbon Process.
I know that comments and doubts have been expressed on this point, but it is a matter of adding the ecological dimension to a process which already exists.

Report (A5-0169/2001) by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission' s EURES activity report 1998-1999 entitled 'Towards an integrated European labour market: the contribution of EURES' (COM(2000) 607 - C5-0104/2001 - 2001/2053(COS))

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- SchÃ¶rling Report (A5-0177/2001)
Mr President, yesterday I went to Rome to see the newly elected Parliament in Italy.
Among the members elected to the Chamber of Deputies is Mr Fatuzzo.
You will think it is me, Mr President, but it is not me.
You know that Julius Caesar belonged to the Julian clan, and now Mr Fabio Fatuzzo, who has been elected to the Italian Parliament, belongs to the Fatuzzo family.
I therefore went round to see him to congratulate him on his election, accompanied by the driver, Ugo Gustinetti, a pensioner, who said to me, 'As a pensioner, I am very much in favour of this report on the environmental programme because we must have clean air to breathe.
So vote for it!'
That is what I have done, following the advice of the Pensioners' Party driver, Ugo Gustinetti.
. (NL) Those intent on economic growth at any price pay the price in terms of compromising nature and the environment.
The clearest example of this can be seen at the moment in the American Bush Administration, which regards the expansion of oil extraction as far more important than complying with the climate treaty of Kyoto.
After the expenditure of substantial community funds in the EU on unintended environmental destruction, the necessity of environmental protection is now considered more and more obvious.
Hopefully that will lead to clearer-headed choices than other EU decisions on the basis of which smoking is discouraged at the same time as tobacco growing is subsidised.
In candidate countries we see a similar contradiction. They want money for the building of motorways through areas of natural beauty, for dams that devastate shorelines and watercourses and for large-scale restructuring of the countryside.
Anyone frightened to make a choice between the all-powerful economy and the protection of our environment becomes bogged down in conflicting decisions.
That is why it is a good thing that the compromise in this third reading forces Member States to inform public opinion and hence also interested organisations and to give them the chance to express their views on projects.
Financing from European funds can no longer be a justification for allowing environmentally damaging expenditure to proceed.
Roo Report (A5-0178/2001)
Mr President, Mr de Roo has presented the directive on tyre regulation.
I spoke to my daughter, Cristina, well known in this Parliament, who told me, 'Now I understand why Mr de Roo is concerned about tyres!'
'Really?' I answered.
'How have you come to understand that?'
'Well, Mr de Roo has a very obvious surname: he is called R-o-o.
Don' t you see?
In his name there are tyres and wheels.
Nobody else could discuss this report as well as he could.'
I know Mr de Roo will forgive me as he is a very nice man.
I am therefore very pleased to vote for this report of his because nobody could give us Europeans quieter and safer tyres than Mr de Roo.
MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro Report (A5-0168/2001)
Mr President, it is difficult to know how we should judge the report by AntÃ³nio JosÃ© Seguro and IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
We acknowledge that, with the amendments that have been made, it makes a clear compromise in favour of constituting a convention for the envisaged reform of the Treaties and that the report accepts the launch of a constitutional process.
We must also say, however, that the report is not as critical of the results of the Nice Intergovernmental Conference as it should be.
With this report, Parliament is regrettably distancing itself from the prevailing feeling of failure in a European society which saw the Heads of State or Government unable to agree on the path to take for building a political Europe, which is now more necessary than ever because of enlargement towards the States of the East and of the Mediterranean.
Once again, the Members of the majority in this Parliament have ignored their responsibility as representatives of the European citizens, have subordinated their positions to those of their governments and, paradoxically, have let themselves be bested by the political representatives of their own States.
Therefore, now, having heard President Johannes Rau, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and PrimeÂ­Minister Lionel Jospin, I am convinced and have the regrettable feeling that, if the majority Members had known beforehand the positions of these national leaders, the report that has just been adopted would have been quite different.
What I am talking about in particular and what I am most ashamed of is its consideration of the European Parliament as the central location and institution of the political European Union.
I hope that in the future constitutional process, this Parliament will maintain a self-respecting position, which is more responsible, especially with regard to the interests and aspirations of our citizens.
Lastly, I hope that we learn this lesson and that we are aware of the role that falls to us in European politics.
Mr President, I voted against this report on the Nice Treaty, but I found it ironic that my colleagues from the main political establishment parties in Ireland, who criticised the no-campaign in Ireland saying we have no grounds for criticism, endorsed a report today which is extremely critical of the Nice Treaty.
At home they say one thing and out here they do something very different.
I also find it quite alarming that this treaty basically endorses the whole concept of a European constitution which is something that has not been debated in the national parliaments.
In fact, in Ireland when we bring this issue up during the referendum process, we are told that it is not going to happen.
It is quite clear today that this is going happen and there needs to be a bit more honesty with the people.
It is rather disturbing that we had the Swedish Prime Minister, coming here yesterday urging a "yes" vote.
People are trying to put pressure on Ireland to say that if do not vote "yes" we will be stopping enlargement when this is not the case.
The kind of Europe the Nice Treaty proposes is far more detrimental to the eastern European countries, because it divides Europe.
We should be looking for a Europe that is not divided into first and the second-class tiers.
Mr President, I think that the Treaty of Nice will go down in history as a clear example of a lost opportunity, due to the specific requirements of the unyielding defenders of the power of the Member States.
The Member States are political structures that originated from the greatest capacity for production and mobility, born out of the discovery of the steam engine, which, according to the North American thinker Alvin Tofler, was the second great technological revolution for humanity. This meant that the political framework of the old kingdoms, counties, dukedoms and domains which, until then, had structured societies were small and useless.
But since Marshall McLuhan talked about the world as a global village and Tofler himself pointed out information technologies as the third human revolution, the globalisation of political relations with regard to trade, the economy, defence, leisure, and so many other things has meant that the Member States are now also small and inadequate and cannot respond to the current needs of the people.
Therefore, the future path for the European Union cannot be resolved through the measures adopted in Nice: what is needed is fewer powers for the Member States and more for the European institutions.
We need a Constitution, a Parliament, a European Government and a President elected by the people.
Mr President, I voted for this report on the Treaty of Nice, which I have read with the eyes of a party secretary.
You know that I am the secretary of a party which is not a party and is called the Pensioners' Party.
I am convinced that, in the Treaty of Nice, there is an important point that we should develop, which is the point that favours the creation, maintenance and development of European political parties.
Power, Mr President - I think perhaps you agree with me, or perhaps you do not - is very often in the hands of the parties.
If we want a Europe we should also have European parties.
Mr President, I have voted against this resolution from MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Seguro for many reasons, but particularly because of what happened this morning, namely the rejection of Amendment No 28.
That proposed, quite modestly, to recognise in any debate on the future of Europe the political and legislative powers of the current 15 States.
The problem is that this resolution is quite hypocritical in that even if it says that it recognises its commitment to upholding the rights and freedoms set out in the Charter, these freedoms, such as those in Article 4 of this Charter, are not defended inside the European Union, as can be seen in the case of torture in Spain.
The Nice European Council, which was held from 8 to 11 December 2000, enabled the Intergovernmental Conference to make a certain amount of progress.
In particular, the following are worthy of note:
Declaration 23 on the future of the Union, and the launching of a wide-ranging and in-depth debate;
the revision of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union on the respecting of fundamental rights in the Member States;
the loosening up of procedures, making it possible to engage in enhanced cooperation;
the increasing of the powers of the President of the Commission and his appointment by a qualified majority of the Council which, together with the recent proposals by the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, on the election of the latter, make it possible to reinforce considerably its legitimacy and therefore its authority.
This resolution should encourage the Heads of State and Government to go even further, particularly by coming out in favour of the convocation of a convention like the one responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, whose participation in the next revision of the Treaties is essential.
This convention will not limit itself to being merely a forum: we intend it to participate actively and authoritatively in the debate, and to draw up the next treaty in constitutional form.
It is essential that the national parliaments should ratify the Treaty of Nice. The theory that there is a crisis in the recasting process which would justify a call for non-ratification is a myth which places enlargement at risk and makes it impossible to hold the necessary debate.
Yesterday, in this House, we saw a good example of one of the methods habitually used in European affairs to cover up problems and to avoid subjecting them to public opinion.
In the debate on the Treaty of Nice, almost the only thing discussed was the 'post-Nice' situation.
All the federalist speakers raised their heads above the parapet, one after the other, to urge the setting up, at the next Council in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency (a presidency which, of course, is in favour of ultra-federalism), of a 'convention' which would open up a 'constitutive process' which was to produce a 'European federal constitution' which the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference would be called upon to adopt.
Thus the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is regarded as a fait accompli.
We are not even discussing it.
The debate on 2004 has taken the place of the debate on Nice, and no doubt the debate on 2010 will only serve to cover up any debate on the future draft submitted for ratification in 2004.
The result, in the short term, is that practically nobody has talked about Nice, and public opinion is still just as ignorant, except in Ireland, where they are holding a referendum, about the content of a very important treaty which will be stealthily submitted for ratification by their national parliaments.
We published our alternative report on the Treaty of Nice to try to make sure that the debate in France avoids this legerdemain.
In particular it must be emphasised absolutely that the Treaty of Nice as a whole is fundamentally opposed to the spirit and the letter of the French constitution, a spirit which is the spirit of national sovereignty.
Some provisions even contradict it openly.
For example, there is the introduction of integration as an objective for the Union and the Community (Article 43 of the EU Treaty), the introduction of uniform regulations and conditions governing Members of the European Parliament (Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty), the creation of regulations governing political parties at European level (Article 191 of the EC Treaty), the appointing of the Commission by a qualified majority (Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty), the approval by a qualified majority of certain international agreements on common foreign and security policy (Article 24 of the EU Treaty), the new measures taken, by majority vote, to introduce the euro (Articles 111 and 123(4) of the EC Treaty), the transfer to Community level of international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property (Article 133 of the EC Treaty), the inclusion of the Community in responsibility for modernising social security (Article 137 of the EC Treaty), or the creation, in vague terms, of a rapid-response military force (Article 17 of the EU Treaty).
It is absurd, in these circumstances, that at present the French government is not even considering bringing the matter to the attention of the Constitutional Council.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the report on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union.
Despite its shortcomings, the Treaty of Nice deserves clear support, since it makes the EU ready for enlargement.
This quality should not be underestimated.
Up until the Intergovernmental Conference, we supported a so-called narrow agenda and also voted against the European Parliament' s very wide-ranging wishes.
This will also be reflected in our voting on certain elements of this report, where we have voted against, e.g. the section on enhanced cooperation.
The Intergovernmental Conference that ended in Nice showed that there are great deficiencies in the way in which the EU at present amends treaties.
Like the rest of Parliament, we take a positive view of declaration 23 concerning the future of the European Union. However, we oppose large, centrally controlled information campaigns.
Nonetheless, we are very concerned that there should be a general debate on the future of the Union in all the countries and in the EU, so that the next Intergovernmental Conference can be much better prepared than that which ended in Nice, with much greater openness in the decision-making process and an underlying basis of visionary ideas concerning the future of the EU.
The implementation of a convention in the style of that which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year may be a positive contribution in this connection.
Everyone is in agreement about the disappointing results of the last IGC, which are symptomatic of the limitations of the purely intergovernmental approach.
The Heads of State and Government have in any case admitted this, in the Declaration on the future of the Union, which forms part of the annex to the Treaty.
This finding has led the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to demand that the convocation of the new IGC (responsible for carrying out the next revision of the Treaties) should be based on a fundamentally different process, a process which is open and transparent.
It proposes to take its inspiration from the effective and universally applauded method which enabled the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to be created.
It would, therefore, be a matter of bringing together a convention that would be composed of Members of the European Parliament, members of national parliaments, members of the Commission and members of the governments of Member States.
It would start meeting at the beginning of 2002, and would have the task of submitting to the IGC (to be held during the second half of 2003), a 'constitutional proposal' based on the results of a wide-ranging public debate.
This constitutional process would have to result in the adoption of an EU Constitution.
In addition, the report launches an appeal to national parliaments, urging them to undertake to support the idea of the convocation of such a convention when they are called upon to take a decision on the Treaty of Nice.
Although the Treaty of Nice has given much cause for dissatisfaction, it has, nonetheless, removed the last formal obstacle to enlargement.
Having said that, the accession of new Member States requires an in-depth revision of the way our institutions function, because those institutions have almost been brought to a standstill already, when we have only fifteen Member States.
The debate is underway.
Several political personalities have had an opportunity to make their contribution, but we must involve the greatest possible range of actors, together with all the citizens of Europe.
I shall end by emphasising the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be integrated into the Treaty so as to make it obligatory.
This would give a strong political signal to our fellow-citizens. In effect, we now have three years to create, finally, the institutions that will guarantee 'democracy' , transparency and citizenship at the service of a strong European social plan.
. I was present but did not participate in this vote.
I wish to put on the record my support for the Treaty of Nice.
However, with a referendum taking place in Ireland next week, I felt that it would not be appropriate to participate in this vote as it is broader than the text of the Treaty itself.
I look forward to the ratification of the Treaty and then one should deal with the other issues raised.
I support the enlargement of the EU and the adoption of this Treaty will remove the final block to that development.
. We, Members from different parties in the GUE/NGL Group, have not voted in favour of the report concerning the post-Nice report.
We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy, as the report in practice advocates.
Instead of transforming the EU into a state, we are of the opinion that the Union must be democratised.
Democratisation of the European Union must be achieved through a decreasing of the Commission's power and the introduction of openness and transparency into the legislative practices of the Council.
The future debate about the European Union must also be about the role of the national parliaments in the future Europe.
Today, political debate in Europe is focused on elections to the national parliaments (with the exception of the presidential elections in some states) and this can also be seen in the turnout in the different elections.
The role of the national parliaments must be strengthened in decision-making in Europe.
We further protest against the militarisation of the EU.
We insist that the EU remain a civil organisation and that the non-aligned countries' special status is respected.
We are of the opinion that the future Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU, reassessing the currency union's lack of democracy and its right-wing policies.
We demand that the stability pact be reconsidered and Article 56 of the Treaty be rewritten in order to bring the ECB under democratic control.
. (ES) My vote in favour of the MÃ©ndez de Vigo-Seguro report is based more on the proposal to overcome the limitations on the Union which still remain after the Treaty of Nice, rather than being in agreement with the Treaty itself.
I agree with the critical view of the current Treaty, as there was a lack of ambition and political decisiveness needed to give it more political content and to improve the capacity for decision making and participation of the Community institutions, especially Parliament and the Commission, in order to overcome a method of operation that is becoming increasingly markedly intergovernmental.
It is very bad that, even in the new areas on which it was agreed in Nice that decisions would be taken by qualified majority, the codecision procedure was not incorporated.
Although I recognise that Nice made the positive contribution of enabling the enlargement process, I do not think that this is enough.
In fact, the Member States recognised the limitations of Nice, convening a further IGC for themselves in order to revise the Treaty of Nice in 2004, with specific objectives that will have to be finally fixed in the meeting in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency, at the end of this year.
I agree with the priorities that the Belgian Presidency has announced for this and, in particular, with incorporating the constitutional regions into the debating process on the content of the next Treaty.
Of course, I defend the Brussels Declaration signed on Monday of this week by seven constitutional regions, of which Catalonia is one, and we need to ensure that the European regions with legislative powers participate in a very prominent way not only in the preparatory debate, first in Laeken and then at the IGC in 2004, but also in the decision-making processes on the policies of the Union.
For the party and coalition represented by ConvergÃšncia i UniÃ³, this aspect is of fundamental importance in order to ensure that the citizens of the Union participate in it to a higher degree, and it is obvious that the constitutional regions are already an element of representation, responsibility and contribution on a European level that the Union cannot do without.
I would like to reiterate my support for the proposal that the post-Nice debate should become a constitutional process, as this is the best option in order to clarify and fix the political content of the Union in the 21st Century.
. (ES) The need to provide the EU with instruments that can cope with the challenge of enlargement explains the importance of the institutional reform that should have taken place in Nice, and also the disappointment with the results that were achieved and, above all, with the lack of ambition and political will shown by the Heads of State and Government, who were more concerned with how to block decisions than with finding formulae that would enable us to move forward towards a shared future.
It is true that some progress was made, but Nice is very far removed from what was expected and needed from it, as the reform agreed on does not serve to make a more efficient and democratic EU in view of enlargement, as is shown, moreover, by the annex on post-Nice that accompanies the final Treaty.
Therefore, the MÃ©ndez de Vigo-Seguro report should have been more emphatic, because it was important for Parliament to highlight the inadequacies of Nice and send a clear signal about this, which is why I also regret that some of the amendments tabled that were going in that direction did not stand.
But aside from this, the report contains some aspects, above all regarding the need to use a method similar to the Convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the need to begin a constitutional process culminating in the adoption of the European Union Constitution, which made me inclined to vote in favour of it, despite my conviction that Nice was a wasted opportunity.
. The state of permanent constitutional upheaval which is a characteristic of the contemporary EU is a major shortcoming in our constitutional arrangements.
With the Treaty of Nice, coming so soon after the Treaty of Amsterdam and to be followed by another IGC in 2004 we live in an Age of Permanent Revolution.
There are signs that this successor IGC may achieve a degree of constitutional settlement which is much to be welcomed and to reach it, it is necessary to pass through the Treaty of Nice despite its self-evident shortcomings.
. (FR) The outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice falls well short of what the people and the nations of Europe were expecting.
First of all, priority should have been given to the content of the European Union and primarily to the question of fulfilling the needs and the rights of all citizens.
There should have been a debate about a real charter of social rights and freedoms, rather than about ratifying a cut-price charter of fundamental freedoms.
Once the question of content had been raised, the next question to be tackled should have been the question of the equitable funding of European policies, in particular a review of taxation and a demand for democratic management mechanisms that would satisfy those needs.
Taxes on capital (Tobin-type taxes) and sanctions on companies that make staff redundant while they are making profits would have been a step in the right direction.
We now come to the question of the container.
Europe must equip itself with the means to ensure genuine democracy with reference to all the major issues at stake in our society, while respecting the diversity of the peoples of Europe, yet at the same time allowing the emergence of a European citizenship.
We must give our workers and our citizens the means of joining in the debate, and influencing issues concerning employment rights and economic choices, placing the governments and the European Central Bank under control.
The Treaty of Nice is diametrically opposed to this approach, as are the policies proposed by this report.
This is why I have voted against.
. (DE) I would have liked to vote for the motion for a resolution on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union, with our group's proposals for amendments, if I had had the opportunity to make it clear, through a recorded vote, which points I cannot support under any circumstances.
I do not believe - in common with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, incidentally - that we should have a European Constitution as long as there are individual states with their own constitutions and as long as there is no European nation.
Nor am I one of those people who regret the fact that at Nice, the rules on qualified majority voting were not extended to taxation.
We have not yet reached a stage where an accidental majority in this House could agree, over the heads of the national parliaments, the types and levels of taxation to be levied by the Member States.
I would therefore have wished to vote against this provision in a recorded vote as well.
In this House, I have always supported the principle that decisions on fundamental and constitutional matters must be unanimous.
I would therefore have liked to vote, in a recorded vote, against the paragraph which states - quite incorrectly - that this would undermine the social and political deepening of the Union.
In order to make my views on this issue very clear, I was unable to vote for the resolution as a whole.
My colleagues and I in the French delegation of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted against the Treaty of Nice, but since others who also voted against it did so for different reasons, we feel it is essential to explain our reasons, so as to make things quite clear.
We did not vote against the Treaty of Nice because it did not go far enough, as the more rampant supporters of federalism believe. Nor did we vote against it because it went too far, a complaint voiced among a certain number of schizophrenics who secretly dream of reversing the whole process.
We voted against it because, quite simply, it is heading in the wrong direction.
However, although we are extremely concerned by some of the suggestions that are still being made before this House as soon as there is any mention of the prospect of any further abandoning of sovereignty on the part of the nation states which are the Member States of the Union, we were, nonetheless, pleasantly surprised by some parts of the final version. This was because, on the one hand, at a functional level, it strongly curbs the supranational trend which seeks to bring us, as rapidly as possible, to the total obliteration of States, in favour of a bulimic and uncontrollable Commission, and because, on the other hand, it goes beyond the somewhat petty reservations of some people and persists in preparing for enlargement, thereby reminding us that, before being a standardised and uniform single market, Europe is, in principle and above all, a political structure in which, of course, the peoples of Eastern and Central Europe and the Mediterranean, despite being excluded at the moment, of course have their place.
In spite of these sensible reactions, however, the Treaty of Nice was unable to escape from the logic, so fatal to the democracies and peoples of Europe, that in accordance with Declaration 23 on the post-Nice process, the European Union should be committed to a 'constitutional' movement which can only lead to a European federal state, the affirmation and future functioning of which are totally incompatible with the continued existence of nation states, whatever the two heads of the French Government, Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin, might think.
Moreover, even though political semantics has already had to accommodate other strange bedfellows which are just as incongruous as this impossible idea of a federation of nation States (we only have to think back to the hilarious concept of democratic centralism), history teaches us that, in the end, people will no longer put up with being abused by what is, at best a tragic error, and, at worst, an unforgivable lie.

.
(NL) The Nice summit focused on EU enlargement, but definitely not on a more democratic and transparent decision-making process in the EU.
Instead of finally moving towards subscribing to the European Treaty on Human Rights a Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union was proclaimed, with a completely unclear status.
Although the Council long ago lost its raison d' Ãªtre as the guardian of national interests, and only plays a part as a guarantee for secrecy and chaos, voting relations within that body turned out to be still more important than the input of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
Nice makes the European labyrinth no less impenetrable and more durable.
When it shortly has a possible 30-plus Member States the complex and obscure decision-making of the EU will become hopelessly bogged down.
I therefore argue for a different model, without a Council but with more influence for voters. The European Commission makes proposals, the European Parliament takes the final decision and the national parliaments then individually decide whether their Member State will be bound by that decision.
It is not a supranational or supranational model, but an interparliamentary one, focused on recognition of democracy and diversity instead of on a multiethnic society that leaves the real decisions to multinationals and NATO.
The rapporteur does not offer that alternative.
Therefore I myself and a large section of my group will be voting against.
. The Labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the Treaty of Nice which opens the way to enlargement of the European Union, an objective which all Member States of the Union have sought, as have successive British governments.
The idea that the Treaty of Nice makes the European Union a centralised superstate is nonsense and was rightly dismissed as ridiculous in the debate yesterday.
This resolution acknowledges that the last remaining institutional obstacles to enlargement have been removed and we welcome that.
It also looks at the need for further reform, to which Labour is committed in order to make the European Union more effective, more transparent and more accountable.
Nonetheless, the resolution contains some criticisms of the Treaty of Nice which are unfounded and also contains some proposals for the future which pre-empt the debate on the future of Europe due to take place over the coming years.
Some of these proposals are premature and some are unlikely ever to be desirable; for this reason, the Labour Members decided to abstain on this text.
- (SV) The main task of the European Council in Nice was to make EU enlargement possible.
All 15 national parliaments in the Member States will ratify the Treaty of Nice in 2001, regardless of the fact that the majority of members of the European Parliament appear to be dissatisfied with it.
Therefore, we Swedish Christian Democrats believe that paragraph 42 of today' s report, which addresses issues such as the European Parliament' s assent to the accession treaties, could be worded so as to be much more positive and welcoming.
How will this point be received by Estonia, Poland and Cyprus, for example?
My party cannot approve paragraph 25 of today' s report, which opens the way for the introduction of a European level of tax, and what is more with decision-making rules based on qualified majority voting.
All experience shows that new levels of decision-making for taxation lead to higher taxes and less money left for the citizens of the EU, whom we represent.
Another key issue, apart from tax law, when it comes to the decision-making ability of each national parliament and government is defence policy.
Therefore, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party also cannot approve paragraph 31 of the report in question which demands that defence policy be included in 'enhanced cooperation' or "flexible integration" .
We Swedish Christian Democrats are happy about two proposals in the report for historic and vital improvements.
The first concerns improvements to the opportunity for citizens and national parliaments to access information about, and to monitor, the Council' s work, by making the meetings of the Council of Ministers open when the Council is adopting legislation.
This is an issue which I have consistently brought up in the European Parliament' s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and for which I have found increasing support.
This is now also the common view of Parliament as a whole.
If it is to be possible to talk in terms of democracy - and not just diplomacy - within the EU, this openness must be achieved, i.e. we recommend approval of paragraph 11 of the resolution and Amendment 68.
The second proposal is about applying and refining the principle of subsidiarity.
There is no single European people, but a great many.
There is no single European mother tongue, but a great many.
There is no single European nation, but a great many.
There is no single European culture, but a great many.
Bearing in mind these circumstances, along with fundamental values such as human rights, democracy, openness, clarity in calls for political responsibility and guarantees of cultural and linguistic equality within the EU, the Swedish Christian Democrats welcome Amendment 77 on clearly delimiting the EU' s political competencies.
This is fully in line with the fact that citizens do not want increased distance from the decision-makers and increasing European political centralisation.
As always, European integration is proceeding by a series of tests and necessary measures.
The essential test which it has inflicted upon itself for the next few years, and which is also a historical imperative, is, of course, the task of opting to reconcile the geography of the continent with its history, and to carry on with the enlargement which will now enable democratisation and considerable economic reforms to take place in the Central and Eastern European Countries.
The Treaty of Nice, which the MÃ©ndez de Vigo report tackles and comments on with great honesty and rigour, is first of all a substantial political choice by a Europe which is finally reunited on the question of its founding values of democracy, freedom, solidarity and culture.
This is a considerable political ambition for our future, which on its own would justify the ratification of the Treaty of Nice, though it has to be admitted that the Treaty has not provided us with the institutional reforms to enable us to exercise, democratically and consistently, a European political power which is held by at least twenty-seven countries.
The difficulty in reaching agreement at Nice, even among fifteen countries, on the future institutions of the Union, is proof, if proof were needed, of the limitations of the inter-governmental approach in a Union consisting of an even greater number of Member States.
This is why I welcome the fact that our rapporteur is proposing to create a convention, based on the convention which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in order to make preliminary plans for and to propose to a future IGC a Constitution for the Europe of the future.
This step, let us not deny it, will constitute a historic moment in European integration, and its task will be to link our peoples and their future in a way which will be irreversible.
This is why a democratic and public debate, a debate which is open to all our peoples, must precede this pre-constitutional stage, so as to remove any ambiguities about the kind of Europe that we want to build together. Is it to be a political Europe or a business Europe?
Is it to be a powerful Europe or a club of countries paralysed by the rule of consensus?
The public debate decided on at Nice, and the convention method which we have just affirmed here, are the conditions for this imperative, which is to render more democratic the debate on Europe and what is at stake in Europe.
Despite the respect I have for the rapporteur Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, today I voted no to his report on the Treaty of Nice; however, this does not mean a no to Europe.
The Irish people have not been allowed an adequate debate on the impact of the changes proposed in the Treaty of Nice upon Ireland' s sovereignty and Independence.
This Treaty does not have to be decided on until the end of 2002, yet the Irish Government is pressurising the Irish people to vote, although they have only had approximately three weeks to digest the minimum information provided to them.
The Irish electorate has the right to know what the consequences of the Treaty are for the people of Ireland and Europe as a whole, including candidate countries.
In a recent national poll, nine out of ten Irish people stated that they did not understand the Treaty of Nice and voter apathy is extremely high.
This situation I have no doubt is reflected in other Member states and surely it is not the way to engage citizens to feel politically concerned at local, national and European level.
There are many areas of concern within the Treaty of Nice for a small nation, some of which are: that Ireland cannot be part of enhanced co-operation because of its corporate and energy tax policies; the future loss of veto, the only sure means by which a small country can influence decisions and protect its interests; the undermining of Ireland's neutrality in an increasingly militarised Europe, in which the Treaty of Nice brings an army, called the Rapid Reaction Force, associated with NATO and a military command structure into the EU for the first time.
There is also the deepest concern with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, clearly intended to be legally binding in 2004, as a constitution or constitution-treaty, which through the decisions of the EU Court of Justice could take precedence over our Irish Constitution and our Courts.
Our Constitution is a finely crafted document, which enshrines the values and beliefs that have sustained the people of Ireland through the best and worst of times.
It enshrines among other things the constitutional protection of life, marriage and family and should not be vulnerable to decisions made without the full, informed consent of the Irish people.
Sadly the Christian foundations and heritage of the European Union are conspicuous by their absence from the Charter.
Surely an Europe which strives to be a Continental power, proud of its economic progress and intellectual capital should not be afraid to acknowledge its spiritual dimension, a dimension which will lend us strength as we work towards peace and security.
The federalists' anger over the Treaty of Nice, which is scrupulously echoed in the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, is, initially, surprising because, far from being a change in direction, far from initiating a fundamental reform of the European integration process which would facilitate the harmonious reunification of our continent, the Treaty of Nice actually uses enlargement as a new excuse and incitement to introduce more supranationality, more centralisation and more of the super-State.
The Treaty of Nice therefore fits in perfectly well with the ideological approach of its predecessors.
It strengthens the supranational institutions and creates new elements of supranationality such as the European political parties or the uniform regulations applying to MEPs.
For the first time it lays down in the Treaties the objective of integration, applying it not only at Community level but also, and there is nothing to stop this ideology, at intergovernmental level too.
Why, then, is there such an outcry, within this old hotbed of federalism, the European Parliament, against a Treaty which boldly displays the predominant federalist philosophy?
Could it be, as Georges Berthu has given us to understand, that with Nice we find ourselves confronted with the expression of a new phase of federalism, which is an even more radical departure from the 'state' component, in favour of the component consisting of numbers, of population size?
Does this mean, in particular the reweighting of votes within the Council and the Commission, which is closely linked to population levels, and the concept of the demographic verification clause, that the European institutions are being redesigned in such a way as to ensure that the concepts of equilibrium and equality will be obliterated, and their place taken by the domination of those states or groups of states which have the largest populations?
If this is true, then we would be heading towards a Europe no longer consisting of equal, and equally respected, states, but a Europe consisting of unequal peoples.
If we are to halt this dangerous trend, calling on the old federalism to combat the new federalism is certainly not the right way to go about it.
In order to escape the antidemocratic trends that threaten it, we must rethink European integration, basing it on respect for national democracies.
(Speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
I decided to vote against the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro report, although I am a convinced European and I care about the future of the European Union.
However, I do not think that the preamble offers any real guarantee on conditions for an enlargement that will be fair to all the countries involved.
In addition, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be binding means that it will not be possible to provide a solid framework for a Europe in which the issue of the greatest deprivation of rights must remain a priority, for example the protection of workers from the arrogance of certain employers.
Finally, the absence of any clear affirmation of the equality of social, economic and political rights between foreigners or immigrants and European nationals worries me enormously, at a time when the sudden upsurge in the populist xenophobic vote is setting the heart of Europe ablaze, in Austria, Lombardy, Italy and Switzerland, when we see the extreme violence of the ultra-right and extremist movements in Germany, or of the hooligans in Great Britain, or when we consider the fate of thousands of people living in our countries without papers, who are at the mercy of those who traffic in human misery in all its forms. These are serious shortcomings.
As for the lack of action following the election violence in Spain, described as a pogrom by commentators, this is not worthy of Europe.
Finally, the fact that the dimension of a Europe turning towards the countries of the south, in particular Africa which is sinking into economic, health and ecological misery, is not really a matter of priority, the fact that there is no provision for simply abolishing the debts of third-world countries and increasing aid to those countries, and also the lack of any thoughts as to how to restore equilibrium between the CFA franc and the dollar, the yen and the euro, all these things will serve only to increase the growing imbalance.
The fact that the IMF and the World Bank have admitted their responsibility surely means that the development of Africa deserves to be made a priority, in view of our colonial history.
This does not, of course, detract from the serious work of the rapporteurs and the recent declarations by the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, which both point in the direction of a more fraternal, mutually supportive and just Europe, but which seem to contradict the positions taken up by Mr SchrÃ¶der and Mr Blair.
Our Europe deserves a Treaty of Nice which is along the lines of the recent declarations, or at least closer to the declarations of the two heads of the French Government.
The Treaty of Nice has confirmed the absence of any political, democratic and open plan for European integration.
On the question of enlargement, the only option proposed is to take from the south in order to give to the east, while at the same time trying to reduce the funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP).
If we want enlargement to be more than just an expansion of the market and of the euro zone, Europe must direct its efforts towards the Structural Funds, with the aim of reducing development disparities by assisting the least developed regions of the Union.
The present level of funding is insufficient, not only because of the needs of the new populations which are to become integrated into the EU, but also because intolerable inequalities still persist within the Union as it is today.
Any new European plan will have to be accompanied by a radical transformation in the thinking behind the CAP.
The small farmers of Eastern Europe must be able to be included in this redefinition of the CAP (jobs, regional planning, environmental considerations, solidarity with small farmers in the third world, productivism, a subsidies policy that encourages exports).
Lastly, enlargement cannot be successful if Europe does not place social issues at the heart of the process, in particular the issue of the living and working conditions of the various peoples.
This report tackles the question of enlargement almost exclusively from the point of view of the EU institutions, without identifying as a precondition for enlargement the essential agreement and commitment of the peoples and populations concerned.
Myller Report (A5-175/2001)
I would like to justify why the Group of the European People' s Party voted against the Myller report while saying that we fully support the project and the Commission' s Environment Action Programme.
The Commission drew up an excellent, very balanced and scientific programme, with a great sense of the future, and which aimed to be a document that would arrive in Johannesburg with all the dignity of Europe, proclaiming a viable, feasible environmental policy that is accessible to all and can be implemented and made a reality.
However, here in Parliament many amendments have been introduced.
As a group, we cannot accept any of them.
As a group, in order to demonstrate our willingness, we have broadened the usual horizons of the environment and we have added very clear support for the urban environment, which did not previously exist, we have increased interest in the countryside and the rural environment, we have also supported municipal participation, which did not feature in the proposal, and we have also supported public health with great enthusiasm.
However, we find that measures have been introduced which are impossible for citizens to comply with.
The level has been raised so high that it is impossible even for the enlargement countries to achieve it.
We think that we need to govern with our heads and with a spirit of solidarity towards the citizens.
We cannot impose things so that we, the Members, get the credit, and profess to belong to the 'greenest' group of all, while it is causing major problems for the people.
For example, with regard to labelling, complying with the standard would require all companies, including the smallest ones, to have a large amount of bureaucracy devoted to filling in labels, and small companies would have to take out civil liability insurance.
It would be crazy what the people would have to do if these measures had to be applied.
As far as taxes are concerned, a general European tax would fall on the poorest people, those who live outside the cities, etc. For all of these reasons, we voted against the report because we defend the people and a viable and common sense model.
Mr President, the Myller report as it has been submitted to us to vote on, is a report without a concrete plan of action.
The vagueness that characterises the report contains the danger of focussing only on a number of eyecatching items, such as the introduction of the CO2 tax and the Kyoto standard.
This report therefore overlooks the central question and specifically the question of how the environment can be better protected than has been the case up to now.
Thus far, concentration has been focused mainly on raising charges rather than offering concrete incentives to live in a more environmentally aware way.
In addition they are completely neglecting the absolute necessity of achieving harmonisation at international level, because for as long as we are incapable of doing that, it will create a negative effect, mainly for Europe, and it will prove an obstacle to trade.
For all these reasons, I abstained in the vote.
Mr President, I too voted against the Myller report, but not for the reasons that Cristina GutiÃ©rrez explained so well just now.
I often happen to talk to elderly people and pensioners and so I have also discussed the environment with them, which we have regulated so much here in this beautiful chamber in Brussels and in the even more beautiful and larger chamber in Strasbourg.
In our conversations they have expressed a doubt, a problem.
They have told me, 'With your reports, with your environmental programmes, to whom are you trying to give good, clean air to breathe, for whom are you trying to have beautiful countryside, for whom are you trying to make life better?
The young, the middle-aged, the old?'
Here it is, then: what I see as missing in these plans is the objective of having a clean environment for the elderly, who are the ones who need it most.
If the environment can be clean and accessible for the elderly, it will also be so for those who are young like you, Mr President.
The French socialist delegation has always defended and encouraged the strengthening of the existing positive relationship between agriculture and the environment.
This is why we support the general objectives of the Myller report.
However, we cannot accept the fact that an attempt is being made, in the guise of an amendment (Amendment No 150), to call into question the very elements which form the basis of the CAP.
We cannot answer for the replacement of production aids.
Today' s CAP no longer bears any resemblance to the policy of forty years ago; it has been fundamentally reformed.
We wish to continue that work, but not in an insidious manner.
Changes in direction are now possible and desirable.
We support them, but we cannot rubber-stamp this amendment, which would lead to the calling into question of a whole section of the CAP without integrating it into the overall change of direction.
. As a member of the Environment Committee of the European Parliament, I hope that the United States Government and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of greenhouse gases.
The fact of the matter is that the greater the use of greenhouse gases, the greater the effect that this has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities not only in Europe but world-wide.
I am fully aware of the preparation of the European Union for the World Summit on Sustainable Development which is being held in South Africa in the year 2002.
I support the four lines of action that have been drawn up by the European Commission in the preparation for this World Summit.
The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of economic development, to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency, promote the sustainable use of water land and energy as well as try and ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation is broken.
I also welcome the fact that the European Commission recognises that the best approach to take to ensure the successful implementation of these action goals is best agreed under the framework of the United Nations.
Ten years after the crucial Rio de Janeiro Summit, expectations have not been met.
The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world.
We must all redouble our efforts so as to be sure that next year' s World Summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a matter which protects existing communities.
The Community' s Fifth Environment Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution.
Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environment Action Programme would not be attained easily, the Commission has rightly decided on a step by step approach setting out so- called interim environmental targets by the year 2010.
The Environment Committee of the European Parliament will continue to play an important co-ordinating role in this regard.

- (FR) We voted in favour of the Myller report because we believe it goes in the right direction and gives an overall impression of the policies which should be followed in the context of environmental protection.
It is important that the concept of sustainable development should be taken into account at all levels of decision making and in all sectors.
Governments (European, national, regional and local) are also called upon to integrate these considerations.
Businesses have a major share of responsibility for the current problems.
However, we must not forget that the public has enormous power, via demand, and it can therefore guide environmental considerations in relation to business investment.
One of our priorities must continue to be making the public at large more aware.
In addition, and despite the fact that the environment knows no geographical boundaries, it is essential that the European legislators should respect the principle of subsidiarity, in other words, they should not over-regulate at European level, but should leave it to the national authorities to define sustainable development at local level, since it is a concept which includes not only environmental protection but also the economic and social context which is essential to human beings.
This is why we did not vote in favour of certain amendments which we felt exceeded the bounds of this context.
I voted against.
The purpose of this action programme is to define objectives, to establish a basis for reflection, and to ensure the success of future Community projects in this area.
Together with many of my colleagues in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I took up a firm position on this report.
At first-reading, it is necessary to send a strong signal so that, when it comes to the second reading, improved consistency, the right balance and a realistic vision can be found.
The report that we are voting on today will cause difficulties.
The objectives that it sets out are too precise. They will lead to a lack of flexibility, and will completely block forthcoming Community initiatives.
This applies when it comes to setting ecotaxes, or defining too precisely how the CAP is to be reformed, although I believe that reform to be desirable.
Then again, some amendments go against directives which have already been adopted by the European Parliament, or else they place too many restrictions around those that we shall be considering in the near future.
This applies in the case of environmental responsibility.
A report such as this must allow the flexibility necessary to adapt European projects in line with developments in scientific research and technical progress.
- (FR) We shall be voting in favour of Mrs Myller' s report, amongst other things because it highlights the basic problem posed by the Council' s proposals on the sixth Community Environment Action Programme.
The intentions, ambitions and priorities of those proposals are often praiseworthy, but the clarification of the objectives (what exactly is sustainable development?) and the definition of the policies, the resources and the time scales, are still extremely vague.
When it is a question of imposing liberal economic reforms and defending the individual interests of private financial powers, the Council issues restrictive regulations.
When it comes to facing up to the ecological crisis and thereby defending the collective interests of the population, all it does is issue very general professions of faith.
The contrast is striking, and it is not difficult to understand.
The ecological crisis, which is now of human origin, is fuelled by the predatory behaviour of this liberal capitalism which the Council is in favour of.
The implementation of a policy of sustainable development requires a radical change of direction in the area of economics, a change of direction which the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties seek to prohibit in the name of commercial competition, employers' rights and freedom for private investment.
There are two alternatives: defending large shareholders on the one hand, and ecological requirements (as well as other, more numerous, social needs) on the other. We have to choose between them.
Mr President, with regard to this report on safety belts, something has come to my mind.
Would you, Mr President, throw yourself off a bridge with an elastic cord tied to your feet, as so many young people do these days?
I do not think so.
I certainly would not!
Yet just think, Mr President, that one of the people elected to the Italian Parliament, who yesterday took part in the first meeting of the Lower House, is an Italian TV presenter, an attractive, pleasant, famous woman, Gabriella Carlucci - who is now Gabriella Carlucci MP - who has jumped off a crane with an elastic cord tied to her feet.
Well, I think we should not set examples of rashness and dangerous living if we then want to implement directives requiring all of us to be strapped into our cars more safely.
The report which we have voted on today at first reading is concerned with a legislative proposal to amend Directive 91/671/EEC.
This directive, it has to be admitted, made a contribution to road safety in the European Union, inasmuch as it made it compulsory to wear safety belts and to use child restraint systems.
Such provisions are essential as they make it possible to reduce the severity of injuries in the case of an accident.
Research into accidents has shown that, for children who are not restrained by an appropriate system, the risk of being seriously injured is seven times higher than for those who are restrained.
However, it would seem essential to revise this ten-year-old text.
Under current legislation, for example, children less than three years of age can use an ordinary rear-seat belt.
As the father of young children, I am in a good position to condemn this state of affairs, which places their health and their lives at risk.
The restraint systems currently available on the market are sufficiently well designed to enable their use to be made compulsory.
The use of child restraint systems must therefore be further harmonised and made more certain.
The Commission' s proposal also extends the scope of the directive by including in it the wearing of a safety belt, by the driver and seated passengers, in all motor vehicles which are suitably equipped.
This proposal, though satisfactory, is not sufficiently precise.
That is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism wanted to provide additional details.
These include the launching of an information campaign about the danger posed by an air bag to a child transported in a rear-facing safety seat fitted to the front passenger seat of a vehicle.
With regard to safety conditions for children less than 12 years old, I believe, like the rapporteur, that it is more logical to take their height into account rather than their weight, because they do not need special restraints if they are at least 150 cm tall.
Ensuring the safety of our children is a collective responsibility. I therefore voted for all the amendments which work towards that end.
. (DE) The effectiveness of the use of seat belts and restraint systems in vehicles to reduce severe injury and death is widely recognised.
This applies especially to the use of child restraint systems.
The Commission's proposal and the Committee's proposals for amendments improve and expand upon the existing Council Directive 91/671/EEC of 16 December 1991:
1.
Drivers and passengers in all vehicles on the road must wear seat belts where provided.
2.
All the existing exemptions for restraint systems, in particular for children, are eliminated.
3.
The child's physical size is taken into account as a parameter for the use of seat belts.
4.
Rear-facing child restraint systems which are fitted to the front passenger seat are only permitted if the airbag has been deactivated.
5.
Better information to be supplied to the public.
Despite the omission of important points such as
attachments for child restraint systems to be fitted as standard in all vehicles,
detection systems to be introduced to indicate whether the front passenger airbag has been deactivated,
identifying the best way of providing information on seat belts and restraint systems in vehicles,
my group fully supports the report.
.
(NL) First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, for her work and express my support for this report on the amending of Regulation 91/671/EC.
This will make safety belt systems compulsory in cars up to 3.5 tons.
Backward facing child seats will also be forbidden unless the airbag is disabled and passengers will have to wear belts in every vehicle fitted with them.
My group is gratified that her amendments have been adopted.
As a result child seats will apply to children not only below twelve but are also shorter than 150 cm.
There is also demand for an "airbag information campaign" to warn against transporting children in seats when the air bag is activated.
"Smart" airbags might be a solution.
And finally the manufacturer should give the consumer better information on which seats are best suited to children.
The principal aim of the regulation is to reduce the inconsistencies caused by difference in application of the present ordinance in the Member States.
As a result the regulation will become more transparent and more predictable.
Problems in intracommunal traffic will be solved because legislation in the Member States will be brought into line.
There was some discussion on the question to what extent this regulation is a community power or a power of the Member States.
After studying this question of subsidiarity carefully, I believe that European legislation is required here to increase transparency in the field of compulsory seat belts and seatbelt use.
It is a shared competence based on Article 251 of the Treaty.
The fragmented legislation in the Member States cannot be tackled by the implementation of a uniform Regulation at community level.
Hautala Report (A5-173/2001)
Following the discussions which led to this report, my group helped to improve the Commission' s proposal, by means of amendments which were legally sound, progressive, in the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in line with the directive, and which, above all, would not lead to any increase in bureaucracy for employers, Unfortunately, in spite of compromises, with which we were largely in agreement, the rapporteur and other groups, without consulting us, introduced further amendments which called the compromises into question and which culminated in the tabling of a so-called Compromise Amendment No 70.
On this point, I should like to point out that, while I agree with the idea that one should not discriminate against fathers either, the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this amendment because there will always be a difference between 'maternity' and 'paternity' .
Unless the present order of things changes, men cannot become pregnant and cannot, therefore, give birth.
Moreover, this amendment is something of a muddle, so that those of us who like good, solid, legal texts cannot agree to it.
As far as the final voting is concerned, many of us were unable to vote in favour of the report because, against our wishes, amendments such as Amendments Nos 4, 36 and 44 were adopted.
As the Commissioner has said, they are unacceptable because they ignore the most basic procedures, and in particular the provisions of the Treaty.
If this Parliament is a co-legislator, it should not confuse a legislative text with a resolution, in which one can reveal all kinds of wishful thinking.
A legislative text must be capable of implementation.
Let us not forget, either, that in seeking to give women at work all-round protection, we run the risk of impairing and endangering their access to employment and their chances of promotion.
Please, let us stop getting so worked up over sexual harassment, and finally, in this area as in others, let us not ignore the principle of subsidiarity.
These are the reasons why many of the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this report.
I await the second reading, and I hope that the wisdom of the Council will be brought to bear on the irrational proposals which we have adopted.
Mr President, I voted for this report.
In fact, I am in favour of all measures that bring equality of treatment between men and women.
On the subject of men and women, I should like to say something about the presence of women in the national parliaments.
In the newly elected Italian Parliament, the number of women has fallen: thus we are going backwards.
I now want to appeal to Mr Berlusconi, who will head the Italian government.
Mr Berlusconi, is it really true that there will be no women ministers in the new Italian government?
I hope not!
Even if there is just one single woman minister, it will mean that Mr Berlusconi has listened to my explanation of vote, which will make me very happy.
Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate the excellent work done by Mrs Hautala.
She has taken the first step, but after hearing Commissioner Diamantopoulou, we can expect new important steps to improve current EU legislation in this field.
I think most people in Europe would consider today's vote on this subject as one of the most important steps towards raising the credibility of this House.
Probably we have done more today to promote the European Parliament than all the euros spent on this institution's official propaganda.
Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Berlusconi will listen to me and take up the invitation I made to him just now in my last explanation of vote, but I must say that Mr Prodi, the President of the European Commission, has listened to my sister, Anna Maria Fatuzzo, concerning this document.
Why, you may ask.
While talking to my sister Anna Maria about the European Community budget yesterday in Rome, she said to me, 'As I see it, you ought to have more funds in your budget.
Europe ought to have more money.'
You will not believe it, Mr President, but, the next day, all the papers in Italy - and I think all over Europe - reported the declaration by President Prodi calling for a tax, paid specifically by the citizens, called a 'tax for Europe' : not an extra tax - which is something I would not agree with - but for European funds to be financed by means of a quota of the taxes paid by European citizens.
It might be better if you had my sister Anna Maria come here: perhaps, as she is a woman, she would be listened to more than I am!
Clearly, Mr Fatuzzo, not everyone can vote here.
. (PT) This report enables us to go into greater depth on the initial proposals for the revision of Directive 76/207/EEC on ensuring equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions, extending its scope to cover all aspects of equality concerning the professional life of women, in an attempt to make a positive contribution to changing the countless forms of discrimination that still remain in the world of employment.
During the preparatory debate, we made our contributions, specifically by tabling amendments arising from working meetings in Portugal with union activists in sectors in which women make up a large part of the workforce, such as commerce and services, textile industries, the garment and shoe-making industries and the electrical and electronic components sectors.
Not all of our proposals were adopted but something of their spirit is implicit in the report, particularly in terms of the need to prevent any discrimination against female workers on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity leave, in terms of the need to adopt the necessary measures for reconciling family and working life and in terms of greater restrictions on opportunities for any discrimination in access to employment.
The report also contains a whole raft of positive amendments in the field of fighting sexual harassment in the workplace and of protecting measures for prevention and for positive action for protecting equality while discrimination continues to exist.
This is why we have voted in favour of the report.
I abstained, because many of the amendments adopted have little to do with the original purpose of this text.
The European Parliament has already had an opportunity to say what it thinks about the issues of equality of opportunity and the special nature of women in a social and professional context, and I am pleased about that.
However, if we keep on overdoing it, we run the risk of producing exactly the opposite effect to the one we are seeking, and of producing real discrimination against women.
What will be the attitude of the managers of small and medium-sized undertakings when they are faced with increasingly restrictive rules and regulations? Will they not prefer to take on men rather than women?
Is that what we want?
Protecting women does not mean imposing increasingly rigid and restricting rules. It means, above all, subscribing to firm principles, at the same time authorising the flexibility made necessary by the constraints of the job.
The Hautala report' s amendments to the old directive on equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, and working conditions are, to a great extent, progressive.
The inclusion of positive action in favour of women, the distinctions made between direct and indirect discrimination, the definition of sexual harassment, and the claim that women, at the end of their maternity leave or after adopting or fostering a child, should have the right to go back to their own job in the same way as men do when they have been on leave, all these are intended to combat discrimination and to achieve greater equality between women and men in the workplace.
We now need to tackle the question of the initial training which, via our schools, accustoms children, from a very early age, to the sexual division of tasks and thus to the inequalities which we find in the world of work and which these amendments are intended to combat.
In the same way, we must also introduce and integrate compulsory measures to ensure that the laws or directives adopted are fully complied with.
For example, in France, despite the equal rights laid down by law, the difference in pay between men and women is still, on average, 27%.
It was with reference to real equality that we supported the Hautala report.
Dell'Alba Report (A5-0176/2001)
. I supported Amendments Nos 14 and 179 of the above report.
Although the report does not concern the public's right of access to the institutions' documents, the Commission text seems to introduce a new and ill-defined exception to access to documents, namely "interests of the Union", which could negatively affect the Parliament's right to documents.
I believe that the Commission's proposal, in the parts which Amendments 14 and 179 seek to amend, is in conflict with the recently adopted regulation on Article 255 (Public access to documents).
This regulation states that "All rules concerning access to documents of the institutions should be in conformity" with the recently adopted regulation (Recital 12).
For more than thirty years, the finances of the European Communities and the European Union have followed the unchanging rhythm of the Financial Regulation, if one disregards implementation measures, and some seventeen years will have passed before the plan to reform that regulation is completed.
The proposed reform of the Financial Regulation applicable to the budget of the Union, which the European Commission is submitting to the Council of Ministers, is certainly one of the major texts of this legislature, a text which will govern the finances of Europe for a long time to come.
That shows just how important the new version of this text, which we have before us today, will be to the future of the European Union.
There are six vital areas covered by this unprecedented reform proposal: the reaffirmation of the principles of budgetary law, the execution of the budget, markets and subsidies, accounting and the presentation of accounts, external measures of the European Union, and other major aspects such as the discharge procedure, the EAGGF Guarantee Section, the Structural Funds, research and development, OLAF and administrative appropriations.
On 16 May, the Committee on Budgets, when adopting Mr Dell'Alba' s draft report, pointed out, quite rightly, that the fact that the Financial Regulation takes precedence over all other financial rules and regulations should be explained in its enacting terms.
It also requested, we believe with good reason, that the budget heading to which receipts are allocated should be clearly defined, as should the purpose of the appropriations.
The Committee also expressed itself in favour of integrating into the Community budget all the European Agencies, including future agencies. However, to integrate these agencies into the annual vote of the budget authority would have the effect of making them lose their autonomy, despite the fact that they were created precisely to be autonomous, and the European Parliament already votes on their annual subsidy and their discharge.
Again, as far as these agencies are concerned, it is worth pointing out, quite apart from the fact that they ought to remain independent, that OLAF is dependent upon the Commission, whereas Europol and Eurojust are funded by national budgets.
(Speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
Blokland Report (A5-172/2001)
Mr President, Mr Blokland has presented a report on the environment and the economy, on the needs of the environment and on economic policy.
I was thinking about this yesterday while on the plane from Rome to Brussels.
Unfortunately, the weather was dreadful - black clouds, rain, lightning, storms - and the plane began to toss about.
I had a dreadful ten minutes, Mr President.
I remember (I was just reading this report) that I wondered, 'Will Mr Blokland,' whom I could see at the controls of the plane, 'also manage to beat the storms, hurricanes and black clouds that I am afraid the environment is bringing us?'
I wondered, I wished, and straight away the plane re-entered calm and peaceful weather and I landed in Brussels.
Long live Mr Blokland!
Naturally, I voted for the motion.
Mr Fatuzzo, the President is amazed at how much you were able to do yesterday in Rome and while you were travelling to Brussels.
To be honest, your diary is much more flexible than the President' s.
HulthÃ©n Report (A5-171/2001)
Mr President, page 15 of the HulthÃ©n report states, 'Sound and sustainable management of the Earth's resources is essential for the survival of mankind.'
I read this part of the HulthÃ©n report to my mother, who lives in Rome, and whom I am always going round to see, as I did, indeed, yesterday.
She said to me, 'But why on earth should the future survival of mankind interest me?
I am 88 years old: my future is today.
Go and ask Mrs HulthÃ©n and the European Parliament' - and that is why I am asking you now - 'to think not just about the future survival of mankind' - an excellent thing, which is why I voted for the motion - 'but also about the survival of mankind right now, which is all too often not a very cheering subject but which I feel is really important for us here at this time.'
Myller Report (A5-0175/2001), Blokland Report (A5-0172/2001), HulthÃ©n Report (A5Â­-0171/2001)
The three reports on environment and development tabled for voting at the part-session on 31 May 2001 will set the tone of the European Parliament for the preparations for the Gothenburg Summit.
Ten years after the concept of sustainable development was recognised as the development system that can reconcile economy and ecology, despite a whole host of standards and regulations, on the whole the environment has suffered more than it has gained as a result of development.
Although the concept of sustainable development seems to be understood by the Commission and certain Member States, this is almost certainly not the case in all fifteen Member States.
Even some Members of the Commission still imagine that economic development in the long term can be adjusted simply by adding a dash of environment.
However, it is all very well for the European Union to talk about wanting sustainable development. The fact is, that its policies on agriculture, the economy, transport, energy, foreign affairs and development persist in demonstrating that the reverse is true.
The environmental aspect still ends up playing the Cinderella role.
This situation is clearly reflected in the reports tabled before the European Parliament.
The resolutions have succeeded in giving practical expression to our responsibilities and obligations in the face of the continuous deterioration of our planet, global warming, and the disappearance of biodiversity, and they serve as a reminder that only a completely new approach to policies can hope to reverse these trends.
As far as they go, all these proposals, the abolition of subsidies which have a harmful impact on the environment, the introduction of ecotaxes, environmental responsibility, making WTO reform conditional upon environmental aspects, the annual assessment of policy progress using credible criteria, are moving in the right direction.
However, will the Council and the Commission have the courage to take into account the position of the European Parliament?
We cannot count on it.
Despite the clear thinking behind policies dealing with global warming, and the undertakings that have been given either orally or enshrined in treaties, guidelines or other international agreements, as yet these pious wishes have been put into practice on only a very modest scale. Remember that greenhouse-gas emissions would have to be reduced by 80-90% over a period of 50 years in order to halt the global-warming process.
So far, a figure of only 8% has been agreed
The Fifteen know what is at stake.
Will they have the heart and the courage, at Gothenburg, to change direction and change gear, by daring to get to grips with the issues of CAP reform, transport pollution, and energy?
If not, it will be with full knowledge of the facts that they will have to take on board the economic, social, environmental and financial consequences of their political inconsistency.
Ribeiro e Castro Report (A5-168/2001)
Mr President, allow me to congratulate you on your excellent French just now, which I heard you speak in such ringing tones that I very nearly thought you were a Frenchman who sometimes speaks Spanish.
Instead, now I have seen, as I had first thought, that you are a Spaniard who speaks very good French.
I voted for the EURES report, which says that it is necessary to inform citizens about their pension rights.
Mr President, every week I am a guest on private television channels and inform Italian citizens about the rules on pensions.
Therefore, I too am a EURES-Fatuzzo or a Fatuzzo-EURES, and so I am in favour of this report.
As I said, I voted for it and I hope that more and more will be done to keep all citizens, particularly pensioners, informed.
.
(NL) This proposal argues for the expansion of the existing EURES network into a European employment service.
The rapporteur rightly starts from the principle of voluntary mobility of people going to work in another Member State or in Switzerland.
But what does voluntary mean?
Did those who came en masse from the Mediterranean in the 1960s to work in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, come voluntarily, or were they forced by poverty, unemployment and dictatorship?
There is still much more work migration in America than in Europe.
Someone who loses his job there must take a job thousands of kilometres away, often an insecure job that pays worse than the previous one.
Because it is not necessary there to regard it as emigration to another country, and people are also remaining in the same language area, the government considers it normal that people should be cut off from family and friends.
Europeans are protected from such pressure as long as no one can force them to look for work abroad or in another language area.
It is much better to bring work to people that to take people to work.
But it is precisely on this count that a liberal economy falls down, which concentrates all activity in areas with a favourable location for traffic.
It is precisely under those circumstances that a single European labour market does not work to the advantage of employees or of society as a whole.
Parliament has completed its agenda.
The Minutes for the sitting will be submitted for Parliament' s approval at the start of the next part-session.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on Thursday, 31 May 2001.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of Thursday 31 May 2001 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a comment about the Minutes.
In the Annex to the Minutes, in the Texts Adopted, on the MÃ©ndes de Vigo report - I am just looking for my papers and of course cannot find anything now - it states at one point that a European constitution should be drafted. This goes back to a proposal for an amendment by Mr Brok.
When I checked with Mr Brok, he confirmed that he did not choose this phrase in his proposal for an amendment.
I would therefore request that the proposals for amendments be used to check again whether this theme has now been included correctly in the final MÃ©ndes De Vigo document in all the languages, as we obviously want to avoid any misinterpretations here.
Of course, Mr Ferber, we shall certainly check this.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
The next item is the final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
I have no requests for amendments to Monday or Tuesday's agendas.
Relating to Wednesday:
I have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to postpone to a later part-session the joint debate on the annual report by Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on human rights in the world in 2000 and the European Union Human Rights Policy, and the Council statement on the European Union strategy in the international organisations.
A representative from the Group of the European People' s Party will be taking the floor, so that Parliament can discuss the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice, in the presence of the Council and as part of the debate on the preparations for the Gothenburg Summit.
Madam President, we found it very difficult indeed to put forward this proposal, especially as we are always keen to cooperate, also with Mrs Hautala, as far as politically possible.
However, we wanted to have enough time for the debate on Gothenburg, which is why we have proposed that the Wuori report be postponed until the mini-session.
This is therefore not a substantive objection; it is simply a matter of having more time to prepare the important Summit in Gothenburg.
Madam President, I would like to appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering and also everyone else who planned the successful postponement of the reading of my colleague Mr Wuori' s human rights report.
When this Parliament addresses human rights this is always done at a very theoretical level but when something really could be achieved people want to delay it.
I would request that Mr Poettering consider that my colleague Mr Wuori' s report not be removed from the agenda and that a short discussion be held nevertheless on the Irish referendum in addition to the discussion we are going to have on the Gothenburg Summit.
It would be a pity if the undeniable high point of the week, my colleague Mr Wuori' s report, were now suddenly to be taken away.
None of you wanted this last week.
We should perhaps have realised that the Irish referendum would arouse discussion but we did not.
Madam President, my group is prepared to support the postponement of this debate on human rights provided that it takes place during the July part-session and is not postponed indefinitely. This is because we believe that the debate on this report is very important, but we also believe that there are other events, such as the case of Ireland, which deserve our attention on the eve of the Gothenburg Summit.
I will add one piece of information: if I am not mistaken, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, will appear before this Parliament during the next part-session.
Mr Verhosfstadt, as a senator in the Kingdom of Belgium, was the rapporteur for the committee which studied Belgium' s responsibilities in the case of Rwanda.
An historic judgment is currently being drafted in Brussels which will define the universal dimension of genocide, which I believe does honour to Belgium and the European Union.
I believe that it is very important that we listen to the Belgian Prime Minister on such a crucial issue.
Thank you, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
I believe that Mr Poettering agreed to include the report in the agenda of the July part-session.
Mr Poettering presented the request and Mrs Hautala has spoken against it.
A speaker in favour of the request will now take the floor, since Mr Poettering tabled it.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo in its favour, as long as the debate is placed on July' s agenda.
This means, then, that there are two speakers in favour of postponing the debate.
Madam President, let me make an alternative suggestion.
I propose that my colleague Mr Wuori' s human rights report remain on the agenda and in addition the Council and the Commission be asked for a statement on the Irish referendum in conjunction with the Gothenburg discussion.
This is completely possible.
We have the whole morning for these two discussions.
Mr Gollnisch will now speak in favour of postponing the report.
Madam President, thank you very much.
Pursuant to Rule 111, I shall speak in favour of the proposal to amend the agenda in order to take into account the extremely important event which took place in Ireland, which proves to us that the cohesion of smaller nations that refuse to give up their freedom is something which must certainly be taken into account.
I am fully aware of the importance of what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has said and of the presence of our eminent Belgian guest, who is a specialist on human rights in Rwanda, but I also believe that there will be the opportunity at the July session to discuss, in particular, human rights in Belgium and the infamous procedure, which is currently being waged against the Vlaams Blok, which should encourage the Belgian leaders to put their own house in order.
I shall put to the vote the request by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to postpone Mr Wuori' s report to the July part-session.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although we are unable to change the United Nations' vocabulary, I believe that we are able to use self-discipline.
Now, at Nice, you proclaimed a charter on our behalf, which gave rise to considerable discussions as to whether the expression 'human rights' should be replaced by 'individual rights' .
I believe that this is the terminology that we should use in our internal work.
Madam President, I have another question regarding Wednesday.
Due to our ill-judged decision to cancel Friday, for which you cannot be held responsible, we now have to begin at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday.
We are on the way to a five-day Wednesday!
We might as well start at midnight on Tuesday and work right through until 8.30 a.m.
However, I rise to address the issue of Question Time again. Question Time with the Commission has been cut yet again.
We always prepare ourselves very carefully so that we put specific questions to specific Commissioners.
This was enforced by this House during a reform of Question Time years ago.
We have thus addressed questions to specific Commissioners, and I see that apart from a single question to Mr Kinnock, everything has been thrown into one enormous pot.
The attendance of all the other Commissioners at this Question Time, which was scheduled six months ago, has been cancelled without substitution.
I would like to know why this is the case.
I have no requests for amendments to Thursday's agenda.
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches relating to procedure:
Madam President, with your permission, I rise for the first time here in connection with the Rules of Procedure.
I wish to propose that we include a debate on the impact of the referendum in Ireland as a separate agenda item.
In my view, the referendum in Ireland offers this House the unique opportunity to shape democracy and intervene immediately in the current debate, rather than always following after the event.
Nice resulted in too little democracy and failed to create a sound basis for enlargement.
We need more than this now, and with the help of the Irish people, we can re-open this debate.
This is the reason for this motion to amend the agenda: we move that a separate agenda item be included to debate the impact of Nice, our positions as parliamentarians with regard to our own willingness to create more democracy in Europe, and the finality of Europe.
Europe's citizens would not understand if we shirked this issue at this time.
Mr Martin, I think that your request has just been more than fulfilled by the vote that the House has just taken.
Obviously, although the House has decided to postpone Mr Wuori' s report until the July part-session, the reason was not, of course, as Mr Poettering has explained perfectly clearly, because Mr Poettering was opposed to Mr Wuori' s report, but simply so that there would be sufficient time to hold a thorough and in-depth debate.
I therefore believe that this is a satisfactory outcome for you.
Madam President, I would like to support Mr Martin' s proposal, for the situation is one of great urgency.
The Foreign Ministers are, of course, meeting today and tomorrow in Luxembourg and will probably decide to press ahead with the ratifications as if there had been no referendum, and the Treaty is now set up in such a way that 15 signatures are required in order to amend it.
Consequently, we should take the initiative to ensure that there is at least pause for thought and that we do not just ride roughshod over the Irish referendum.
The Irish referendum should provide everyone with reason for reflection, bearing in mind the substantial resources employed on the 'yes' side compared with the few employed on the 'no' side.
Mr Bonde, I would, in any event, refer you to the Rules of Procedure.
You know that such requests must be submitted at least one hour before the beginning of the sitting and I am absolutely sure that this was not done.
Madam President, my point of order has, perhaps to some extent been pre-empted by the earlier discussion, but following the Irish referendum I should like to ask whether you, in your capacity as President of Parliament, will write to the President of Ireland congratulating the Irish people on their wise and far-sighted decision, which strikes a blow for freedom, independence, self-determination and the nation state.
I wonder whether you will also join me in congratulating our colleague, Dana Rosemary Scallon, on the marvellous role that she played in Ireland in helping to deliver a no vote in the referendum.
Mr Helmer, as you are aware, I sent a message which is not exactly along the lines that you suggested, but which expresses what I believe to be the opinion of the majority of the House.
Madam President, I should like to say that it is a decision made by the Irish people, whether we like it or not, and I do not particularly like it.
I want to say to the Eurosceptics in this House and throughout Europe that, whether they like it or not, that decision was made in good faith.
At the same time it ill-behoves those anti-Europeans to dance on the grave of the Eastern European nations that are so anxious to join the European Union and to join us in this House.
The Irish people are a generous people.
We have accepted great support from the European Union since we joined it and we are prepared to give back a great deal of what we received.
Confusion, however, was spread at a great rate by the fundamentalists of the left, by the fundamentalists of the right, by the cranks in the middle; and the truth was not properly sold.
Let me say to the Commission and to the others that in future we must make these Treaties simple and comprehensible to the European people; but do not blame the Irish people for making a truly democratic decision.
We must now reflect on that decision, each and every one of us in this House and throughout the European Union.
It was a decision made in good faith.
Madam President, I canvassed and voted in favour of the Nice referendum in Ireland and was disappointed with the result, but, I hasten to add, I fully accept the democratic decision taken by the electorate in my country.
The will of the Irish people must be respected.
We should not rush into a debate.
It is time for reflection and analysis.
A debate at this time would only suit the many Members in this House who are opposed to giving the eastern and central Europeans the opportunity to share in the economic growth we are enjoying in the European Union.
Clarification is undoubtedly necessary.
Let there be no ambiguity: the Irish people are a generous people.
They have a social conscience and favour enlargement.
This matter will be resolved within Ireland; we do not need any interference from outside, from Members of this House, whether they are for it or against it.
The Irish people will resolve their own problems.
Any future debate here should follow the debate in our own country.
Madam President, my point also concerns the Irish referendum.
It has been eloquently made by more experienced Members than myself and so, in the interests of not detaining the House, I shall withdraw it.
Mr President, following up on Mr Helmer's point on the Irish Referendum, you may recall another event last week, in the UK.
Mr Helmer's party campaigned on the principle of keeping the pound against the euro.
Now we all know that the British people soundly rejected his party on that policy.
Will he now join me in voting to go with the euro?
Madam President, one thing that makes my heart very glad is to hear the last unreconstructed Tory of the seventeenth century agree at last that freedom is a good thing for Ireland.
(Laughter and applause) I extend the hand of friendship to Roger.
I welcome his conversion.
I say to him - because he does not have a great understanding of history - that historically, a 'Tory' means somebody who is hunted: 'tÃ³raidhe' , a hunted one.
I am beginning to think that Roger and those of his political party are feeling a little bit that way since last weekend.
The tÃ³raidhe were Anglo-Irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion.
They refused to go and were loyal to the king.
I hope that Roger is enlightened now.
I certainly hope that we have bridged the gap between us.
Edmund Burke, a great British parliamentarian, said: "All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good people do nothing".
Evil triumphed last weekend, not in the person of those people who went out and mistakenly voted for the wrong side, but of those who told them lies and deceived them.
They are the people who cadged money from abroad in the interests of breaking up the solidarity of the people of Europe and spent it to tell lies to the Irish people, while the Irish government - and, unfortunately, the opposition - were so complacent that we thought everybody would trust us.
I want the people of this House to know that every major newspaper supported a 'yes' for eastern Europe.
I want this House to know that a large number of the people who voted 'no' believed that they were doing no damage to the interests of the eastern European countries.
I have one disagreement with my colleagues Mr Andrews and Mr Gallagher about the generosity and special merits of the people of Ireland.
I believe we are different.
We have a slightly different culture and a very different history.
Yet we are the same as everybody else here.
We have good people and bad people.
We accept democracy nevertheless, because it is the only way.
As the Jacobites said after the Battle of the Boyne, "Change kings and we will fight you over again", and I believe we will win the next time.
Thank you, Mr McCartin.
I think that Mr Helmer has the right to respond to the first part of your point of order.
I shall therefore give him the floor once again.
Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking my friend and colleague Mr McCartin for his lesson in history.
However, primarily I want to respond to Mr Miller who made a point about the British election and about the euro.
As he knows perfectly well, but is apparently seeking to hide, the Conservative Party's position on the euro was supported by between 65% and 70% of the British people.
It was the one key issue where the public were definitely and clearly on our side.
I would remind Mr Miller that his Prime Minister has just sacked the pro-euro foreign minister Robin Cook and replaced him with the much less pro-euro, indeed some have called him a Eurosceptic, Mr Jack Straw.
So put that one in your pipe and smoke it!
Madam President, I rise on a point of order concerning my friend Roger Helmer.
We share the honour of being representatives for the East Midlands - information I give to this House more in shame than in anger.
Mr McCartin pointed out quite rightly that Mr Helmer had no understanding of history.
In the interests of accuracy: Mr Helmer has no understanding of politics, of statistics, of literature, of courtesy towards a fellow Member State of the European Union - and I could go on for a considerable amount of time.
(Laughter and applause)
Madam President, allow me a final remark on Ireland.
Is it not strange that those Members of Parliament who speak most about national independence are the same ones who lead massive foreign intervention in elections in other countries?
I look forward to asking them on Wednesday what it is they want.
Do they want to weaken Ireland the same way they weakened Denmark ten years ago?
I warn against that.
Madam President, following on from the last comment, it is obvious that the Irish made their decision in a very democratic way, as did, alas, the British people, because they voted in this wonderful Labour government.
But as we are trying to change what the Irish said in their referendum, maybe we should look at the British vote.
Surely this House would have wanted to see a Conservative government returned, and on the basis of fact and realistic policy, people would have wanted to vote Conservative on Thursday last.
That is the result that we would all have liked.
My fellow Danish MEP, Mr Haarder, decided to speak in a language other than his own.
I intend to speak in our common language.
I believe that it is very important that we here in Parliament seek to bring about a debate in which we show respect for the decision that was made in Ireland.
Although the participation rate was low, I think it is worth remembering that it was no lower than it was in many places in the European Parliamentary elections at which we were elected.
The participation rate in Ireland corresponds very well to the participation rate in elections to the European Parliament.
I would like to say to the Irish people that of course it is up to them to work out how we move forward. However, I cannot fail to recommend the Danish model.
In complete contrast to my good fellow Member, Mr Haarder, I would gladly recommend the Danish model.
I believe that it is the way forward for this cooperation and that it would bring somewhat greater flexibility and somewhat more latitude into it. This latitude could also provide room for that diversity which will become part of the experience of all of us when enlargement becomes a success, which hopefully will happen very soon.
Madam President, I should like to say that I do not entirely agree with my Danish fellow Member, Mr Haarder, in his attack on Jens-Peter Bonde, who was the campaign leader in Ireland.
In fact, I would like to say that there are an incredibly large number of us Danes who are pleased the more he is away from Denmark, because then he is not doing damage there.
However, now that Mr Bonde is advocating openness so much, we should like to know whether the DKK 100 000 that he obtained for the campaign came from opponents or from his former comrades on the central committee or in East Germany.
Madam President, since you have been asked to write to the Irish authorities as a part of the debate on the events in Ireland, I am wondering if we should not also ask you to write to the leader of the British Conservative Party to pass on our condolences at the outcome of the elections, which is mainly due to deep-rooted euroscepticism which is not a good sign.
Madam President, I rise under Rule 174, the right to petition the European Parliament.
You may be aware of a number of petitions concerning Lloyd's of London, as well as complaints to the European Commission.
One of the names of Lloyd's of London received a letter from Lloyd's criticising him for daring to raise this matter with the Commission, and a rather threatening letter saying that it was a clear breach of the terms of an agreement.
Lloyd's therefore requested written confirmation within seven days that this citizen would desist from taking any further action in breach of the settlement agreement.
I have written to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, saying that this not only dealt with complaints but also the right to petition Parliament.
The President is looking into the question of complaints to the Commission, but he said clearly this is an issue that Parliament would itself want to address.
I will certainly give you full details of this later but it is such a serious matter that I thought it should be raised in the House now.
Thank you, Mr Perry.
I shall, of course, take note of what you have said.
We have somehow moved onto dealing with the points of order, but we had already established the agenda.
Madam President, Mr JoaquÃ­n JosÃ© MartÃ­nez was declared innocent by a jury in Tampa of two murders for which he had previously been condemned to death.
All of us in the European Parliament have many times been deeply involved in the debate on the death penalty.
During that debate, we defined our set of values and our beliefs, and we have also entered into a dialogue with our American friends on many occasions.
We have campaigned at Senate and Congress level in all manner of ways.
This should give us a great sense of satisfaction, and I also hope that you will be prepared to express this on behalf of our Parliament during your visit to the Gothenburg Council this week.
We have in any event noted that, for once, the position of Europe against the death penalty has triumphed over that other set of values.
I hope that the intensification of the debate on that other set of values between Europe and the Americans can lead to increased awareness on the part of the Americans. If one wishes to condemn another person, but ultimately wants to protect one' s own values, one should not back down from those values, but should defend them instead.
That is why our protest against the death penalty is crucial.
I hope that you, on behalf of the entire Parliament, will once again be prepared to voice this at the Gothenburg Council this week, particularly at a time when President Bush is visiting Europe.
Mr van den Burg, I had already intended to speak at Gothenburg on this issue, along the lines that you have described.
I would like to remind you, however, that the European Parliament' s Bureau decided that Parliament would co-organise a very important meeting, which will be held on 21 and 22 June, on the world-wide abolition of the death penalty.
We have already been assured that around 30 leaders of the national parliaments, from all continents, will be taking part, and have accepted to come to this meeting.
Madam President, I am sorry, but something seems to have got lost in translation.
My question was very precise.
I wanted to know why, out of the three Commissioners who were scheduled to participate in Question Time with the Commission, two have been cancelled and all the questions addressed specifically to these Commissioners, such as Mrs Schreyer, have been bundled together under 'General Matters' , where they have no chance of being answered.
That was my question.
Yes, Mr Posselt, I was informed that Question Time has been shortened because the Members of the Commission scheduled to attend have not received enough questions.
Yes, that was why.
Your comments have been noted.
Madam President, I would like to come back to a less amusing issue than the exchange which we have heard during the last five minutes.
I wish to ask whether there have been any further developments concerning the application for the removal of Mr Dell'Utri's immunity since the last Parliamentary session.
After all, since 8.30 this morning, we have been deprived of the other case, to the great regret of our colleagues in the PPE-DE, so I am told.
I would like to ask you this: since the last Parliamentary session, have you received any documentation from the Spanish authorities concerning the application for the removal of Mr Dell'Utri's immunity?
If so, have you already forwarded this documentation to the committee responsible?
If not, do you intend - now that a further month has passed since May - to take any initiatives to request the Spanish authorities no longer to block the process initiated by the Spanish judiciary?
There have been no new developments, Mr Schulz. The Supreme Court has still not sent us a request through the official channels, namely, via the appropriate Spanish governmental authority.
I do not think that it is the task of the President of the European Parliament to urge the Court to do this or otherwise.
I believe that the President of the Supreme Court is, I would say, old enough to look after himself and able to make up his own mind.
Madam President, I do not fully understand your reply to Mr Schulz, since, according to your reply to my letter of 15 May, you acknowledge that you have received documents from the Spanish Supreme Court relating to the request for the waiver of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, and that does not square with your reply to Mr Schulz.
This is not the case at all.
The Supreme Court subsequently sent further documents, and they were again sent directly to me.
I really do not understand the need to go back over this subject, as the matter is perfectly straightforward.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to inform me of the opinion of the Spanish Council of State, in other words, that it is the task of the governmental authority to submit requests for waivers of immunity.
This is clear.
I cannot really see why there is a need to persist with this, as, in my view, the matter seems to be perfectly clear.
Therefore, until I have received the request sent via the Spanish governmental authorities, I shall not take it into consideration.
In addition to the answer I gave Mr Schulz, I would also like to reiterate that, as you know, a certain number of initiatives have been taken.
We have drafted and drawn up an exhaustive document on all the requests for waivers of parliamentary immunity involving MEPs since Parliament was elected by universal suffrage, as, in fact, requested by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
This document could not have shown any more clearly that, with the exception of Portugal, all the requests have always been submitted to us by the governmental authorities, again with the exception of Portugal and another case involving Spain, where there is some doubt, in relation to which, the Official Journal stated that the request came from the Spanish Ministry of Justice.
Another initiative that has been taken is that the Conference of Presidents asked the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up a report on the general problems relating to requests for waivers of immunity and to propose amendments to the regulation, if need be.
I think I am right in saying that it is Mr Duff who has been appointed rapporteur and we look forward to the report that Mr Duff will present to us at the Conference of Presidents.
As you see, therefore, we are keeping a close eye on the progress made in this matter.
Madam President, thank you for permitting me to rise again.
I greatly regret the fact that my only opportunity to put a question to you regarding the Dell'Utri case is at the opening of Parliament during the discussion of the agenda.
As a simple Member of this House, there is no other opportunity to raise this type of issue.
I have been accused on several occasions in this House of only having an interest in this matter due to the Italian election campaign.
The election campaign is now over, and so I would like to come back to the Dell'Utri case since it has great significance for every Member of this House.
An application for the removal of immunity could be lodged tomorrow against any Member of this Parliament - against me, against Mr Poettering, against Mr Haarder, against Mrs Frahm, against any one of us - and, in order to avoid public speculation, the Member concerned must have the opportunity to make a direct statement about the accusations.
For the last nine months, Mr Dell'Utri has been denied the opportunity to make a statement on the accusations made against him here.
This is why it could be quite important to tell the Spanish authorities that the way in which the Spanish government deals with applications for the removal of immunity submitted to this House is also a matter of honour in its relations with the European Parliament.
One further point, Madam President: in Europe, where there is a separation of powers, it is accepted that the judiciary can approach the legislature direct.
There is only one Parliament where it is claimed that the executive must have a proviso in such cases, and that is this Parliament.
This is an absurd situation for which I hold you, Mrs Fontaine, entirely responsible.
Mr Schulz, I am sure that Mr Dell' Utri will listen carefully to your concerns.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is worsening.
Albanian rebels are dangerously close to the capital, the authorities in northern Greece are preparing to receive refugees and Olympic Airways flights to Skopje have been cancelled.
We all know that the terrorists are from Kosovo, an area under NATO control, which alone is responsible for what is happening in the FYROM.
At the same time, both ÃÃÃÃ and the European Union are preventing the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from taking basic measures to protect the country and the people, while agreeing to talk to the terrorists and the government on equal terms.
Yet the Greek government has proposed a plan which, rather than disarming the terrorists, allows them to depart in safety, requires the European Union and the USA to be directly involved in the negotiations and prepares the ground for military intervention.
We urgently need to take account of the peoples' struggle in order to put a stop to foreign intervention and so that NATO forces can leave and these nations can resolve their differences peacefully and without any foreign interests being brought to bear.
Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis.
I would like to remind you that, as you know, the President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be coming to address Parliament on Wednesday morning.
His visit will, naturally, be brought up at Gothenburg and, as you would expect, I shall also be referring to this in my speech.
I would like to bring up two points.
First of all, the death penalty.
The death penalty equates to murder, and even if a murderer is killed under the death penalty, this is still murder.
We are opposed to the execution of Timothy McVeigh, even though he is a murderer.
This should be pointed out.
There is no good or bad use of the death penalty.
Even the lowest of the low do not deserve to be killed in this way.
I would like the European Parliament to adopt this position.
My next point refers to the debate on Ireland. I hope that it will be organised differently and that it will not take place merely at the level of the group leaders.
We saw earlier that a slightly more spontaneous organisation gave rise to much more lively debate than when the debates are organised by the heads and leaders of the groups.
I hope that we shall draw the appropriate lesson from what happened five minutes ago.
Sexual exploitation of children - Trafficking in human beings
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
report (A5-0206/2001) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography [COM(2000) 854 - C5-0043/2001 - 2001/0025(CNS)]
report (A5-0183/2001) by Mrs Klamt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings [COM(2000) 854 - C5-0042/2001 - 2001/0024(CNS)].
, rapporteur. (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by offering my personal congratulations to Commissioner Vitorino on taking such an important legislative initiative and thank the Swedish Presidency for its support, which will ensure that the Council takes a decision as quickly as possible.
The sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are, of course, a scandal in a modern civilisation and it is unthinkable that criminal networks and customers should go unpunished and avoid criminal prosecution by taking advantage of the lack of cooperation between countries and shortcomings in our criminal legislation.
It is high time we addressed appalling cases such as the Dutroux case in Belgium, where the inadequate legal framework means that it is still impossible to prove the constituent elements of the crime and hold the trial which has been pending for the last four years, which is why the Union initiative to stamp out this vile crime and create a common reference framework to strengthen judicial and police cooperation between the Member States and bring these criminal syndicates to justice is all the more important.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has worked through the Commission framework proposal line by line and has adopted a series of proposals and amendments which enhance and strengthen the initial legislative text, such as the definition of child pornography, which has been expanded considerably so as to include the various permutations of this crime and ensure there are none which escape prosecution, taking account of course of new technological developments.
As far as the sexual exploitation of children is concerned, given the composite nature of the crime and the international networks involved, we have included types of criminal conduct over and above those proposed by the Commission, such as facilitating, buying, selling or transporting a child within or outside national borders.
Another important point which we have added apportions responsibility both to the natural persons who care for the child, such as parents, teachers etc. and to legal persons, including distribution companies and Internet service providers, which are now required to design protective mechanisms to prevent new technologies from being used to facilitate the exploitation of children.
As far as crimes relating to child pornography are concerned, we have proposed that importing, exporting, purchasing, selling and advertising, and not just producing, distributing and disseminating child pornography should be criminal offences.
What is also extremely important is that we have made the possession of pornographic material a criminal offence, subject of course to safety valves which ensure that people who receive material unwittingly, for example by electronic or conventional mail, need not fear prosecution.
As far as punishment is concerned, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms accepted the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for a stricter criminal framework for crimes inflicted on children under the age of 16, rather than the age of 10 proposed by the Commission, with stricter punishment of at least 10 years rather than the 8 years proposed by the Commission.
We have also proposed that, in addition to condemnation, any movable or immovable assets which are proceeds from these offences be traced, seized and confiscated and that punishment be accompanied by psychiatric treatment. This is another innovation which we have proposed.
As the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, we have also made an important contribution on the procedural side by making provision for criminals to be extradited, so that the phenomenon of sexual tourism can be stamped out, and amending legislation on double criminality, so that offenders cannot escape to countries in which crimes against children are punished more leniently.
We also propose compensation for victims and a host of measures to protect victims during investigations and hearings and of course afterwards, especially for disabled children.
Finally, we propose setting up registers of persons who have committed the offence, in collaboration with Europol, Interpol and national police forces, and involving candidate countries in action to combat the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
I am well aware that promoting legislative arrangements is not the only solution.
We need to focus on the causes of the mental and physical abuse and exploitation of children, such as poverty, the lack of fundamental structures to protect children, the lack of control and prevention mechanisms, the breakdown of the family and, of course, the fact that such a market - a market of huge supply and demand - exists and, unfortunately, operates within the European Union, discrediting our European civilisation.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is estimated that as many as 700 000 women and children are trafficked every year.
From the Central and Eastern European states alone, 120 000 women and children are lured to the European Union every year. These are the figures on which the Commission proceeds.
The fates of the individuals profiled in the media, but also the statistics highlight the urgent need to combat human trafficking through a coordinated and cooperative approach.
