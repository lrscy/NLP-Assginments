That might result in the NGOs being thrown out, which are the sole remaining source of information.
Europe could suggest lifting sanctions and at the same time increasing the diplomatic pressure on Pakistan.
This would slow down the advance of the Taliban and especially bring them back to the negotiating table.
However, this will only be possible if at the same time there is investment in the NGOs operating there that are trying to improve the situation of men, women and children.
Mr President, two days ago, MÃ©decins du monde alerted us in the towns of France as we in the European Parliament seek to inform public opinion on Afghanistan.
MÃ©decins du monde added that the European Community budget given to NGOs in Afghanistan was in sharp decline.
I ask myself how we can receive representatives of the Afghan resistance, how we can support Afghan women - which I feel is a very positive thing - without going further and without having the means to express our indignation.
I think that that is the purpose of this resolution, which is much better than the one we drafted two months ago, which I found rather weak, especially with regard to discrimination against women.
Now, we seem able to talk about crime, about rape, about apartheid, about everything which reflects the situation of women nowadays.
The current situation is difficult.
It has perhaps been made worse by our support for Commander Massud, Afghan women and many others, as well as the entire Afghan population, which is dying of hunger.
If, in future, however, the effect of our support were to worsen sanctions, to prohibit women from driving for the NGOs working on behalf of women and to close bread shops which enable women to work, to feed themselves and to feed others, we must do more.
And to do more, as has already been said, is to call the countries supporting the Taliban to account.
I believe that the European Community, the European Union, must not only give more money, it must know how to politically call to account those who support this regime and who allow this regime to survive.
This is the logical outcome of our indignation and our support and it is also our responsibility.
It is my hope that we stop confining ourselves to drafting resolutions which, even though each one is better than the last, are still too timid in relation to what we have to do for this suffering population.
Mr President, previous speakers have said that we have repeatedly condemned the violence that is happening in Afghanistan and the human rights violations that take place every day.
What are we to do, however, when the situation gets worse for women and for the Hazars, as mentioned today?
We have a situation in which 170 civilians were executed in January and, as mentioned by Mr Dupuis and the others, there have been attacks in Yakaolang.
What are we to do?
On the other hand, we know that, after the Tampere Summit in 1999, the EU approved a recommendation from a high-level working party concerning how we should deal with the Afghan situation.
I believe that this strategy needs to be soberly appraised.
We need to review it again.
How should our embassies in Pakistan receive people who apply to be allowed to come to our countries?
I have heard it said that they are sometimes treated like criminals.
I am pleased to see that we are seeking an Echo office in Afghanistan, something which should be reiterated.
We must also give our support to the Christian organisations that are working in Afghanistan.
There are Christian organisations that are doing an incredible amount for the Afghan population while maintaining a low profile.
They, too, need our support.
As has also been said by other speakers, we must also devote ourselves to getting the arms embargo into force and to ensuring that the UN gains access to the country in order, for example, to investigate the atrocities committed against the Hazars.
These are some of the measures that are needed.
We cannot get any further by condemning matters time after time.
One feels really powerless.
We need a more intelligent policy in this sphere.
I think that our experience in areas close to home has shown that a presence in the country can also yield good results and, above all, has a humanitarian basis.
Mr President, the dubious honour of holding the world record in human rights abuses goes to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
A few weeks ago, as previous speakers have mentioned, the statues of Buddha at Bamiyan were destroyed and radicalism continues to gain ground.
Religious minorities - first the Hindus and now all non-Afghans - are forced to wear a yellow patch to identify themselves, resurrecting fatal memories of the totalitarian Nazi regime in my country.
Since the Taliban took over, the situation of the civilian population has deteriorated dramatically: women and girls are systematically oppressed, forced to wear the veil, denied an education and face the death penalty for adultery.
Women are not even allowed to take part in the distribution of bread under the UN world food programme.
They are no longer allowed to play leading roles, and the work of international organisations is being hugely obstructed.
Men must wear a fez and grow a beard, thieves are maltreated and their hands are chopped off in public as a deterrent.
The high Islamic priest of Egypt and numerous Muslims, Farid Wasil, is refusing the Taliban knowledge of the true values and ideas of the Koran and has declared their religious values and fatwas to be null and void.
Commissioner, we call on the government of Pakistan to refuse this regime any form of support, be it financial or moral.
Almost nothing has come of earlier promises to destroy poppy fields and opiates.
Last Wednesday, German customs seized six kilos of heroin and 64 kilos of hashish worth EUR two million in a container from Afghanistan.
Drug dealing is used to fund campaigns by religious fanatics and international terrorism.
Bid Laden is still in Afghanistan, feted instead of extradited.
The UN sanctions must stay in place, Commissioner, until Afghanistan makes the transition from the mediaeval world imposed by Mullah Omar to the modern world and hence to democracy and the rule of law.
Mr President, I do not want to repeat everything that has already been said by Members in the course of this debate, which has seemed very eloquent to me, but every so often we find ourselves once again discussing this problem of the attitude of Europe and the international community towards Afghanistan, because each time it seems that the previous record of human rights violations has been beaten.
Recently - this also affects me as an Italian - an Italian hospital in Kabul, one of the few that was working in a decent, modern way, had to be closed because the staff were threatened with reprisals, since the regime would not accept that women could work there in close contact with male doctors and nurses.
It has already been said that the regime has also recently ordered minorities to wear specially marked clothes in the street, which sadly recalls a Nazi practice that we hoped had disappeared for ever.
All this has left us unable to believe any more in mere verbal condemnations and wondering what effective means there might be for the European Union to put pressure on Afghanistan.
As has been said and as the joint resolution has emphasised, it is a question now of putting pressure on the countries that recognise Afghanistan diplomatically and also sustain it economically - Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc. and effectively organising independent forms of assistance both inside the country, with the European Union supplying and distributing humanitarian aid, and outside on its borders where there are refugee and displaced persons' camps, as in India and Pakistan.
All this is extremely urgent, not just to help uphold human rights in that country but also to prevent the Taliban from helping to spread a fanatical, blood-shedding image of Islam in the West, which would add to the image cultivated by our own fundamentalists and racists.
Mr President, on Tuesday, Mohamed al-'Owhali was sentenced to life imprisonment in New York for the Nairobi US Embassy bombing, whilst his boss, Osama bin Laden, is given sanctuary by the Taliban as an Islamic hero of Afghanistan.
This country is now so extreme and medieval that paper bags are banned in case they contain pulped versions of the Koran and women are veiled, segregated from men and unable to work at all.
Even chess and the flying of kites have been banned as un-Islamic, though there are many Islamic scholars who would contest such interpretations of the Koran.
Indeed the rules imposed by the Taliban would appear to derive less from the Koran than from the tribal customs dependent on a view that sees women's value as essentially procreative and economic alone.
Until recently the focus has been on ensuring that Muslims behave in accordance with Islam.
However, in March, following a takeover of the Taliban by a hard-line faction linked to bin Laden, the extraordinarily beautiful 5th-century Buddhist statues in Bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite.
Now echoes of Nazi Germany are heard as Hindus, many tens of thousands of whom I represent as a community in London, are required to identify themselves visibly in public with a yellow cloth.
I am not suggesting that direct intervention in the country which defied the Red Army is either appropriate or feasible.
Moreover, intervention in the internal affairs of other states by outsiders can often exacerbate and prolong a conflict, as may have happened in the Balkans.
It may be that we simply have to wait for things to burn themselves out.
Nor should it be forgotten that there is peace of a kind in most of Afghanistan now.
However, the Taliban should be left in no doubt that, should they want our help, they will have to listen to the widespread concerns of people around the world, who are shocked and horrified at the brutal character of their medieval regime.
Mr President, I shall deal first of all with the debate on the situation in Guatemala.
The Commission is closely monitoring the situation there.
There are increasing concerns within the EU and the international community about the considerable deterioration in that country in the situation in key areas such as human rights protection, justice and good governance.
The Commission's main priorities for relations with Guatemala are to support the implementation of the 1996 peace accords, which should lead to better respect for human rights; to promote the modernisation of the state; and to bolster good governance.
The EU has been very supportive of the peace process in Guatemala, both politically and financially.
The cooperation programme with Guatemala is aimed at giving adequate support to the peace process.
The Commission has assisted civil society and state organisations, with the aim of contributing to the reconciliation process in the country.
At the same time the Commission is preparing a programme to improve the justice system.
Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding, signed jointly by the European Commission and the Guatemalan government on the 26 March 2001, confirms our commitment to the peace process, with EUR 93 million of additional funds for the period 2001 to 2006.
The Commission and Member States have also used the regular political dialogue with Guatemala to reiterate the importance of respecting human rights.
The most recent EU actions raising concern about Guatemala have been the Joint Declaration of San JosÃ© 17 meeting last March and the recent Declaration by the Swedish Presidency on the third anniversary of the assassination of Bishop Gerardi.
In this respect the Commission welcomes the recent sentence in the Bishop Gerardi murder trial as encouraging proof of the commitment of the Guatemalan judiciary to improving the human rights situation.
In addition, during a visit to Central America at the end of March 2001, my colleague, Commissioner Patten, called on President Portillo's government to take urgent action to avoid a negative spiral of events in Guatemala and reinvigorate the stalled implementation of the peace accords.
The Commission is also closely monitoring the situation in Chad, after the announcement by the National Independent Electoral Commission of the result of the presidential election of 20 May.
The calmness of the population on polling day and the high turnout demonstrated a civic commitment which should be praised.
According to international observers the voting procedures conformed to legal regulations, but there were organisational deficiencies.
A statement from the observation mission reported that opposition candidates listed certain instances of irregularities and fraud which they said had marred the vote.
On 12 June the Constitutional Council announced the official election result confirming that Idriss DÃ©by had won a second term in office with 63% of the votes.
The Council reportedly rejected the vote in some polling stations.
The situation is being closely monitored by the EU heads of mission on the ground.
In the spirit of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission will continue its ongoing political dialogue with Chad.
Chad has been engaged in a democratic process for the last ten years. This effort is leading to greater human and civil rights protection.
However, it is recognised that these rights and liberties are not sufficiently respected by all actors.
It will be essential to address these issues in order to ensure sustainable peace in the country.
The ninth EDF country support strategy, which is at the final preparation stage, contains an important programme of support for civil society, including human rights organisations.
The recent sentencing of the well-known human rights and pro-democracy campaigner, Professor Saad Ibrahim, and his colleagues has aroused widespread interest in the international community.
The case against Professor Ibrahim and his 28 co-accused at the Ibn Khaldun and HODA centres has been closely followed by the European Commission and Member States.
When they were initially held without charge last year, the EU made its concern clear at the highest levels, with respect not only to the imprisonment without charge, but also to the intensive and prejudicial press campaign against the accused.
When charges were eventually pressed against the accused, and when it was made clear that these included a charge of accepting foreign (that is, EU) funds without authorisation, the European Commission delegation in Cairo reminded the appropriate authorities that grants to civil society organisations were perfectly proper and covered by the EU-Egypt framework convention on financial and technical cooperation.
Support for civil society is also an integral component of the Barcelona Process and is an explicit objective of the Barcelona Agreement of 1995, to which Egypt is a signatory.
The charges also claimed the misuse of EU funds allocated to the Ibn Khaldun and HODA pro-democracy programmes.
The statement issued by the European Commission in Brussels on 13 December last made it clear that the projects concerned were subject to normal monitoring procedures, including an external mid-term audit.
In answer to Mr Purvis's question in particular, I should stress that in 1999 the Commission received satisfactory progress reports from both projects regarding a satisfactory and independent financial audit.
The Egyptian authorities have so far provided no evidence or information to support their charges related to the projects financed by the EU.
There have been EU observers present throughout the trial and the EU has always made clear its expectation that due legal process and justice would prevail.
It has scrupulously avoided any intervention that might prejudice that expectation.
However, the timing of the sentencing a month earlier than expected and without apparent regard for the defence case presented in the closing day of the trial, and the severity of the sentences - 7 years for Ibrahim and lesser but nonetheless heavy sentences for all the accused - were entirely unexpected and quite disturbing.
The sentencing gave rise to an oral statement by the Commission on 23 May and a Presidency declaration on 25 May expressing deep concern.
The EU used the opportunity to stress the importance it attaches to the development of civil society and reiterated that programmes to this end were an integral part of the EU's bilateral programming with Egypt.
The European Commission is continuing to monitor the case closely.
The court is obliged to give its reasons within one month of sentencing, and these will be read with interest.
There are also limited possibilities for an appeal.
The legal process is not finished, and it is to be hoped that the final outcome will reflect the best traditions of the Egyptian legal system.
The Egyptian authorities are well aware of international interest in the case and of the implications of a final conclusion that is perceived as being unjust.
Nawal el Saadawi, the well-known feminist writer, was charged with apostasy, but the Prosecutor-General threw out the charges on 23 May.
However, this does not appear to be an end to the matter, and charges may yet be pressed in another court.
The situation is being carefully monitored by the Commission.
The Ibrahim and Saadawi cases have both raised issues of real concern, although further legal steps and the possibility of a sensible outcome remain open.
The overall situation is complex and not entirely clear.
There are also some signs of optimism in some areas, for instance women's rights, elections controlled by the judiciary, social legislation and so on. There is an increasing section of Egyptian society which fully subscribes to the view that Egypt must adopt the highest standards and is working to that end.
In relation to Malaysia, the Commission has followed closely the events relating to the detention by the Malaysian police of ten pro-reform activists under the Internal Security Act just days ahead of the second anniversary, on 14 April, of the conviction of the former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
It strongly regrets that on 2 June the Minister for Home Affairs signed two-year detention orders for four of the ten opposition activists and that three of the other six ISA detainees remain in police custody.
The Commission is deeply concerned at these events, which it considers contrary to established democratic practice.
They reinforce concerns already expressed in the past regarding the general human rights situation in Malaysia.
In this respect, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Malaysian National Human Rights Commission has questioned the basis of the arrests and that government representatives have stated that the ISA needs to be abolished or at least radically revised.
It also welcomes the fact that the High Court of Malaya, in setting free two of the ISA detainees under writs of habeas corpus on 30 May, called on the Malaysian Parliament to review the ISA thoroughly.
The Commission is ready to support EU action to press the issue of the human rights situation in general, and of the ISA in particular, with the government of Malaysia on all appropriate occasions.
The Commission, like Parliament, is deeply disturbed by the ever-worsening humanitarian and political situation in Afghanistan.
On the humanitarian front, the Commission continues, together with other partners, to provide assistance to vulnerable groups and populations inside Afghanistan and to refugees in neighbouring countries.
This assistance is given throughout the country to areas of greatest need, where access and security permit.
This is in line with the EU common position on Afghanistan, which sets the objective of providing effective humanitarian aid on the basis of an impartial needs assessment.
Commission representatives regularly take part in field visits and assessment missions inside Afghanistan in order to see conditions at first hand and to ensure that aid can be directed towards the areas of greatest need.
On the political front, Commission representatives, acting as part of the EU troika, have sought to persuade the two factions in the current conflict to promote a peaceful solution.
The EU troika, consisting of its ambassadorial representatives based in Islamabad, recently visited Kandahar and Faizabad to explain the EU's common position on the Taleban side.
They noted a reluctance to consider new peace initiatives.
The EU, with other partners, is currently looking at how best to promote a process of engagement.
Two things are clear concerning the future of Afghanistan.
First, outside involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan can only prolong the fighting.
This applies to the support given to either side by third countries, which are pursuing their own agendas and their own national interests.
Secondly, a military solution to the Afghan imbroglio is not possible.
The history of the country shows clearly that no one faction can ever impose itself and its political and cultural philosophy on the whole country.
I might reinforce that, particularly in response to what Mr Dupuis said, by drawing attention to the fact that the Commission does not provide aid to factions.
It is delivered to vulnerable groups and populations according to need and where access and security conditions permit.
Given that the Taleban control 90% of the territory of Afghanistan, it is obvious that much of the EC's aid will be delivered in Taleban-controlled areas.
For these reasons the EU maintains an arms embargo covering the whole of Afghanistan and continues to call for a halt to third country interference.
The EU, at the same time, supports the peace efforts of the UN and stresses the need for a broad-based government in the country.
Finally, in answer to the contribution from Mrs Fraisse, fighting between the Taliban and the forces of the Northern Alliance has reintensified after the winter lull and the Taliban can be expected to try to expel the Northern Alliance forces from the approximately 10% of Afghan territory which they currently occupy, while Northern Alliance commander Massud and his allies try to spread the conflict to areas already under Taliban control.
In the meantime the effects of the worst drought to affect the country for 30 years continue to afflict Afghans in the south, central and western regions of the country in particular.
Large numbers of Afghans have been forced by fear of famine and the conflict to leave their homes and are now living in IDP camps inside Afghanistan or have crossed the borders into either Iran or Pakistan.
In 2000 or 2001, an additional 500 000 internally displaced persons or refugees fled the fighting or the drought and the country is heavily dependent on food aid, much of which is supplied by the United States.
Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Purvis if he is going to table a vote of no confidence in the Commission, given the false information and the deliberate lies Commissioner Byrne has just uttered before the Members of Parliament present here today.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Nepal
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0426/2001 by Olivier Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0428/2001 by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the aftermath of the massacre of the royal family in Nepal;
B5-0435/2001 by Reinhold Messner and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Nepal;
B5-0443/2001 by Luigi Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0460/2001 by Thomas Mann and Charles Tannock, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Nepal;
B5-0469/2001 by Jean-Claude Fruteau and Pedro SÃ¡nchez Aparicio, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Nepal.
Mr President, as far as Nepal is concerned, even though we are all aware that this is a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, I think that our main problem as the European Parliament is how to face the future.
I call on all honourable Members to support the amendment tabled by Mr Messner, which calls on our President to allow a delegation from Parliament to go to Nepal at the earliest opportunity.
I think that the role of this delegation is crucial.
The destabilising forces at work today in Nepal are very strong and I think we would be unwise to underestimate them.
The situation is extremely fragile and I am sure that a gesture, such as the presence of three Members of the European Parliament in Nepal, could have a positive influence on the development of the situation.
We are all aware of the pernicious role played by a major country which, under normal circumstances, would not border on Nepal but which, because of its policy of occupation in Tibet, is now practically a neighbour of Nepal. We are all aware of the logistical support that this country - the People' s Republic of China - is giving to the Maoist guerrilla movement, a guerrilla movement akin to the Shining Path in Peru.
I think that says it all.
Pressure urgently needs to be exerted on this country to put an end to the assistance given to this guerrilla movement, which is destabilising this wonderful little Himalayan country and risks plunging it into chaos.
Finally, it is crucial that we adopt a different policy towards this region.
I would like to add one last thing concerning the Commission. This Parliament has been calling for the opening of a full delegation in Nepal for years.
I think that the recent events there are, sadly, even further justification for the opening of such a delegation.
Mr President, following the tragedy in Nepal, which wiped out almost the entire royal family, this tiny kingdom in the Himalayas is now threatened with civil war.
We must also remember that it is hemmed in between Tibet, which now belongs to China, and India, with tensions threatening to come to a head between these two heavily populated countries.
The facts on today's Nepal.
Nepal is about the same size as Switzerland and Austria put together.
Twenty-two million people live there and, if you think that a large part of the country is highly mountainous, then these people do not have a great deal of space.
The flat land is overgrazed, the forests have all been cut down and ecological meltdown threatens.
There are hardly any schools, hardly any infrastructure and corruption is rife.
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and its only source of income is tourism.
Then there are the Maoist groups which oppose the royal family and have already seized control of part of the country, mainly in the west, and who are even more sceptical of the new king, the late king's brother, than they were of the old royal family.
What this country needs now is enlightenment.
These people also need our solidarity, they need hope and suggestions.
Tourism must not run dry, which is exactly what will happen if there is a civil war.
I think that Europe should play the role of peacemaker here, hence my proposal to send a small EU delegation to Nepal to take preventive action before it is too late.
We must bring our values of transparency, democratisation and hope to this country.
We must not abandon this country, which has so many friends in Europe.
Mr President, the death of the Nepalese royal family rocked the world.
We would like to tell the people of Nepal that they have our solidarity.
King Birendra, whom I met once as Vice-Chairman of the SAARC delegation, was very popular and very well liked.
His espousal of democracy, of a majority party system, gave a great deal of hope to this country, a country which - as Reinhold quite rightly says - is so bitterly poor economically but so rich culturally.
The tragedy in the royal palace in Kathmandu, in which King Birendra, his wife Aishwarya and other members of the family died, leaves a vacuum.
The curfew and the ban on meetings can only go some way towards calming the situation; there have already been quite a few violent attacks.
The first positive sign was when the new King Gyanendra said he would sign the old Nepal constitution, his brother's constitution, in order to continue the democratisation process begun by the family.
Setting up a committee of inquiry was also important as a first step towards winning trust in the face of huge reservations on the part of the people about the new ruler.
The committee is chaired by the head of the supreme court, which is neutral enough, but the committee will only win credibility if members of both the government and the opposition sit on it together, of course, with international observers.
So if a delegation is to take part, it must be the SAARC delegation of the European Parliament.
The Maoist underground rebels have tried to grab this opportunity to destabilise the country still further.
The government and the opposition must finally realise that they have to meet each other half way and reach some sort of consensus.
They must remove the conditions in which terrorism and subversion thrive and that requires a common approach, not personal ups and downs.
The PPE-DE Group calls on the king and the politicians responsible to do everything in their power to relieve the people of their anxiety and concerns and the EU, Commissioner, must send out a suitable signal.
I again call on the European Commission to open an office in Kathmandu, where the SAARC secretariat-general has its headquarters, which we can use as a base from which to implement the excellent cooperation agreement between the European Union and Nepal.
This agreement is an excellent basis, as acknowledged by the European Parliament several years ago.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my solidarity with the pain of the Nepalese people, who are currently experiencing one of the most difficult moments in their history.
As Vice-Chairman of the South Asia delegation, I had the opportunity to meet King Birendra, a man of stature who was able to shake up his country' s secular political traditions by establishing a constitutional monarchy.
A veritable force for stability, he represented the hope that the Nepalese people would emerge from absolute poverty and that the rule of law and democracy would become established for the long term.
The tragic death of the person whom the people of Nepal regarded as the symbol of the nation' s unity and the force binding it together is the source of numerous concerns and raises countless questions.
Indeed, behind the drama a political process has been brutally called into question.
A link of confidence between the political class and its people has been broken.
It is a significant change in the balance of power in a region where instability reigns.
The European Union attaches great importance to respect for human rights and to democratic principles.
We must therefore roundly condemn the repression and arrests which followed the death of the king.
Nor can we remain silent over the distressing problem of the refugee camps in Bhutan, to which I am particularly sensitive, having visited them last year as a member of the delegation, and hope that the positive actions which were embarked upon to solve this problem are pursued with the same vigour.
Lastly, I too would like to appeal to the Commission for a full delegation to be established in Kathmandu, in order to try to help these traumatised people to heal their wounds.
The Commission is dismayed by the dramatic events that are shaking Nepal.
It understands the state of shock of the Nepalese people at the deaths of a beloved monarch, symbol of unity and continuity, and of many members of the royal family.
As of today the situation remains volatile.
It is still too early to assess the impact of the palace killings on the stability of the country and to predict whether events will take a disastrous turn or endanger democracy.
This development took place against an already turbulent situation in Nepal in recent months, as a consequence of political paralysis and the constant threat from the Maoist insurgents.
The European messages of condolence therefore particularly emphasise the need to preserve democracy - a democracy that has been a remarkable achievement of the Kingdom of Nepal and of the late King Birendra.
The Commission will monitor future developments with the utmost attention to make sure that all parties act in respect for democratic principles and human rights, in conformity with the basic provisions of Article 1 of the EC-Nepal Cooperation Agreement.
In this context the Commission deplores the arrest of three Nepalese editors of the Kantipur newspaper.
As you know, the Commission has consistently supported Nepal in its quest for social and economic development.
The EC has granted EUR 160 million in cooperation assistance since 1977, and the current rate is around EUR 50 million a year.
Our commitment stands firm.
We are also ready to bring to our cooperation a new dimension, taking into specific account aspects of governance.
However, in the present circumstances we believe it is necessary for the dust to settle before proceeding with any further concrete action.
In answer to the issue raised by a number of you whether the Commission will set up a delegation in Kathmandu, I am happy to tell you that there is in preparation a Commission communication on the external service, which will cover the situation of new delegations and which will deal with this particular issue.
It should be published before the summer break.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in Angola
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0432/2001 by Nelly Maes and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Angola;
B5-0444/2001 by Joaquim Miranda and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Angola;
B5-0445/2001 by JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Angola - civil society building peace;
B5-0453/2001 by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Angola;
B5-0461/2001 by Carlos Coelho and Arlindo Cunha, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Angola;
B5-0470/2001 by MÃ¡rio Soares and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Angola.
Mr President, this is the umpteenth time we have discussed Angola.
The war has been going on for twenty-five years; and again we are about to vote on a resolution.
Surely we must ask ourselves the question whether sufficient efforts are being made for peace.
I welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency has applied itself to this question and provided a declaration.
I wonder, however, whether the two sides - and I mean both the government of Mr dos Santos and UNITA - are not actually doing their level best to prolong the war.
This is a war that is fed by a stream of smuggled diamonds and oil: sufficient to buy vast quantities of arms and hold the civilian population hostage.
I consider this war to be making a mockery of our civilisation.
I should therefore also like to ask that the recommendations again recorded in this resolution, be followed up both by the Commission and by the Council, so that it can be monitored whether the will for peace is really increasing.
Of course we welcome the fact that statements have recently been made both by President dos Santos and by the leadership of UNITA expressing the intention to start a dialogue.
However, we see that the civilian population is being harassed time and time again.
There are the kidnappings by a new movement, again calling itself a rebel movement.
There are the new minefields.
There are the attacks on towns and the constant attacks on the civilian population; and those who live in those parts know that meanwhile in the bars on the borders the soldiers are trading with each other.
What cynicism!
Mr President, the complex situation occurring in Angola deserves constant, careful attention, and therefore I believe the inclusion of the matter yet again on this Parliament' s agenda is justified, since the search for peace and the encouragement of all those who effectively seek it must be a central objective of our institution.
Because of the consistency required of it, however, this House cannot wipe out its earlier resolutions or the more or less recent positions of the other Community institutions and international bodies, especially the Council, which has particular competences in this matter.
Just as it cannot or must not ignore or paper over important events that have happened recently which mark the way the situation in the country is evolving and clarify, if that were necessary, the real intentions of certain forces acting in the territory, especially UNITA under Jonas Savimbi.
Having said that, I must also emphasise right now that I regard it as positive that the proposed resolution on a compromise, as it has been presented to us, has essentially put an end to the attempts to cloud the real situation in Angola and whitewash UNITA that underlay the initial proposal by the UEN...
It is, however, equally true that even after the positive changes that have been added to this compromise at our suggestion, particularly the statement of agreement with the position adopted by the Swedish Presidency on behalf of the Union, it still suffers from unacceptable positionings and serious gaps.
This is the case with the obvious attempt to place the responsibilities of the legitimate government of Angola and those of UNITA on the same level, in clear contradiction to successive United Nations resolutions, which are symptomatically and for this very reason forgotten.
The same happens with the unacceptable omission of the recent condemnable attack by UNITA in Cachito, which resulted in the death of a great many defenceless, innocent people and the dreadful kidnapping of dozens of children and young people.
For that very reason I believe it to be very important and timely for the Commission to reaffirm the positions that it and the Council have adopted on behalf of the European Union.
Indeed, as I understand it, nothing can justify the fact that the above-mentioned positions and omissions can remain in a resolution by this Parliament, and they are in fact the essential reason why we have not subscribed to the compromise.
Furthermore, we are amazed at the blatant gulf between what was approved and reiterated recently by the Council and what is now proposed, even more so when some of the principal supporters of the current compromise originate from the same political force that shapes a government which so recently defined and adopted the position taken up by the Council.
That is also why we tabled some draft amendments with the aim of enabling this Parliament to realign itself with the positions of the Council and the international community and to ensure a line of continuity and consistency with what we have always approved here.
Our final vote will of course depend on the direction this vote takes.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard the discourse of war, the discourse that has led to war, the discourse that has led to the continued failure of international mediation.
That was not our intention.
Our intention is to contribute to peace, because at last consistent signs are coming from Angola that some lasting change may happen in that country.
That is the major piece of news of the last few months.
Amid the news of the terrible ongoing war, it is these signs of peace that are strongly emerging from the civil society of Angola and which make our vote today so urgent.
It is these signs that we are turning to, to point them out, embrace them and encourage them.
We do not want just to cry over more deaths or lament further destruction.
We want to welcome those people who, with courage, generosity and independence, coming from the churches and the many sections of Angolan society, are carving out a new path that can lead to national reconciliation and lasting peace.
Let us listen to the Angolans.
They know more and better than we do.
The AMC, the broad movement of citizens, a civic platform recently launched in Luanda, speaks to us of inclusive national reconciliation.
Inclusive in the sense of not excluding anyone, because it is the poisonous spirit of exclusion that spreads war, misery and ruin throughout Angola.
Inclusive because the spirit of including everybody is a precondition for reconciliation, and because without true reconciliation to restore confidence there will be no peace.
The Angolans want peace.
Let us listen to the Angolans, let us trust that internal mediation and the energy of the civil movements can succeed where international mediation has failed.
Let us follow the voice of the Angolans, good people, not just those of the AMC but those of so many movements that fervently hope for peace: the Inter-Church Committee for Peace in Angola, the Angolan Reflection for Peace Group, the 'Peace and Development' Women, who today are holding an international conference in Luanda, the Martin Luther King Association, the Justice, Peace and Democracy movements, the Village of Peace, the Messengers of Peace, the Mosaic, and still more, like the Forum on the multiple consequences of war a few months ago, from which there sprang an appeal for an immediate cease-fire.
These are the voices we must listen to.
We must recognise their features, learn their names, publicise their faces, shake their hands.
Because the tragic recent history of Angola teaches us one thing: we must only trust those who talk of peace without arms in their hands, with gestures and instruments of peace.
We have to stop this monopoly of the bipolarisation of war.
I therefore ask you to join in an invitation that I have already asked the President to make so that we here can listen to the vision of Angola and the future of peace that people aspire to, people like Dom Zacarias Kamuenho, Vieira Lopes, Rafael Marques, Justino Pinto de Andrade, William Tonnet, Chivukuvuku, Marcolino Moco, Cesinanda Xavier, and others, who have joined this civil movement for peace.
These are the ones who can teach us a lot.
Angola is still suffering, but it does not have to be like that.
This Angola of peace hopes that we will be able to send out new, different signs to the new signs with which it is challenging us.
Mr President, everyone - in Finland at least - has probably played a game called Star of Africa.
Each time we discuss Sierra Leone or Angola, I think with dismay of this game that was, indeed, regarded as just a game but which, at the same time, showed in a bloody way - one moment in Angola, the next in Sierra Leone - that what could actually be a country' s blessing can also be a curse upon it.
My friends, I truly believe that we are beginning to see signs of a more intelligent policy in respect of the monitoring of resources.
We have seen many proposals for peace - the Lusaka Protocol, peace proposals in Sierra Leone and such like - but so long as war pays better than peace we will not get especially far.
I therefore strongly support what Mrs Maes has stated, namely that it is this way we must choose in order to move forward.
I also think that Canada, which has started work on sanctions, deserves our support and forms a reference point for our activities in respect of sanctions and our work in opposition to landmines and child soldiers.
We need to introduce similar work that is just as ambitious.
It is interesting to note that many who speak Angola' s language are speaking today.
I also believe that there are many amongst us who have a bad conscience concerning what we said about Angola in the past.
We have all in our own way contributed to the tragedy.
Now it is a matter of putting a stop to this, of looking at what is singled out in the UN' s reports - including the reports requested by the parliaments of the Member States - and also of pointing the finger at the presidents: those holding power in Togo or Burkina Faso who have, in their own way, contributed to the buying of diamonds or oil.
When it comes to the World Bank, which was mentioned in the debate, I actually believe it can be a very positive player in Africa, for example by monitoring, as it does at present, the income that the Angolan government acquires through the oil trade.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Angola is still suffering from war, destruction and the senseless, shocking loss of human lives.
Angola has everything it takes to be a great, rich, developed country and a factor for stability and progress in south-western Africa, but it has been squandering its resources and energies in a conflict which seems to go on forever.
We condemn the use of war, and we condemn most especially inhuman attacks on defenceless civilians, women and children, attacks that nothing can justify.
Several times over the years this Parliament has pronounced on Angola and has criticised attitudes and behaviour.
We recall these deliberations, which we uphold and support and which the compromise resolution upholds, recalls and supports.
Just as we remember the United Nations deliberations on the conflict and we do not deny that the various sides have different responsibilities.
In our view, however, at this precise moment when a little window of hope is opened with declarations from the main players responsible and initiatives in civil society for peace, our role is to encourage this movement.
We must tell the people of Angola and the political leaders that the international community is willing to collaborate in the search for peace.
There is no military solution to this conflict.
The General Affairs Council said so at its meeting on 11 June in Luxembourg.
Today it is the European Parliament' s turn to affirm it on behalf of the peoples of Europe.
We are pleased with the compromise text that it has been possible to draw up and we shall vote against the proposals that may disfigure it, not because we disagree with the content of several of them, but because what is expected of us today are words of encouragement and not of recrimination.
Mr President, my fellow Members of Parliament, representatives of the Commission, I too approve of the draft resolution on Angola, which has resulted from a compromise and in my view is a moderate and well balanced draft.
Basically it is an appeal for peace, which at this time, as has been stressed by JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro and just now by Carlos Coelho, needs to be supported by the international community and especially our Parliament.
The situation of Angola is a tragic situation.
Angola is a devastated country, which has experienced twenty-six long years of civil war without a break.
That is, since independence on 11 November 1975 there has been a civil war in Angola, and it is still going on.
As has just been pointed out, this civil war does not have a military solution; and the theory that it is possible to reach a solution by crushing the enemy, even if the assassination or death of Savimbi were to occur, would not be a solution because the war would carry on.
The war can only end through negotiation among those that wage it and through pressure from Angolan civil society, which is at last emerging.
There are independent voices of civil society that are appealing for peace, especially those supported by the Angolan Catholic Church, which has played an extremely important role in this, and by all the other churches, which are exerting great pressure for peace, that is, for negotiations for peace.
This is the pressure that we must support, both the European Union as a whole and this part of it which is the European Parliament.
Mention has been made of a proposal by some of our left-wing friends - the Greens and the Communist Party - who would like us to make a special condemnation of the Cachito massacre.
We do not agree and we have proposed an oral amendment which might be a compromise.
This oral amendment would condemn all massacres from whatever source, because there is not just the Cachito massacre but also the massacres that have happened recently, for example, in Cabinda.
Therefore if we only mention one kind of massacre we shall be turning a blind eye to a reality which, as has been said, is a complex reality, and therefore what is an apparently humanitarian act is essentially a political act with which we cannot agree.
For that reason we are going to vote on this proposal for a resolution as it has been drawn up and not with the amendments that have been suggested.
By doing this we think we can contribute to peace in Angola, and I should like to second JosÃ© Ribeiro e Castro' s proposal for Parliament to listen to independent voices from Angola who are today courageously fighting for peace, such as the journalist Rafael Marques, such as Archbishop Zacarias Kamuenho, such as the former Prime Minister of Angola Marcolino Moco, and many other Angolans who are able and have the courage to come to this Parliament and say truthfully that it is necessary to get rid of the warlords.
Because while it is true that there are warlords on both sides and that both should be condemned, whether on the side of the MPLA or on the side of UNITA (and we must condemn them both), the truth is that there are interested parties that gain with the war, and those that gain with the war are the oil and diamond interests. What we need to do is help civil society and the churches to emerge so that this ravaged people may finally achieve peace.
Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is very concerned at the continuation of war in Angola, especially given the recent upsurge in attacks on civilians as well as the continued suffering of the 3-4 million citizens affected by the renewed war since 1998.
As established in the common position adopted on 11-12 June 2001 by the European Union, the Commission remains committed to supporting initiatives contributing to a political solution to the Angolan conflict.
It seeks to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and the improvement of human rights, the rule of law and justice, and a more transparent management of public finances.
The Commission encourages political dialogue within the terms of the Lusaka accords to overcome the conflict and expresses the hope that the recent declarations by President Dos Santos, inviting Mr Savimbi to set a date for his movement to end the war, will result in a dialogue for peace and national reconciliation.
The Commission expresses its grave concern at the lack of safe access for relief agencies to people in need.
The Commission's strategy of assistance is delivery of a flexible package of emergency and rehabilitation assistance according to the changing requirements, as well as the creation of conditions which enable structural development actions to be undertaken.
I should inform Parliament that the level of eco-interventions in 2001 is expected to rise to a similar level as in the year 2000, which is in fact EUR 52 million.
The joint debate is closed and that concludes the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Civil emergency protection
The next item is the report (A5-0180/2001) by Laura GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community mechanism for the coordination of civil protection intervention in the event of emergencies (COM(2000) 593 - C5-0543/2000 - 2000/0248(CNS)).
Mr President, Community cooperation in the field of civil protection began in 1985 and included two programmes, one which lasted two years - 1998-1999 - and another which will be in force until 2004.
In recent years, disasters that have often been wrongly termed 'natural' have had serious consequences for people, for the environment, and for both natural and cultural heritage.
Supporting the Member States in risk prevention, improving the training of those who intervene in the event of disasters, contributing to educating citizens about self protection and raising their awareness of the issue: these are some of the objectives of these programmes. Today, however, we are debating the Council proposal for the setting up of a mechanism for the coordination of civil protection intervention in emergency situations.
I think it is worth remembering that, according to the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change, there is already evidence that if the current trends of increasing greenhouse gas emissions are not corrected, such disasters - floods, droughts, storms and so on - will become ever more normal.
This mechanism therefore has to be very welcome.
Determining the resources available for intervention, the training of assessment and coordination teams to intervene in emergencies, and a common rapid communication system are aspects on which this proposal is based in order to meet the objectives of protecting citizens, the environment and natural and cultural resources.
The four priority types of action under this mechanism are: prevention of accidents, rapid reaction capability, response in emergency situations, and recovery measures in the event of a disaster.
The most important factors for achieving these objectives are: creating a management, coordination and information operations centre; identifying available resources in the Member States; training programmes for intervention teams and for experts in the assessment of needs and the coordination of transport, resources and teams and establishing a joint emergency communications system linking all available civil protection teams.
It is obvious that the current situation differs in each of the Member States: in Germany and Spain there is a clear delimitation of Autonomous Communities - regions - which have their own civil protection mechanisms, and also in the towns and municipalities.
In the other countries the civil protection service is more centralised.

In any case, I think it is obvious that this mechanism will prove very useful in that it can effectively coordinate and mobilise all the resources we have available in Europe for clear emergencies, as have occurred in recent years. I remember very well what happened in the DoÃ±ana National Park, when a pond of toxic waste burst its banks, flooded a river and a vast area of water meadows and destroyed the livelihoods of 5000 farmers.
Therefore it is vital that there should be a rapid, effective mechanism of this kind.
What perhaps is just as vital as this need for rapid communication and coordination is for citizens to be trained and educated to protect themselves.
In Europe there are about five million volunteers - I was surprised at the number - who for no payment provide their services at any given moment when there is a disaster.
Giving these people the slightest amount of training would be of great help in tackling these disasters.
We just have to remember what happened with the Erika on the French coast and other disasters of this kind.
I think the proposals put forward by Parliament are acceptable and improve this mechanism, and in future it will be very important that there should be a clear, practical mechanism, with a centre for the coordination of communications and resources for civil protection.
Mr President, honourable Members, allow me to start by thanking Parliament and, more particularly, you Madam rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Budgets for your excellent and constructive work on this proposal.
There is no need, I think, to enumerate yet again the numerous natural, technological and environmental disasters which have occurred over recent years.
The honourable Member has just mentioned one which caused very serious damage in several Member States and neighbouring countries.
The citizens of Europe have expressed their concern and made clear that they expect the Community to take specific action to guarantee efficient civil protection in an emergency.
Parliament too has called on the Commission to take initiatives in this area in a series of resolutions.
The Commission proposal of 27 September last year makes provision for a Community procedure for civil protection intervention in the event of natural, technological or environmental disaster inside or outside the European Union.
The aim is to improve and coordinate action taken by Member States in the event both of this sort of serious disaster and in the event of nuclear or ecological disaster and to create the facility for immediate aid if a country does not have the necessary capacity.
May I say, as regards the results of Parliament's work, that the Commission agrees wholeheartedly with many of the proposed amendments because they improve the Commission's proposal considerably.
The most important improvements are: the creation of a monitoring and information centre as an operational tool for implementing the decision to set up a database on the Member States' production and storage capacities for serum and vaccines and other emergency medical resources, the importance attached to aid for isolated and outermost regions of the Union, the use of new technologies, including in notification systems, warning systems and systems for exchanging information and the use of satellite technologies for the purpose of the procedure and the references to the cultural heritage.
We are therefore able to accept 35 of the 46 proposed amendments in full, in principle or in part.
As far as the remaining proposed amendments are concerned, we still have a number of queries, mainly on the following aspects: first, the reference to the humanitarian aid component contained in Amendment No 12.
This proposed amendment could give rise to a certain amount of confusion and the risk of duplicating the ECHO programme.
The Commission would like to avoid this and has therefore rejected this amendment.
Then there is the need for immediate action at Community level in the event of deliberate marine pollution. I refer here to Amendments Nos 1 and 13.
The concept of 'deliberate marine pollution' is not, I think, the correct or a suitable concept here, because deliberate marine pollution does not trigger fast action and whether or not fast action is needed depends on the type of pollution or the type of disaster.
Then there is the question of the exact definition of the role and remit of the operational monitoring and information centre. I refer here to parts of Amendments Nos 5, 14 and 16.
The Commission rejects Amendment No 17.
The references to the monitoring and information centre are a constructive contribution.
However, some of the wording is misleading and therefore needs to be revised or deleted.
The centre should be a tool for the Commission and the Member States, not an operator.
So, to summarise, the Commission supports Amendments Nos 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 18, 23, 25, 27, 31, 35, 36 and 38 to 41.
It supports eleven proposed amendments in principle, which are Amendments Nos 4, 7, 19, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32 to 34 and 37, but which need editing.
The Commission supports Amendments Nos 5, 8, 13, 14, 16, 21 and 45 in part and rejects Amendments Nos 1, 2, 12, 17, 20, 28, 29, 42 to 44 and 46.
Finally, I must emphasise that our proposal is much improved thanks to Parliament's contribution and support.
I am sure that these improvements will help to save more human lives in future and to reduce the damage caused by natural and technological disasters or by nuclear and ecological disasters.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Classical swine fever
The next item is the report (A5-0143/2001) by EncarnaciÃ³n Redondo JimÃ©nez, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever (COM(2000) 462 - C5-0493/2000 - 2000/0214(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 25 April on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever proposes an early diagnosis system and maintenance of the Community method for controlling the disease and slaughter, since not enough progress has yet been made on marker vaccines.
The reason for applying a policy of non-vaccination is based on the fact that in the event of infection vaccinated pigs may become carriers of the virus, especially pregnant sows, which may not show signs of the disease but may transmit it horizontally to the other pigs on the farm and vertically to their progeny, which may include persistently infected piglets.
In addition, as regards the differentiation of animals that have been vaccinated or have had the disease and generated antibodies, this differentiation between vaccinated and infected animals is not yet reliable.
Research will have to continue into this until these marker vaccines are effectively reliable and we are able to use differential methods that indicate whether the animals have been vaccinated or have had the disease.
This legislation improves certain prophylactic rules, clarifies definitions and proposes the inclusion of the 'Diagnostic Manual' as an annex to the Directive.
In addition, the amendments introduced refer to animal welfare standards on the farm and during transport, and emergency solutions are proposed for cases of serious health crises which prevent animal movements for long periods, such as buying-in schemes, which the Commission has certainly never done before.
It is also proposed that this health legislation should extend to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and that they should be included in the plans to control classical swine fever.
Several amendments to this document have been tabled which your rapporteur feels deserve some comment.
There is one amendment, No 34, tabled by Mr Mulder on behalf of the ELDR Group, which seems logical, but given that the health control authorities are national, trying to divide up the European Union into regions that belong to different countries and do not coincide with national borders seems unfeasible.
I would ask Mr Mulder, who is present, whether the Dutch will be able to control German farms or whether the Germans will control Dutch farms.
I do not think either side will agree to this.
Amendment No 35, tabled by Mr Mulder, goes against both my feelings and the spirit of the report.
If the animal is not eliminated, vaccination will not eliminate the virus and the marketing of meat from vaccinated animals in the European Union would mean less safety for our consumers than for those of third countries.
We would in principle be unable to export, and anyway this news in the press would ruin the industry.
Fresh meat from vaccinated animals carries the virus and may infect healthy animals that feed on swill containing it.
I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 35.
As for Amendment No 36, also tabled by Mr Mulder, we again come up against the subject of co-financing, and I am also against it.
There are two other amendments: Nos 33, tabled by Mr BÃ¶ge on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and 37, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
These two amendments go a little beyond what I could have imagined, since in my country the use of swill has been banned for more than twenty years.
Nevertheless, in this very House, Amendment No 102 in the Paulsen report, reviewed in this very part-session, was approved and I do not want to go against the feelings of this House.
I therefore understand that both Amendment No 33 and Amendment No 37 are acceptable because they may lead us to a more realistic solution to the animal feed control problem.
Mr President, this is a comprehensive report and I congratulate Mrs Redondo for the great deal of work that she has put into it.
The House might be interested to know that Mrs Redondo very kindly accepted my invitation to come to London during the formulation of this report to take evidence from representatives of the UK pig industry and senior officials from the National Farmers Union and the Ministry of Agriculture.
We happened to be in one of those meetings on Tuesday 20 February this year, the very day the first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK was reported.
As you can well imagine, this brought our meeting to an abrupt halt.
Indeed, it is partly because of foot-and-mouth disease that I wish to direct my remarks to the question of feeding catering waste or pigswill to pigs.
I know that my colleagues from Germany and Austria have serious reservations about the proposal to ban such material from being fed to pigs throughout the EU.
As Mrs Redondo has just said, Amendment No 33 seeks to permit controlled swill feeding, subject to stringent exceptional arrangements, if it can be guaranteed that the pathogens which cause epizootic diseases have been destroyed by treatment.
Amendment No 37 seeks to achieve a similar objective.
I would ask the House to reject both these amendments this evening.
In the UK we had stringent controls of swill feeding in place.
We ensured that pig farmers only used the most appropriate and up-to-date equipment for boiling catering waste to the correct temperature to destroy all pathogens and we ensured that regular inspections of the farms using such equipment were carried out.
Of course you cannot legislate for human behaviour, however.
It now seems almost certain that infected catering waste was delivered to a farm in the north-east of England, which for whatever reason, was not properly treated, or perhaps was not treated at all.
This simple error, whether deliberate or just a mistake, has led to the destruction of over six million animals in the United Kingdom and tens of thousands of animals in Ireland, the Netherlands and France.
We have now banned swill in the UK entirely.
I urge the House to do the same across the whole of the EU.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo, for her work, which is unexpectedly topical following the most recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth.
The parallels between swine fever and foot-and-mouth are obvious; in the case both of foot-and-mouth and swine fever, the Community decided in the past to pursue a policy of non-vaccination.
However, the scale of the foot-and-mouth crisis has demonstrated that an unreserved policy of non-vaccination belongs on the test bench.
I do not mean that we should resort to blanket vaccination in future.
Killing infected stock, stamping out, must continue to be the mainstay of the strategy to combat these diseases.
However, greater importance should be attached to vaccination.
We should not, in my view, stand still on the question of vaccination; instead we should develop a strategy of comprehensive zoonosis prevention mainly for use during disease-free periods.
This could include stricter controls on third country imports, controls at airports and quarantining new additions to livestock.
Another important point is the principle of regionalisation.
The Commission must act very quickly here and negotiate with EU trading partners in order to implement this principle.
We cannot expect all the Member States of the EU to put up with import restrictions in third countries every time a disease breaks out in one or a few Member States.
The European Union already applies this principle to third country imports.
Now third countries must return the favour.
Marker vaccines are very important here, as the rapporteur has clearly highlighted.
More must be invested in these vaccines and in developing discriminatory diagnostic techniques, so that it will soon be possible to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals and then make economic use of vaccinated animals.
I should also like to comment on one more very specific issue, namely swill feeding, that is, using leftovers from canteens etc. These leftovers have been used as animal fodder for years and we must still be able to use them in future.
As with meat and bonemeal, I support a conditional ban here, as formulated in Amendment No 37 by the Group of the Greens, that is, it should only be possible to use leftovers if a suitable sterilisation process is used.
I think that if proper controls are carried out then, as we have seen in the past in numerous Member States, we will still be able to use this valuable source of protein.
We should support the proposed amendment by the Greens which still allows leftovers to be used but subject to stricter conditions.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, because I learned something from her report, which is always very pleasant.
In addition the report points out the necessary modification of the guidelines.
Of course we must bring swine fever under control, but extermination methods that require mass slaughter are no longer really accepted by public opinion.
That is a problem.
I myself come from Flanders.
It is a densely populated region and there are even more pigs than people.
That means that we ourselves are dramatically confronted with that problem.
Therefore I agree that the combating of swine fever is important but should like at the same time to point out that this animal disease, unlike others, presents no danger to human beings.
I would say that culling because of the disease is one thing, but it is difficult to distinguish from culling for economic reasons, for example because sties become overfull or because animals become too heavy for sale.
That is why it is always rather hypocritical when mass slaughter is being considered, since it is not very clear whether the culling is taking place to prevent disease or for economic reasons.
I must honestly admit that in that respect I do not trust the industry.
The report has nevertheless convinced me that there has been a remarkable development in marker vaccine.
Therefore in my view it can easily be declared ready for use so that it could be used on a much wider scale than solely in emergencies.
If it is not reliable, for example because the disease can still be transmitted via the placenta, then it would seem sensible to me that it cannot be used with sows but that it can still be of use in other cases.
If it transpires, as is argued in the report, that the diagnostic method is still not reliable, then I believe that we must do our utmost to develop good diagnostic methods, so that a distinction can be made between vaccinated animals on the one hand and animals that have developed antibodies because they have had the disease or have had contact with the disease in some other way.
This is why I believe that culling must be rejected as a method of combating this animal disease and that we must concentrate our attention on the development not only of marker vaccine, since that already exists - but of good diagnostic methods and the refinement of the vaccine so that it can also be used for sows.
In any case the guidelines should provide regulation that makes mass culls unnecessary.
I agree with the conclusions of the Commission, namely that mass culls cast a slur on the agricultural policy and the health policy that we wish to pursue as a European Community.
Mr President, Commissioner, a lot of attention is being paid to pigs this week.
Unfortunately the discussion of the Redondo JimÃ©nez report is ending in an anticlimax.
On Monday the Swedish Minister spoke on animal welfare, including tightening welfare regulations for animal transport.
This morning we voted on the Busk report, in which we are trying to improve the living conditions of pigs in great detail.
We now have a report before us in which we are supposed to simply agree to the destruction of thousands of healthy pigs if there is an outbreak of swine fever.
This Parliament speaks with two voices!
One for the consumer and his feeling for animal welfare and one for the economy and trade, which must not be allowed to suffer from the outbreak of a disease.
I have requested a roll-call vote on this report and on Mr Mulder' s amendment, so that the public can see from Members' voting behaviour the double tongue of this Parliament on animal welfare.
It is astonishing that Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez has learned nothing from the combating of foot-and-mouth disease as it has developed in recent months, particularly in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
As part of the preparation of this report I should have like to see Mrs Redondo driving around the Oene region, the foot-and-mouth triangle in the Netherlands.
It would have struck her that almost every field carries a poster reading: 'EU, vaccinate now!'
I have argued more than once in this Parliament that animals are more than production units.
They are creatures made by God, for whom we have responsibility.
Norms and values apply not only in church but in the sty too.
Until 1980, vaccination was commonplace in the European Union.
In order to meet the trade, the non-vaccination policy was implemented.
In the 1997 outbreak of swine fever in the Netherlands, thousands of healthy pigs had to be destroyed and then too there was a call for vaccination.
When will this Parliament start listening to its citizens?
There is a vaccine available that makes it possible to distinguish vaccination from infection.
There are still some drawbacks associated with those vaccines, but are there none associated with the mass destruction of animals?
No one less than the International Bureau for Infectious Livestock Diseases (Office international des Ã©pizooties) recommends that in serious outbreaks of swine fever, countries that previously did not vaccinate should consider emergency use of a marker vaccine.
Infectious animal diseases, like swine fever, show the weaknesses of current agricultural policy.
It is wrong that organic farming and extensive animal husbandry should be proposed as the solution.
These forms of agriculture are not less susceptible to livestock disease, on the contrary.
Because of the high level of enclosure in intensive livestock farming, these businesses are precisely less susceptible to infection.
That is not to say that organic farming does not have desirable aspects - its small-scale nature has many advantages.
A combination of the small-scale structure of organic farming and the enclosure of intensive livestock keeping is a key for the future.
For production we must abandon large-scale mobility and switch to more enclosed operations, no longer with international, but with regional circuits.
Mr President, may I add my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very welcome report.
Swine fever, like foot-and-mouth, does re-emerge from time to time in different Member States throughout the European Union.
Unfortunately, the only way of controlling it, at the moment, is by large-scale slaughter of animals, many of which are free from disease.
To date, we have not been able, as has already been said, to develop a marker vaccine capable of controlling the disease.
I find it very hard in this modern day and age to understand why we have not made greater progress.
You need only look at everything we have at our disposal, and at the costs incurred in this senseless slaughter of thousands of innocent animals.
We heard this week that in the United Kingdom for every one proven case of foot-and-mouth, animals have been slaughtered on five or six farms around that case.
The cost, not only to the Exchequer and to the European Union, but the real cost of the loss of these animals, is enormous.
The agriculture industry certainly does not need anymore bad publicity and I support Mr Stevenson's position on the amendments put forward by Mr Mulder.
It is all very well to speak of stringent controls, but you cannot guard against human failure.
You cannot prevent a failure by a single individual and it only takes one person not to follow those controls and the feeding of swill creates a real problem as seems to have been the case in the United Kingdom with foot-and-mouth.
I understand that it will be very difficult and take time to secure agreement between all the parties involved - our trade partners and everyone else.
But we must begin and we must put down a marker now.
We must never again go through what we have just witnessed, be it with swine fever or with foot-and-mouth.
There has to be a better way.
The people of the European Union are demanding this.
Many farmers demand that there has to be a better method of control.
It is incumbent upon us to find a better way rather than witness the senseless slaughter we have recently seen.
No one can convince me that we have got it right at present.
I do not believe we have.
We have made mistakes and we should recognise those mistakes and put those mistakes right sooner, rather than later.
Thank you, honourable Members.
I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez and the Agriculture Committee for the report on the proposal for a Council directive on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever.
The main purpose of the Commission proposal is to update the existing control provisions on swine fever, so as to take into account the most recent knowledge and experience acquired in controlling its agent.
The proposal also takes account of the development of new diagnostic tools and vaccines, and of the opinions given by the Scientific Committee on these issues.
This House is well aware that in 1997/1998, a major outbreak of classical swine fever occurred in several Member States.
This crisis led the Commission to review Community legislation on this issue and to look at the possibility of introducing provisions on the use of the so-called marker vaccines as an additional tool against the disease in case of emergency.
The urgency for this review has been added to by the worrying outbreak in the United Kingdom last year, and today there is confirmation of an outbreak in the region of LÃ©rida in Catalonia, Spain.
The Commission has immediately taken a decision, in full consultation with the Spanish authorities, to impose restrictions on exports from this region.
This decision will be reviewed at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee, scheduled for this week.
The decision taken today has immediate effect until 30 June and will be reviewed in the meantime.
Before standing up in this debate, I had a brief telephone conversation on this matter with the Spanish Minister for Agriculture.
A single farm is concerned, and I am happy to say that he informed me that all of the animals moved from that farm before confirmation had been slaughtered.
However, we must remain particularly vigilant in relation to this issue.
The situation will need to be followed up very closely, and I will be happy to keep Parliament informed of developments.
Returning to the current proposal, and marker vaccination in particular, the Commission financed specific trials and research projects.
By means of this research very valuable information was obtained.
It has been essential for the Commission in drawing up its proposal and cautiously paving the way for the potential use of these vaccines.
Clearly, their use can only be envisaged in an emergency situation and once laboratory tests are available to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals.
Here I must emphasise the importance of the efficacy of the tests, as distinct from the marker vaccinations themselves.
Encouragingly, Parliament's Agriculture Committee, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Member States, largely support the Commission's approach to this sensitive issue.
This contrasts with the situation a few years ago, when quite different opinions were expressed by the experts themselves.
This reminds us of the importance of scientific investigation, so that informed answers can be given to technically complex matters such as this.
Indeed, I am aware that in preparing her report, Mrs Redondo organised an interesting and important hearing in the Agricultural Committee attended by swine fever experts from different Member States to better understand the progress made on this issue after the outbreak from 1997/1998.
The report of Madame Redondo largely supports the main aspects of the Commission proposal and of course, I am obviously very pleased about this.
However, allow me to address in detail the amendments, which have been proposed.
I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 to 5, 26, 28 and 30, as they go beyond the scope of this directive.
I understand that the recent FMD crisis has prompted Parliament to raise some horizontal problems related to animal health, which certainly need to be addressed.
The report deals for example with the implementation of controls on imports of live animals and products, traceability, financing of costs related to animal diseases and future animal health problems, which may emerge in relation to enlargement.
I share the concern of the Parliament.
But these complex issues cannot be addressed in this directive.
I have already informed this Assembly that the Commission will address those issues before the end of the year in a separate legal framework.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 6 to 8, 12, 16 to 18, 22, 24, 25 and 29, which contain certain technical details of relatively minor importance, for which the Commission considers the text of its proposal more suitable.
Amendment No 15 concerns the establishment of Community financed market support measures, in case of prolonged standstill of pigs in holdings kept under movement restrictions due to an outbreak of swine fever.
The Commission cannot accept this amendment, as such decisions must be taken on a case-by-case basis.
The legal basis for doing so already exists in the framework of the common market organisation for pig meat.
This mechanism demonstrated its efficiency and there is no need for further legal provisions in this regard.
Amendments Nos 20 and 21 concern the role of different authorities in the control of classical swine fever in wild boar.
The Commission cannot accept these amendments, as it is for the Member States to ensure that all authorities potentially involved in the control of the disease are given a proper role.
Their co-ordination must be guaranteed to ensure proper eradication.
Amendment No 23 concerns the introduction of an article on the potential use of marker vaccines.
As I have already said, the Commission and Parliament agree on this important issue.
The Commission however cannot accept this amendment, as its proposal already includes comprehensive provisions on marker vaccines.
However, we will take into account Parliament's remarks in a new recital.
Amendments Nos 20 and 29 concern the legal status of the classical swine fever diagnostic manual, which the Commission intends to adopt.
After the adoption of this directive, following the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee, the report suggests including this manual as part of the directive itself.
The Commission feels that this could create confusion from a legal point of view and thus cannot accept these amendments.
However, some modifications will be introduced in the text to reinforce the concept but the manual must be an essential part of Community legislation on swine fever.
Amendments Nos 24 and 25 note the need for some transitional provisions on contingency plans, which are indeed already in Article 28 of the proposal.
While the Commission shares the views of the Parliament, it cannot accept these amendments.
On the other hand, the Commission can accept entirely or partially, a number of amendments.
In these cases, drafting changes are also needed.
These concern not only some technical aspects of the directive, like disinfection of holdings, or other contaminated materials and sampling of suspected pigs, but also some more substantial and sensitive issues, like marker vaccination and the introduction of a ban on feeding pigs with catering waste.
On this last issue, I can only add to what I have already said in this Chamber last Tuesday, during the debate on the regulation of animal by-products, that the Commission is committed to ensure consistency between this directive and that regulation.
In summary, the Commission can accept the following amendments in full or in part and subject to necessary drafting changes: Amendments Nos 1, 9-11, 14, 19, 27, 31 and 32.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2-8, 12, 13, 15-18, 20-26, 28-30 and 33-37.
To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish once again to thank Madam Redondo and the Agriculture Committee for the excellent report and their support.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
EEC/Comoros fisheries agreement
The next item is the report (A5-0192/2001) by Mr PÃ©rez Royo, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros for the period from 28 February 2001 to 27 February 2004 [COM(2001) 173 - C5Â­0144/2001 - 2001/0088(CNS)].
Mr President, the Protocol that is today submitted for our approval, between the European Union and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros originates in the initial 1988 agreement and refers to the fifth period of this agreement; in other words, this is the fourth time the initial agreement has been renewed.
The agreement we are going to vote on today retains a line of continuity from the previous one, while the philosophy behind it also bears similarities to most of the agreements of this kind that the European Union has signed.
The present agreement, which as I have said retains a line of continuity from the previous one, introduces only some slight quantitative changes to the number of vessels authorised to fish and to the volume of catches, and also some changes - slight as to the amount involved but appreciable in structural terms - to the financial contribution made by the Union and the companies that will benefit from the agreement.
The authorised catch volume is set at 4 600 tonnes, slightly above the previous agreement' s 4 500 tonnes but quite a long way below the historical levels of 1988 to 1994 of 6 000 tonnes.
The number of vessels authorised to fish is set at 65: 40 tuna seiners and 25 surface longliners.
There is an increase in the overall number of vessels, which goes up from 60 to 65.
Of these, the tuna seiners correspond to the following countries: France, 21; Spain, 18; Italy, 1.
As for the surface longliners, most are Spanish with a few from Portugal.
It should be noted that although the total number of vessels has risen, the number of tuna seiners, which are the ones that catch the greatest tonnage, has gone down from 44 to 40 and the number of longliners has risen from 16 to 25.
These figures in fact reflect the utilisation levels achieved in practice during the time the previous agreement was in force, which were 75 to 80% for tuna seiners and over 90% for longliners, which are precisely those that have now been increased in number.
Turning now to the financial contribution, this is set at just over EUR one million: EUR 1 050 750, to be precise, or the equivalent of EUR 350 000 for each year the agreement lasts.
The main change in this section concerns the structure of this financial contribution.
Whereas in the previous agreement it was split 50-50 between funds allocated for compensation and those intended for targeted measures; that is, support measures for development of the local fishing sector, technical programmes, etc. Under the new agreement, however, the funds allocated to these targeted measures make up 60% of the financial contribution.
That means there is greater effort, so to say, in the development contribution to the detriment of the purely commercial aspects.
The cost distribution of the agreement is also changed.
The Community budget appropriation is cut by 2.7% and in exchange the shipowners' contributions are raised by 35%.
In real terms, the rate per tonne of catch goes up from EUR 20 to EUR 25.
This is a fair and balanced agreement, which brings together the various interests, and the various elements that are inevitably involved in this type of agreement.
That means first of all the interests of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, the interests of the European Union, the interests of the companies that will benefit from the agreement, and last but, of course, not least the resource conservation aspect.
It is, as I say, a fair and balanced agreement, which has been passed by a very large majority in the committee and which I now ask this House to vote for.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr PÃ©rez Royo for his report and the efficient conduct of business in committee.
He had our full support.
But we have some reservations.
In this policy of buying, on behalf of Community fleets, fish from third countries, I often ask myself whether it might not be better to spend the money in another way, in the interests of the regions which we set out to help.
I have no difficulty whatsoever with the need to develop the fishing ports that are, in many ways, hard-pressed through restructuring and depleted stocks.
I have no difficulty with the original political decision of the European Union to help the regions, particularly those of Spain and Portugal, that are highly or partly dependent on fishing.
But I have a serious problem about dealing with countries like the Comoros, which has a population of half-a-million people, and a GDP per capita of USD 700.
I cannot believe that these people have any capacity whatsoever to police their waters or in any way manage their stocks.
We are obviously sending - as the rapporteur pointed out - something like 65 vessels (mostly Spanish and French) into these waters.
These vessels catch 40 000 tonnes of fish.
How can anybody have any control over what they do or what they bring back?
I tend to believe that, to put it bluntly, this is a licence to plunder.
First of all, I would like a proper evaluation, as Mr PÃ©rez Royo requested, an economic evaluation and a cost-benefit analysis on behalf of the Union.
I would like to take it further and have a social evaluation of the money we spend, to find out whether or not we contribute to the improvement of the economic and social situation of certain regions in Spain or France, where this money is supposed to go, or whether in fact we just give a licence to a small number of people, who control quite a lot of capital, to exploit the waters of a country which is in no position to control its own resources.
That is my main concern.
I would prefer to take this money and spend it in the regions concerned, in Spain, Portugal or France, and spend it in such a way that we have direct control over the development we promote and in a way that we could be sure would be sustainable - for fish farming or alternative industries, perhaps.
Nevertheless I support the report.
Mr PÃ©rez Royo represents the view of the committee on this.
Mr President, honourable Members. I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr PÃ©rez Royo, for his report on the new fisheries protocol with the Comoros.
I am delighted, Mr PÃ©rez Royo, that you have given this proposal your full and firm support.
The new protocol refers solely to tuna and makes provision - as already mentioned - for fishing opportunities for a total of 65 ships.
The financial contribution paid in return will be EUR 350 000 per annum.
What is so gratifying is that 60% of this sum is to be used for targeted measures to develop the local fisheries sector in the Comoros, taking special account of small-scale fishing.
A brief word on the proposed amendments.
The Commission has no problem with the content of Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4 but considers them to be superfluous because it already complies with these requirements within the framework of the Interinstitutional Agreements, especially the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission of 5 July last year.
Unfortunately, I cannot agree to Amendment No 5.
The principle which applies here is that no new mandate is required for new protocols negotiated because they are annexed to existing agreements.
I can accept Amendment No 2 in full but, here too, we feel that this is not necessary because the principles set out in it coincide with the Community's basic position on sustainable, responsible fisheries as contained, for example, in our communication on fisheries and poverty reduction and the Green Paper presented recently on the future of the common fisheries policy.
As far as Amendment No 6 is concerned, the Commission shares Parliament's concern as regards protecting the habitat of Coelacanth in the Comoros.
Rather than refer to this in the text of the Council regulation, I would suggest that we proceed as follows: the Commission is prepared to write to the government of Comoros in order to convince it of the importance of this species and the problems connected with it.
We shall then send a copy of this letter to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela.
Finally, I cannot accept Amendment No 7.
It is an integral part of our agreement policy and all negotiating guidelines state that financial compensation for fishing opportunities must be paid partly from the EU budget and partly by the shipowners.
What happens in practice is that the Community pays the financial consideration to the third country in question and the shipowners obviously pay the licence fees themselves.
Mr President, I am sure that you will now be able to confirm with considerable relief that a large number of cases pending before the Legal Affairs Committee about the immunity of Members will now lapse.
I shall let you be the judge of your remark, Mr MacCormick.
VOTE
We shall now proceed to the vote on the topical and urgent debate.
Before the vote on Chad:
Mr President, I have a few minor changes that are required by the changed situation in Chad and an addition on which all groups agree and that are also very simple and short.
In item i) the words must endorse are changed to did endorse (past tense).
In item 3 of the regulatory section the following must be added to the first line: notes that the election of President Idriss Deby on 20th May 2001 was confirmed by the Chadian Constitutional Court on the 13th of June.
This is because of the changed situation: it has already happened.
We can therefore no longer do anything to change it.
Then there is agreement on the addition of item 10 b: calls on the Commission to examine the possibility of using the consultation procedure under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Convention.
Thank you, both your explanations are, therefore, technical amendments which are based on proven facts.
Mr President, the purpose of my speech was not to express my opposition. I just wanted to say that I found that the amendments tabled by Mrs Maes were in the right direction but that, nonetheless, the debate we had did not fully correspond to the text we have to vote on.
So, personally, I will not be taking part in this vote because I believe that the dimension of the responsibility of Western countries, especially France, in relation to Chad was not adequately developed in the text.
I accept the amendments tabled by Mrs Maes, but personally I will not be taking part in the vote on Chad because I think it does not go far enough.
That is your prerogative, Mr Sylla.
It will be noted in the Minutes.
So the first two technical amendments tabled by Mrs Maes have been incorporated.
As to the phrase she read out, that is an oral amendment.
Are there any objections to taking this oral amendment into consideration?
As there are none, it shall also be integrated.
During the vote on Afghanistan:
Mr President, we thought that there should still be a vote on one section of item 6, namely the last one.
No, Mrs Maes, we isolated the phrase. We voted in two parts and both parts were approved by the House.
Before the vote on Angola:
Mr President, this is not exactly an oral amendment but rather a point of fact, and if there is no objection I would like to ask that it be corrected in the text of the joint resolution.
In the sixth paragraph there is mention of the existence of three million displaced persons as a consequence of the war in Angola. The latest statistics and information gathered from international organisations and NGOs point at four million.
Therefore, if there is no objection, I should like to ask that the number be corrected: four million persons and not three million.
In any case, we are not going to start voting on the joint resolution.
First of all, there are two group resolutions which do not cover the entire text.
I suggest that you reflect on Mr Ribeiro' s proposal whilst we vote on the other proposals.
We will see if the House will accept the technical amendment tabled by the honourable Member.
On the vote on Angola:
Mr President, in order to obtain as broad a consensus and as broad an agreement as possible, I would suggest that we introduce an oral addendum to replace Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 as a new No 5a which reads as follows - and I trust you will forgive my poor French, I did not know we had a French-speaking president in the chair:
"Condemns all the massacres against the civilian population perpetrated by the military forces in place" .
If agreed, this would replace Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4.
The natural, technological and environmental disasters that repeatedly cause devastation throughout entire regions of the globe have always given rise to requests for urgent measures to make civil protection interventions at Community level more effective. This has been achieved through the proposal for a decision, which I feel able to support.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, with regard to this proposal, I would like to stress how this Community mechanism for the coordination of civil protection intervention was set up on a permanent basis to respond to specific emergencies.
In fact, the proposal seeks to create a body within the Commission which will coordinate the actions in the Member States.
The mechanism will cost EUR 1.5 million per year, which will be charged to the B4-3300 budget heading entitled 'Community cooperation for civil protection and situations of environmental urgency' for which there exists another legal basis that authorises a multiannual programme (2000-2004), whose grant is EUR 7.5 million.
In accordance with the joint declaration of 20 July 2000, I have taken note that this additional cost is now compatible with Heading 3 of the Financial Perspective, without existing policies being cut.
I am, however, still confused on two points, which I asked the Commission to clarify in my report. First of all, the distinction between economic, actual operational costs such as the intervention teams and the assessment and co-ordination teams, and the structural costs of a more administrative nature; secondly, the risks of duplicating the actions financed under co-operation in civil protection, which also provides for exercises, exchanges of experts and the mobilisation of specific competencies.
In any case, I feel that this proposal for a decision is to be supported, and I announce that my group will be voting in favour.
Redondo JimÃ©nez report (A5-0143/2001)
. (DE) Classical swine fever is one of the scourges of the animal world in Europe.
This viral infection in pigs, which is harmless to human beings, occurs time and again because the virus is widespread in certain regions of the EU where it is carried by wild pigs.
It makes sense to develop strategies to fight this disease in periods of respite rather than crisis, strategies based on preventive measures since, if there is an outbreak, animals have to slaughtered on a massive scale.
The EU's vaccination policy is attracting more and more attention, especially since the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth.
If conventional vaccines are used, the stock affected must be totally isolated for long periods.
The situation would be different if we could use marker vaccines, which are currently being investigated and improved.
We must be able to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals.
Mrs Redondo has presented a good, balanced report on the problem of classical swine fever.
I support the call for more research and development on vaccines.
Using marker vaccines would give us another very useful tool with which to fight the disease in areas with a high density of pigs, obviating the need for wholesale slaughter.
Hygiene plays a very important part in connection with disease.
Feedingstuffs must be prepared to strict standards which can and must be controlled.
I am opposed to a total ban on swill feeding because this would destroy valuable feedingstuffs, merely because we feel we are not in a position to prepare it, that is, to heat it so as to destroy any risk of disease.
I must explain, Mr President, why I cannot present explanations of vote.
My 86-year-old mother came to visit the European Parliament; she watched the whole sitting; she said, 'Good, Fatuzzo!
What a fine Parliament!
You speak a little too much, however.
You should not give so many explanations of vote.'
Mother will always be mother.
That is why I thought I should make her happy by not giving explanations of vote.
Just for today!
(Applause and laughter)
Mr Fatuzzo, I think the applause shows just how much the House is amazed by the wisdom of your mother.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 7.00 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 14 June 2001.
Membership of political groups
I would like to inform you that, with effect from today, 2 July 2001, Mr Holmes will no longer be a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities. He will now sit with the Non-attached Members.
I would also like to announce that, pursuant to Rule 7(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has carried out a verification of credentials regarding Mrs Olga Zrihen Zaari and Mr Miguel Mayol i Raynal.
I therefore propose to confirm these mandates.
I note that Mr Holmes is leader of the UK Independence Party.
I wonder whether that means that the UK Independence Party is now transferring in its entirety, or at least the two Members who are present here, to the other group.
I only have information about Mr Holmes.
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 28 June 2001.
Relating to Wednesday:
Madam President, I am sorry that I keep on having to repeat myself on the subject of Wednesdays, but the same deplorable state of affairs still exists.
As I see it, question time has again been deferred and shortened.
Every time I protest, I am told that this is exceptional.
The exception is now slowly becoming the norm because, by foolishly abolishing the Friday sittings, we have overloaded the Wednesday ones.
I would therefore ask you to ensure that, independently of the Friday issue - which we cannot now resolve -Wednesdays come fully into their own again. In other words, a full one and a half hours should be set aside for question time, for the right to ask questions is a fundamental right of every parliamentarian.
Mr Posselt, I promise you that this will be the last time.
Unless the chairs of the groups decide otherwise.
(The order of business was adopted)
Speeches relating to procedure
Madam President, I would like to inform you once again of the difficulties of travelling to Strasbourg from the countries where we live.
This morning, there were only 18 seats in total on the flight from Milan Malpensa to Strasbourg, as a result of which Mrs Morgantini and other Members found that their seats had been double-booked, and she was unable to get a plane in time to be here before the beginning of the part-session, despite the fact that she had left Rome at 7.30 this morning.
I would like to make this extreme inconvenience known.
I realise that airlines have limits, but surely Air France could provide an aeroplane with more than 18 seats on the first day of the part-session, Madam President.
This is an obstacle to the work of this House.
Thank you for pointing this out to me, Mrs Napoletano.
As you know, we are doing all we can to improve the situation.
In any case, I think that there have been some improvements.
I hope that some of you have noticed this, but I am well aware that there is still much to be done and have, therefore, taken a careful note of what you have said.
Madam President, there were no flights at all from Amsterdam to Strasbourg this morning.
The flight was once again cancelled.
I have drawn your attention to this on several occasions in this House.
The number of flights, which was originally three per day, has been cut down to two.
We then assumed that those flights would probably continue to operate, but Air France has once again decided to cancel the flights altogether.
I should like to draw your attention to this.
We all had to fly via Paris, Brussels or Frankfurt again, which meant that we were late arriving here, although we were at the airport before 8 a.m.
Thank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can only say that I am sorry to hear this.
You have indeed pointed this out on a number of occasions, so please rest assured that I will try to do all I can to follow up this matter.
Madam President, whatever one' s personal opinion may be of events in Yugoslavia over the past 10 years, bombings, holding governments to ransom, endeavouring to stigmatise and humiliate an entire nation and its leaders for resisting NATO policy; whatever one' s personal opinion of how this country was governed by a president and his advisers repeatedly elected in democratic elections, one must, I think, agree that the unprincipled manner in which he was abducted from his own country, despite categorical opposition from the upper and lower houses of parliament and the supreme constitutional court, and handed over to a court which, as we now know, was set up on the orders of the USA in order to serve political interests and help terrorise anyone who opposes the new order, are unacceptable methods, to put it mildly; some of us think this is the work of hoodlums and deserves to be roundly condemned.
I therefore call on you to intervene. I am asking for a stop to be put to this deplorable situation and for Mr Milosevic and his advisers to be returned to their country, because only the people and the courts in their own country have the power to judge them.
To remain silent in the face of this sort of international terrorism is basically tantamount to complicity; it shows disdain for any notion of international law or national sovereignty and paves the way for international political activity to be criminalised.
I would like to thank my fellow members for their support, but it is high time everyone accepted their responsibility; otherwise how can we talk of international legitimacy and respect for institutions?
Madam President, I will be very brief.
I would just like to remind Mr Wurtz that Mr Milosevic was the force behind his political family.
My whole group and I fought, therefore, against him, in particular during the Yugoslavian conflict.
I cannot help feeling some disgust, however, at the vultures circling around this carcass and at this farcical judicial system which is still designed for the victors and never questions their actions.
Whether we are talking of Nuremberg, Tokyo or The Hague, today, everyone believes that victors should at least have to answer to history if they are not subjected to the all-too-weak legal systems of their fellow men.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, without wishing to defend a Member from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I feel that the essence of the speech we have just heard on Mr Milosevic concerns not so much whether or not he has committed crimes as the following question, which is a serious one: how far can limits be imposed on a people's autonomy in matters of putting its citizens on trial?
Who gave the United States the right, which they exercise today, to put on trial all those who are suspected of having committed war crimes, when they themselves are often suspected of committing crimes in wartime?
Well then, the task of a self-respecting European Parliament is to analyse this fact: whether Mr Milosevic is a criminal or not will be decided by an appropriate court.
Our task is to decide whether or not the autonomy of peoples is sacred and sacrosanct.
Madam President, as the chairman of the group and a number of honourable members have commented on my speech, I should like to clarify that I was speaking solely for my own part and on behalf of the members of my party and, secondly, that I merely pointed out that, whatever ones personal opinion of how Mr Milosevic and his advisers governed their country, we cannot condone this sort of action, especially when the upper and lower houses of parliament in his country refused to pass this sort of law and his country has not ratified the statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
I think that we need to respect the institutions and sovereignty of every country, otherwise I am not sure exactly what sort of European Parliament this is.
Madam President, in my view, we must welcome Mr Wurtz' s speech on conversion.
I also feel that we must remind our fellow Members from Greece that the Macedonian people are being humiliated, mainly because of the attitude of Greece, which still forces all the countries of the European Union as well as Greece, to use the acronym 'FYROM' to refer to Macedonia.
This constitutes genuine humiliation, and perhaps this would be enough to inspire our Greek friends to set about fighting to change this situation in their own country.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I simply wish to say to Mr Dupuis that the matter of the name he has referred to is under negotiation, progress has been made and I hope it will be resolved soon.
For the rest, I repeat what I have said once before in this Chamber: our neighbouring State has existed so far only because of the continued moral and material support of Greece.
Otherwise Milosevic and company would have broken it up long ago.
We should concentrate now on supporting and helping it to survive in this present very difficult situation rather than confuse the issue with matters which are secondary.
Madam President, I should like to endorse Mr Dupuis' remarks about not calling Macedonia "FYROM" and to recommend that the whole of Parliament align its practice with the Dutch text of this week's agenda which lists the Council and the Commission statements on Wednesday morning as being about "Macedonia", whereas the English text says "FYROM".
Mr Dupuis is quite right.
How can we expect a country to have an identity when it is called by an acronym?
Let us please put an end to this nonsense.
Madam President, with all due respect, I should like to remind the House that, as far as the recurring issue of the name of FYROM is concerned, this name has been endorsed by FYROM itself.
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not subrogate to this nation by speaking on its behalf.
They personally agreed to this name at the United Nations.
Do not worry, a solution will be found and, anyway, that is not the problem.
Helping FYROM or Macedonia in its present state.
That is what Parliament should be doing.
Madam President, I wish to speak about pensioners and elderly people who are not self-sufficient, who have disabilities.
On Thursday 28 June, the German Provincial High Court and Court of Appeal upheld the appeal brought by a private German rest home for elderly people who are not self-sufficient, which is a member of an association of private European rest homes known as ECHO, ruling that the German law which grants funding and aid to public rest homes but not to private rest homes for elderly people with disabilities is illegal.
I want all the elderly people who need to, to be able to find a public or private home where they can receive assistance, in a situation of free competition.
I call upon you to make every effort to bring this about.
Resale rights
The next item is the report (A5-0235/2001) by Mr Zimmerling, on behalf of the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the resale right for the benefit of the author of an original work of art (C5-0220/2001 - 1996/0085(COD))
Madam President, I think this directive will be a success. What we have here is a classic example of European work.
First of all, Parliament came up with a pioneering proposal as regards which the Council then needed four years to establish a common position adopted by the 15 Member States which was characterised by exclusively national interests.
Parliament then required the Council to think in European terms at second reading, while the optimum demands were made on behalf of artists and auction houses.
Finally, a solution that everyone involved considered to be acceptable and satisfactory was found following tough negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
We have put European competition in the art market back on track, while auction houses and galleries in the EU are being given equality of opportunity.
In this context, I think it is particularly important for the Commission to also look regularly into the issue of whether - and, if so, when - the European art market, and not only national art markets, are affected, and that corresponding adjustments are made.
We have improved social security for artists and their heirs, who have now also been uniformly guaranteed a financial stake in the increases in value of their works.
I therefore believe that we have, in this way, taken a first important step in the direction of more competition and more security in European art circles.
I must ask the House to approve the result of the negotiations.
Madam President, 12 out of the 15 Member States of the European Union have introduced a resale right on the resale of works of art. One Member State has not applied it and three Member States have not yet had recourse to this mechanism.
Since existing legislation differs greatly, not just as regards its specific objective but also with regard to the rates applied and those entitled to receive royalties, this situation represented a gap in the internal market.
The compromise reached by Parliament, the Council and the Commission seeks to bridge this gap and to bring an end to the distortion of competition from which the Community is currently suffering.
Furthermore, the resale right represents a fair return for artists or their successors, since it compensates for the fact that the laws of the art market dictate that a work of art usually only gains value over a period of time, whereas artists cannot wait for their twilight years to be able to live from their work.
Lastly, the resale right is a form of tax on financial speculation in the art world. It is a tax that the art market can easily bear, as is proven by the introduction of a special VAT system on works of art in Directive 94/5, a special system which has not prevented an increase in sales quite the opposite not even in Member States which did not operate a VAT system.
The rapporteur has said all that was necessary with regard to the compromise reached, which I personally supported.
In this compromise, the European Parliament made two essential gains:
on the one hand, the threshold subject to resale right was brought down to EUR 3000, which is still quite high, but which could be brought down further if the Commission believes this is necessary. This becomes more acceptable insofar as a Member State resale right is maintained below the European threshold;
on the other hand, the refusal to have an extremely long deadline of 15 years; this was retained by the Council of Ministers in the text adopted after first reading and has now been brought down to a maximum of six years.
This precedent would have been set at a particularly inopportune moment, at the very time when the Community is preparing for its enlargement to new members.
Given that the external art market is under no illusion as to the importance of the draft submitted today for the vote by Parliament, there is, therefore, no real reason to reject this draft text, and that is why our group will be voting for the motion.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, having started in April 1997, we have now reached the third reading of the Resale Rights Directive.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the conciliation committee and Mr Zimmerling for their efforts.
But unfortunately, I shall have to adhere to my old point of view.
The vast majority of my group are still not happy with the proposal.
We are concerned here with the difference between the English term 'copyright' and the Dutch word 'auteursrecht' , for what is at issue here is the sale of a work of art.
Should an artist' s heir be able to exercise his or her rights seventy years after the event?
I do not think so.
A sale implies that all rights and duties are waived, and that is what the financial compensation is for.
The suggestion to increase the minimum price to EUR 3 000 is an improvement.
Anything lower would seriously hamper budding artists.
This brings me to my next point of criticism.
Our main objection to this proposal is that it is diametrically opposed to the principle of subsidiarity.
The Commission has been unable to demonstrate that discrepancies in legislation in the Member States will, in the long run, have a direct, negative impact on the internal market.
Furthermore, it is quite likely that the European modern and contemporary art market, which is of particular significance for London, will be moved to Switzerland. This was, in fact, already evident a few weeks ago at the Basel Art Fair.
The art market could, in fact, move outside Europe altogether, where this right does not exist.
Surely that cannot be the aim of the exercise.
It appears from the proposal that that is a problem.
Provision is made for all kinds of unnecessary exceptions.
Harmonisation has therefore gone out of the window. Is it not a contradiction in terms that, whilst attempts are being made to harmonise resale rights worldwide, the opportunity is being created for the Member States to abandon the minimum price at will via all kinds of loopholes?
Then there is implementation.
In addition to the red tape which is involved in keeping track of the different sales and purchases of a work of art, exceptions complicate the matter even further. Artists do not welcome this either.
If the sale takes place between private persons, resale rights do not apply.
Would you not agree with me that the trade in art between private persons will experience a dramatic upsurge?
That is not the only example I could quote.
Finally, the directive does not offer all artists the same treatment, except in the case of sales via galleries and auction houses.
The directive is unclear and is not fraud-proof.
It is also superfluous, for there is no distortion within the internal market.
My group does not welcome legislation of this kind. The citizen experiences this, in fact, as unnecessary interference from Brussels.
My group has voted against it twice. It deems the changes and improvements in respect of the proposal to be insufficient and will therefore be voting against it for the third time.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, further to what Mrs Sanders-ten Holte has said, it can be seen that there are two sides to every question.
A majority of members of visual artists' associations and representative bodies, with whom I have spoken during the last few years, now want to see European resale rights.
Even the majority of those in the art trade want to see common resale rights.
Politicians have been trying for years to negotiate a compromise acceptable to everyone.
Admittedly, the Council has not really striven for harmonisation but, rather, put together a framework with a number of ingenious loopholes.
Admittedly, the Council was not particularly flexible and did not pay very much attention to the European Parliament' s proposals, but it is, at the end of the day, an acceptable compromise.
I cannot speak for the Commission, but there are one or two things to indicate that the Commission, too, was not happy, or in agreement, with all the Council proposals, especially those regarding the transitional periods.
In what was not so much a debate as a veto policy, the Commission, too, played its role, however, in making resale rights possible.
Now we have this document, on the subject of which I would say that, although we might well protest, we ought to be saying 'yes' to what is, at long last, a victory.
We have this paper, which can be improved upon, but it is precisely because we now have the paper that such improvements can be made.
Opponents should be somewhat more careful in their criticism rather than appear, as critics, to be all of the same mind.
That is because there are some people who reject resale rights on principle and others who would like to level specific and very serious criticisms which may be of vital importance to themselves or to particular players, for example to the smallest art galleries which, in fact, are instrumental in creating a pool of talent.
It is they who assume the major risk.
They have a great many problems with the tax differentials, administration and insurance contracts.
They are scarcely allowed to take visual artists' work on commission. For the most part, they have to buy such works.
If these smallest galleries have to buy works of art and are then - as anticipated in this proposal - unable to resell them three years later, and if perhaps, only after that period, have to sell them for less than their purchase price, they are bearing a risk and are losing out on two counts, namely in terms of both the price and of the resale rights.
My group will nonetheless vote in favour of this proposal, although there are still one or two improvements to be made in terms of both resale rights and of related aspects.
Finally, I should not like to brush aside one further argument, for that is not something I can do, but, rather, to qualify it somewhat.
It is only one specific lobby that is arguing the point about market migration.
We have supply and demand, and there are certain things that are sought in Europe, and which have always been sought in Europe, and not in the United States, and vice versa.
It is important that this European decision, which will hopefully be taken by a majority of us tomorrow, should exert enormous pressure in favour of representatives campaigning for resale rights in Switzerland and also in the United States.
They are waiting for us to say yes, and I hope that this is what they will hear tomorrow.
Madam President, this report relates to the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee, and it is therefore far too late to affect the course of this directive - not that a single or group of MEPs could do that anyway.
Nevertheless I will take this opportunity to put on record my party's opposition to this measure.
In so doing I must point out a few home truths to this House, even though I know these will be unpopular with the institution, which prefers to live in its own world, totally detached from reality.
First, although this measure aims to remove distortions in the internal market, it is fair to say that there is no such thing as a Community market in the resale of artists' work. There is in fact a major market in the UK - mainly in London - and very little else in Europe.
Therefore, the major effect would be not so much to distort as to disrupt the UK market.
The net result of this will be to drive the trade elsewhere: to Japan, Switzerland and the United States, none of which countries will have the same concern for EU-based artists as the London market.
Secondly, such money as is collected will invariably go to the wrong people.
Seventy per cent of the 'droit de suite' funds collected in France in 1996 went not to the artists but to the descendants of seven artists, including the relatives of Matisse and Picasso.
This does not exactly conform with the images of helping the struggling artist.
Thirdly, the law itself is cumbersome and will add considerably to the costs of art markets by adding a tier of bureaucracy and expense.
Many small firms will be excluded from low-value sales altogether, limiting the opportunities for new and aspiring artists to market their works.
Instead of helping artists, this will hinder them, and there will be fewer small firms left in business.
Who will then buy the works of unknown artists?
Altogether this is an ill-conceived, irrational and ultimately unnecessary piece of legislation.
The legislation itself will be the instrument which creates distortions in an otherwise satisfactory market.
As is so often the case, Parliament and the European Union should leave things alone.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached by the rapporteur, Mr Zimmerling, is a compromise agreement on an extremely interesting issue.
The agreement was criticised by some artists' groups who told us they believed that the new directive would, paradoxically, cause unacceptable discrimination between famous artists and those who are in difficulty, that it would give no support at all to artists who need it most.
They pointed out to us that, in fact, this would create a distortion between a minority of privileged artists, whose works are sold in art galleries and auction houses, and the majority of artists, who would be officially refused the resale right since their works of art are sold privately or sold to museums by private collectors.
In fact, as you might imagine, we had lengthy debates on setting a threshold of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 4 000, above which the resale right would apply, arriving at a compromise of EUR 3 000, which is a reasonable amount.
What is more worrying, on the other hand, is the exception to the rule of equal opportunities in law, which could well lead to appeals before the Court of Human Rights in Luxembourg due, in particular, to the fact that the date on which the directive will enter into force in Member States which currently do not have a resale right is so far away 2010.
In any case, I am afraid that, as the previous speaker said, the resale right itself although it clearly responds to legitimate concerns will create bureaucracy that is more likely to cripple the art market than to bring genuine satisfaction to the creators themselves.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, a majority of my parliamentary group - I am also saying this because Mr GraÃ§a Moura is unable to be here at the moment - will doubtless approve the conclusion reached by the conciliation committee.
In spite of this, a good many more members of my parliamentary group also have reservations, shared by political colleagues in my own country of Austria which, at present, does not have resale rights at all and has not seen any need to introduce them either.
I also promised my French colleague, Mrs Fourtou, that I would again voice some of these reservations today, although I am a committed supporter of fair competition in the internal market and always speak up for European regulations whenever they make sense in terms of the internal market and our common integration policy.
On 13 December of last year, I therefore informed plenary of the concerns expressed about resale rights by artists, the art world, gallery owners and, above all, young artists, as well as by the auction houses in my own country and by our parliamentary group.
On that occasion, I concluded by saying that the present basis for the decision was unsatisfactory.
I certainly think that the conciliation committee made a lot of changes to try to accommodate these reservations. Moreover, the rapporteur is also to be congratulated.
For many, these misgivings could not, however, be completely resolved, something which finds very clear - albeit only symbolic - expression in the wordings concerning the transitional regulations, such as the following: 'The deadline for implementation of the directive will be 4 years.
Those Member States which do not apply the resale right at the time of the entry into force of the directive shall not be required, for a period expiring not later than 1 January 2010, to apply the resale right for the benefit of those entitled under the artist after his death.'
A further deadline is cited by way of supplement.
This wording shows how sensitive the subject is and how various compromises had to be made.
I should also like to say, however, that the purpose of introducing resale rights is to enable practitioners of the visual arts to benefit from the subsequent financial success of their works.
We must ask ourselves if this goal has been achieved.
Partly in the wake of scientific investigations and, in addition, the conclusion reached by the conciliation committee, many believe that resale rights constitute a redistribution of resources from young, and often less well off, artists to older, successful artists and, above all, to their heirs.
One of the investigations I have to hand provides a very good five-point summary of the reservations, which I should very probably point out, since they show that not everyone is now in a state of euphoria.
Firstly: since the art and auction trade can only bear a very small part of the resale rights tax and since - thankfully, in my view - this tax cannot be fully passed on to the purchasers of works of art, resale rights might lead to a reduction in the purchase prices of works by young artists.
The second problem is that artists successful later on in life - perhaps just a few out of the total number - might regard resale rights as an enforced redistribution of resources in those later phases of their lives.
Thirdly, this is an undesirable development, however, since it would confine young artists within a world of consumer opportunities.
Fourthly, the tax could change the nature of competition in the art trade. If this were to happen, there could be a real risk of migration.
Fifthly, the initial sale price might be influenced by account having to be taken of the fact that, in the event of a subsequent sale, the resale rights tax would be payable to the artist.
These reservations are also shared by many in my country and in my parliamentary group.
That does not detract from the result of the conciliation, but I would ask you to understand that not everyone today is laughing.
Madam President, for reasons of equality, if nothing else, a right similar to copyright or other intellectual property rights is needed for intellectual works which can be reproduced ad infinitum.
And what we have created are resale rights for the figurative arts.
These rights are property rights because they vest economic rights and benefits in the artist.
However, they are property rights sui generis because they indirectly recognise the importance of aesthetic values while, at the same time, awarding artists a sort of honorary tax. It is a fact of life that works of art cannot be bought and sold without the intervention of art dealers.
However, unlike the trade in consumer or other capital goods, the trade in works of art is not an end in itself.
The point about the art trade is that it disseminates aesthetic values and aesthetic messages.
But these messages cannot be disseminated without artists. And while their contribution is unique, the works which they produce only gradually acquire a market value.
It is therefore wholly unfair for the dealer - who is no more than a middleman - to reap the full benefit of this value.
Besides, it is up to them to encourage artistic creativity.
That is why it is wrong that artists in certain countries do not recognise this right.
We therefore need to correct the mistake in the Berne Convention making resale rights potential rights.
The fact that certain countries insist on long transitional periods or on postponing the date of application does not flatter its supporters.
Europe, as the area of artistic creation and culture par excellence, must show third countries the right way forward.
Everyone stands to gain from this solution.
Mr President, we, the British Conservative MEPs, are not happy with this proposal.
We believe it is not necessary for the completion of the single market.
In practice we do not believe it will help financially those who need it most.
Indeed, there is some evidence it may actually make them worse off, as my colleague Mr Karas pointed out.
It is going to drive a significant part of the contemporary art market out of the EU to Geneva and New York, and that will cost jobs in the trade itself and in supporting industries.
Those jobs are our jobs - Europe's jobs - and our businesses.
On balance, we believe it will damage rather than enhance Europe's economy and the position of its working artists.
Moreover, it will make a global agreement on 'droit de suite' less rather than more likely because there is no incentive for the beneficiaries of this agreement - New York and Geneva - to strike a deal with the European Union.
In short, we believe it is an ill-conceived project which is against the best interests of Europe in general and the single market in particular.
I begin by expressing the thanks of the Commission to the rapporteur, Mr Zimmerling, for his report.
In particular, the Commission notes with pleasure that an agreement has finally been reached.
I shall be brief in my remarks; much has been said about this subject, not only today, but in the past, so I shall restrict myself to what is absolutely necessary.
The resale right is going to be part of Community law.
It will allow artists to benefit from that right wherever their works are sold in the European Union.
That means that an end will gradually be put to the distortion of competition affecting the internal market in this area.
The directive will give the Commission a basis on which to act in order to promote recognition of the resale rights at international level.
The Commission has already committed itself to taking appropriate action in that direction.
But the Commission is still concerned by the long delays in application which may lead to 10 years elapsing before the directive is able to produce its full harmonising effects.
The Commission has therefore made a statement, which is to be published in the Official Journal together with the directive, in which it points out that such delays should be considered exceptional and should remain so in order to maintain the effectiveness of Community action within the internal market.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Better legal protection for accident victims
The next item is the report (A5-0174/2001) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with recommendations to the Commission on a fifth European Parliament and Council directive on motor vehicle liability insurance to improve the legal protection of accident victims.
Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, has unfortunately been detained today at an important meeting in Luxembourg and has asked me to stand in for him today and, in fact, to speak on his behalf, which is something I am happy to do.
With the fifth draft directive on motor vehicles, we want further to improve the protection of accident victims and, at the same time, take account of the requirements of the internal market.
What are we proposing?
Firstly, any loss arising out of a traffic accident in the European Union - whether those involved are from the same or from different countries - ought, in future, to be settled within a reasonable period. Otherwise, there should be the threat of financial sanctions.
Secondly, the sum insured ought, in future, to amount to at least EUR 2 million, irrespective of the number of victims and the nature of the losses.
I have doubts, however, as to whether this amount will be sufficient.
In December 1998, a British judge decided the case of a Dutch student who had broken his neck in an accident and since been paralysed from neck to toe.
The court awarded the accident victim compensation of approximately GBP 9 million, some GBP 8 million of which related to purely financial loss.
Thirdly, there are still doubts as to who is obliged to assume liability for an accident caused by a vehicle without a number plate or with a false or stolen number plate.
In such cases, we need clear regulations in favour of the accident victim.
In future, compensation should be paid from the guarantee fund of the country in which the accident occurred.
Take, for example, the case of a Dutch hit-and-run driver who causes an accident in Italy with a vehicle stolen in Poland that has false German number plates.
Who is liable?
In future, it should be the Italian guarantee fund alone, which would obviously try to obtain redress.
Fourthly, the period for which a policyholder working temporarily in another Member State is protected ought, in future, to be increased to twelve months.
During this period, he ought neither to have to register a new address for his vehicle nor to have to effect a new insurance policy.
Those are only some of the proposals.
They are really there for the purpose of tying up loose ends.
At a later stage, we shall deal with the real problems of the future, i.e. reform of the compensation provided for non-material losses in the European Union.
We discussed this last year in Trier at the Academy of European Law: in other words, the protection of pedestrians and cyclists as vulnerable road users.
That was the theme in Trier this year at the Second European Road Traffic Law Conference: in other words, the accident victim' s right to claim directly against his own insurer.
I consider that to be a modern concept.
The Commission should therefore set to work.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, very much for the painstaking work that he continues to do on behalf of citizens and motorists throughout Europe in filling gaps in their insurance cover.
Insurance has to be as foolproof as we can possibly make it, because that is what consumers expect.
Many of us have dealt with constituency cases, because of problems or loopholes in insurance cover.
I welcome this proposal from Mr Rothley on behalf of our group, and particularly thank him because he has accepted a number of suggestions that I have made to him in this area and added them to his report.
I just want to mention two areas specifically this evening.
The first is an important provision that not only benefits citizens, but also encourages in a practical way the development of the single market.
Currently, if European citizens wish to go and buy a new car in another country, they have to get special insurance cover for the period when they pick up the car from the dealership or the factory and bring it back to their own home country.
Their current home insurer is not allowed to provide that cover.
In Mr Rothley's proposals, they will be able to do that simply and easily.
Cover can be extended for 30 days to encourage citizens to go and exercise their rights in a single market and shop across borders.
That is something which the Commission, particularly the internal market Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein, will be pleased to support.
The second issue, mentioned briefly by Mrs Gebhardt, concerns cover provided for citizens who take up temporary positions in other EU-Member States, such as students moving to a university wishing to take a car with them; workers on secondment or members of families moving to another country for a temporary period.
They will be able to take their car and its existing insurance cover for a period of up to 12 months, without any problems.
That is important.
We know from complaints received, certainly in my case, from UK citizens that it has not been easy for insurance companies to provide such cover.
Again, this is of practical benefit enabling citizens to exercise their rights in the internal market.
In conclusion, I would like to say to Commissioner Bolkestein that I hope he will accept this proposal from Mr Rothley on behalf of Parliament and move as quickly as possible to bring these changes into effect in the form of further revisions to the Motor Insurance Directive.
Mr President, firstly I want to make it absolutely clear that I have every sympathy with what our rapporteur wishes to achieve in taking forward this proposal.
As we have often noted before, motor vehicle accidents unfortunately touch the lives of far too many of our citizens as mobility across Europe grows.
The Fourth Directive made great strides in dealing with these problems.
However, I want to concentrate on the fact that the proposal "requires" Member States to implement in their national law the provisions relating to an improved compensation procedure.
In essence, we have created a preferential system for European motor accident claims and therefore, logically, it makes sense to give those who experience an accident in a purely national context the same advantages.
Logically, yes, but does this way forward respect subsidiarity?
I am afraid not and this is an important point.
I have therefore retabled an amendment to make this merely a recommendation to Member States.
The point is that the issues raised here are a matter for national private civil law.
It would involve substantial changes in tort law in England and Wales, for example.
We would be putting motor vehicle accident victims in a class apart.
What about the victims of medical negligence, industrial injury or any other type of claim against insurers?
At present our committee is looking carefully at the harmonisation of civil law.
In that respect we have been rightly critical of a piecemeal approach, improperly researched.
I merely wish to make the point today that this proposal does, and must, involve a much bigger debate with tremendous implications for our respective systems of civil law.
It deserves proper and transparent treatment.
Mr President, Mr Rothley's own-initiative report is indeed most welcome at this stage in the evolution of the single market.
There is no doubt that the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive needs updating after 15 years in force.
This period has afforded us sufficient opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the directive in contributing to a genuine single market for motor insurance.
It is clear that there are a number of gaps remaining and that the insuree and the claimant still face certain difficulties which need to be addressed.
I thank Mr Rothley for his research in this area and for clearly identifying the areas in which the legal protection of accident victims can be improved.
As long as there is room for improvement in this area, it is incumbent on us, as European legislators, to push forward and bring about a better set of conditions.
While a certain amount of progress has been made, it is clear that a single insurance market does not yet exist.
This deprives consumers of the best that companies across Europe can offer in terms of choice, in terms of flexibility and, of course, price.
Motor insurance is a multi-billion euro business and further competition must be encouraged so that consumers can reap the benefits.
One glaring inconsistency in the motor insurance field is in the area of temporary residency.
Current rules often place consumers at the mercy of insurance companies.
This must stop.
I strongly support the notion that citizens who wish to take up temporary residency outside their home country should be allowed to bring their personal motor vehicle without running into financial and administrative obstacles.
The freedom to live, work or study abroad must mean just that - freedom - and not hidden barriers.
Having to re-insure and re-register can be such hindrances.
In my own country we currently have the shortest re-registration period, with only one day allowed.
It is frequently difficult for temporary residents to obtain local insurance cover at a reasonable price.
A one-year grace period during which the home country insurer would be obliged to continue cover is perfectly reasonable.
This would mean one less headache for citizens considering temporary residency in another Member State.
We often hear in this House that European citizens somehow feel far removed from decisions taken at European level, that the issues dealt with are not ones that impinge on their daily lives.
