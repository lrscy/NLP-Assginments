First, tourism needs to be promoted within Europe as a form of exchange and a way of getting to know each other; secondly, economic stagnation and international challenges force us to think of tourism in global terms.
We have to attract the new demand from China, Brazil and India, by proposing an integrated product and promoting the whole of Europe as a destination.
We cannot afford to waste this opportunity, in a sector in which we have the greatest potential for growth, development and employment.
This report offers a number of ideas around which intelligent proposals can be drawn up: tourist destinations of excellence, cutting VAT rates for operators, and promoting agrotourism, a very Italian form of rural tourism to encourage farmers not to leave the countryside and to promote traditional produce.
In the light of recent tragic accidents, I should like to finish by pointing out that Europe needs to guarantee the safety of its tourists.
In that respect, Parliament must adopt the blacklist regulation as soon as possible, as well as all the measures needed to be able to act swiftly to manage crises, as in the case of the attacks in recent months.
The aims set out in the report are ambitious and innovative.
Therefore, Commissioner, we call for careful attention and adequate financial support for an industry that is of vital importance for the whole of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, as we all know, tourism can contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Objectives.
Europe is the world's favourite tourist destination, but with the emergence of new competitors, as has already been mentioned, we can maintain this situation only by creating better tourist facilities, higher quality services and information, and a high level of consumer protection and safety.
This requires cooperation between the public and private sectors.
Coming from a new Member State, I emphasise that all of us benefit from enlargement in the field of tourism, so future enlargements would give a further boost to the sector's economic weight and its importance to European growth.
As Vice-Chairwoman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I am sure that the growth of tourism will lead to more opportunities, prospects and appropriate working conditions for female employees, who represent the majority of the sector's workers, as well as businesswomen in tourism and, most importantly, to more jobs for women.
In developing tourism, we must not forget the socially vulnerable groups and people with disabilities, representing more than 10 million Europeans.
I welcome the initiative to make tourist and leisure establishments, facilities, services and itineraries accessible to people with reduced mobility and disability.
I stress that this is a great challenge for the new Member States, which will have to overcome huge disadvantages in this sector.
Tourism still does not receive the attention it should in the EU.
There is no tourism website on the EU portal and Eurostat publishes only a few tourism statistics.
I therefore recommend that we have a 'European Year of Tourism', which would be accompanied by a wide range of events and programmes to highlight the social and economic importance of tourism.
Experience of Member States' practices in this area is important and increased cooperation between Member States on best practice could be useful.
Â Â  Mr President, please believe that as a Spaniard and as a Valencian, I was extremely apprehensive about this report.
I shall begin by saying that all my fears have been allayed by my colleague Mr QueirÃ³âs report, and I shall therefore restrict myself to reiterating certain ideas, emphasising others and adding some new ones.
The report starts by stressing the importance of tourism from the cultural and economic points of view.
From a cultural perspective, and given that we have referred to our own personal experiences, I believe that the transition from dictatorship to democracy in my country was possible because we wanted to be like the other Europeans, and we knew what Europeans were like because of the phenomenon of tourism.
In addition, thanks to the phenomenon of tourism, Spain was able to begin to leave behind poverty and take off towards a new economic horizon.
This would have justified more emphatic treatment in the Treaties, something that did not happen.
Since then, however, new developments have taken place, such as the increase in travel, in new technologies, in life expectancy and in incomes, all of which favour tourism amongst senior citizens.
I would also like to say at this point that I entirely support the proposal MrÂ YÃ¡Ã±ez will make in this field.
I know he has not spoken yet, but he has been kind enough to tell me about it in advance â pure intelligence is what is required.
It has to be recognised that the increase in tourism has caused certain problems in terms of sustainability, ecological balance, physical security, food safety, legal security in the field of delays, non-compliance with contracts, time-sharing and competitiveness.
All of these have been emphasised here.
At this point I would like once again to stress the importance of the issue of value added tax in the special system for travel agencies and the reduced rate, to which Mrs Sudre has referred.
Commissioner, I would like to raise something new which is not in the report, namely compensation from the states of origin to the host states for health services provided by the latter.
I believe this to be an extremely important issue.
I shall end by congratulating my colleague from the bottom of my heart on his wonderful work.
I take my hat off to you, Mr QueirÃ³.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.
Sustainable European tourism can and must help to maintain high and stable levels of economic growth, especially in tourist regions, where it is the basic pillar of economic and social viability.
The tourist industry, which mainly attracts women and young people, substantially strengthens the employment sector and is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Lisbon Strategy.
However, these are highly critical times for the development of tourism on a global scale and this also directly affects our employment policies and competition in the industry, in which thousands of small and medium-sized businesses trade.
Despite the fact that tourism policy falls within the competence of the Member States, the importance of this industry at European level is such that provision needs to be made for a financial heading in the Community budget.
At the same time, better coordination is needed between the Member States so that we are ready and able to effectively meet the new challenges thrown up by changes in tourist trends and by economic and social changes at European and international level.
The basic precondition when designing any tourism policy is an in-depth knowledge of peculiarities and problems at local level.
In order to achieve this, we need to use scientific tools and methods, invest in research and development and create a European network of regional tourism monitoring centres to coordinate and transfer technical know-how.
The response by European tourism to the current competitive challenge must include as a matter of priority competitive tourist businesses which will provide quality services, will not have an impact on the environment and will not change the local culture.
European tourism must respond in a responsible manner, placing the emphasis on the Union's economic and cultural values.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the first point I should like to make is an obvious one, namely that tourism is not directly regulated under EU legislation.
My second point is one that emerges quite clearly from the QueirÃ³ report, namely that we must not sideline, or even disregard entirely, such an important aspect of social, cultural and economic life.
Many arguments have been put forward during todayâs debate in favour of this approach, and I should like to add one more, which in my opinion is of no little significance.
Tourism is also a form of interpersonal communication, since tourists not only visit monuments and tourist attractions, but also, and above all, meet new people they had not previously known.
Any earlier prejudices, negative stereotypes or memories of unfortunate historic events fade away and disappear during the course of such meetings, and in fact personal contact with other people is the only way to change such attitudes.
People who communicate with one another stop being strangers, which is a crucial lesson for the enlarged European Union, and in particular for young people.
I therefore propose that the Socrates and Erasmus programmes be taken as models for the development of tourism schemes for young people.
We should provide them with the opportunity to get to know the whole of Europe, from Spain to Estonia and from Sweden to Malta and Cyprus.
This would promote a much greater degree of mutual understanding than has been the case to date.
I believe that serious work should be put into schemes of this kind, and that neither time nor money should be spared on them.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr QueirÃ³ on his outstanding work and to thank him for being amenable to accepting contributions from various Members of the House.
As I come from Portugal, and from a region, the Autonomous Region of Madeira, in which tourism is one of the main tools for development, it stands to reason that I have a vested interest in supporting this report.
I shall now mention some of the reasons behind my support and my proposals.
In light of its importance at European, national and regional level, of the jobs that it sustains and of the number of businesses, the new technology and the innovation that it fosters, tourism can be considered as one of the areas in which the Lisbon Strategy can be taken forward.
Tourism is also a means of diversifying the economy and of developing rural areas and regions with natural or demographic disadvantages, such as the outermost regions, remote or mountainous regions, and the most northerly, sparsely populated regions.
The EU is the most popular tourist destination in the world and yet EU citizens visit tourist destinations outside the Union in the greatest numbers.
Although tourism remains under the competence of the Member States and their regional and local authorities, it should, however, be subject to EU guidelines, policies and measures.
The Union should support, coordinate and complement the Member States.
There should be greater integration and cohesion amongst the actions of Member States and the Union in relation to tourism.
In order for it to assume its responsibilities as regards tourism, I would suggest that the Commission confer on the Union more effective structures and adequate financial resources in the financial perspective, in order to promote Europe as a destination, and to set up mechanisms designed to foster greater cooperation and exchange of information between the Unionâs structures, the Member States and the regions.
Tourism should remain within European-level parameters whereby environmental protection, regional planning, the training of the work force and cultural traditions are guaranteed if all those responsible carry out their functions.
In the area of the security and the rights of tourists, we feel that take particular account should be taken of ...
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking my colleague Mr QueirÃ³ most warmly for his innovative report.
I am from southern Baden, in the centre of which is the Black Forest and where many important jobs do indeed depend on foreign tourists; this is particularly the case in rural areas, which are doing a successful job of moving from agriculture to the service economy.
I do believe, though, that there are many areas in which we do not necessarily need European rules and regulations, and, unlike many Members, I certainly do not propose to urge you, Commissioner Verheugen, to plan further regulations in this one.
What tourists in Europe need most of all are railways and roads that work.
I do not doubt that they also need airlines, even though some other Members of this House seem less than pleased with that idea.
If we attempt to tackle the synchronisation of holiday arrangements, then we must make the attempt â which we did not do in relation to the sunshine directive, that was made slightly weaker this morning â to make it clear, in the long term and very politely, to the Member States that the directive was conceived in consultation with the interested parties and is not to be seen as something forced upon them by Europe.
Something else that I believe will be of vital importance to Europe is the question of how the safety of facilities for tourists in Europe may be guaranteed.
We have all heard from people who have had adverse experiences in them, and nine of the ten victims of the fatal accident in SÃ¶lden in the Tyrol came from my electoral district.
It seems likely that tourism in Europe will suffer more as a result of accidents like that happening more frequently than from this or that part of the directive not being transposed.
Hence my appeal to you, Commissioner, in the hope that we may be able to take such action in relation to safety as the European Union is able to take, and, moreover, may encourage diversity in European tourism, for therein lies its strength.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr QueirÃ³ warmly on his wonderful report, and I would like to say to the Commissioner: âGÃŒnter, look at paragraph 28 of the report in which we call on the Commission to produce a tourism programme for senior citizens during the low season, to be known as âUlyssesâ.
This programme has existed in Spain for 20 years.
I am referring to the IMSERSO holidays.
Find out about them via your services, because they have been a spectacular successâ.
A programme of this kind has five fundamental objectives.
The first is to improve the quality of life of our senior citizens on low incomes.
Many of them have not had the opportunity to travel, to see the sea and to visit other countries.
Secondly, such a programme must create employment for example in hotels, restaurants, transport facilities that have to shut or drastically reduce their staff in low seasons.
The third objective is to generate demand and growth in the European economy by means of greater activity and consumption.
The fourth involves promoting European citizenship, as in the case of the SOCRATES or ERASMUS programmes amongst young people.
The fifth objective has to do with all this not being an expense but rather an investment, because the Spanish experience demonstrates that the returns exceed the sum budgeted annually by the government by 1.8%. That is only via taxes and social security returns and does not include indirect and inferred returns.
We named the programme âUlyssesâ after the great traveller from Ithaca, but if you like, Commissioner, if it would please you, we will call it the âGÃŒnterâ Programme.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make three points.
First of all, I think this is a very important area.
I come from Finland, so I do not want to make this into a commercial for a mobile phone company, but it is the best way of connecting people.
Karl Deutsch talked about it in the 1930s.
It is a way of crossing borders: if you go to the Algarve, you fall in love with Portugal; if you go to the Marche, you fall in love with Italy; if you go to the Costa del Sol, you might fall in love with Spain, and if you go to Provence, you fall in love with France.
It is as simple as that.
On top of that, we get growth, GDP; 4% of GDP stems from our tourist industry, with sixÂ million people employed and two million SMEs in the sector, so it is a very important and, in many ways, a key area.
Secondly, it is also an area of growth.
There is real growth potential in the services sector.
In that sense, it is an important part of the Lisbon process.
We have an ageing population, a population with more money and more time, a population with more time to travel.
All of that is good.
Thirdly, I support the report that has been produced by my colleague.
It is an excellent report.
One thing I find unfortunate, but the rapporteur could not do anything about it, is that we did not get tourism into the treaty, because the Constitution has not yet entered into force, but I think the system of classification in the report is good.
Finally, I hope that Mr Berlusconi and Mr Chirac read this report and become inspired to travel around Europe and taste different kinds of food.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since May 1 of last year the flow of tourists into the 10 new Member States has shown an impressive increase.
This implies additional budget revenue generation and possibilities to explore and get to know the lesser-known States on the tourist maps, but on the other hand, it poses new challenges.
In our countries we are lucky to have the opportunity to draw upon the experience of the older EU Member States and thus avoid repeating their mistakes.
The growing tourist influx into Central Europe is expected to alleviate the pressure upon the EU regions currently suffocating from the over-abundant flow of tourists.
The tourism infrastructure in the new Member States is still lagging behind that of the old ones, which therefore offers tempting new investment opportunities.
There are abundant untouched natural resources in the Central European States, including Lithuania.
Sustainable tourism is meant to preserve and protect nature, as well as the landscape, urban and rural infrastructure.
Specifically promising areas in Lithuania appear to be rural, cultural, sport and medicinal tourism.
Due to their low prices, these countries are attractive to young people, although the elderly also willingly come to Lithuania because of the healthy local climate.
Tourists show interest in history, but the tragic, historically significant and even complicated events of recent decades should not be trivialized or presented in a Disneyland or kitsch style.
The revision of the Sixth Tax directive with a view to introducing tax relief for incoming tourism is essential for all Member States of the European Union, and the new members in particular.
By reforming the tourism industry, the EU is promoting economic growth and mutual understanding. This will also make a significant contribution toward the elimination of demarcation lines that have continued to divide Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, tourism is a journey and a voyage.
In the past, voyagers were people who went out into the world in order to discover more about it, to learn something and to return home with new experiences and skills.
During their travels across Europe, they also paid visits to the universities.
This led to the emergence of a European identity, an awareness of European values and a Europe of universities, cathedrals and superb artists and craftsmen.
Tourism nowadays has changed into the pursuit of instant pleasure.
I still have frequent occasion to quote the slogan of the French Ski Schools, which says that âpleasure has to be learntâ.
It is only when we make an effort to gain new skills or knowledge that we appreciate them.
Unfortunately, modern tourism is very much like visiting a Europe-wide chain of supermarkets that all subscribe to the same principles, namely to be cheap, easily accessible and preferably identical in the majority of cases.
People now travel at lightning speed.
We have less and less time, and so we devour one tourist attraction after another.
The tourist industry is adapting to this phenomenon by selling as many colour pictures as possible of the sea, the mountains and the swimming pools.
The phrase âtourism creates jobsâ is repeated like a mantra, but the cost of such jobs is frequently the mindless breaking of visitor number records.
The resort or attraction boasting the highest number of visitors is considered to be the best.
This report is important because Europe must promote high-quality tourism and tackle the challenge of mass tourism.
This is especially true because Europe is now lending its backing to the development of regional airports and cheap airlines.
The words âtravelâ and âvoyageâ should regain their original meanings.
Educational programmes must be put in place with a view to protecting the natural environment and historical heritage, and new initiatives are needed to promote sustainable tourism.
We should not forget that love of world heritage, nature and the non-material stems from knowledge of the values of the world that surround us, or in other words from our own âsmall fatherlandsâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to support Mr YÃ¡Ã±ezâs proposal and stress what I believe to be one of the most interesting contributions made in this report, the proposal to create the âUlyssesâ programme.
This is a very positive measure, not only because of what it means in terms of improving the quality of life of senior citizens, but also because of the benefits it may provide for areas of dense tourism, such as the Balearic Islands, the part of Spain from which I originate.
To be able to extend tourist activity beyond the high season means more and better employment for these areas, and diversifies the tourism on offer, since it enables them to receive not just sun and sand tourists but also cultural and environmental ones.
Mr Verheugen, it is very important that in line with the notion of sustainable tourism that is respectful of the land and of the environment and is described in this report, the Commission should promote actions obliging the authorities in tourist areas such as mine to ensure their actions comply with the principles laid out in the document we are discussing.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate on the future of sustainable tourism in the European Union is proving to be highly important and interesting.
It is being held towards the end of the summer tourist season, of which we all have our personal experiences, and it is being held for the first time after the recent accession of ten new Member States to the European Union, which they enhance with their exceptional tourist destinations.
In addition, with Mr QueirÃ³'s report, this is the first time that the multifaceted nature of economic activity in tourism has been presented, together with its repercussions throughout the spectrum of the economy, society, natural and cultural resources and mutual acquaintance between nations.
It is highly satisfactory that the European Commission â as the Commissioner said â is targeting the leading role which European tourism can play in the future.
However, particular attention and a serious strategy are needed for this, because we must not forget that the increase in tourism in the European Union in the first half of 2005 was just 5%, compared with 17% in the Middle East as a whole and around 10% in the United States.
I should therefore like to emphasise in particular the added value which the European Union can bring to the policies of the Member States.
Apart from the development of secure transport at national and trans-European level, other proposals contained in the report are also extremely important.
I refer to cooperation and coordination on the conditions of entry of third-country nationals, cooperation on the flow of tourists in the high season, in order to overcome the imbalance between areas which are literally drowning and others which are seeking to attract tourists, on the promotion of tourist programmes such as the 'Ulysses' programme, on educational exchanges and mobility, so that we have certification of professional qualifications and, also, on the structured projection of Europe as a tourist destination with diversity and, of course, on the budget line for tourism in the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate MrÂ QueirÃ³ on his report and on the splendidly cooperative manner in which it was brought into being.
It is, indeed, a very welcome development that an opinion on sustainable tourism should be worked out at European level.
In the knowledge that most measures must be taken by the Member States, we have to establish that there are problems that Europe should take to heart.
Tourism is, after all, a very important sector for the European public and also for our European economy.
This is an ambitious report and that is why I am interested to know whether the Commissioner would like to say something about it and with which proposals and measures the Commission would actually like to tackle the job.
This is not only a task for the Commission but also for the Council, for the report appeals to the Council to speed up the decision-making process on the reduced VAT rate.
I have made out a case for this, because the reduced VAT rate is crucial for the tourism industry.
Very many jobs hinge on it and the VAT rate should remain low for hotels in all Member States on a permanent basis.
They should also be able to apply in a structured way reduced VAT rates for restaurants.
It is unfortunate that the Council is not present, because I was actually very interested to see whether it expects to reach agreement on this by the end of this year.
It may be possible for the Commissioner to comment on the report, and perhaps we as Parliament and Commission should bring more pressure to bear on the Council to finally force it into taking a decision, for these proposals are very important for employment, particularly in this economic climate.
I endorse the request for quality indicators for the tourism industry, provided, though, that we fully utilise that industryâs expertise.
Finally, let me say that this excellent report by MrÂ QueirÃ³ illustrates why our committee is not called âCommittee on Transport and Tourismâ for nothing.
Â Â  Mr President, tourism is a real growth area across much of Europe; it is, above all, a sector that still relies on workers rather than machines, and that makes it an integral part of our Lisbon Strategy.
We have not abandoned hope that there will be real action about this strategy rather than just even more talk.
One thing I would particularly press the Commission to look at is something that is a matter of fundamental concern to my own country.
As is well known, Austria is a holiday destination both in summer and in winter, and year by year, season by season, we have the same experience of a few weeks when the hotels and guesthouses are full up and there is gridlock on the streets.
A lot of things would be easier to handle a couple of weeks later â that is, assuming the tourists were still there.
If nations and regions â and here I am also thinking of the principal works holidays in your own country, Mr Vice-President, as well as in the Netherlands and in Belgium â were to synchronise their holidays better, it would have an enormous effect on Central Europe and would, in particular, really take the load off the tourist industry and offer it new opportunities.
What we need here is not direction from on high or from Brussels, but we have learned, not least from the debates on the European Constitution, that a lot can be done by means of the coordination method, if it is taken seriously and handled properly.
With that in mind, Commissioner, we can do no other than wish you much success and hope that European holidays will soon be better synchronised, that the tourism sector will grow and that tourists will benefit.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, sustainability concerns every one of us.
It is of course not only an ecological, but also an economic matter.
We must seek to enable enterprises to survive, and taxation is only one aspect of this; it is also important that enterprises be enabled to invest for the future, so as to create a sustainable supply of investment that is also reflected in global competitiveness.
For this reason, I welcome the initiative in the Committee on Budgets by MrÂ Mulder â a specialist in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises â together with the European Investment Fund, aimed in particular at the provision, in future, of equity loans and other guarantees, the intention being to make sure that the risk and investment capital in tourism enterprises is secure in the long term, too, with a view to their sustainability.
The fact is that negative equity is one of the main problems facing the tourism sector; a great many enterprises are going bankrupt, with the loss of large numbers of jobs.
The debate on Basel II is imminent, and that debate, in particular, is a matter of life and death for tourism.
After all, liquidity is a matter of life and death for every enterprise.
I would therefore urge the Commissioner to keep up his commitment, particularly as regards the relevant programme for small and medium-sized enterprises.
He has already done an exemplary job in this regard and, if we keep up the good work, we can succeed in doing what is best for tourism.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will take away from this debate a great many very important ideas and, above all, the impression of broad agreement on your part that tourism represents a dynamo for growth for Europeâs future, and must be given a higher profile in European policy as a whole.
For this reason, it has already been agreed that a European Tourism Forum is to be held in Malta in October, where I shall be unveiling the key elements of the Commissionâs future tourism policy.
In addition, as I have already told your Committee, there are plans to present, early next year, a fundamental review of EU tourism policy to date in the form of a new strategy.
I shall gladly incorporate into this all the ideas â and there have been very, very many of them â that I have been able to draw from todayâs debate.
I should just like to make one very clear qualification, which is that I am unable to raise the hopes of those speakers who, this afternoon, have called for protectionism, interventionism or subsidies.
The Commissionâs ideas will be far removed from any form of State intervention, State protection or, particularly, of subsidy.
We shall most definitely not be launching a new subsidised sector, but instead shall create framework conditions using all the instruments we have for supporting the framework conditions for an economic sector.
I should like to state equally clearly that I shall never accept the assertion that it is the Commissionâs job to set up a âtourism and the elderlyâ programme.
If the tourism industry believes it should be doing something special for the elderly, then it should be so good as to do that itself; the Commission, at any rate, will not.
We can propose it, but we shall not take upon ourselves those things that the tourism industry should be doing.
Instead, we shall ensure that the tourism industry enjoys conditions conducive to development.
It is for people themselves to run their own businesses; that is a function we shall most certainly not be taking from them.
I think that we shall come to agree on this principle, and also, most certainly, on the principle that we do not wish to take the retrograde step of calling for more and more European rules, standards and regulations.
I really was rather astonished this afternoon to hear the call for large numbers of new European rules, and my answer to this is an unambiguous ânoâ.
For the Commissionâs part, at least, there will be no European standards for hotels, inns or coaches.
The last thing the Commission needs is to have to take on thousands of testers and send them to Europeâs restaurants to determine whether certain minimum standards of quality stipulated by the Commission ...
Yes, you did say that, and my reply is a clear ânoâ.
Let the tourism industry agree on its own quality requirements.
Where safety is concerned, however, it is a different matter; the appropriate arrangements are in place for this, but arranging and imposing quality standards in certain economic sectors is a matter for the sector itself rather than for the public legislator.
I would also ask that Parliament finally show some consistency on this, and not criticise the Commission for excessive interference in economic matters, whilst at the same time repeatedly demanding that we take the industryâs tasks upon ourselves.
This difference of opinion notwithstanding, though, I think that this debate has revealed a good deal of common ground, and I am quite sure that we shall succeed in arriving at a forward-looking common policy on tourism.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â I should like to congratulate MrÂ QueirÃ³ on his excellent report.
I shall confine myself to some brief thoughts.
For years now we have all been aware of the important part played by tourism in developing local economies and creating jobs, especially for women and young people.
The European Conference on Tourism and Employment, organised by the Luxembourg Presidency in November 1997, showed âthe pulling power that tourism exercises on young people and women, to whom it often offers a first job opportunityâ.
For that reason as well, we in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully support the call for the Commission and the Council, when adopting the structural policy instruments for 2007-2013, to provide for an integrated approach to tourism, âallowing the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Regional Development Fund actions to be coordinatedâ.
A further aspect that I must underline, which is something totally new, is the reference to itinerant tourism, represented particularly by camper vans and caravans.
This is effectively a segment of the tourist industry that is active 365 days a year and contributes to employment growth in the sector.
In lean times, that is no bad thing!
This segment therefore needs measures to encourage its development.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0330/2005).
We shall examine a whole series of questions to the Council.
The EU's revised services offer in the Doha negotiations provides additional opportunities with regard to the movement of âhighly qualified natural personsâ or âservice providersâ which would allow persons from third countries to travel to the EU to provide services for a limited period of time.
Can the Council provide a clearer definition of the term âhighly qualified natural personsâ or âservice providersâ and what is the Council's view in terms of the major repercussions this may have on the professional sectors of the developing countries and the LDCs?
Â Â  . It is a pleasure to be here once again to answer on behalf of the Council.
I shall await the judgement Members of this House on whether it is a pleasure for them.
In response to Mr Karim's question, a dynamic service sector is critical for the prosperity for any modern economy.
No country, developed or developing, can prosper without one.
It is therefore vital that we strive for an ambitious deal on services within the Doha development agenda negotiations.
The European Union's revised services offer, tabled in Geneva in early June, contains a significant number of new commitments, including the 'mode 4' commitments which allow people to travel to the European Union to provide services for a short time.
Under the terms of these commitments, overseas companies, with a contract to provide services in 21 important designated sectors, will be able to send skilled employees to the European Union to provide these services for up to six months at a time.
As Mr Karim's question highlights, the contractual service suppliers in these cases must be skilled persons who enter the European Union for the purpose of providing a service associated with a services contract in certain defined economic areas.
'Skilled' means they possess a university degree or its equivalent and have the necessary professional qualifications to practise in the European Union.
They must also have at least three years' professional experience, or six years for independent professionals.
In all such cases, European Union and national working conditions, minimum wage requirements and collective wage agreements will apply.
European Union Member States will also continue to be able to refuse entry to persons that pose a security threat or are considered to be at risk of abusing the terms of their entry.
Â Â  The Minister can rest assured that this Parliament is equally as pleased as he is that he is here again today.
Will the Council do anything to promote well-ordered international labour migration and, in turn, encourage EU Member States to set up mechanisms and provide incentives so that the expertise and experience gained by the service providers from the developing countries and LDCs can be applied in developing countries with under-serviced regions?
Â Â  . I am grateful for the gracious words of Mr Karim, the questioner, and I hope his faith in my performance will be vindicated in the minutes to come.
On the more general question that he raises, as we meet today in this Parliament, the European Union Summit with India is taking place.
The Indian subcontinent is one place where skilled migrant labour is already proving to be of mutual benefit.
I have had the opportunity to travel to Bangalore and meet many of the service providers who are benefiting from the present proposals.
I heard directly from the Indians that they considered there was genuine mutual benefit in having their employees working for a period either in the European Union or in North America.
In Silicon Valley, for example, highly-skilled software engineers educated either in the United States or in India were able to gain experience in the United States and then either stay and continue to develop commercial contacts between the United States and India or return to India and establish businesses, which in turn do business with developed countries such as the United States.
So I can assure you this is a far wider issue than simply the answer I provided on mode 4.
It is a matter about which there is much discussion, not least on the close commercial ties that can be established between less-developed countries and the European Union.
I am optimistic that there can be genuine mutual benefit both for the countries providing the workers and for the European Union, which benefits from their skills and expertise.
Â Â  I too am very pleased to have MrÂ Alexander here among us.
I would just like to point out to him that we are not at Westminster.
Could he wait until he is given the floor, for the time it takes to complete the translations for everyone?
This is by no means âQuestion Timeâ.
That will come perhaps when we all have the same language in the European Union but, for the time being, everyone must have time to listen to your answers and to the questions posed.
MrÂ RÃŒbig had a supplementary question.
Â Â  â I should be interested to hear whether the modeÂ 4 commitments also entail the security risk being assessed according to uniform standards in future.
Will the Council be producing a definition of what is meant by âsecurity riskâ?
Â Â  . I am grateful for your guidance, Mr President.
I certainly would not be as contentious in my appearance in Parliament today to suggest that there should be a single language for the European Union.
In many ways our diversity has proved to be our strength in recent years.
On the important point that the questioner raised in relation to security, of course there has to be concern given to whether we have specific strategic interests.
That extends beyond simply the question of labour and individual workers, to cover broader questions.
Before appearing in Parliament today, I read of the concerns over cyber-spying, which is now regrettably a feature of the modern world in which we live.
It is essential, not just in our internal discussions but also in taking a broader view of this issue, to have an important and necessary regard for the security questions that the Member raised.
Â Â  As regards a single language, the key issue would be to know what language that would be.
Let us avoid that debate for the time being.
Mr Martin had a supplementary question.
Â Â  President-in-Office, to give effect to your mode 4 proposals, which I welcome, would the Council consider encouraging the Commission to create a database for the whole of the European Union that companies and countries from outside the EU could access, so they could identify potential skills shortfalls and opportunities to provide services?
This would extend the benefits from such access to include poorer developing countries, as well as countries that already have good intelligence about what is going on in the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a fellow Scot, along with the questioner, I will resist the temptation to discuss the closeness of relations between the Scottish people and the French people over many centuries and instead direct myself to the question that was asked.
I will certainly be happy to pass on to the Commission the point of view that was communicated to me this afternoon in relation to the merits of a database.
In my discussions previously with, for example, the Indian trade minister, the urgency and importance of progress on mode 4 as part of the wider Doha Development Round was impressed upon me.
The question is whether the European Union's institutions are best placed to be aware of the constantly changing commercial opportunities available in a rapidly changing commercial sector.
None the less, I am happy to give the undertaking that I will pass on that suggestion to the Commission.
Does the UK Government strongly support the need for an EU 'Third pillar' data protection framework to safeguard individual privacy through for example purpose restrictions, when information is accessed by intelligence and law enforcement agencies on a cross-border basis, or does it regard the 25 national regimes as sufficient, as a Home Office Minister has suggested (House of Lords European Union Committee Report 'After Madrid: the EU's Response to terrorism', 5th report 2004 - 5, evidence page 128 - 141)?
Â Â  . The Presidency is waiting for the Commission to introduce its proposals for a framework decision laying down data protection rules in the third pillar.
As soon as the proposal is formally introduced, the Presidency will ensure that it is discussed by the appropriate Council body and forwarded to the European Parliament in accordance with Article 39 of the Treaty on European Union.
Â Â  . That is a staggering reply, because it did not answer the question at all.
We all know it is going to be introduced and we all know the Council and Parliament will discuss it, so you have told us absolutely nothing.
What you were actually asked, if you will read the question please, is whether the Government supports an EU regime or, as suggested by one of your Government ministers in the House of Lords last year, the 25 national regimes.
Which is it?
Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, told Parliament when he introduced the British Presidency, 'I am a passionate pro-European'.
He did not say another word back in the United Kingdom about it.
Is this a case of being two-faced, saying one thing here and nothing back home?
Tell us the truth!
Â Â  . I should like to thank the Member for the characteristic grace with which he has directed his question towards me.
It is not a question of being two-faced, but simply â and I hope he appreciates this point as a passionate European â a due regard for my position today, which is not to speak for the UK Government, but instead to represent the position of the Presidency of the European Union.
Â Â  â I agree with MrÂ NewtonÂ Dunn.
I, too, am disappointed with the non-answer the President-in-Office has just given us.
The British Presidency is very well aware of the difficulty of combating organised crime.
That is why we are anxiously waiting to see something done about it once and for all: after all, crime has become globalised, and so that is what the fight against international terrorism and international crime needs to be too.
Â Â  . I have been questioned on two substantive points in supplementary questions.
The first supplementary question asked, 'have I read the question?'
I can assure you I have, and it specifically and explicitly states, 'does the UK Government strongly support the need for an EU third pillar data protection framework?' It goes on to elaborate on that point.
I merely reiterate for clarity that my responsibilities today are to discharge my duties on behalf of the Presidency, rather than to articulate the national position of the United Kingdom Government.
It would be a disservice to this Parliament were I to do anything else.
However, I think anybody who was present in this Chamber this morning and had the opportunity to hear the UK Home Secretary speak, again on behalf of the Presidency, in relation to data protection measures, would have a very clear understanding as to the importance that we attach to the service that can be provided by data protection measures, and the need for a transnational approach to tackling not just issues such as people trafficking and organised crime, but also the pressing threat of international terrorism.
When will the Council next have an opportunity to vote on changing its rules of procedure to provide for it to meet in public when it deliberates on draft legislative acts?
Â Â  . On 23 June 2005, the United Kingdom's Prime Minister stated in this Chamber that, in the view of the Presidency, there is a strong case for increased Council transparency, but this is something we need to discuss with all Member States.
As the Presidency, we have not made any formal proposals at this time.
We are still considering measures and will be consulting with partners in due course, because, as I am sure the honourable Members will appreciate, this is not a matter that is entirely in the gift of the Presidency.
Â Â  That was not a bad answer!
I can vouch for some satisfaction with that.
Does the Presidency-in-Office accept that the British Government, in some four months' time, will be coming back, trying to point to achievements during its period of holding the Presidency of the European Union?
Does the Minister accept that to be able to look at an example of having spread openness and transparency and having enhanced the ability of national parliaments to hold ministers to account would be quite a significant achievement?
Â Â  . I thank the questioner for his gracious remarks on my initial answer.
Let me elaborate on that answer.
As I said, the position of the British Government was stated by our Prime Minister and the strong case for increased Council transparency is clearly recognised.
However, there is further work to be done, not least because a balance has to be struck between what I think are understandable objectives and desires on the part of the British Government and several other Member States and due regard for the decision by the European Council in June that a pause for reflection was necessary, following the decisive decisions in the Dutch and French referenda.
As I said, I would not seek to close down the discussion that will no doubt take place in light of the correspondence in the London yesterday.
I merely offer what I think should be regarded as a holding reply while consideration is given as to the best way forward.
Â Â  President-in-Office, I appreciate that this issue is very sensitive and I understand very well that the decision must be taken unanimously.
However, what is the position of other Member States in the Council?
Perhaps some of them would agree that, in some special cases, it would be possible to meet in public.
Â Â  . I am grateful for this supplementary question.
The acknowledgement of the sensitivity of this issue is a helpful one.
The question alluded to the fact that there may be division within the members of the Council as regards how far and how quickly we are able to proceed.
Therefore, it is appropriate that, as the Presidency, we recognise the case and the strength of the case that was put so volubly in at the beginning of this week, but seek to work collaboratively at this stage, rather than making unilateral declarations.
We are cognizant of our responsibilities and it would be to the disadvantage of everyone if division was to become the hallmark of this discussion, if there is an opportunity for moving forward together.
Â Â  â In this question on openness and transparency I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer.
However, there is also another question, about Strasbourg itself.
We are the only parliament in the world that has no say over where it sits.
Can the President-in-Office comment on whether the Council will deliberate whether we can have our meetings solely in Brussels and not have to come to Strasbourg?
Â Â  . I am not sure whether the question of the location of the European Parliament is judged more contentious or less contentious than the suggestion that there should be a single language for the European Union, but suffice it to say that I will tread cautiously in replying to this question.
I can assure you that I was asked a very similar question on the floor of the House of Commons by one of my Conservative colleagues, who asked whether, in light of our Prime Minister's speech to this Parliament, we were minded to consider a more efficient approach to the location of the European Parliament as a first step in negotiating the future financing of the EU.
I have already been accused of not answering one question.
I can assure you that I did not answer that question in the House of Commons either.
I believe it is fair to say that there has been a long-standing debate on this matter and the position of Member State governments has been very clear for some time.
I have to say, however, that I have listened very carefully to the point that the questioner made.
She is certainly not the only Member of the European Parliament who has forcibly put this point to me on this visit.
Â Â  That is undoubtedly true.
It is the case that we can debate the number of EU languages, but as regards the treaties, I believe that there is only one single version.
Each and everyone one of us therefore lives with it, whatever our nationality may be.
Â Â  Question No 4 is withdrawn
In statements made to the Turkish press on 27 June 2005, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr GÃŒl, expressly ruled out the possibility of the Turkish Government recognising the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate and made it clear that the issue of the Halki School of Theology was being examined on the basis of current Turkish law, which meant that the School would not be re-opening.
In the light of the European Council's conclusions of December 2004 and the Commission's announcements of December 2004 concerning Turkey's progress, which contained an express reference to the religious rights of the non-Muslim communities, what is the Council's reaction to these statements by Mr GÃŒl?
Â Â  . I have not yet read Foreign Minister Gul's statement in full but, under the revised Accession Partnership adopted in May 2003, Turkey is required to establish conditions for the functioning of non-Muslim religious communities which are in line with the practice of European Union Member States.
However, as the European Commission indicated in its 2004 Regular Report, non-Muslim religious communities, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continue to encounter obstacles.
Serious problems, in particular the legal status of non-Muslim communities, property registration and training of clergy, remain to be solved.
New legislation, needed in order to remedy these difficulties, is still in preparation.
In this context, a draft law on foundations is currently pending in the Turkish Parliament.
The Turkish authorities have invited and received comments from the Commission on this draft and the Union expects the Commission's comments to be seriously considered.
As the honourable Member of Parliament is well aware, the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004, when reviewing whether Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria to open accession negotiations, clearly stated that the Union would continue to monitor closely progress of the political reforms in Turkey.
I can assure the honourable Member that the Council continues to do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, the refusal by the British President-in-Office of the Council to comment months after the event on MrÂ Abdullah Gul's specific declaration, in which he refuses to recognise the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate and the reopening of the Chalkis Seminary, makes a very bad impression on me.
Given that there is a clear common position on this matter, both from the European Parliament and the Commission and all the churches, I ask you directly MrÂ Alexander:
Is this continuing refusal on the part of the Turkish leadership a retraction from the Copenhagen criteria, yes or no?
I ask you please for a clear answer at long last.
Â Â  . With the greatest respect, I shall choose my own words on what is an issue of great interest but also of great controversy.
I think it is fair to draw attention to the clearly stated position of the European Parliament on the opening of accession talks with Turkey and the decision reached, as I explained, in the European Council.
It also has to be borne in mind that discussions are currently under way through the Permanent Representatives of Council members, ahead of what we anticipate to be the opening of accession talks, if that process is taken forward, on 3 October.
You have to understand the issue of Turkey in the broader context of what has been set out by the Commission in relation to not just the Copenhagen criteria, but the broader criteria for enlargement.
At the recent Gymnich meeting that took place in the United Kingdom, Commissioner Rehn made clear that there were really three fundamentals that needed to be recognised in relation to enlargement: firstly, consolidation, secondly, conditionality and thirdly, communication.
I would merely state, in relation to Turkey, that there is a very clear understanding, as I sought to convey in my answer, on the issue of conditionality.
The opening of accession talks would represent not the end of that process, but the beginning of a much longer one.
I think that, as the question showed, the way forward is not to identify a particular statement by one individual or another, but instead to uphold the important and rigorous process of conditionality which is expected not just for any prospective member aspiring to join the European Union, but which should apply to every potential candidate for accession.
Given the interest in this matter, I am confident that Turkey will undergo this process in the weeks, months and, indeed, years to come.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether religious freedom in Turkey meets European human rights standards.
Â Â  . Our standard of human rights is set down in the Copenhagen criteria.
In that sense, the obligations which any candidate country has to meet are set out objectively and I hope, in the view of this Parliament, independently.
It is therefore important that the Commission and others be given the opportunity to take forward that process of rigorous assessment, but I am cognisant of the strength of feeling, both within certain Member States and among representatives here in this Parliament.
That is why we need to uphold the integrity of the process as we seek to move this particular dossier forward.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, I, too, would like to ask a question about this.
Over the last year, we have all seen serious abuses of human rights â and of womenâs rights, in particular â continuing to occur in Turkey.
That is why I insist that the President-in-Office answer the question as to whether the Presidency is prepared, in future, to discuss not only full membership, but also a different form of accession or association: a privileged partnership, for example.
Â Â  . I am fully aware of the long-standing interest in, and concern about, the issue of Turkey expressed by certain representatives in this Parliament.
While I am respectful of the views that they hold, I would respectfully remind them of the decision both of this Parliament and, indeed, of the European Council on the issue of opening accession talks on 3 October â recognising, of course, the work that is presently under way.
On the specific points that were raised: firstly, in relation to women's rights, a package of major constitutional amendments was passed in May that confirms the equality between men and women.
The new penal code significantly strengthens women's rights, removing sentence reductions for honour killings and abolishing the article that enabled rapists to escape jail if they married their victim.
I understand that the Turkish Parliament has agreed to set up a 15-member commission to investigate honour killings in Turkey, looking at the causes and possible preventative measures.
I am sure that is a matter which would find widespread support and would be welcomed by many Members of this Parliament.
On the broader issue of religious minorities, which was the genesis of the question: it is also worth bearing in mind that the head of the Syrian Orthodox Church in Istanbul has said that, as a result of European Union harmonisation reforms, his community has found it easier to worship, and that attitudes towards them have changed in recent months.
How does the British Presidency assess the current state of progress of preparations for Croatia's accession to the EU, and what steps are now planned, and within what time frame?
Â Â  . â The Council appreciates the keen interest that honourable Members are taking in the question of Croatia's preparations for accession.
As for the next steps, the Council reiterated on 13 June 2005 that the intergovernmental conference to launch accession negotiations with Croatia will be convened by common agreement, as soon as the Council has established that Croatia is cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia â ICTY.
As the Member is aware, a high-level task force has been set up with the specific objective of examining, in close contact with ICTY and the Croatian authorities, the measures taken and to be taken by Croatia with a view to reaching full cooperation with ICTY.
In this context, Croatia has presented an action plan.
In her letter to the Presidency, dated 7 June 2005, the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, noted that, by implementing its action plan, Croatia was on the road to full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal but that more time was required to determine whether these further efforts had produced tangible results.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, I did not ask you what happened in May or June; I know that already.
I asked you what the Council Presidency was planning for the coming weeks.
Specifically, will there be another General Council before 3Â October to deal with the commencement of accession negotiations with Croatia?
Secondly, how does the Council propose to keep the democratically-elected European Parliament informed about the work of the task force?
Is this task force actually working at all, or is it only being used to block the accession negotiations?
Â Â  . Let me seek to complete the story I began in my initial answer and hopefully address the points that the Member raised.
In June the Council took note of this new element â that is, the task force â with satisfaction and encouraged Croatia to continue with its efforts in that direction.
Indeed, the Council committed itself to continuing its examination of this dossier in July and, under the United Kingdom Presidency, the Council therefore considered this issue at its meeting on 18 July, following the task force meeting a week earlier.
At the Gymnich just this week, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw made a commitment to seeking a further report from the Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal.
It will be in light of that report that the task force will meet again in September.
I cannot at this stage anticipate the conclusions of the task force.
The Council will, however, then discuss the matter further in light of the task force's conclusions.
Â Â  â When comparing the conditions for Turkeyâs accession with those imposed on Croatia, do you not see any difference in the treatment of these two States?
It is totally unfair to impose an individual condition on Croatia and thereby postpone the negotiations.
In the light of the kind of problems currently being experienced with Turkey as regards its human rights situation and its past, what is being demanded here is a monstrous injustice.
I really would ask you to keep to the rules of the European Union and apply the same standard to both of them.
Â Â  . With the greatest of respect to the questioner, I find there is a curious connection between the first part and second part of his question, in the sense that I can assure him that there is an honest endeavour on the part of the Council to uphold the rules and that is exactly what we are seeking to do in the case of Croatia.
Although I recognise that opinion in this Parliament is divided on the issue of Croatian accession, there can surely be few of us who would deny that upholding the international rule of law is one of the tenets of the European Union.
In that regard it is important that Croatia is recognised to have upheld international law and its clear obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal under international law, not just in the interests of the Union but also in the more general interests of all of us who wish to see international law upheld within the western Balkans generally.
It is also important that, at a critical time, we do not collectively resile from the very clear position on the steps Croatia needs to take.
I find it curious, as a British Minister standing here on behalf of the Presidency, that implicit in the questions is a suggestion that Britain is somehow averse to the accession of a country such as Croatia, given Britain's longstanding commitment to enlargement and our determination that Croatia should be able to take its place within the European Union in due course.
The bar to that is simply the fact that it is obliged to uphold the international obligations as set out by the International Criminal Tribunal.
That is why I am keen to emphasise today that the ball is primarily in the court of the Croatian Government and I am hopeful that, in light of the taskforce work that is being undertaken at the moment, we will see further progress in Croatia that will allow accession to move forward expeditiously.
Â Â  I warmly welcome that last reply from the President-in-Office.
Of course Croatia should not enter into negotiations with the EU until it complies with the International Criminal Tribunal's conditions.
But will he accept that this is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition and that Croatia also has to address the question of the Krajina Serbs and other major issues before we can enter into detailed negotiations about membership?
Â Â  . As I have sought to suggest in previous answers I have given in the course of this Question Time, there are objective criteria which are set down for all potential candidate countries seeking membership of the European Union.
They apply as much to Croatia as they would to any other potential Member State of the European Union.
However, I would emphasise that, on this particular issue, which has attracted so much attention, Croatia's obligations are very clear, as is the opportunity that is available to Croatia if it meets those obligations in relation to the International Criminal Tribunal.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in this Houseâs Rules of Procedure, Rule 166(2) states that âa request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speakâ.
My request to speak is therefore perfectly justified.
I should like to make a request to speak regarding RuleÂ 109 âQuestion Timeâ, paragraphÂ 4 of which makes reference to AnnexÂ II.
PointÂ 4 under âSupplementary questionsâ in AnnexÂ II reads as follows: âEach Member may follow up the reply with a supplementary question to any question.
He may put in all two supplementary questions.â
I have the Italian version, too, which says the same.
If the official who has been constantly gesturing to me that I am not entitled to put a second supplementary question has this point checked by the competent authorities, he will find that I am indeed entitled to do so under the current Rules of Procedure, subject to your consent pursuant to pointÂ 6(a) of AnnexÂ II.
Â Â  We will, in fact, leave it to the relevant services to interpret this question.
All the same, I, for my part, read in the annex to the Rules of Procedure concerning Question Time that it is recommended, as regards supplementary questions, that, as a general rule, the President should allow one supplementary question from the questioner and one or, at the most, two supplementary questions put by Members belonging ideally to a political group and/or Member State different from that of the author of the main question.
It seems to me that to give an even more generous interpretation of this recommendation would lead us to profoundly alter the spirit of Question Time, which is designed to have a certain tempo and to enable a large number of questions to be put.
It is not a matter of allowing those MEPs who might wish to do so to conduct a general policy debate.
Let us take the example of Croatia.
There might be 15 or 20 of you here who wish to proceed with the supplementary questions on Croatia, which would result in the subsequent questions from other MEPs never being put.
It is in order to avoid that that the regulation was devised in such a way.
MrÂ Ebner, you have said what you have said.
The question has been sent to the relevant services.
You will receive a more official response; however, I believe that the spirit of Question Time is extremely clear.
Following the appointment of a new Director of EUROPOL, the positive impression made at his appearance before MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee in June 2005, and a positive visit by MEPs to the EUROPOL Headquarters in April 2005, can the Council give details of how it views the future cooperation between EUROPOL and the EU Institutions?
Does the Council believe that current accountability arrangements between EUROPOL and the EU institutions are fully transparent?
Â Â  . The Presidency was encouraged by Max-Peter Ratzel, the new director of Europol's positive meeting with the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs back in June.
We are working with both the European Parliament and Europol to improve the exchange of information between the two institutions.
The Presidency is fully committed to making the system of accountability as transparent as possible.
As Members of this House will know, Europol is directly funded by Member States and is directly accountable to Member States via the Europol management board and indeed the Council of Ministers.
However, the Presidency hopes that Mr Ratzel will soon return to the European Parliament for further discussions.
Â Â  In contrast to Mr Newton Dunn earlier, I am more than happy and satisfied with that answer.
Could the President-in-Office amplify or underline what Charles Clarke has been saying over the past couple of days, that in order fully to deal with terrorism, with cross-border crime â a far more difficult task than it at first seems to the general public â we must attempt to promote a Europol that functions to its true potential and operates as transparently as possible within the rules, within the new directive â which you have rightly said is an efficient and good addition to Europol â so that we can attack terrorism at its roots as well as organised crime?
Â Â  . I am grateful for those generous words by the questioner, and I would be happy to give him the affirmation of the point that he made in relation to MrÂ Charles Clarke's speech earlier today here in this Chamber.
If I was to identify a single area where I found myself in absolute agreement on this issue with the Home Secretary, it was when he recognised that it is by greater cooperation, not by seeking to put up walls between us, that, collectively within the European Union, we will be able to meet the challenge of the truly transnational nature, not just of the issues of people trafficking or drug trafficking, but also of organised crime and the challenge of terrorism.
What the Home Secretary was able to communicate in this Chamber today was the deep-seated belief within the UK Government â and, indeed, of the Presidency â that it is only by the kind of effective cooperation that we continue to support within Europol that we will be able truly to harness the potential of all the law enforcement agencies across Europe as, collectively, we strive to meet the challenge posed by the kind of threats that I have outlined in the course of my answer.
The Colombian government has recently passed a law through Congress, with the resounding support of Members with links to paramilitary groups, guaranteeing paramilitaries de facto impunity and thus also enabling known drug traffickers to escape justice.
This law has been strongly criticised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' representative in Colombia and by all human rights organisations.
At Cartagena the European Union, and the United Kingdom in particular, made it clear that the continuation of aid to Colombia was conditional upon a legal framework for the demobilisation of paramilitaries.
What stance does the Council intend to adopt towards the Colombian government following its decision in support of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity and which represents a serious attack on the rights of victims to secure truth, justice and compensation?
Does the Council believes that it can continue to encourage police cooperation with a country that makes such generous concessions to known terrorists and drug traffickers?
Â Â  .
The Council has been informed of initial reactions to the justice and peace law by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who drew attention to insufficiencies of the law as concerns impunity, provisions on investigating heinous crimes and due restitutions or reparations for victims.
To prepare a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the situation by the Council, European Union Heads of Mission were asked to produce for September a considered analysis of the law and recommendations for the European Union's policy, taking into account the Council conclusions of December 2004.
In this context, they will consult widely, including the government, civil society, the group of 24 and the United Nations.
As concerns police cooperation, the Council is convinced that training police in Colombia in accordance with the values and standards of the European Union will contribute to security and greater respect for human rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer seems very vague to me and puts off a decision .
What we have here is a law that in practice regularises paramilitaries, offering organised criminals and drug traffickers the possibility of turning themselves into paramilitaries and thus taking advantage of this law. By the way, the law was also severely criticised by Amnesty International, which says that the demilitarisation and demobilisation have not actually taken place.
I therefore call for an extremely specific answer on the matter of funding: does the European Union still intend to finance this kind of project, which formally aims at demobilisation, whereas in actual fact it ends up providing support for the paramilitary groups?
Â Â  . I have listened carefully to the terms of the questioner's supplementary.
I would respectfully suggest that if he is concerned about and desirous of a thorough answer, then that rather vindicates the point that I sought to make in terms of the need for EU heads of mission to prepare a very thorough statement in terms of what should inform the European Union's decision-making process.
Of course it is the case that the Union is committed to helping Colombia to resolve inter-related problems of internal armed conflict, trade in illegal drugs and human rights abuses about which he is rightly concerned.
The Council conclusions back in December underlined the importance of the establishment of a proper legal framework that addresses the issues of truth, justice and reparation for the victims of that armed conflict.
However, I would reiterate the point I made in my initial answer, that we have a responsibility, given the need and seriousness of the issues that the questioner raised, to make sure that our decisions are informed by a thorough analysis of the true situation in Colombia at the moment.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether he agrees with the statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers of the European Union, Mr Solana, in support of the peace efforts by President Uribe in Colombia, and whether he believes that the laying down of arms by people responsible for horrendous crimes, such as the paramilitaries, is good or bad news.
I would also like to know whether he is of the opinion that a decision taken by a democratically-elected body, such as the Colombian Parliament, could be illegitimate.
Â Â  . I am aware that the European Union could be more formally involved through timely political endorsement for the ongoing peace process to which the honourable Member referred.
But that would take place once the Colombian Government has set out a comprehensive legal framework.
This position has not changed and the Union is currently studying carefully the new Colombian legislation, the 'Justice and Peace Law' agreed in late June, to gauge whether these conditions have now been met.
Â Â  President-in-Office, in dealing with a sovereign government, is it not important, unlike the initial questioner, to always keep a sense of balance?
In that regard, has the Council yet discussed and acted upon the disgraceful fact that three convicted international terrorists, who are fugitives from justice in Colombia, are now enjoying sanctuary in a European Union Member State, namely the Republic of Ireland?
Is the Council content with this situation and, if not, what action is proposed?
Â Â  . In the course of my replies to questioners this afternoon, I have already been clear as to the distinction that is appropriately drawn between those matters for which a reply can reasonably be expected from the Presidency and those matters which instead lie within the domain of individual Member State governments.
The case to which the honourable Member refers, the so-called Colombia three, is a matter between the Irish Government and the Colombian Government.
It is for the Irish authorities to pursue any extradition request with the Colombian Government if that is what they choose to do, but it is essentially a matter for the Irish authorities.
In that regard, I think that is all it would be appropriate for me to say at this stage.
Will the UK Presidencyâs priority of better regulation include a drive to ensure a level regulatory playing field throughout the EU to eliminate the regulatory asymmetry that is beginning to develop in sectors such as the postal sector?
With wide discrepancies in the independence and effectiveness of national regulatory authorities, what initiatives is the Presidency planning to ensure that UK companies, which are subject to rigorous national regulatory regimes, are not disadvantaged in the face of competitors which have much more freedom in their home markets in such areas as pricing and performance targetry?
Â Â  . Improved communication and cooperation between regulators is vital to the smooth operation of the internal market.
In its recent report on the application of the Postal Directive, the Commission has proposed intensifying cooperation and indeed benchmarking with national regulatory agencies, either bilaterally or within the framework of the Postal Directive Committee, in order to tackle the irregularities that may persist in this sector.
As well as benchmarking exercises, we should also consider initiatives such as the Solve-it Scheme.
Such initiatives encourage regulators to communicate directly with one another to solve problems.
We also need to make sure that we review existing legislation to see whether it has achieved its objectives on the ground.
With that in mind, the Telecommunications and Energy Council, meeting in December, will discuss Commission implementation reports in these relevant sectors.
Â Â  There are so many Scots in the Chamber that I think, if we are going to have a common language, it should probably be Scottish.
I am grateful to the President-in-Office for his reply and it goes some way towards answering my supplementary question as well.
He appears to be agreeing with me that there is not a level playing field at the present time, causing this asymmetry.
Therefore, what concrete proposals is the Presidency planning to improve the coordination between national regulatory authorities in order to ensure that there is a genuine, free and fair internal market for all operators?
Â Â  MrÂ Stevenson, I do not know whether we translate directly from Scottish, but we are probably obliged to go through another language that is spoken in the United Kingdom and that many people here speak.
Â Â  . The last time I saw so many Scots gathered together was probably around the British Cabinet table, but I am not sure I would be brave enough to make that point back in London.
As regards the point raised by the honourable Member, it is a matter of which I have had some direct experience, having myself been the minister responsible for postal services in the United Kingdom when I was at the Department of Trade and Industry.
At that time I was aware of exactly the kinds of concerns he raised.
I can assure you that there is an awareness of these issues, not simply from a Presidency point of view but in the context of a Member State.
As regards the concrete steps to be taken on cooperation between national regulators, I reiterate the point I made in my earlier response.
In terms of the application of the Postal Services Directive and in particular the report published by the Commission, the Commission strongly recommended that there should be intensified cooperation between national regulators, and that certainly has our full support.
A balance has to be struck between the constructive oversight that the Commission can provide in this area of work and a greater involvement by national regulators themselves in what surely is of common interest to them, ensuring a level playing field.
Â Â  Does the President-in-Office agree with me that part of the problem is that different countries are proceeding with liberalisation at different rates?
The United Kingdom will soon fully liberalise, along with Germany and the Netherlands, which means that 60% of the market will be liberalised.
Therefore, the key element will be the Commission's forthcoming report on the final steps towards full liberalisation in 2009, dealing with regulatory authorities, access arrangements, and also the differing treatment of VAT between the reserved and non-reserved sectors, which is a very sensitive issue and needs to be treated with due care.
Â Â  . I find myself in concurrence with the points that the honourable Member raises.
I can assure you that when serving as a British minister with responsibilities for the Postal Services Directive, these were points that were made very vocally to me by the Communication Workers Union, never mind by the Royal Mail and others.
So I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed in a number of Member States in terms of the relative liberalisation of the markets that has taken place and indeed the extent of openness within markets at the present time.
In relation to the specific point on VAT and regulatory asymmetry, the Commission has proposed amending the relative VAT Directive.
The Council has not yet reached agreement on the proposal and understands that the Commission is currently exploring ways of achieving a common interpretation of the current framework.
In that regard, we await the outcome of those further areas of work.
Ten United Nations special rapporteurs on several human freedoms and rights issued a recent statement expressing concern about the âmass forced evictions in Zimbabwe and related human rights violationsâ and raising questions about the negative effects on supplies of water and food, education and health care, including HIV/AIDS treatment.
Will the Council give an update of the situation in Zimbabwe following the extended visit of the United Nations Special Envoy, Mrs Anna Tibaijuka, who is also the Executive Director of the UN Human Settlements Programme?
Â Â  . It is not within the Council's remit to report on situations following the visit of a United Nations special envoy to a country.
The report of the UN special envoy Mrs Anna Kajumulo will be available through the usual United Nations sources, I am reliably informed.
In the context of the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, the Council will, of course, report on the situation in the said country.
Â Â  President-in-Office, it is absolutely disgraceful that up to 700Â 000 people have been displaced from their homes, their houses and businesses completely destroyed.
I understand that blood transfusion stocks are now almost non-existent.
The United Nations is organising an international appeal for humanitarian and other aid.
The international community has no option but to cooperate in helping these unfortunate people.
Is it not outrageous that a regime led by what can only be described as a tyrant, along with his cronies, can carry on with the ruination of a country and its people with total impunity?
Â Â  . I find myself in complete agreement with the honourable Member in deploring the actions of the said government and the impoverishment of its people that has followed as a consequence of the misrule in that country for so long.
The European Union continues to call on the Government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the international relief efforts which tragically have now proved necessary and to allow humanitarian assistance to be provided free from political interference.
It is also the case that the European Union continues through sanctions to place pressure on the regime.
These sanctions have the support of the democratic opposition and the non-governmental organisation community within Zimbabwe and they show that the European Union is determined to make its voice heard on human rights and the rule of law.
I deplore the situation and hope and wish that it will change in due course and, in that regard, will take interest in the report that is being produced by the United Nations Special Envoy.
The Myanmar authorities recently released 249 political âprisonersâ throughout the country, reportedly including two prominent journalists and a close aide of the still-detained National League for Democracy (NLD) leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which is welcomed.
Does the Council agree that the Myanmar authorities should lift the remaining constraints on all political leaders and resume political dialogue with all parties concerned?
Furthermore will the Council use its office to call on Myanmar's military government to remove all constraints, starting with the end of her house arrest, on Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner?
Â Â  . The European Union pointed out that the releases of political prisoners mentioned by the honourable Member were a welcome step towards national reconciliation in Burma.
The European Union has repeatedly called for the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi, most recently on 17 June, ahead of her 60th birthday.
On that occasion, the European Union hoped that this would be the last birthday she spent deprived of her freedom and urged the State Peace and Development Council â SPDC â to release her, U Tin Oo and all the other political prisoners immediately.
The European Union is committed to supporting national reconciliation and respect for human rights and democracy in Burma and continues to call on the SPDC to enter into a genuine dialogue with the NLD and with ethnic representatives to find peaceful political solutions.
Like Ann Sang Suu Kyi, the European Union supports an approach to resolving the long-standing political problems in Burma based on dialogue and non-violence.
Consequently, the Union looks forward to the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining political detainees in order to enable all social and political forces to participate in that reconciliation process.
The European Union has shared the above concerns with the Burmese leadership on several occasions, most recently on 6 May at a ministerial meeting held in the margins of the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Kyoto.
At that meeting, the European Union handed over a list of political prisoners whose release was requested on urgent humanitarian grounds.
At the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting and the ARF ministerial meeting on 28 and 29 July in Laos, the Union again voiced its concerns about the situation in Burma.
Â Â  I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and understanding that actions have been taken, words have been said.
Is the Minister aware that the Indonesian Foreign Minister has recently taken up this case in a big way and is planning to make a presentation during the UN General Summit which takes place later on this year?
Could I urge the Council, and the President-in-Office in particular, to give support to the Indonesian Foreign Minister in ensuring the release of all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi?
Â Â  . I am sincerely grateful to the honourable gentleman for the question that he raises and pay tribute to his long-standing interest in this matter.
I myself, before assuming my responsibilities as Minister for Europe, had responsibility for South Asia and South East Asia within the UK Foreign Office and I took the opportunity, anticipating in some ways his question, to meet directly with the ASEAN ambassadors in London, to press home to them directly the critical role that other Asian countries can play in bringing to bear a full awareness by that regime of the strength of international feeling.
In that regard, of course, the European Union continues to support efforts, both internationally and in the United Nations General Assembly, to bring pressure to bear on the regime, to take forward the process of national reconciliation that we all seek and to address urgently the deep concerns we feel in relation to the unfair detention of political prisoners.
According to a senior UN official, Under-Secretary General Jan Egeland, 'One medical charity has treated 500 victims of sexual violence in Darfur in four months and this is just a fraction of such attacks in the Sudanese province'.
He also stated that 'women and children were being systematically raped and assaulted in the ravaged region'.
Does the Council agree that the Sudanese authorities are turning a blind eye to these atrocities?
Furthermore does the Council agree that there is an urgent obligation on the international community to do more to protect innocent civilians from this type of barbaric behaviour and to put an end to a culture of impunity in Sudan?
Â Â  . The Council has, on various occasions, condemned the massive humanitarian rights violations taking place in Darfur, including the systematic rape of women, demanding that those responsible at all levels be held accountable for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
The European Union strongly supported the creation of the International Commission of Inquiry on the violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur, which found that government forces and militia conducted indiscriminate attacks, including rape and other forms of sexual violence, throughout Darfur on a widespread and systematic basis, as well as the referral of the findings of the Commission to the International Criminal Court.

The EU has contributed more than EURÂ 150 million to the humanitarian programme in Sudan, including funding for United Nations agencies and NGOs in Darfur engaged in protection issues and the treatment of victims of sexual violence.
The European Union has also allocated EURÂ 92 million from its Africa Peace Facility to the African Union Mission in Sudan.
The latest report by the United Nations Secretary-General states that, 'The presence of the African Union and its patrols directly resulted in a decrease in both sexual and gender-based violence and other violations of human rights.'
In its conclusions of 23 May 2005, the Council particularly welcomed the adoption of the Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan by the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which expresses deep concern at the situation of human rights in Darfur, including gender-based violence, condemns sexual violence against women and girls and calls upon all parties to the conflict to protect women and girls from sexual and other forms of violence.
The Council urged the Sudanese Government to implement all the recommendations set out in the resolution.
Human rights issues, including sexual violence, are permanently addressed in the political dialogue conducted with the Government of Sudan, most recently in June, on the occasion of the demarche conducted by the European Union Troika in Khartoum, concerning the arrest of two staff members of accused of disseminating false information on sexual violence in Darfur.
Â Â  I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and for the information.
However, I hope that he would agree with me that these atrocities in Darfur, where 180 000 people have been killed in two years and more than two million have been driven from their homes, need more urgent attention.
Would the President-in-Office not agree that the international community, including the European Union, should do more, because this has gone on for far too long?
Â Â  . There is of course a desire for urgency, given the scale of the atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated in that country.
It is clear that there can be no immunity for the people who have committed those crimes and those responsible must be brought to justice as a matter of urgency.
That is why the European Union strongly supported the referral of Darfur to the International Criminal Court and I think that represented a significant milestone in the progress that we still wish to see.
We have also made it clear that there must be full cooperation with the Court by all sides.
The prosecutor has already decided, on 6 June, that he has sufficient evidence of the scope and nature of the crimes committed within his jurisdiction to mount a formal investigation and he has reached this decision independently.
That is why, although I recognise the strength of feeling there is about urgent action on this matter, we must respect the fact that the Court is now in its investigation phase.
It will need the support of the international community, and that includes the European Union, if it is to fulfil the mandate given to it by the Security Council.
I can assure the questioner that I am acutely aware of the desire for a speedy conclusion, but I am confident that the way forward has been found through referral to the International Criminal Court.
I can assure you of the continuing support for the International Criminal Court in its efforts to ensure that no-one can commit such terrible crimes with impunity.
Â Â  That concludes Question Time.
Questions Nos 13 to 37 will be replied to in writing.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrsÂ Svensson (A6-0250/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on gender discrimination in health systems (2004/2218 (INI)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by saying thank you for the opportunity given to me to draft this important report on gender discrimination in health systems.
I wish to thank all those fellow Members who have shown great interest in, and commitment to, the report and made valuable contributions to it.
The gender with which we happen to be born is as important a health factor as social, economic and ethnic background.
The UN conferences in Cairo in 1994 and Beijing in 1995 put gender-related discrimination in health care on the agenda.
Unfortunately, not much has happened since in the way of action, whether it be in the Member States or at EU level.
Womenâs health is still often seen as synonymous with sexual and reproductive health.
Naturally, womenâs health is more complex than that.
I want to mention a few examples of gender discrimination.
Women with acute heart complaints are still forced to wait longer than men for ambulance transport.
The same types of heart disease still lead to higher mortality among women than among men.
It is still the case that more men than women with sight problems are given the opportunity of having cataract operations.
Violence against women, which is a major public health problem, is still an almost invisible phenomenon in medical training and practice.
Men still constitute the norm in research and the development of new drugs.
This report focuses in particular on two different areas.
The first area is about submitting proposed measures to combat gender discrimination between men and women affected by the same or similar diseases.
The other focus area is womenâs health from the perspective of so-called âwomenâs diseasesâ, that is to say diseases that almost only affect women, for example breast cancer, osteoporosis, eating disorders in the case of young girls and violence against women in all its different forms â physical and mental abuse, genital mutilation, sexual slavery, prostitution etc.
Gender discrimination becomes very clear to anyone able to study the research reports that exist.
For example, an analysis of the work done at a health centre in Sweden specialising in skin diseases reveals that men and women are treated very differently.
Men are given the more expensive light treatment, while women are sent home with a prescription for skin ointment.
The conclusion in terms of costs is that, if women were treated in the same way as men, the resources expended on women would increase by 61%.
If, on the other hand, the intensity of womenâs treatment is taken as the norm, the cost of treatment would decrease by 33%.
I might also mention that, in the example I cite, the doctors who discriminated between women and men in issuing prescriptions were women.
This shows that gender discrimination permeates thinking in the case of both men and women.
In order to combat gender discrimination, researchers and others must have access to gender-disaggregated health care statistics.
Without information and knowledge, we cannot substantiate how, in reality, gender discrimination operates. Nor, without such knowledge, can we do anything about the problems.
It really is high time that measures were taken enabling us to talk in terms of fair and equal care.
Gender discrimination in health care is just as important a determinant as ethnic background and social and economic factors. This is something of which we must take account in future in our work to obtain fair and equal health care.
I also wish to emphasise that access to sexual advice, reproductive health care and family planning are important tools in the service of womenâs health, as well as of womenâs opportunities to participate in society on equal terms and of combating poverty and the ongoing feminisation of poverty.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, and of course the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for the very important job which they have done in drafting this report.
It is a fact that, from the day I took up office and became involved in health issues, I realised that there is indeed a gender dimension â a difference between the two sexes â in health issues.
There is, for example, the question of smoking, where it now appears that there is an increasing tendency among women to smoke, especially young women and especially on the basis of the false promise that they can use smoking to control their weight.
We know society's problems as far as young girls' weight is concerned and this is now being exploited in order to promote smoking.
Then there is the question of HIV/AIDS.
Unfortunately, the number of cases is increasing in the European Union among young people, especially women. This is also one of the most worrying factors about this illness.
Then there is, of course, the question of alcohol, consumption of which is indeed rising at the moment thanks to alcopops, which target and are mainly consumed by women, with the social problems that this can cause.
Of course, that is why I consider the report to be very important and both I and the rest of the Commission will take very serious account of the proposals contained in it.
Of course, I must say from the outset that many of the issues touched on in the report falls within the competence of the Member States.
Nonetheless, we have ways, such as proposals, recommendations, the open method of coordination and guidelines, with which we can develop a common policy between Parliament and the Commission in order to persuade the Member States to apply it.
I also wish to refer briefly to two or three matters: in both the 2006 programme and the new health programme we shall take account and promote the gender dimension, exactly as the report proposes; on the question of smoking for 2006, we shall focus our attention on young women.
The same applies to alcohol: the strategy which I shall be presenting within the coming year will have a special dimension for young women.
The same also applies to mental health, which will be approached from the criterion of the gender dimension.
The Green Paper on mental health which we shall be publishing in October will also emphasise this issue.
We shall soon be announcing the new guidelines for breast cancer screening and we have already extended work on cervical cancer also.
We believe that, by the end of the year, we shall have the first package of guidelines. This proves that we really are taking account of this dimension.
To close, what is really important, and I take it on board and will promote it in the Commission, is the question of collating data, really accurate data which will give us the real dimension of the difference between the sexes in the health sector; this will of course help both us and the Member States to plan the rest of our strategy.
For example, in 2006 we shall define indicators for gynaecological health and the menopause, such as an endometriosis indicator which is, of course, extremely important.
I wish to close by saying that in the pharmaceutical sector, together with my colleague Mr Verheugen, we shall soon be announcing an initiative in the pharmaceutical industry sector and we shall take account here in the patient information sector of the need for a different approach to women as regards the use of drugs which, as the report quite rightly says and there is no need for me to analyse it further, react differently in men and women.
I shall follow the debate with a great deal of interest.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank MrsÂ Svensson, who has taken the initiative to launch this report.
I have but one word to say on the matter: âvigilanceâ.
In fact, the scope and pertinence of the rapporteurâs remarks highlight forms of discrimination that seem to belong to a different era.
It is unacceptable that, today, the simple fact of being a woman means that there is a greater risk of not being born, and then, of being less well cared for than a man.
Health is our most precious asset and this asset in currently in danger.
For a number of years, an increasingly clear link has been established between womenâs physical and mental health and their economic situation.
Poor women have more physical and psychological health problems than other women.
They have a shorter life expectancy, they experience premature aging and they take more medication.
One out of every two teenage girls from an underprivileged background shows a high level of psychological distress.
More than half the number of single-parent mothers live in poverty; they take more medication than other mothers and their level of psychological distress is particularly high.
Women who are less educated or who are unemployed or poor are, in fact, the most affected by psychological distress and physical health problems.
Female poverty, single parenthood and social isolation therefore create an explosive cocktail that endangers womenâs health, a state of affairs that is quite simply intolerable.
This report is an extremely useful reminder, which comes at just the right time.
There are no individual explanations and solutions: we must therefore find joint explanations and solutions.
That is our political task.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard again today, there is still a lack of any gender-specific health policy in Europe.
That is why the report by MrsÂ Svensson is so important, and I am much obliged to her for it.
It is really no longer acceptable that most medicinal products are still tested only on men â another fact which has already been mentioned â even though we know that biological factors mean that medicinal products work differently on men and women.
It is also no longer acceptable that, for example, more women than men die of heart attacks, because the differing symptoms that occur in women mean that the condition is not diagnosed in time.
It is equally incomprehensible, in my opinion, that there is still a complete absence of references to any gender-specific reactions in instruction leaflets for medicines.
My group fully supports this report, therefore, as it requires Member States to finally take gender-specific health policy seriously.
Many of the demands put forward in this report are not new. This just goes to show how slowly the wheels of bureaucracy turn in the Member States.
Although EU guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer in women aged between 50 and 69 have been in place since 1992, comprehensive mammography screening exists in only nine Member States. This can reduce mortality by 35%.
This report also calls for screening for women from the age of 40, subject to the availability of evidence-based data, as there are early indications that mortality can be reduced here, too, by up to 20%.
Another issue we regard as important is that of chlamydia infection.
This disease leads to female infertility in one third of cases, where it has not been diagnosed in time.
Further data on this are urgently needed.
By way of conclusion, I should like to draw attention briefly to a development that is going completely unnoticed by the public.
Although Caesarean operations present an increased health risk to mother and child, the number of such operations is rising dramatically in several States.
Causes seem to range from hospital doctorsâ duty rosters, to supplementary income from private patients, to parents requesting particular appointment dates: holiday planning plays a major part in this.
Therefore, my group supports the call â addressed to Member States, in the first instance, of course â for attention to be drawn explicitly to the health risks of Caesareans to mother and child, which are five times greater than with natural births.
However, we also support the call for the Commission to further study this phenomenon and gather and pass on the relevant data.
We also welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to take every possible step to ensure that women finally receive a full explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of hormone replacement therapy.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the work of the committee, this report seems very confused.
It could be described as a patchwork quilt: it lacks any grand design or focus.
We must, however, have clear areas of focus.
The speech by the Commissioner just now was very welcome.
His conclusion that the gender dimension should be taken into account and the areas of focus which he mentioned were truly welcome.
The main issue that should be raised is the fact that 14 Member States of the Union have not implemented the screening programme to identify cancerous diseases.
It would save money and human life, and it is very important that these screening examinations are actually carried out in good time.
It was also very positive that the Commissioner suggested that mental health was a priority.
In many Member States mental health patients are clearly second-class citizens, and mental health illnesses are not seen as diseases in the same way as others.
Thirdly, I would also like to say how glad I was that the growth in alcohol consumption was something the Commissioner drew attention to in his speech.
Alcohol consumption has increased in almost all Member States, and deaths and alcohol-related illnesses have become common.
This has been a fatal trend, especially among the young.
There is therefore much to do with regard to this at Union and government level, and priorities must be set.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, wish to thank MrsÂ Svensson for this report and particularly for taking the initiative.
As has already been emphasised, there were failings: gender differences were not noticed.
I do hope, however, that the Commission will not merely pay lip service to this, but that this initiative will, in future, lead to more action to rectify this situation.
There is particular agreement that female genital mutilation is a crime against women in many respects, but especially from a medical point of view.
The European Union must not be content with making appeals, but must set a crystal-clear example, and I hope that the Commission will join with the next Presidency in launching an appropriate initiative.
We need screening programmes, we need a notification requirement, and we need penal measures for those conducting genital mutilation in the EU.
Chlamydia leads to infertility in one third of cases.
We need greater awareness, more campaigns, to bring this truly dramatic issue into the public eye.
In addition, the risks arising from hormone treatment, and hyperstimulation in the case of in vitro fertilisation, can no longer be played down.
The European Union must do more in this field, particularly for the sake of women.
It is my hope, therefore, that this own-initiative report really signifies a fresh start at European level, and will thus bring the issue of âwomen and healthâ into sharper focus.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Svensson warmly for her report, with regard to which I have two points to make.
The Dutch Parliament will not discuss further measures against female genital mutilation until later on this month.
The Cabinet has adopted a number of sound recommendations from the Public Health Council on the prevention and prosecution of genital mutilation. That itself illustrates how important it is that this subject, and Mrs Svenssonâs report, be considered.
Despite the Netherlandsâ image, to which it is attached, of being a progressive country, clear policy on genital mutilation has been too long in coming, and even now, the Dutch Government has not yet decided in favour of a notification requirement for health professionals, because it fears that the public will avoid seeking medical help if is used for enforcement purposes.
However, we cannot afford to take this casual approach to this serious form of abuse, and we therefore support the appeal in Mrs Svenssonâs report for notification to be made mandatory.
In addition to the gender disparities in health care and the need for a gender-specific approach to health complaints, as indicated in the report, there are many areas left where women and health have a special relationship and where gender-specific effects can therefore be anticipated.
These should be mapped out before new legislation is introduced.
Two months ago, the Dutch Parliament decided to have a gender effect report drawn up for the new care system that is due to be introduced on 1 January.
I would advise the Commission to have similar gender effect reports drawn up in areas of policy that really matter to women, and would ask that these be presented to Parliament before new health care legislation is approved.
This could, in fact, be seen as an addition to paragraph 11 of Mrs Svenssonâs report.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, I have no doubt that MrsÂ Svenssonâs intentions in drafting this report were honourable, but programmes appear to have been divided up somewhat artificially on the basis of gender.
Although the report highlights a number of key problems of both a general and specific nature, its particular focus on certain issues means that it discriminates against others that are no less important, and for no good reason.
It is always easier to treat a disease whose cause is known.
After having studied the report, I should therefore like to draw Membersâ attention to the fact that discrimination stems from a lack of respect for human rights and ethical principles, as well as from the present epidemic of mental illness.
It is a symptom of self-centredness, or in other words the desire to dominate others and to subjugate them by manipulating them for oneâs own purposes.
The fact that most medical workers are female, which is a problem raised in the report, does not amount to discrimination.
Instead, it is a prerequisite for patients, given that women are naturally caring and sensitive to their needs.
Wages that are too low to meet costs can be discriminatory, however.
Economic conditions and liberal lifestyles result in discrimination against women who have children and against morally upright families.
The latter provide the only environment for normal growth and co-existence in an atmosphere of mutual respect and love, and a family environment of this kind requires legal support and pro-family policies.
At the same time, destruction of the family is one of the causes of sexual promiscuity, which is a further link in the chain of infection of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular chlamydia and HIV, which cause a great deal of suffering, as well as cancer and death.
Similarly, the fight waged by women for the privileges and rights due to them must not degenerate into aggressive and conflict-generating rivalry with men.
If the author is genuinely concerned about women who suffer from mental illness and addictions, then why does paragraphÂ 21 contain covert pro-abortion propaganda?
Such propaganda disregards traditional standards and results in confusion and depravity, as does the liberal-minded tolerance of deviation.
Furthermore, although differences do indeed exist between the types of addiction suffered by women and men, the underlying problem is always one of self-addiction. The latter is a symptom of individual mental deficiency and of the mental illnesses known in medical parlance as self-destructive behaviours.
Violence is also a symptom of mental illness.
Research carried out on people in homosexual relationships has shown that the proportion of men and women using violence is around 50% respectively. This proves that violence is not related to gender.
From a medical point of view, the proposal to administer medicines on a gender-specific basis is entirely misguided, since it is standard practice to adapt dosages to a patientâs body weight or age.
Any differences in the way individual medicines need to be administered depend on individual sensitivity and sex hormones, which means that there is no justification for the EUâs innovative introduction of gender differences into pharmacotherapy.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, I read this report with great interest, since it quite rightly highlights a number of very specific problems relating to womenâs health.
I am delighted that the interest we are taking in such matters may well be born out of the time-honoured European tradition of concern for the weaker members of society. This is a fine tradition in this instance, where there is every justification for turning our attention to women as the weaker half of the human race.
At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves to what extent many of the problems facing women today stem from undesirable changes in civilisation, a flawed family model and negative ideologies that spread in the wake of modern ideas about good and evil and morality and immorality.
Men are working ever shorter hours, and in some Member States have even secured for themselves a 35-hour week, which means that nothing or almost nothing gets done.
If we take this fact into account, as well as the fact that women also have to work this 35-hour week as well as looking after a home and family, it becomes clear that a womanâs lot is indeed harder.
This begs the question of whether arrangements should not be made to allow women to stay at home if they so wish, and to devote themselves to their families instead of working as hard as they frequently do today.
In my opinion, this report fails to highlight the negative consequences of frequent abortions, although it states very clearly that women are suffering from extremely serious mental disorders.
It also indicates that levels of alcoholism and drug addiction among women are rising, and, as MrsÂ Svensson notes, that an increasing number of women are committing suicide, which is highly regrettable.
The question that needs to be asked is the extent to which this results from flawed family types and models and from such things as the effects of abortions or of certain contraceptives.
Ladies and gentlemen, in spite of everything we should welcome the fact that women still live longer than men in the majority of countries.
It is an unfortunate fact, however, that this gap in life expectancy is narrowing, and this is quite obviously a result of the many problems to which MrsÂ Svensson refers in her report.
I regret to say that this report has a certain ideological slant.
As noted by MrsÂ Krupa, this can be seen in paragraphÂ 21, which refers quite unnecessarily to âreproductive healthâ, or in other words covertly encourages women to have abortions.
I am mystified as to why ideology-crazed feminists come out of the woodwork during almost every debate we hold.
During debates on AIDS and on the Millennium Goals, and during the debate this House held on equal rights for women and men, there was always someone who wanted to shoehorn in âreproductive healthâ, or in other words a covert endorsement of abortion.
This is entirely unnecessary ideology.
Similarly, the confusion between patients and women in the health service is entirely misplaced ideology.
Equal access for women and men to health services is one thing, but the internal workings of the health service are something else entirely.
Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the deluded feminist ideas to which some Members of this House still fall prey.
It was with the greatest satisfaction and pleasure that I found in point D the statement that public health is affected primarily by ethical and moral principles.
I hope that public health in Europe reaches an optimal level on the basis of good moral health.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the report in question is remarkably rich and demonstrates a far-reaching ambition in the number of points it addresses. However, we know that we have neither the human resources nor the material resources to meet such a large-scale demand, and it seems to me that a certain modesty ought to guide our work.
It is true that, at a time when we are enabling everyone to benefit from technological discoveries and when we are concerned about the way in which energy and food products are distributed, it is high time that we envisaged the creation of a European bank for health and prevention.
It is quite obvious that, within the countries that have recently joined the European Union, a large part of the population is excluded from public health systems.
These people do not go and enquire about health care.
Should we not, therefore, think about health care coming to them by means of screening campaigns, vaccinations and primary care dispensed, regardless of gender, by mobile teams and equipment?
While in our old European countries, in fact, the right to health care has become undeniable, the same cannot be said of these countries, where health and social protection is all too often aimed at those who have paid contributions so as to benefit from this protection.
It is therefore the case that unqualified and unemployed men and women, elderly people and lone parents do not have access to the most everyday care.
Leaving aside the resources that might come from the Structural Funds, such as funding allocations for the health care structures already implemented in these countries, it is imperative to ensure that a minimum level of health protection is given to these sections of the community.
It would be wise, therefore, to begin with the children, as we know that without prevention and basic health care during childhood, incurable problems can set in.
Then, depending on the needs, it would be a case of treating as a priority those areas with the most significant pathological conditions and, finally, of extending the scope of the activities.
If we want to aspire to action with a humanitarian dimension, that is our duty as MEPs and that is the duty of our Assembly.
It is a challenge, admittedly; however, we must have the ambition to accept it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, it is important that we are debating in our Parliament the question of women's health for the first time within the framework of the enlarged European Union, especially in view of future enlargement to countries in which equality between the two sexes has not been established in policies and women's rights need protection.
I therefore thank our rapporteur for her initiative and the useful information contained in her report.
Indeed, a prosperous society with standards and cohesion is based above all on the physical and mental health of its members.
Our report raises awareness of the particular situations which women face in the health sector, such as childbirth, and of particular problems such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis and menopause.
It gives us information about the particular behaviour which women have as patients and users of certain drugs and therapies.
The Commissioner has confirmed these peculiarities to us and assures us that he will incorporate them into his new strategy.
The rapporteur also gives us information about the lack of information and proper approach to these situations by society and by scientific and nursing staff.
We therefore understand the need â and here I support the rapporteur's proposals â for special studies, detailed statistics and indicators, so that we can study these situations properly and address them effectively with all the parameters and at all levels â prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
What is important is that we understand that we need to examine the gender dimension in all our national and Community strategies and in all research programmes and all information and awareness-raising strategies, because women themselves must be informed and protected.
One negative element of the report is that it includes issues which do not come within the scope of the study, such as the call for shorter hours and pay levels and I propose that we should not vote for these paragraphs.
I should also like the Commissioner, as the question of paragraph 21 was raised, to explain to us what the Commission means by its strategy on sexual and reproductive health.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I thank the rapporteur.
Turning to the Commissioner, I think it is appropriate to point out that this ambitious report, which combines a gender approach with health and the state of our health systems, deserves to be placed in the political spotlight, including by the Commission.
The Commission should make its voice heard and, based on a careful analysis of the various national health systems in the Europe of 25, tell us what its overall approach is, how it intends to include prevention and treatment in all the Unionâs policies and, above all, what its assessment is of Europe.
Once we know that, and after the debate with Parliament, we shall be in a position to say what progress has been made in this continent, which is not merely a series of misfortunes, but a part of the world where women live better lives than in other areas of the planet.
The Commission should also specify the challenges facing us in building a new welfare state commensurate with womenâs needs.
Europe will not progress without women; that is a political fact that I hope even the Commission will not forget.
I am therefore grateful for this report, but I must admit that I have asked for a separate vote on three items: recital U and paragraphs 15 and 10, because they are superficial or poorly formulated and, despite the rapporteurâs very good intentions, they are liable to be damaging because they are not comprehensible.
Recital U and paragraph 15 state that ovarian stimulation as such may endanger a womanâs health. That statement is false and may, without saying as much, lead people to condemn stem cell research on the basis of some presumed gender discrimination.
We do not need obscurantist attitudes!
Europe needs to move forwards on a firm scientific footing.
Paragraph 10, at least as it has been translated into certain languages, calls not for human cloning to be ruled out of European programmes, as would be correct, but for the practice to be stopped or suspended.
Europe does not finance any programmes of that kind, and therefore the idea that one might say or think that we are trying to stop therapeutic cloning should be ruled out.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a great deal in this report, I hope not too much, but I want to thank the rapporteur for including a particular women's health issue with which I have been much involved.
I refer to a disease which affects an estimated 14Â million women and girls across the EU.
There is no known cure, the cause is unknown and the average diagnosis time is rising, not falling, now standing at nine years.
The disease I am talking about is endometriosis.
It wrecks lives, it wrecks families, it causes infertility, it is not just 'bad period pains'.
The disease desperately needs serious research and attention.
As Members will be aware, we had a written declaration in this House to raise awareness.
We achieved a total of 266 signatures, more than has ever been achieved on a single health issue.
Seemingly, though, the pain caused by this disease goes unnoticed.
It is a real gender issue.
Even in our modern society, no one wants to talk about the pain associated with menstruation; women should 'just get on with it'.
That cannot be right.
The consequences of this disease are heart-rending for many women and families and there are also consequences for Europe's economy.
14Â million women across the EU are waiting for someone to take their suffering seriously.
It is wonderful that the rapporteur has included it.
I was grateful that the Commissioner mentioned it, but really it is now up to the Commission and the Member States to do something about this dreadful disease, which is a gender issue affecting only women and girls.
I wonder what might have been the case had it been a male disease!
Â Â  Mr President, gender policies must indeed be mainstreamed and incorporated into all political, social and institutional dimensions.
I believe that the report is a good demonstration of this in relation to medical and health practices and therefore join with previous speakers in congratulating MrsÂ Svensson, the rapporteur.
As several studies indicate, men and women are treated unequally in terms of prescription, treatment and medical and health costs.
To quote examples mentioned in the report, women are victims of specific violence, genital mutilation and of diseases such as osteoporosis, breast cancer and eating disorders. Women also suffer as a result of sexual exploitation, prostitution and a lack of safety at the workplace.
These are specific issues that call for specific treatment.
Of the reasons why we take a positive view of this report, I would like to stress its insistence on the need for the States and the Commission to adopt a gender perspective in their policies.
I was therefore also pleased to hear what the Commissioner said at the beginning.
Mr President, I concur with the notion that good health is not merely the absence of illness, but is about physical, mental and social wellbeing.
That concept lies at the heart of a strategy called the Investing for Health Strategy, which I initiated in my constituency during my time as Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
I saw myself not as a minister of illness, but as a minister of health.
This report by Eva-Britt Svensson â and I thank her for it â highlights many of the pertinent issues.
It contains good, practical recommendations that are worthy of support.
It has been put to me that being a woman is bad for your health and indeed there are statistics that reinforce that commonly held view.
We hear now of statistics from Scandinavia suggesting that there are inequalities not only in health status, but also in the response of health systems and health services to women, as compared with men.
If this is the case in Scandinavia, with its relatively good record on equality, then it is time we took a very close look at trends in other Member States.
I welcome Commissioner Kyprianou's recognition of the importance of data.
I also echo the proposal put forward here this evening by my colleague, Kartika Liotard.
Recognition of gender inequalities in health is required if we are going to successfully combat disparities and ensure that there is adequate health care for everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Svensson has written an extremely fascinating and complete report, which discusses many aspects that are related to women and health care.
I am not a doctor, but I gather that many comments in it put the finger on the sore spot.
I am impressed with the care that emanates from this report.
It shows a great deal of compassion for the individuals who cannot in any way stand up for themselves, certainly when that is the result of abuse, crime or addiction.
I wholeheartedly endorse the appeal for an accessible health care system.
Paragraph 21, however, is in sharp contrast with all the positive sections of this report.
Whilst the report devotes much attention to the well-being and health of adults, paragraph 21 fails to guarantee this for people at an earlier stage of their lives.
It appears that the rights of, and care for, adults are more important than those for people who have just started out in life.
To me, the life of every human being is just as valuable, whether they be very young or very old.
That is why I would like to call for the removal of those elements that draw a distinction between care in the different life stages. In that way, the positive approach of this report can also benefit those people who cannot yet look after their own interests.
I hope that my fellow Members will be prepared to remove this blot on this otherwise excellent report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to start by offering my sincere congratulations to MrsÂ Svensson on her successful report.
The report that she presented in committee was truly balanced and largely complete.
It is important that the issue of âwomen and healthâ be addressed at European level.
I should also like thank the Commissioner for instigating the appropriate initiatives in this regard as, firstly, there is still a lack of information on the effects of many medicinal products on women and, secondly, illnesses specific to women are still receiving unequal treatment in research.
There are hardly any clinical trials involving the testing of medicinal products on women.
This is a particularly important aspect against the background of our current discussions on the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
Thirdly â and this is a particular concern of mine â EU action is also important in the case of osteoporosis, the hidden epidemic which particularly affects women.
It is important that the fight against this disease finally be given a higher profile.
Quite apart from these comments, I should also like to express my regret that the report in the form currently being put to the vote in plenary is only a watered-down version of what MrsÂ Svensson originally presented in committee.
I find it particularly infuriating that the report now includes demands for shorter working hours and higher pay for healthcare professionals: in paragraphÂ 54, for example.
Although I fully appreciate the difficult working conditions within the health service, this is not something that should be dealt with at European level.
Where would we be if decisions on pay were taken at European level?
On the subject of working hours: we have only recently adopted the Working Time Directive, so I do not think it right for this issue to be addressed once more in this good report.
The same goes for an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on unisex tariffs.
We adopted a directive regarding unisex tariffs inÂ 2004; I do not consider it appropriate to now demand a further revision of this.
I, and other members of my group, therefore reserve the right to vote against this report tomorrow â if this means voting on absurd matters â even though I warmly welcome the essence of the report.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even now in the 21st century, women still suffer from all kinds of discrimination: at work, in the home, in politics, in society and in access to healthcare.
This is not only true of access to sexual and reproductive healthcare; there is also discrimination when it comes to diagnosis and treatment as a whole, particularly as regards what are deemed womenâs diseases, such as fibromyalgia, breast and uterine cancer and osteoporosis.
This is therefore a timely and welcome report and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Svensson.
Women are discriminated against because prejudices prevail over common sense and respect for others.
As a result of prejudice and lack of information there are more women today with AIDS.
In order to reduce the number of women suffering, and to prevent more deaths, all Member States must, as a matter of priority, ensure access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and family planning.
We cannot allow thousands of women to go on dying because they opted to undergo backstreet abortions; we cannot allow thousands of young people to suffer the consequences of teenage pregnancy because they have not been given sufficient support; we cannot allow thousands of women to suffer physical and psychological abuse in maternity wards because of neglect and, worse, prejudice.
Even in European maternity wards there are women who are abandoned for hours on end during labour, suffering terribly, without any help or attention.
It is known that domestic violence, genital mutilation, the trafficking of women, prostitution and all manner of sexual trade are at the root of serious health problems and deaths among women.
Violence against women between 15 and 44 kills more women than cancer, malaria, road accidents and war.
In Europe, however, women continue to be abused, mutilated, trafficked and prostituted, without the authorities in the Member States fulfilling their responsibilities.
For that matter, what has the Commission done?
In this area, it too has done very little.
Even obvious and simple measures take time to be implemented, such as breast screening, which has only been put in place in a few countries â such as Belgium, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Portugal â and it is crucial that this be extended to cover other countries.
Health policy falls under the competence of the Member States, but the Commission could and should do more in this area because there are many situations that go beyond national responsibilities.
Â Â  â It is always vitally important to bring to the fore the importance of gender mainstreaming in the public health strategies of both the Member States and the Commission.
We therefore feel that this debate is crucial, and I wish to commend Mrs Svensson on her report, in view of the need to pay greater attention to womenâs health, with particular emphasis on pregnant women and babies, and on predominantly female professions.
Nevertheless, we must become far more proactive in promoting sexual and reproductive healthcare, sexual health and family planning, in guaranteeing womenâs right to choose, in creating equal access to health clinics for the purposes of terminating a pregnancy in the first three months for all women regardless of their social and economic situation should they choose to do so, and lastly in putting an end to the mutilation of women, backstreet abortions and the criminalisation of women, which still goes on in some EU countries, including my country, Portugal.
The European institutions and the Member States should play a more active role in protecting womenâs health and should take the opportunity of the forthcoming United Nations World Assembly to do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, the word 'health' is feminine in most languages and the pagan Europeans of ancient times envisaged health as a beautiful woman, statues of whom we admire to this day.
The Svensson report comes at the beginning of the 21st century to prove that often, due to technological achievements and despite the progress of science and perhaps due to the breakdown in values, a large proportion of women in the European Union have or risk having bad health or are threatened by a plethora of illnesses, disorders and addictions.
However, the subject of today's report is gender discrimination in health systems; in other words, in the ways and means of addressing all the terrible and frightening threats described to women's physical and mental health.
Congratulations to Mrs Svensson who, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, has sounded the alarm; congratulations to you Commissioner on your findings and the solutions which you have proposed, in order to generate attention to, and an initiative for, the health of 42% of the working population in the Union, as well as for elderly women who have already made their contribution in two workplaces: at work and in the home.
Initiatives also on the health of girls and young women in the European Union, because its continuing life and prosperity depend on them.
Even if in the motion for a resolution there is a lack of hierarchy and certain indications border on exaggeration and touch on the principle of subsidiarity, I feel, as a female Member of the European Parliament and as a women with daughters of her own that approaching health problems and the causes of illnesses with gender sensitivity is a civilised step.
This is a difficult subject, as the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, whose contribution we must also call upon, also acknowledges on its website.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the fact that I belong to what certain people â if only a few â call âthe weaker sexâ and that I am many hundreds of miles from my children this evening, I want very much to be here debating this important issue.
I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, my Swedish fellow Member MrsÂ Svensson, for having included many important issues worth highlighting in this context.
I am very glad that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported my amendments concerning, for example, women and smoking. The latter now forms part of paragraph 34, and I naturally hope that I shall receive support for it tomorrow.
Sweden became the first country in the world in which the number of women smokers exceeded the number of male smokers, a fact of which I do not feel especially proud.
Women are more vulnerable than men to the dangers of smoking.
One explanation is that, in general, women are smaller than men and have smaller hearts and narrower coronary arteries than men.
Investigations also show that it is mainly poorly educated women in low-paid jobs, for example care assistants and other health care workers, who are the biggest smokers.
In the last few days, a major new study carried out by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) was presented, showing for example that women with symptoms of heart disease and vascular disorders generally receive worse care than men, and this in spite of the fact that womenâs chances of surviving heart attacks are fewer than menâs.
Discrimination of all kinds, in this case gender discrimination in health systems, is an international matter.
We in the EU should therefore come up with a clear policy and also draw on each otherâs experiences.
Â Â  In the system of values of the consumer society, health has become a fundamental determinant of quality of life, and it has evolved into a major factor in economic and social policy.
Direct and indirect expenditures on medical treatment account for an ever-increasing share of the budgets of the Member States of the European Union.
However, the positive effects of this are not experienced by everyone to the same degree.
In the case of poor and disadvantaged groups, excluded on several counts, who make up the bottom third of society, we cannot say that there has been any significant change for the better either in terms of quality of health care provision, or in terms of their well-being, state of health, or life expectancy.
The report drawn up by my fellow Member, Mrs Svensson, clearly articulates the need for greater equity in health care provision. The objective is to provide the same quality of health care and ensure equal access to health services for women and men.
A particularly strong point of this report is that it calls for the creation of the conditions for equal access to health care and equality of opportunities for pregnant women, women living with chronic illness or disability, older women and those belonging to other disadvantaged groups, for example Roma women.
Due to a lack of statistical data, we have no figures on the relationships between the Roma population as a whole or Roma women in particular and the various types of institutions that make up the health services.
Few surveys have investigated the degree of prejudice manifested by health service employees in the way they deal with Roma people.
Neither do we know what prejudices or fears are harboured by Roma people with regard to the health service and its employees.
From reports by human rights NGOs and anthropological descriptions, however, the clear picture that emerges is that Roma women living within the European Union get poorer-quality health care, as they are affected by a number of unfavourable factors and are subject to discrimination.
In Hungary today, for example, the life expectancy of a Roma woman is 62.5 years, while that of non-Roma women is 75 years.
We need to have a great deal more discussion on the decisive factors involved in curtailing the lives of fellow women who are Roma by 13 years.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to refer specifically to two diseases mentioned in the report: chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.
These are two invisible diseases, given the difficulty of their diagnosis and the lack of resources devoted to research and their treatment.
It is calculated that 90% of the people suffering from these diseases are women.
We are therefore clearly dealing with two gender diseases.
Consequently, research into the origin and causes of these diseases is urgently needed, in order to improve treatments and compare results.
To this end, it is essential to increase the resources allocated to research, improving the training of health professionals, organising information and social awareness campaigns, carrying out studies on their social, legal, economic and healthcare repercussions, and also to promoting and developing new techniques for early diagnosis and for the dissemination of existing prevention methods.
For all of these reasons, I would like to call upon the Commission to carry out a study that compares the degree of application of treatments and their effects, both physical and psychological, in each of the Member States, in order to make progress with tackling these diseases.
It is essential to take account of the gender perspective when drawing up and applying health policies.
Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are not the only diseases that mostly affect women.
Other gender diseases that have been mentioned more often in this debate, such as breast cancer and osteoporosis, are at a rather more advanced stage in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
Nonetheless, in all cases it is necessary to continue actively to make progress, to continue research and to ensure that the public authorities work to effectively guarantee the health of men and women.
Â Â  The European Parliament frequently draws attention to human rights.
As members of parliament we draw attention to events around the world and we are particularly sensitive to minorities, who, in certain cases, demand special attention and care.
We women are not a minority, however.
We represent more than half of the population of the European Union.
In spite of this, women in our society encounter problems that are solely a result of their gender.
So the fact that the treatment of women in various health systems continues to be discriminatory is something we simply cannot accept.
Yet the right to healthcare is one of the basic socio-economic rights in the European Union Charter of Human Rights.
Therefore it is right and proper that the European Parliament, as the highest democratic institution in the European Union, should draw attention to this fact and put forward possible measures.
In doing so we must observe the principle of subsidiarity and we must also do so in the document we are discussing today.
I therefore support the document and I also support the amendments, which are needed if the principle of subsidiarity is to be taken into account.
In other words we, as the European Parliament, cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of individual Member States.
However, we do have the opportunity to take an important step in discussing and formulating European policies, where we do have the relevant jurisdiction.
May I point to the example of the joint decision-making of the European Parliament on the seventh framework programme.
Health is an important part of this programme.
The financial resources we earmark for this programme must reflect demographic indicators and the genuine needs of our citizens.
In this way we can also come closer to the people and give them the opportunity to see directly how joint European policy can affect their quality of life.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall take a few seconds to complain once again about these debates always being held at night.
We have often met to talk about women in the middle of the night, and with you in the chair I believe.
We always talk about women in the middle of the night, and one day we could do so in daylight, Mr President.
The inequality and discrimination suffered by women is structural and sustained.
We women have always been carers rather than cared-for.
There is therefore still a very significant imbalance between the level and quality of care for men and care for women.
We do, however, have certain common values in Europe, such as fairness, universality and solidarity.
Accordingly, we must also apply the gender perspective in the area of health, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said today.
I welcomed the initiative taken by the Social Democratic Ministers of the European Union who met in Sweden at the end of August, discussed the reduction of gender inequalities in health care and expressed their concern about the situation.
There are certain issues the report should have dealt with in more depth, and which relate in particular to sexual and reproductive health, as many speakers have already said.
It has also already been pointed out that violence is a health problem.
There is another important issue worthy of mention: the difficulties faced by immigrant women in accessing health systems, because they are afraid.
I hope we will meet again in daylight.
Â Â  I hope that this report will help to foster a uniform attitude throughout the European Union with regard to protecting womenâs health.
I would like to draw attention to an important issue: we must not allow women to face discrimination in the health services again just because they are poor, on a low income or because they are suffering from specifically womenâs illnesses.
In the health services we must not repeat the mistakes that put women at a disadvantage in other areas of life.
On the other hand, it would also be very important to ensure that, as part of their training, medical and health care personnel acquire the knowledge and skills enabling them to deal appropriately with illnesses that are specific to women.
Â Â  . Mr President, first I should like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for the very interesting debate.
I have also followed closely the proposals and views expressed.
Of course, I cannot comment on all of them in such a short time, but I have taken note of them and I shall of course take very serious account of them.
The fact is that there is a difference when it comes to health between men and women; there is the question of the illnesses which affect both sexes but which are peculiar either in their diagnosis or treatment in women and, of course, there are illnesses which affect women in particular.
This is something which needs to be taken into account when policies in the health sector are defined.
Of course, I shall not refer to all the specific illnesses mentioned.
What I can say, however, is that our new programme makes special provision and gives us the facility to turn our attention to specific illnesses.
Of course, they cannot all be covered, but we shall be able to define the priorities together when the time comes to adopt the programme.
This of course brings me to a basic point which I would like to raise: the need for money, because everything that has been said is all very well and good. It is indeed everything we could wish for but, without the necessary financial resources, it cannot be achieved.
This means, first of all, that the Member States will need to earmark part of their budget for this sector and I agree with the report, which encourages the use of the Structural Funds for investment in the health sector; it is a very good proposal and I urge all the Member States, especially the new Member States, to make use of this facility.
However, we too at Community level need the financing we have requested if we are to be able to implement the programmes we propose.
I am aware of Parliament's positive stand in this sector and I am depending on its support with the problems which exist as regards the adoption of the financial perspectives for the next budget.
I should also like to say that we need to understand that many issues fall within the competence of the Member States: the provision of medical services, the health systems, all this is the responsibility of the Member States.
As I have already said, we shall make use of all the non-legislative means we have at our disposal to promote policy in these sectors.
However, the reference made earlier, for example, to the question of breast cancer screening â that it has not yet been implemented in all the Member States â highlights precisely one weakness.
I believe that collecting and publishing data and information for the Member States in these sectors will create significant pressure on them to implement precisely these recommendations and the guidelines which they agree with.
To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once again on this initiative.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrsÂ Honeyball, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on options for developing the European schools system (2004/2237 (INI)) (A6-0200/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the House for giving me the opportunity to present this report.
It is an important report in terms of the schools which the European institutions run principally for the children of staff who work in the institutions.
It is quite an undertaking these days.
At the moment there are over 19Â 200 pupils in fourteen European schools in ten locations, including Brussels and Luxembourg.
Therefore, we have a responsibility here to make sure that these schools are providing the best education possible, in the best way, making best use of the resources and using the teaching staff and the curriculum in the best possible way.
That is what I have sought to look at in my report, and it is important that we consider these issues at this point because these schools were in fact set up about fifty years ago and, although there have been times when they have been looked at, essentially not very much has changed in that time.
So we now have an opportunity to look at these schools, the way they are run, their governance, their funding and the curriculum, and make recommendations for improvements.
In my report, I have specifically looked at those areas, that is to say, at finance, governance and government of the schools, at the curriculum and the way that it is taught within the schools.
First of all I would like to raise the question of finance.
Mr BÃ¶sch is here who in fact did a report a couple of years ago on this subject and I think he will want to talk further on this.
However, it is important that we look at the way the schools are funded and make sure that we are using our funds to the very best advantage.
A particular area I would like to highlight is the way that teachers are employed.
At the moment, teachers are seconded from Member States to teach in the European schools for a certain period of time after which many of them go back to their own Member States.
Given the way the schools are organised, in that in addition to mother-tongue teaching, there is teaching of certain subjects in Community languages, the system as it stands at the moment places an unfair burden on English-speaking countries, which provide proportionately more teachers because there is a demand within the European schools for English teaching.
I hope, as a result of this report, that particular issue will be taken on board.
The other thing which is important under the âFinanceâ heading is the question of fees and the way that the structure of payments works.
Children of employees of the European institutions do not have a fee levied on them, which is absolutely right because that is the reason why the schools were set up.
However, these days, many school places, not the majority, but very many places in the schools, are filled by children from outside the European institutions.
There are a significant number who come from other government-type institutions and from local industry.
They are generally paid for by the organisation which sends them.
So that does not present too many problems.
But where there are real difficulties is in the remaining pupils, who are chosen by what appears to be a fairly random method and pay a proportion of the fees themselves â their families pay for them.
This system has come in for considerable criticism because it is not transparent and very often the fees levied are not sufficient, they are not actually reflecting the market rates.
Turning to the question of governance, I would like to see the administrative boards which govern the schools have more autonomy.
In terms of curriculum, the main thing is that we reduce class sizes so that no class within the European schools is more than thirty; at the moment the maximum is thirty-two.
So I commend this report to you and I ask for your support.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Honeyball, your report considers some very sensitive matters and I have already encountered the difficulty which you mentioned in your introductory remarks.
It is a very controversial issue and sometimes I ask myself why I am here on this side and not on your side asking the questions, because the European schools are quite autonomous bodies with autonomous structures, which decide a lot of these questions by themselves.
The Commission is fully committed to the cultural specificity of the European schools.
It therefore endorses most of the points made in this report, since the sound functioning of the European school system is our common objective.
As regards the budgetary features, we would like to ensure accountability for all actors through transparency, planning and control and therefore sound and efficient use of our citizens' money.
I understand people's frustration sometimes when everything comes down to money, but we must understand that in many cases the devil lies in the detail of these financial matters and they must be handled properly.
On governance aspects, I am very pleased to note that the report calls for greater representation for the EU institutions on the Board of Governors, more in line with the role they play and with the EU's financial contribution, currently at EURÂ 127Â million, that is, roughly 60% of the overall budget.
Experience has shown that the 1994 Convention is no longer equipped to meet the challenges relating to enlargement and its consequences.
I trust therefore that I can rely on your support for improving the current governance mechanism.
I am also pleased to see that we share the same concerns as regards children with special educational needs, in line with the measures advocated by the rapporteur on this subject.
Only by progressing in this manner and by making appropriate resources available will we be able to ensure a truly human and inclusive approach.
As far as a European baccalaureate is concerned, I agree with the view that all Member States should be called on to ensure that it becomes more widely available.
When designing the appropriate processes, however, we must be careful to ensure that the same quality standards are met.
I agree that efforts should be pursued to allow European schools to offer, as an alternative, a leaving certificate for pupils who choose to follow a more vocational education.
Nevertheless, I would like to stress the Commission's concerns in a number of areas.
With regard to the financial aspects, we should find ways to seriously and concretely improve the management and reporting.
I still believe that the idea of establishing a yearly ceiling on the Community contribution to the European schools should be carefully considered, as some Members have stressed.
I also believe that it is important to apply and to revise the so-called criteria, which have been adopted after careful discussion by the Board of Governors, the decision-making body of the European school system.
If we are to ensure the maintenance of the European school system as defined in its founding convention, we must have the courage to address the question of the future of those European schools that no longer fulfil the objectives for which they were initially created, without excluding any option.
I do understand the various expectations following enlargement, but the answer cannot be a systematic creation of new schools for which no justification exists.
That would be in complete contradiction with the mission and the spirit of the European school system.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank our rapporteur, MrsÂ Honeyball, for her report and her frank collaboration.
The European schools system has proved its worth.
Having paid particular attention to the Luxembourg school, I would like to congratulate the teachers and the management who have succeeded in bringing together, under the same system, children and teachers from the various Member States of the European Union.
Multilingualism has also been able to prove its worth, just as one school system for the various EU nationalities has done, in spite of temporary overcrowding in the schools in Luxembourg and Brussels.
Should we not, Commissioner, evaluate in the medium term the European schools system and expand the multilingual education model, encouraging the Member States to become more involved in it by drawing on the experience of the European schools?
Furthermore, I believe that any country that puts itself forward to house an agency should be required to commit itself to ensuring that the children of the officials it is accommodating receive a multilingual education.
Ghettoisation of the schools by only admitting pupils whose parents are sufficiently wealthy to pay the fees already required in CategoryÂ III should therefore be prevented.
For the 2004 academic year, 32% of the overall pupil intake â that is to say a third of the children â belonged to that category, for which the fees are very high.
That is why I have tabled an amendment to reduce Category III fees for future pupils too.
Our committee is calling for class sizes to be reduced, special needs pupils to be admitted and a technical baccalaureate to be introduced.
While the aim of the European schools system is to provide an education for the children of officials that does not neglect their mother tongue, this aim does, nonetheless, deserve a rethink in light of the mobility already achieved within the European Union and of what it will be in future.
MrÂ President, although a British minister declared in 1998 that English would shortly be the universal language â the price paid by English teachers will perhaps be that of being in demand â I am of the opinion that multilingualism is part of European identity.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European schools are important to the identity-building process and also to the making of a true European citizenship.
Europe â the EU â is an ongoing building process and its construction has been undertaken in a complex manner.
Education plays a very important and fundamental role.
Different EU education systems are entitled to spread the ideals and values that Europe has traditionally inspired.
From this, it will help to set up a sense of common European citizenship.
The defence of pluralism and diversity has always been one of the core values that have influenced the European Union.
This is one of the myriad of reasons why a stateless nation's citizens continually advocate the whole idea of Europe; we regard Europe as our national environment.
EU enlargement has provided all of us with a new challenge for European schools.
This has to do with a new European Union facing its work.
Such a moment will entail greater plurality and a healthy breath of fresh air for European schools.
In a truly pluralist Europe, I consider that real multilingualism cannot be just partially expressed and the real linguistic plurality of our continent has to be uncovered.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst I do not believe that the United Kingdom should be part of the EU, it would be quite wrong of me to deny the right of those parents who work for the qualifying institutions â in most cases outside their country of origin and in many cases in a country that does not share their mother tongue â to give their children a suitable education.
The European schools provide the only practical way for many such parents to exercise that right.
I have no quibbles there.
In most respects, the rapporteur has considered the European schools in the same proper light.
It would be churlish of me not to say so.
I do, however, differ from her on one or two points.
First of all, the rapporteur defines Category I pupils as children of staff in the service of Community institutions and bodies.
There is a significant omission here.
Category I status also covers children of the staff of the UK Atomic Energy Authority seconded to the joint European tourist projects in Culham, near Oxford, and children of staff covered by the service regulations of the European Patent Office in Munich.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority is most certainly not a Community institution and, furthermore, the joint European tourism project involves one EU pre-accession state, Romania, and one completely non-EU state, Switzerland.
As for the European Patent Office, it covers Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and will soon bring in Norway.
As I had to stress during the debate on computer patents, that means that it is most assuredly not a Community institution.
I am sad to have to make that point again so soon.
Too often we see an assumption in this Parliament that Europe and the EU are one and the same thing.
Here is another example.
This is not a trivial point in a general sense, nor is it trivial with specific regard to this report, because the rapporteur states that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are Category I. She may well be correct, but if she actually means that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are children of staff in the Community institutions then she could be very wide of the mark.
I hope she can clarify that statistic.
I am most concerned by the Commissioner's suggestion that the option of offering the European baccalaureate outside the current school system should be considered.
