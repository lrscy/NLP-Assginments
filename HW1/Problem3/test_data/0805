For this reason, I feel it would be right and proper for the Commission to pursue an approach to SMEs whereby the proposed deadline for projects undertaken by SMEs be cut to three years.
Small businessmen need to be flexible.
State aid is an important tool in regional development.
The reform of the rules should therefore be based on the principles of effectiveness, transparency and solidarity.
I support the drive towards such reforms.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to thank you and all the honourable Members for the close cooperation between Parliament, through its Committee on Regional Development and its rapporteur, Mr Koterec, and the Commission on this important issue.
In the new draft regional aid guidelines, two principles have been of fundamental importance.
Firstly, there is the need to provide a solid contribution to the cohesion policy of the Union by ensuring the maximum possible coherence with the structural fund regulations.
Second, there is the need to implement the conclusions of successive European Councils calling for less and better-targeted aid, following the general approach set out in the state aid action plan.
I am confident that this reform, which is only a first step in our overall review of state aid rules, will constitute an important contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda and the restoration of European competitiveness, and will act as a driver for the virtuous circle of economic growth, better standards of living and more and better jobs.
I look forward to the next stage of the wider debate: this is not the last evening that we will be discussing this issue.
The next stage of the wider debate will come when Parliament discusses the state aid action plan next year.
It is in that context that I take note of several of the comments in the report relating to more wide-ranging issues, such as those mentioned by a couple of honourable Members: block exemptions, the de minimis thresholds and the general rules applicable to small and medium-sized enterprises.
I would also like to remind you that important amounts of aid to small and medium-sized enterprises may be granted anywhere, including outside the assisted areas.
Aid for research, for development, for training and for environmental protection is also available for large companies wherever they are located, subject to a number of conditions.
The âstatistical effect regionsâ are regions with less than 75% of EU-15 GDP per capita but more than 75% of EU-25 average GDP per capita.
De facto they go up to 82.2% EU-25 GDP per capita.
Under the draft guidelines these regions will benefit from ArticleÂ 87(3)(a) status and a 30% aid intensity for aid to large companies for the first part of the programming period as well as the possibility of granting operating aids.
The situation of these regions will be subject to a mid-term review if their GDP has fallen below the 75% EU-25 GDP per capita.
They will continue to benefit from ArticleÂ 87(3)(a) and from operating aid.
Otherwise they will be eligible under ArticleÂ 87(3)(c) with an aid intensity of 20% and they will benefit from transitional provisions.
In particular they will be able to continue granting operating aid for two additional years.
Therefore, all statistical effect regions will continue to be eligible for regional aid for the whole programming period, either as ArticleÂ 87(3)(a) or as ArticleÂ 87(3)(c) regions.
Our discussions this evening and the amendments tabled to the motion for a resolution lead me to add three more specific points.
Firstly, it remains essential to focus regional aid on the neediest regions.
That also means defining well balanced and distinctively shaded aid intensities.
Secondly, increasing the safety net would risk going against the principle of the exceptional nature of regional aid and might endanger the objective of giving the assisted regions a real boost compared to others.
Thirdly, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring that investment remains in a region for the time necessary to contribute to development, and overly restrictive obligations on the investing companies, which would become a disincentive to investment.
Regional aid is de facto cofinanced by structural funds in new Member States; old Member States generally use their own budget.
A cut in the financial perspective as well as an increase in population coverage would be anti-cohesion and I would like to underline that.
I will close by simply noting that, on a subject as important as this, any reform can only be successful if it is built on a broad consensus amongst stakeholders.
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is an active contributor in this.
Again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koterec, and the members of his team, for all their work.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  â State aid is devoted to particularly less-favoured regions and helps, in a more focused way than other policies, to foster the Lisbon, Gothenburg and Barcelona objectives.
It is therefore an important tool available to Member States to assist poorer regions, such as those impacted by the so-called statistical effect following enlargement, or less-favoured regions such as islands or mountainous areas.
The reduction and better targeting of state aid are vital factors in promoting effective competition, but care is needed with the parameters proposed in this new approach.
They impose excessively high differentials between the 15 and the new Member States, leading to a waste of incentives.
This will prejudice subsequent success in attracting new companies, cause the relocation of uncompetitive companies able to survive only with the help of subsidies, and create unjustified competition among the poorest areas of Europe.
It is therefore necessary to restore more limited aid levels and reduce the differentials between the maxima of less-developed regions.
Lastly, the accent needs to be placed on the planned âflexibilityâ for aid to large companies.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the European Council in Brussels on 15 and 16 December, including the Development Strategy.
To this end, we welcome the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.
No member of the Council is here yet, unfortunately: they must be finishing off their preparation of the new British proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to rise on a point of order, to offer the Presidency the opportunity to request that this debate be rescheduled for this afternoon.
It is my understanding that the President-in-Office, the European Affairs Minister, intended to be with us this morning to discuss the preparations for the Presidency and yet the Presidency-in-Office did not intend to unveil its budget proposals until this afternoon.
We have had the great pleasure of debating with one of the more assiduous and intelligent European Affairs Ministers who has come before this House.
To engage in some kind of shadow boxing when we do not know what the proposals are seems to me to be really quite ridiculous and a waste of our time.
The Presidency-in-Office is not here to be able to make this request.
I hope it will be here later.
Mr President, I hope you will seek an assurance from the Presidency-in-Office that it will have proper debate with us and outline what it intends to put to the Council as a budget proposal.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Watson.
For the moment, we would not be so much boxing shadows as boxing a void, because the representative of the Council is not yet here.
Nevertheless, I have been told that he is on his way and that there are traffic problems.
I therefore assume that he will be here in a few minutes.
With regard to your request for the Council to refer in its speech to the new proposal which is apparently going to be made public today, I must inform you that yesterday, at the lunch to mark the end of their Presidency, I asked the British Presidency to do that, since it would appear strange to Parliament that a new proposal that is going to be made public today should not be included in the debate, since it would surely be a merely formal debate.
I did not receive a guarantee but I did note a degree of understanding that I imagine will in practice lead, at least, to a foretaste of what the Presidency is going to say later.
If that is not the case, I certainly believe that Parliament would have good reason to feel under-valued.
Furthermore, I do not believe that we should suspend the sitting now, Mr Watson, since I know that the Minister will be with us very soon.
I hope that the common sense and sense of humour of which the British are so proud will help them in their speech and that they can tell us what is going to happen later.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to convince you that tomorrowâs European Council is a crucial stage for Europe.
We identified the immediate challenges at Hampton Court; we must now provide ourselves with the resources to meet these challenges, and that is what is at stake in the financial perspective.
I will return to the financial perspective shortly, but allow me first of all to say a few words about other important issues to be addressed at the European Council.
At Hampton Court, we discussed the way in which Europe can prepare itself for globalisation.
We agreed to restart our work in several areas, in particular research, universities, demographics, energy, immigration, security and external relations.
I will report to the European Council on the work under way following the informal summit.
In this context, I would draw your attention to a few key issues.
Yesterday, the Commission put the finishing touches to the revision of its sustainable development strategy.
The aim is to increase the level of ambition of this strategy by making sure that the latter is implemented more effectively.
The most important factors are as follows: to see to it that all Community policies are underpinned by the principles of sustainable development; to make a firm commitment to accomplish the aims by scheduling regular meetings between our institutions with a view to taking stock of the situation and of reviewing the Member Statesâ practices; and more systematically to involve the main actors in the area of sustainable development, and not only the institutions, but also the world of business â which must make significant efforts â as well, of course, as the regional and local authorities.
The Commission will work closely with Parliament and the Council to prepare as well as possible for this important stage.
You can count on my personal commitment and on that of the College.
In this context, the success of the Montreal Conference comes as very welcome news.
It shows that the European Commissionâs and the European Unionâs leadership in the context of climate change has borne fruit.
I shall now turn to the issue of growth and employment in the context of the new Lisbon Strategy.
The Commission is pleased to observe that the renewed strategy for growth and employment is now well under way.
The national programmes that have been established show that the Lisbon Strategyâs new system of governance is beginning to be integrated by the Member States.
I should now like, for my part, to note the following points: there is clearly a very close link between the economic challenges we identified at the informal summit and those that the Member States are identifying in their national programmes.
The Commission will assume all of its responsibilities in its report in January by explaining in a clear and constructive way the strengths and weaknesses of these national programmes.
It will also make sure that it singles out good ideas and practices that everybody could use.
Another important, and extremely topical, issue is that of immigration.
The Commission is determined to make progress in the development of a horizontal approach to migration issues.
This approach would consist of looking at immigration from the angle of prosperity, solidarity and security within the European Union and of doing so in close cooperation with the third countries concerned.
This is the spirit of the communication on an action programme relating to legal immigration, which the College is to debate next week.
The Commission also welcomes the comprehensive strategy to combat terrorism, which should result from the forthcoming European Council.
The instruments recently proposed by the Commission with regard to information exchange, the interoperability of databases or the protection of critical infrastructure should be adopted and implemented as soon as possible.
We desperately need these instruments in order to strengthen the effectiveness of our action.
This is, once again, one of the areas in which there is distinct European added value when viewed in the light of the contribution Europe can make to the action carried out at national level.
Finally, I am very pleased that the three institutions should be in agreement on the initiative taken by the Commission with regard to the European consensus for development.
As you know, this consensus will also â we hope â be the subject of the European Council conclusions.
For the first time in 50 years of cooperation, this European consensus for development defines a common set of values, principles, aims and resources designed to eradicate poverty.
With the adoption of the European Parliamentâs resolution on the European Unionâs development policy statement, this consensus becomes a genuine European tripartite statement on development.
Today, the seal is set on an agreement promoting development.
We must now take the promises of extra money and apply them in specific ways in the real world.
The Commission will actively call on the Member States to honour their commitments.
We not only made these commitments between ourselves, but also at the United Nations.
Once again, we are proud, as Europeans, to champion this dossier at international level, but we must now turn this ambition and these commitments into practical measures.
I am now going to speak to you about the of this European Council: the financial perspective.
As you know, whenever I speak about financial matters I switch to English!
I have been doing that for the last month, so I shall now continue in English.
We all know what is at stake this week.
This is the opportunity for Europe to show its citizens that it is capable of deciding on tough issues, that it can meet their expectations and that it will hold true to its values. The Commission has set out its ideas.
Parliament has done the same. Now we are waiting for the Council.
Any further delay and implementation of our policies will be delayed.
Policies delayed are policies denied.
I know that there are other technical options for keeping spending programmes going, but let us be frank: these are temporary measures only.
The Europe of today needs greater security and ambition for its new priorities.
The Commission is playing its role.
To unblock negotiations in October, I set out five proposals which have helped to kick-start discussions.
On Monday I set out to Prime Minister Blair and other national leaders and to the President of this Parliament principles and 12 specific proposals to reach what I believe can be an ambitious and fair agreement this week on the financial perspectives.
I welcome the support I have received within this House and amongst the Member States for the Commissionâs position.
I want to set out today where the European Council should focus its attention in the coming days.
We need an ambitious Europe.
The Hampton Court Summit showed the scale of the challenges before us and the role which the European Union must play in meeting them.
But we must be coherent.
Having defined the objectives, the Member States must now provide the means to achieve them.
To support enlargement, we need investment; to support reform and modernisation, we need investment; to increase trade liberalisation, we need investment.
Ambition is not realised through communiquÃ©s and great and grand statements.
It needs action. And action needs means and instruments.
Europeâs credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is.
A modern budget needs to recognise the realities of an enlarged Europe, so it must support growth, with cohesion policy focused on competitiveness.
It must support Europeans adjusting to globalisation, immigration and the threats to security.
It must avoid reversing recent reforms, such as the shift to rural development in agriculture, and it cannot downgrade the essential task of reconnecting with our citizens.
HeadingÂ 3b of the financial perspectives is not an optional extra; it is of central importance to the Unionâs work.
There is another direct consequence of a tight budget. It makes it all the more essential that every euro be used to best effect, and seven years is a long time.
We must not close the door to sensible adjustments in the future.
With our original proposals, the emphasis Parliamentâs resolution put on flexibility was prudent: at much lower levels it is indispensable.
The European Council must leave room for these issues to be debated within Parliament and the Council, as the two arms of the budgetary authority.
The principle of flexibility should be carried through to the review clause.
I said in June that this will be essential in reaching a deal.
I remain convinced of that.
We need a comprehensive, ambitious and open review clause.
Of course, any change must be agreed unanimously, but it is essential that this Commission and this Parliament have the opportunity to launch a genuine debate, without taboos, about the future of the European Unionâs spending and resources.
The budget also needs to be fair: fair in spending, but fair in contributions too.
I think that we have come a long way in this respect, with a true recognition that the impact of enlargement on the budget has changed the situation.
Now we need one further step to ensure that the burden of that impact is genuinely shared.
That means further movement from the British side on their abatement. That will be crucial to reaching an agreement.
That change should be linked to enlargement and, since this enlargement is permanent, so should the change be permanent, just as it was when the United Kingdom agreed changes to its abatement in 1988 and 1999.
One aspect of last weekâs proposals which concerns the Commission is the creation of parallel rules: one set for the Europe of 15, one set for the rest.
This creates a very unfortunate effect.
A two-speed cohesion policy, with one set of rules focused on competitiveness and another on financial transfers, is not the way to build a competitive Europe or a cohesive Europe.
We need to ensure the coherence of our instruments.
If there is some differentiation â and in some cases we need differentiation â it should be based on objective criteria in terms of the relative development of the Member States or the different regions, and not on those who were already members and new members.
The European Union we want to build is not the European Union of old members and new members, it is a Union of all members with exactly the same dignity, and that is a very important point.
Making exceptions and special arrangements not only undermines coherence, it creates new risks for financial management.
As you know, we take our accountability to this House and to the public at large very seriously.
We take seriously the fiscal pressure on the Member States.
The Commission made great efforts to develop a package of measures which were simple and comprehensible and will permit high standards of control.
Alongside the revised financial regulation, they aim to make programmes more user-friendly and more efficient, so I regret that the principles of value for money and sound financial management seem to be sacrificed in order to achieve an agreement.
The proposals on managing cohesion policy and voluntary modulation must be revised.
Sound management can also be undermined if cost-cutting takes the easy way out and targets administration.
It is simply not credible to suddenly bring to an end the process of bringing our institutions up to speed with the last enlargement, and still less credible to make zero provision for Bulgaria and Romania.
I have to tell you, very frankly, that I know it is very easy and popular â I would say demagogic â whenever there is a need to make some cuts, to make those cuts in the administration.
But in the next financial perspectives, we have to accommodate Bulgaria and Romania in all the institutions: in the Commission, in Parliament, in all the rest.
I have to say that we do not have the resources now for that.
So, if you want to have Bulgaria and Romania, we should have this in our budget.
I know that you share many of the concerns I have set out today.
I know this because many of them echo your own resolution and your own comments.
I welcome Parliamentâs position.
It contains sound principles and imaginative solutions which can only make agreement more likely and results more effective.
I am determined to do everything I can to help the European Council reach agreement this week.
I urge the Presidency, with its special responsibility, and the Member States to show the courage and determination to reach a deal which matches our ambitions.
I fervently hope that when I address the Conference of Presidents next week our task will be to chart the path towards an interinstitutional agreement that will take Europe into the next decade with real confidence.
But we must do that with confidence and ambition.
I myself, you in this House, and, I hope, all here today will always reject the narrow, nationalistic vision of a mini Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin by apologising to honourable Members for the momentary delay in my arrival here from the airport this morning.
Let me also assure this House that I have listened with great care to the statement that we have just heard from the President of the Commission and I look forward to the contributions of honourable Members to this important and timely debate that we are having here today ahead of the European Council.
This weekâs European Council in Brussels takes place at the end of a tumultuous year for the European Union.
It has been a year in which the voters of France and the Netherlands rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty; a year in which the need for Europe to face the realities of a globalised economy has become ever clearer; and most tragically, a year in which terrorism has once again struck in the streets and trains of a European capital.
But Europe has responded.
We have developed a clearer sense of our common response to globalisation.
We have shown a sheer determination, which Mr Schulz has been generous enough to acknowledge in previous debates in this Chamber, in the face of terrorism which has reaffirmed the strength of our solidarity, our democratic values and our common resolve to see those values triumph.
We have asserted Europeâs truly global role and responsibility, whether it is in New York, in Montreal last week, the Gaza Strip, or in Aceh, Indonesia.
The United Kingdom has been truly proud to hold the Presidency of the Council during these last six months.
Let me put on record, on this occasion, our gratitude to the Members of this Parliament for the cooperation they have shown in facing this challenging but shared agenda.
The primary task facing the European Council this week is both necessarily and appropriately to agree the financial perspectives of the European Union for 2007-2013, to which the President of the Commission directed the majority of his remarks this morning.
It has always been one of the key challenges of our Presidency.
Following the failure to reach political agreement last June, we listened to the calls of those, not least in the new Member States, who underlined the importance of agreement being reached by the European Council this year, and we have worked long and hard towards that end.
The proposals we put on the table a week last Monday, which were discussed by foreign ministers first in the informal conclave last week and then again briefly at the General Affairs Council this week, are challenging for Member States â I acknowledge that â and so, too, will be the revised proposals which we will table later today.
Those revised proposals will be realistic, too, given the budgetary context in which most Member States are now operating nationally.
Let me be candid: the room for negotiation is narrow.
We remain convinced, on the basis of our extensive consultations with other Member States, including at the level of Heads of Government over the last week when a number of Heads of Government came to London and there was a range of bilateral contact beyond London, that these proposals remain the best and only basis for agreement within the Council and subsequent discussion with Parliament.
They are an important and necessary step in the direction of a modern, reformed budget, fit for the purposes of the 21st century, about which our Prime Minister spoke so eloquently on the eve of the British Presidency at the European Parliament.
The review we propose to hold of all Community expenditure in 2008 and 2009 offers us a chance to assess the global and domestic challenges which the Union faces, where and how Community action and spending can best add value to national and regional efforts, and how the resources to sustain that spending can be most fairly found.
It is an important opportunity for us all, for this Parliament, for the Council and the Commission and our European citizens, to consider the best way forward.
Amidst all the debate in the press and the media, let us keep our eyes on the very considerable prize before us: a budget that enshrines a fundamental shift of spending towards the new Member States, EURÂ 260Â billion in receipts for the new Member States over the next seven years, EURÂ 2Â 500 for every man, woman and child.
The economic dynamism of those new Member States is already truly an inspiration for us all.
The new flexibilities we have proposed for the structural and cohesion funds should ensure that more of the allocations to new Member States can be spent and that each euro absorbed by Member States, their regions and their cities can have more impact.
This will deliver greater improvements in the infrastructure and skills which this Union collectively will need if it is to rise to the global economic challenge and if it is to deliver the social justice which all of our people rightly demand.
Future financing lies at the heart of this weekâs European Council, but it is not the only issue, so let me briefly touch on other points to be discussed by our Heads of Government this week.
First, there is the follow-up to the October informal Heads of Government meeting at Hampton Court.
At the summit we agreed to make more concrete progress in a series of key areas: boosting research and development with the creation of a European research council; improving our universities and their links with business; creating a more competitive energy market; examining how migration can boost our economy; how we can use more extensive and better quality child care to give people a fairer balance between work and family life; how we can re-skill workers to meet the global challenge, and how we can strengthen Europeâs place in the world and our collective security.
President Barroso and High Representative Solana will report back to Heads of Government on the progress made and on the next steps.
Let me pay tribute to the work that they have already done and the close cooperation they have offered on those and so many other issues in the course of our Presidency.
Secondly, there is the issue of economic reform.
Here we continue to work closely with the Commission in pursuing the jobs and growth agenda for Europe.
This has borne fruit these last few months with the launch of the Lisbon national reform programmes, setting a forward-looking agenda of reforms for every Member State.
The summit will welcome this progress, as well as the significant steps taken already on the issue of better regulation.
That includes simplifying European Union legislation, both for citizens and for European businesses, and underlining our common responsibility as Council, Commission and Parliament to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens.
Thirdly, we will adopt a Europe-wide counter-terrorism strategy, creating a clear and coherent framework for the European Unionâs work on counter-terrorism and setting out concrete objectives for action.
The strategy enhances the European Unionâs work to prevent people turning to terrorism.
We will adopt an action plan to tackle radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist organisations.
It will work to protect further the European Union citizens and infrastructure.
We will put in place a programme for protecting critical infrastructure right across Europe from terrorist attack. It improves the European Unionâs efforts to disrupt terrorists and their terrorist networks, in particular combating terrorist financing.
The strategy will help the European Union build its ability to respond to a terrorist attack by improving our crisis management capability and coordination.
The Council hopes that we will have reached agreement on the measure on data retention, on which we have worked very closely and effectively with this Parliament in recent days and months.
Next, the summit will set out a global approach to migration.
This is an approach that learns the lessons of the events of the last few months and is informed by the discussions we had here in the plenary debate in October.
It focuses on the problems of Africa and the Mediterranean but does not exclude the important and necessary cooperation which we need to foster with other regions.
It identifies priority actions for the Union to take so as better to help countries of origin and transit to manage migration better and to combat illegal immigration.
Fifthly, let me highlight the regular report on European security and defence policy to the Council.
The report will register the difference our European missions are already making on the ground, including the two latest missions: in Aceh â our first in Asia â and on the Rafah border crossing in Gaza, a practical manifestation of the Unionâs longstanding commitment to the lives and freedoms of the Palestinian people.
The European Council is also expected to adopt an overarching declaration on that area of the world â the Middle East.
This will renew our commitment to a secure, prosperous and peaceful Middle East, as well as our efforts to support political, social and economic reform within that region.
The declaration will reflect what the European Union has achieved over the course of our Presidency: the first ever EuroMed Summit in November, which has set the agenda for our future relations with our southern Mediterranean neighbours, support for disengagement from Gaza, building Palestinian institutional and security capacity, launching the European Union border assistance mission to Rafah and increased European Union engagement with Iraq.
But it will also set out the continued challenges that we face in that region: the search for peace between Israel and its neighbours, the political processes within Iraq and Lebanon, Iranâs nuclear programme â a subject that we have debated here in this Chamber â and ending support for groups that use violence.
Let me just pause here to note that the Presidency has been unequivocal in its condemnation of the comments attributed to President Ahmadinejad of Iran which relate to Israel, firstly saying that Israel should âbe wiped off the mapâ and then denying the Holocaust and calling for Israel to be removed to Europe.
The comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly.
They have no place in civilised political debate.
Finally, Heads of State or Government will also adopt a comprehensive global strategy for Africa, tackling peace and security, governance, regional integration, trade and development assistance.
It will refocus the Unionâs relationship with Africa to cover the whole continent.
It will be a fitting end to a year in which the continent has taken centre stage in the European Union and internationally, and in which we have seen extraordinary popular calls for change throughout Europe to make poverty history.
The European consensus on development is the second theme of todayâs debate.
It is right that we should return to the subject of development as we approach the end of this year and the end of this Presidency.
Over the course of the year the European Union â already the largest provider of global aid â has again demonstrated the leading role which it plays in this area of work.
The European Union set the tone for the Millennium Review Summit with its commitment from the International Development Ministers to increase aid back in June, a decision that was then ratified by Ecofin.
As the consensus on development shows, however, this is not the time for us to rest on our laurels: we must not only spend the money but also spend that money well.
This tripartite declaration sets out the aims and principles guiding European Union development cooperation efforts.
The first part is a political declaration that sets out common objectives, principles and methods for delivering development cooperation at both Member State and Community level.
The second part guides the implementation of development aid at Community level.
The Council and the Commission agreed the consensus on 22Â November, following extensive discussions between all relevant European Union institutions and after consultation with other key stakeholders, including European civil society.
We hope Parliament will agree to this today so that it can be a truly joint tripartite declaration.
The Presidency would like to extend particular thanks to the rapporteur, MrÂ Wijkman, for his commendable efforts to ensure Parliamentâs substantive and constructive input to this important text.
This agreement would be the first time we would have a common European Union approach to development, which will guide the actions of the Community and all 25 Member States.
The consensus focuses squarely on poverty eradication to help meet the Millennium Development Goals, on partner country ownership, on ensuring we provide more effective aid and on joined-up policies to promote development.
This agreement is particularly important, given that the European Union already provides over half of all global aid and is set to provide two thirds of aid by 2015 on the basis of the commitments that have now been made.
The consensus also sets out a revised EC development policy which clarifies the Commissionâs role and establishes where it adds value.
It ensures that we give priority to the poorest countries and that we take into account development objectives in all other policy-making that affects developing countries.
The consensus is an important political statement, against which all parties can be held to account.
I hope that it will receive your support.
This will, frankly, be an important but difficult European Council, but, approached with flexibility and vision, we can make significant progress on some of the most important issues facing the Union and set the scene for further work by our Austrian and Finnish colleagues in the coming year.
I will listen with great interest to the points that you make and ensure that they are narrated back ahead of what will be important discussions in Brussels towards the end of this week.
Â Â  Minister, as I imagine you know, this plenary sitting is intended to prepare for the European Council that will take place this weekend.
The Presidency regrets that you have missed an opportunity to inform Parliament of the proposal that you are going to make shortly.
I asked this yesterday of your Minister responsible for relations with Parliament, and I believe that it is a shame that this request has not been granted, undoubtedly reducing the significance of this debate.
I regret that I did not take any notice of the proposal that you made at the beginning of the sitting, Mr Watson.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, that this Chamber is so splendidly decorated today is not in celebration of the achievements of the British Presidency, but because we shall shortly be welcoming the winners of the Sakharov Prize, who do so much, and so outstandingly, for the cause of human rights in the world.
That the President-in-Office has arrived rather late is not something I want to use as an occasion for criticism; it simply shows that he too is subject to human limitations, but it does also show, symbolically, how the Council generally is a latecomer where the practical politics of moving Europe forward are concerned, and, if we are to have the results we want for Europe, we would like the Council to get up earlier in the morning.
The President of the European Parliament said, to great applause, that it would be nice if we were to be informed about what is going on now.
I presume, Mr President-in-Office, that the fact that you waited until midday to present your proposals for the Financial Perspective indicates that you have chosen a time after this debate in order to allow what emerges from it to influence your proposals.
I hope that it will.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party would like to see a result for the Financial Perspective, but the crucial thing for us is that that result must be an acceptable one, and the reason why this is so is that Europe, after the difficulties we have had in various areas, needs renewed success.
We would point out, Mr President, that we have as yet nothing to show for it.
As you said, the President of the European Council, Tony Blair, gave an eloquent speech; indeed he did, and was applauded for it by many in my group, perhaps by more than in the group to which he politically belongs.
Style is, of course, important, and I would certainly concede that the British Presidency â whether in the person of the Home Secretary or any other minister, not to mention the Prime Minister and President of the European Council â has been good at getting its message across.
We have been getting along well with each other in this House, but style on its own is not enough.
If style is not backed up by political substance, then it is the substance that loses out and must come in for criticism from us, and that is why we hope that results will be forthcoming from what you do in Brussels tomorrow and the day after.
We were told by the British Prime Minister, the President of the European Council, that more must be done for research.
Indeed so, but it appears to me from the British Presidencyâs proposals that what is now provided for research is less than what Mr Juncker offered us.
Where, then, is the logic in what the British are doing?
We see it as crucial, and as cause for rejoicing by all of us, that there are among us representatives of the eight Central European countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.
We believe that it will be crucial to see whether what you on the Council propose â on the assumption that such a proposal is made â actually expresses European unity and solidarity, for if there is no such solidarity, we will be obliged to reject your proposal.
For us, solidarity and the community of Europeans come first and there can be no first- and second-class Europeans.
I am addressing the President of the Commission when I say that we very much appreciate his writing to the British Presidency on 12 December, and that we endorse what he had to say in that letter.
I have to tell the President-in-Office that the British rebate has had its day, and must therefore be reduced, the ultimate objective being that it should disappear altogether.
We are, of course, aware, that this is tied in with the agricultural policy, and that is why we are in favour of a review clause with the effect that the whole EU Budget for 2008â2009 would be re-examined, but what we must not allow to happen is for the Central Europeans, who need our solidarity most, to end up footing the bill for the British rebate.
That is not in your interests; it is not in our interests, and we will not agree to it.
We also demand that the European Parliamentâs legislative rights be taken seriously.
To take one example of which we have heard, we would remind you that promising money to the Hungarians for house-building touches upon this Houseâs rights, for it is we who have to pass the legislation that would make it possible for this to be done.
We therefore urge you to take this House, and its reforming goals seriously; we want to be able to make use of our right in both internal and external policy areas, and we will not allow the Council to disregard them.
Where Iran is concerned, we are right there by your side.
We must unequivocally express our opposition to Ahmadinejad and our support for Israel and its right to exist.
Those who call that into question are, in essence, also questioning the right of the Palestinians to live as they are entitled to, for, if you deny Israel the right to exist, you are opposing any sort of Palestinian state; the fact is that, without Israel, there will not be one.
So, in dealing with Iran, speak out against Ahmadinejad and in favour of peace in the Middle East; in this respect, we are one your side.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for us to have things out with the British Presidency of the Council.
It is time for us to get to grips with the politics of the European Council.
As Mr Barroso wrote in his letter to the Council, to which Mr Poettering referred, âWe need a strong and effective European Union, and I am prepared to fight for oneâ.
I recently had an interesting telephone conversation with Mr Barroso.
After reading an interview with him in the , and liking what I read, I phoned him up and said, âThat was a good interview; it was a pleasure to read itâ.
I have to admit that his response down the phone line was a sharp one.
He said, âWhenever you have criticisms of me, you write them in a newspaper; when you have something good to say about me, you phone me up.
Why not give me credit for something in public?â
Well, Mr President of the Commission, I am doing it now.
That is the right way to go about things â so fight!
An overwhelming majority in this House support your position and oppose the line we have just heard taken by the Council, which will not move Europe forward or foster cohesion, but will make for less solidarity in it.
That is something that this House will not take lying down!
I would like to come back to what Mr Alexander said to this House; he referred back to what the President of the Council said six months ago.
He was perfectly right in what he said, and we all heard him say it.
He said something important that Mr Alexander has not quoted, and so I will.
He said that, if there is a crisis in the European institutions, it is there because there is a lack of strong leadership in Europe.
Five and a half months later, Mr President-in-Office, I get the impression that that is still the case, and let me tell you what impression my group gets: whatever country holds the Presidency â not just the British â we always get told the same thing by the Presidents of the Council.
We are always told not to talk too loudly about Europe, not to plead its case too strongly, as it puts people off.
It is clear that if the Heads of State or Government constantly talk Europe down, they cannot be surprised when Europeâs peoples get the idea that their Heads of State or Government are right.
The state of affairs in the Council that you lament is one that you yourselves have brought about.
To put it bluntly, we have now had it up to here; things cannot go on like this.
In the European institutions generally, there is no crisis: Parliament acts and takes decisions; they may perhaps not always be the right ones, but, to take one example, a few days ago, we achieved a very good compromise on chemicals policy.
That was this European Parliament in action.
The Commission acts, perhaps not always in the right way, but it does take action; it is active.
The only people in Europe who are in a permanent state of disagreement are the members of the Council of Heads of State or Government, and things have now got to such a pass that they cannot even agree on their own order of business without fearing a veto.
If there is a crisis in the European Union, then it is above all a crisis in the European Council, and I hope there will be no repetition of it this weekend.
Fifty or sixty years ago, the European project did not call forth enthusiasm from all the peoples of Europe.
I was born where the borders of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium meet, and when, 60 years ago, Paul-Henri Spaak or the Dutch Prime Minister or the Head of the Luxembourg Government turned up there and said that the Germans were getting more funding from the Marshall Plan, that we had to rebuild the country and establish the European Coal and Steel Community, I do not suppose that all the Luxembourgers, Belgians, Dutch and French people burst into applause.
They, too, said, âWhat?
That lot on the other side were over here only recently, wrecking our country and killing millions of people, and now they are supposed to be getting more money?â
And the people in positions of government said, âIf you want peace in Europe, you have to have integration.
This is the only way to go, and it is the way we are going, because we are convinced that it is the right one.â
That is why we call them statesmen and name buildings after them.
There have indeed been times when Europe has been led by statesmen, but I get the impression that it is now led by businessmen whose only interest is in working out how much they can make out of the project.
That is what makes the European Summit this weekend such an important one.
It is not just about selling the new maths to Europe, for I have now learned that there is such a thing as new maths, according to which a reduced increase is the same thing as a reduction.
That, though, is wrong; slightly increasing the British rebate is not the same thing as reducing it.
That is certainly no way to bring about agreement; what really is needed instead is an attempt at putting Europeâs real needs in a financial framework.
While I am on the subject of financial frameworks, let me say that my colleague Mr Walter always does a brilliant job of analysing the things that are put before us.
In this Parliamentâs proposals, set out in the BÃ¶ge report, agricultural policy is given a share of 40% of the Financial Perspective over the next seven years.
The British proposal gives it 44%.
Our proposals are more up to date than what the Council has now put on the table.
If we are talking about modern policy, that much is clear.
Now, out of personal affection for the British Presidency of the Council, because the Labour Members are my friends and because I am very fond of you, Douglas, I will do something I do not usually do and speak English:
To avoid any misunderstanding, I will now speak in English Six months ago, Mr Alexander, we all applauded when the President-in-Office of the Council set out his vision for reform, including great investment in research, education and the hi-tech future for our Union, and you repeated it today.
In preparing these remarks today, I recalled what I learned at school about the United Kingdom: 10 April 1912 was the date of another launch of a hi-tech future for Europe.
The crowds applauded enthusiastically, as they did when Tony Blair spoke here five months ago.
They applauded enthusiastically as the symbol of that hi-tech future sailed from Southampton.
The symbol was, of course, the .
Today, we are on the .
The captain is not Edward John Smith, but Anthony Charles Lynton Blair.
Our captain has a huge advantage over poor Mr Smith. The iceberg is staring him in the face, but he still has time to avoid it.
To avoid this iceberg, Mr Alexander, you have to sail in the direction of the BÃ¶ge report.
To be absolutely clear, let me give you our iceberg coordinates: BÃ¶ge.
Certainly not 1.03%. That is the centre of the iceberg.
Do not sail in this direction or the and its crew will be lost.
Choose another route and do it urgently.
I strongly hope that, by the end of the week, Captain Blair will have avoided the iceberg and steered the British Presidency to a safe harbour and a secure financial future for the European Union.
Mr Alexander, that is what I wish.
Then you will have a successful British Presidency.
Otherwise we will fail altogether in Europe.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Schulz, the services of the House will verify the precise coordinates of the iceberg which sank the so that we can be sure that they were one zero three.
Â Â  . Mr President, two years ago today a letter was written to President Prodi.
It bore the signatures of one head of state â President Chirac â and five prime ministers: Balkenende, Blair, Persson, SchrÃ¶der and SchÃŒssel, four of whom, alas, are still in office today.
Signed with poison pens, it is the root of our problems today.
That letter called for a limit to EU spending of 1% of gross national income.
Those same heads of state and government simultaneously demanded of the Union policies that they are not prepared to finance.
They are Member State leaders who urge on the Union abroad but duck the debate at home; leaders who will the ends, but not the means.
Words like âunacceptableâ rarely flow from the very moderate lips of the Commission President, who is reportedly one of Mr Blairâs best friends, but the Commission and Parliament must be at one in rejecting a budget that puts the concerns of the accountants above the broader view of the boardroom.
I welcome MrÂ Barrosoâs letter to the Presidency-in-Office about this weekâs Council.
For Liberals and Democrats in this House, no deal is better than a bad deal.
Liberals and Democrats will not compromise Europeâs long-term interests.
We will not be implicated in creating a two-tier Europe.
What have the new Member States found in their brave new world?
A French President who tells them to shut up, a German Prime Minister who denies them their own tax policies and a British Presidency that moves the goalposts of solidarity.
What we expect from the Presidency is a budget that puts long-term strengths and common concerns above individual satisfaction and personal gain.
What it seems we will get is a proposal that will paralyse the Unionâs priorities and satisfy noÂ one.
President-in-Office, 1.03% of gross national income will not pay for our new policies or for enlargement.
This House understood that when we estimated the future financial needs at 1.08% of GNI, and that was a conservative estimate.
What about money for challenges, such as security?
What about the ambitions of the Lisbon Agenda?
Five years ago, we said we would raise research spending to 3% of GDP by 2010.
It has slipped down even further: to below 2% last year, compared to 2.5% in the USA and over 3% in Japan.
This is not just a budget for tomorrow.
It is a framework that will bind us until 2013.
It is a budget that must provide for competitiveness and jobs for our young people.
It is a budget that must pay for the social solidarity Europe wants.
Parliament should reject any Council agreement that does our Union down.
The Presidency has ambitions for a wider Council agenda.
I wish you success.
My group hopes that you will review the so-called war on terror.
Complicity of EU Member States in warfare using depleted uranium and white phosphorous, detention without trial, torture and turning a blind eye to a clampdown on the freedom of millions in countries with whom we cultivate strategic partnerships debases our Union.
Two days ago, the General Affairs Council called for a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism while respecting human rights.
Liberals and Democrats want the Council to restate the European Unionâs respect for the rule of law and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to mean it.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just learnt something this morning: even on a cold December morning, a May-time atmosphere can develop in a room, and I can suddenly see a spirit of revolt arise against the Council and against the governments. I find that very, very interesting.
MrÂ President, MrÂ Alexander, you spoke of MrÂ Blairâs eloquence.
I, on the other hand, would say that it is the inadequacy of the UK Presidency that is eloquent.
It is extraordinary, and if the policy you are proposing to us is truly on a par with the manner in which you exploit this Parliament and the European institutions when you need them â I am talking about data retention, which you cannot arrange for your own Parliament to approve, because you have the obligation and the duty to go via ours â if this is how you conceive of Europe, then I have one thing to say to you: not only will you fail â I do not care whether the UK Presidency fails â but Europe will also fail, and that is dangerous.
On the subject of the financial perspective: when you speak of reform proposals and of your desire to reform agriculture, you are, in reality, cutting funding for the development of rural areas.
These are the most modern aspects of our budget that you want to sacrifice!
Hold your applause; I fear that you will find less to applaud in what I am about to say.
You said something extraordinary: we need to be modern â there will be less applause heading my way right now â and yet what are you proposing to us?
Nuclear energy!
This is an energy source from the past, from the 1960s!
Do not stay in the 1960s.
Modernity means something else, namely hydrogen.
You have not understood a thing, and that is what is dangerous.
When a presidency has not understood a thing, it does just about anything.
â I would now like to say that in German, so that Mr Poettering and Mr Schulz can get my drift.
One thing is true: say to your governments what you have said to the Presidency today!
The fact of the matter is that these miserly governments, to which Mr Watson has already referred, and who do exactly what the Council wants of them, are part of the problem.
Tell Mr SteinbrÃŒck that things cannot go on the way they are!
In the days when the Greens were in government, I told them to make things public!
This finance ministerâs aspirations are a scandal!
Likewise, I have this to say to Mrs GrossetÃªte:
Tell MrÂ Chirac too: the defence of French agricultural policy, such as it is, is a scandal that does not help us make progress.
â It is not only the Presidency that bears responsibility for what happens, although it does share in it through being every bit as feeble and poor as the other governments in the Council.
It is not one whit better than any of them, but the governments that they represent are part of the problem, too.
Not when they are in here, but when they are out there, they form part of a total artwork called the Council â and what a total work of art that is!
I would now like to say something about two things that strike me as important in this connection.
Earlier on in this debate, reference was made to Iran.
Mr Poettering is right to say that what is said by that countryâs President touches and affects us all.
If, though, we are going to think about what to do about him, then I have an idea.
The fact of the matter, whether we like it or not, is that he is an elected President!
At present, the only effective way to get this discussed at last, would seem to be to consider the possibility or otherwise of excluding Iran from the World Cup.
That would spark off debate in Iran, and the debate would be a serious one.
Bread and circuses on the one hand, and everyone on the other being able to do and say what they like is something I regard as inconsistent.
It is that sort of debate that would bring home to people in Iran the reality of what their leadership is currently doing â cutting them off from the world!
If people are being cut off, that needs to be said and there must be no illusions about it.
This is also something that one might suggest that the Council Presidency might discuss, along with, ultimately, the war on terrorism.
Fighting against terrorism cannot mean fighting against democracy.
Do you understand?
It cannot mean fighting against democracy.
Having heard about the events involving the CIA here in Europe, I can tell you that this is not about fighting terrorists; this is about creating the conditions for bigotry.
We must stop the wrong fight against terrorism.
If you want to fight terrorists, please, come back to the rule of law and then you will have us, the Greens, on your side.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, last June, the majority of Parliament warmly welcomed MrÂ Blair.
Six months later, the chairmen of the political groups took a very unusual step and unanimously rejected his budgetary proposals on the grounds, I quote, âof a lack of solidarityâ.
The President of the Commission has just made a speech along the same lines, and our entire debate could not be clearer.
This turnaround in the situation ought to make the outgoing Presidency reflect.
The UK Presidencyâs offhand manner towards its partners in general and to the new Member States in particular has, this time round, crossed the threshold between what is acceptable and what is not.
How can one dare envisage resolving Britainâs internal political and budgetary quarrels on the back of the new Member States, which have the most need of Community funds, while at the same time professing to be the champion of enlargement?
On the one hand, the new Member States would be granted EURÂ 14 billion less in appropriations than what was proposed in the June compromise, the amount of which was itself meagre.
On the other hand, Great Britain, on account of its notorious rebate, would benefit from an extra EURÂ 12 billion in savings in comparison with what had been envisaged six months earlier.
This is a Thatcher-style touch that could cost us dear.
As for the desire expressed by the Presidency-in-Office to reform the CAP with a view to making it fairer, let us leave it to the 7 December issue of the to assess the sincerity of that desire.
I quote: âWhen the Commission proposed to set a ceiling on the size of the farms eligible for subsidies during the last reform of the CAP, the initiative was blocked by the United Kingdom because the latter has fewer small farms than the other Member Statesâ.
The great European principles of the current Presidency obviously stop at the point where major domestic interests come into play.
Thus, it took a fair amount of composure to look down on the new Member States, as MrÂ Straw did, by comparing the funds allocated to these countries in the forthcoming financial perspective to two Marshall Plans, even though, according to your Foreign Secretaryâs own figures, the cheque would, to all intents and purposes, amount to nothing less than a 2000-2013 Marshall Plan exclusively for Great Britain, the fifth global economic power.
This is no longer about Europe; it is about winning the lottery.
Let us not allow the bad old days of âI want my money backâ to return with a vengeance.
The letter from the six biggest net contributors announcing, two years ago, that they intended to limit future budgets to 1% of gross national product sadly re-opened this dead end.
MrÂ Blair leapt unrestrainedly into the breach.
We must arrest this wayward trend while there is still time.
It appears that we are in the middle of a period of reflection on the direction to be taken by the European adventure.
It seems to me that the time has come to choose between integration via the market and political integration, between fierce rivalry and solidarity and between capitulation and ambition.
We will soon see who really wants Europe.
Â Â  . â Mr President, if you sat down and deliberately tried to plan the family Christmas from hell, you could not do a better job than the British Presidency has managed to achieve in the last six months.
I am certain, Mr Alexander, that you have been very ably backed up by the utterly useless and treacherous Foreign Office sitting behind you, but perhaps this morning you as a great Europhile will begin to understand the reality about the UKâs position inside the European Union.
We have never been more isolated, more alienated, more disliked by our European neighbours in our entire history than we are today, sitting here in this Chamber this morning â and I guess that is why Mr Blair has sent you here today to do his dirty work.
Because he promised us back in June â did he not? â that he would report back to the European Parliament as often as he could.
Well he has not got the guts to turn up today.
Perhaps it is the abuse, I do not know.
Perhaps he is upset that Mr Barroso has likened him to the Sheriff of Nottingham.
I know that many of the new Member States think that Mr Blair is behaving like Ebenezer Scrooge.
Well, that is actually rather unfair because the British are still paying GBPÂ 30Â million a day into an organisation whose accounts have not been signed off for the last 11Â years in a row, and we are paying our fair share of the new underground system in Warsaw, and the sewers in Budapest, and goodness knows how many hectares of French farmland.
But the ghost of Christmas past for Mr Blair will be the spectre of failure.
He will not want history to see him coming out of a six-month Presidency without a deal and that is why there will be a deal.
There will be a further surrender of the British rebate.
And the only real victor in all of this is Mr Barroso!
And my goodness me, Mr Barroso, you could do with a few successes, could you not?
You wrote to Mr Blair on 20Â October with five proposals to relaunch negotiations, and the British Presidency has followed those to the letter, including accepting that in 2008 there will be a complete review of the EU budget, when the whole of the UK rebate will be on the table.
So there will be a deal over the next couple of days, but it will not settle the matter.
I have a positive proposal for all of you.
Yes, honestly!
Why do we not extend the British Presidency for a further six months?
Six more months of the Foreign Office, Mr Blair and Mr Alexander, six more months of this, and it will be obvious to all that the United Kingdom is a square peg in a round European hole.
A global trading nation that is very proud of its recent history does not belong, does not fit in with this club and, from your perspective, we are like the dog in the manger, are we not?
We are always holding you up.
We are always stopping you.
Get rid of us!
Kick us out!
Expel us!
You can then carry on with your projects and we can get back to running our own country.
It is not just a question of âwe want our money backâ â we want our country back!
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we can only regret the fact that we have learnt about the United Kingdomâs proposal for the Unionâs financial framework only at the end of its six-month presidency, as well as the fact that this new proposal has not even been put before this House today.
That really shows a lack of consideration towards Parliament, which has been flattered in words but scorned in deeds.
Europe is in difficulties today because of an international situation that has led the globalisation process to be managed rather than experienced naturally, and in which there occur serious breaches of the rules that constitute the only guarantee for honest trade and fair competition.
We all know that what is needed to reinvigorate Europe in this situation are political and economic measures based on appropriate budget lines.
That is why we might have hoped for a calmer and more thorough debate in the Council and in all the European institutions over the past few months.
Instead, this last-minute proposal, which is worse than the Luxembourg one, makes it even less likely that we can press ahead with the development policies and social policies that are needed to address the problem of over 40 million people living in poverty and over 20 million unemployed.
The UK proposal does not even take account of the geographical diversity of the Member States and cuts those Structural Funds that are vital to southern and eastern Europe.
This proposal lacks ambition and diminishes Europeâs role in the world.
Minister, you mentioned terrorism.
Well, to combat terrorism it is necessary not only to strengthen the structures for monitoring and fighting it, but also to improve living standards within the European Union and beyond, and to do that requires political will and funding, not just statements of good intentions.
The fact that President Barroso himself and the various Heads of State or Government have clearly stated their disagreement with the UK proposal, even though they are still negotiating, suggests that the proposal was probably put forward at the end of the mandate precisely because the United Kingdom is unwilling to realistically face up to the old problem of the UK rebate.
A decent agreement means that some countries must learn to give up certain privileges, even substantial ones, which they were guaranteed at a particular time in the Communityâs history under specific circumstances, and which at that time were justifiable.
In the absence of a new Treaty, the Union is in great need of a financial equilibrium that penalises no one and can usher in a new economic policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I almost feel sorry for Mr Alexander, but I am going to resist the temptation.
Last weekend the London published Mr Blairâs next speech in Brussels, which included the words: âhere you breathe the sweet smell of Belgiumâs unique brand of corruption, which it has generously bestowed on the rest of Europeâ.
Then it went on to anticipate what he might say to Mr Chirac the next time they meet: â Jacques, the proud upholder of the most immoral state-subsidised policy in human history â the GBPÂ 27Â billion-a-year common agricultural policyâ, which transfers British taxpayersâ money to âbloated French landowners, pumping up food prices in Europe and creating poverty in Africaâ.
Mr Blairâs real problem is that he cannot say any of that.
He has to be supportive of the European Union, or at least seem to be so.
However, he knows back home that the majority loathes this House and all it stands for and wants us to leave.
He knows the British Presidency has been a disaster.
We do not subscribe to your project.
Mr Heathâs pigeons of the 1970s have come home to roost big time in the UK.
Mr Heath lied through his teeth to persuade us to join.
His deceit has left successive British governments to cope with the consequences and we have gradually come to see the EU for what it really is.
Today we know this emperor has no clothes.
This is not a parliamentary democracy.
That was never intended.
This is ruled by secret committees, faceless bullying bureaucrats, and accountability by smoke and mirrors.
This is the new soviet and it is no wonder that Italy now wants Russia to join it.
Mr Putin would feel perfectly at home.
Since I arrived here last year, it has been remarkable how many people have admitted privately to me that we should never have joined and we should leave at the earliest opportunity.
So we should!
Â Â  Mr President, I too almost feel that I should be doing something to help MrÂ Alexander out, but, as a lawyer, it does not appear to me that there will be enough money in the EU budget to pay my fees.
I am rather sorry for him, but he is here to try to convince the House that the Presidency is on top of events.
Sadly, the past six months have shown that this presidency has unfortunately been unable even to comprehend events, let alone establish its position in relation to them.
He is the messenger for a presidency that has run out of ideas, run out of steam and is rapidly running out of time.
It is sadly acknowledged across the political spectrum, as we are hearing today, that the British Presidency has not achieved what it said it would.
It began with high hopes and prime ministerial panache.
In this Chamber, it asked to be judged on its record over the six months it was in office.
In June, I warned the House that there was often a yawning gap between the Prime Ministerâs rhetoric and reality.
Anyone who has watched the Prime Minister preside over this presidency will surely understand my caution.
Unlike the Minister, I now want to concentrate on Mr Blairâs increasingly frantic attempts to get an agreement on the financial perspectives and the future EU budget.
In the past few weeks, he has left us breathless with his efforts at diplomacy.
Flexibility and vision is all very well, Mr Alexander, but the Prime Ministerâs actions have been successful only in securing the hostility of the countries of central and eastern Europe â which thought he was their friend â while gaining not a hint of compromise on CAP reform in discussions with governments.
In addition, and crucially, he has reneged on a promise to the British people not to undermine their budget rebate, a promise that perhaps he should not have made.
In June, he said the rebate would remain.
He is now negotiating it away without any promises on fundamental reform, which he said previously were vital.
He should not be surprised if public reaction in the United Kingdom is hostile.
He has misled the British people and they see it live on their television screens.
They will be paying more because the Prime Minister has let them and the country down.
I read at the weekend â and I hope the President-in-Office will react to it â that the British Treasury has not budgeted one cent for a reduction in the budget rebate, meaning that British taxpayers could end up paying higher taxes.
We will look closely at the latest budget proposals expected from the Presidency today.
I am sorry that we did not have the benefit of hearing these in Parliament this morning, but we will judge them in part on how much British taxpayers will have to pay for their governmentâs mishandling of the issues and on whether there is any evidence that the Prime Minister has received any solid and bankable commitments on fundamental reform in Europe.
As far as we are concerned, whatever our political positions, we need to have sensible and progressive reform.
Under this Presidency, the omens have not been good.
Â Â  Mr President, I too regret the fact that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has come here to say nothing, but I would like to make the following comments and ask the following questions, to see if the Council can clarify things.
Firstly, the preamble to the Councilâs proposal of 5 December states that the financial perspective must provide for the financial resources necessary to confront the European Unionâs internal and external challenges.
Do you really believe that the Unionâs challenges can be tackled with fewer and fewer resources?
Secondly, you â though you are not the only ones â have ranted and raved, sometimes for good reasons, but also for reasons of demagoguery, against the CAP, but at the end of the day, you will carry on cutting the most sensitive part of the CAP dedicated to rural development: the most modern, the most rational and the most justifiable part of agricultural spending.
Thirdly, we all applauded the British Prime Minister when he said in this Parliament that he wanted a modern budget for Europe, and we hoped that that would include an increase in the appropriations intended for creating this Europe of excellence.
Will that be a vain hope?
Will you change your initial proposal, which meant a 40% cut with regard to the Commission?
Fourthly, the âugly ducklingâ of the Community budget: external actions.
All of the Foreign Affairs Ministers are constantly delivering promises relating to the needs of developing third countries, or to provide relief following natural disasters, or not so natural disasters, such as famine.
But then the cuts will come, as always.
This means that we will be giving to some people what we take from others.
Fifthly, you have accepted that an agreement was not reached last June, because the financial perspective was too generous.
Are you going to carry on listening to those colleagues of yours who believe that when it comes to the European budget, the smaller it is the better?
Unfortunately, many countries are happy that the European budget gets smaller every year; for some, in fact, it was the only positive thing about your first proposal.
Is the idea of trying to slow down European integration with the philosophy âwith less budget, less Europeâ going to win out in the Council?
In Parliament, however, I would like to make it very clear that we want to move forward with European integration.
We do not believe that we have gone too far and that from now on it is better for each country to sort things out for itself.
This is the great gulf between the Council and Parliament.
It is not going to be a question of a few million euros more or a few million euros less.
We shall judge where the financial perspective that the European Council can propose to us is going to take us.
Sixthly, we saw that all you were prepared to propose on the controversial issue of the Unionâs income, or own resources, were a series of botched jobs to keep your associates who want to pull the Community budget apart happy.
Do you want us to return to national contributions?
Finally, in the face of an attack on the Unionâs system of own resources, Parliament only has the right to protest, according to the Treaties; nevertheless, please be in no doubt that the existence of the financial perspective does depend on Parliament.
Do not forget that, and do not be so sure that we are going to do whatever the Council asks of us.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the reason why the current debate on the Financial Perspective is so fraught with drama is because it is not just money that is at stake.
What is at stake is firstly a climate of trust, and secondly the future of Europe.
I refer to a climate of trust because the outcome of this debate should reveal whether the promises that were made, and the British Prime Ministerâs acknowledgement of the need to help weaker countries, have any kind of meaning.
Alternatively, it may reveal that the real aim is to ensure that the EUâs only priority is something else entirely, which would violate the principle of European politics, and that brings us to the second problem.
The question is whether we want a Europe that is not only enlarged, but also united, which requires a certain amount of political solidarity.
We currently have the Commissionâs proposals, Parliamentâs proposals and the BÃ¶ge report on the table. These are all manifestations of the European spirit, and demonstrate an understanding of Europeâs future needs.
Yet we also have the recent British proposal before us, which exemplifies the national egotism of the great and the rich.
We are all aware that Europe paid a high price for such egotism over many long centuries.
There can be no compromise between egotism and the sense of national spirit.
It is for that reason that we must wait and hope that an entirely new British proposal will be put forward.
Such a proposal is the only way of resolving this crisis.
Â Â  Mr President, for the first time in 11 years, we see a President-in-Office of the Council declining to avail himself of his right to speak in response to the first round of debate.
So short is a presidencyâs road from splendid to wretched, from its dissembling performances on the European stage to its public failure, from great affirmations to the ostracism that is the present lot of the British Presidency of the Council.
It began with fanfares and ends with the passing-bell at a pauperâs grave.
Six months ago, wanting to regain peopleâs trust, you promised them leadership.
I really do pity you; Tony Blair took responsibility for the great performance, while you must take responsibility for the ostracism.
I am not surprised that you do not want to talk about it.
Leadership was what you promised, but what you showed was national egoism, with Europe as a bazaar of national interests, a Europe run by governments.
You wanted to regain peopleâs trust, but, at the end of these six months, all surveys indicate that, because of your policies, people in every country have markedly less of it in you.
Turning to the Financial Perspective, you affirmed your belief in a Europe of solidarity, yet are dividing the EU financially and creating a first- and second-class Europe.
Solidarity among Member States is becoming a thing of the past.
Having announced great reforms, you are making your agreement to the Financial Perspective conditional upon agricultural reform, and are now, by cutting funding for regional development, wrecking the only successful reform that we have seen.
You wanted to prepare the way for the social Europe, yet what came out of Hampton Court was that the social model in Europe does not actually exist.
That is what has emerged from your Presidency, and it is lamentable.
Internal security was meant to be one of your Presidencyâs priorities; instead, it has become a fiasco.
It was your own Home Secretary who managed to be the first representative of a democratic government to describe the European Convention on Human Rights as outdated.
The whole issue of the ban on torture, in particular, shows the British Presidency in a curious light.
Perhaps that is the explanation for why this Presidency of the Council has let the public down on the most fundamental of fundamental rights issues in the face of the presumed crime of abduction and transportation, and the utter inability of the government of the United Kingdom to do anything about it.
I have but one question to put to the British Presidency, and it is this: when will you stop travelling to Europe, and instead start living in it?
Mr President, there are many difficulties with the British Presidencyâs proposals for the financial perspectives, which the chairman of my group, Mr Wurtz, and others have outlined here this morning.
Those include lower than previously proposed amounts for rural development, cohesion funds for the newest Member States, culture, youth and health and consumer protection.
I would plead in favour of one aspect, however: the funding for the EU programme to support peace in the north of Ireland.
That is necessary if we are to continue the valuable work of peace-building, tackling discrimination and promoting national reconciliation.
It is imperative that the opportunity for peace in Ireland is not squandered, which means that there is also an onus on the British Government to ensure political progress in Ireland in 2006.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the United Kingdomâs assumption of the EU Presidency meant that there was a chance that this bureaucratised and inefficient organisation would take the first step on the path towards major reforms, and that the voices of the smaller or less-developed Member States would be no less audible that those of the large Member States.
Six months ago in this very Chamber, the British Prime Minister said that we should forget about national egotism if we want to transform Europe into a politically credible and economically competitive continent on the basis of solidarity.
Now that the British Presidency is coming to an end, it is apparent that this was merely brilliant rhetoric.
It is highly unlikely that the EU will gain a modern and development-focused multi-annual budget in the near future.
It is equally unlikely that there will be any change to the way in which decisions are taken on matters that involve the 25Â Member States.
The EU will continue to be governed by means of opaque negotiations conducted by the powerful Member States, during which the weak Member States are expected to keep quiet or nod in agreement. The new Member States, which were accepted into the EU âas a favourâ even though they pay their way in full, are otherwise accused of being ungrateful, or they are told that, in the words of the British ambassador to Warsaw, and I quote, âlife is brutal and full of trapsâ.
We cannot consent to an EU of this kind.
Â Â  Six months ago many people in this Chamber and also in the new Member States looked with hope and sympathy to the new, dynamic British Presidency and its leader.
We heard about a vision of Europeâs competitiveness in the world and about an equalisation of socio-economic conditions in Europe.
In Luxembourg various new Member States also proposed reducing their requirements for funds, if the bigger states could not reach a compromise.
Unfortunately, this was the basis for the British proposal for the Financial Perspective, simultaneously reducing the amount of the budget and slightly reducing the âBritish rebateâ.
Here the debate is not about the roads that have not been built or the jobs that have not been created in the new Europe.
Here the debate is about the fact that you have demonstrated to our people that the principle of solidarity is nothing but fine words.
We wanted to see that by 2013 our people would be living a little more like âfirst classâ Europe.
Our people in Latvia, my people, do not want to be merely a cheap workforce for your labour market and a cheap tourist destination for the tourists on your cut-price airlines.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Brussels European Council, devoted to budgetary and fiscal issues, is of the utmost importance.
Albion, embodied by the socialist MrÂ Blair, put forward its proposal on the 2007-2013 financial perspective just ten days before the European Council so that its partners could not present it with counter-proposals.
Moreover, the British - shrewd tacticians as they are â went so far in their cunning as to annoy their friends â the countries of the East â and to give the kid-glove treatment to their opponents â France and Germany â practically without touching their budgetary rebate.
All they need do is pretend to make concessions in order to obtain an agreement from the Council, which is scarcely inclined to return to this issue under the Austrian Presidency.
The big loser will, in all likelihood, be France, which will probably continue to finance the British cheque and to see its contribution to the Community budget soar on account of enlargement, while receiving less as a result of the decrease in the CAP budget.
The other topic of debate is the reduced VAT rate for labour-intensive services.
It is marvellous that taxation on activities such as catering or building renovation, which have no negative bearing whatsoever on the operation of the internal market, should be debated at European level and require unanimity.
MrÂ Chirac should have remembered that fiscal sovereignty no longer existed when he made promises to catering workers that he was unable to keep.
Be that as it may, the decisions made in Brussels will bind France for many years to come and contribute, a little more, to our countryâs tragic debt.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, almost twenty years ago, with the Single European Act, when we opened up our borders in order to create a European Economic Area, we also decided to establish a series of financial mechanisms to help the least-developed countries to adapt their economic structures to free competition.
From that moment, cohesion became a fundamental pillar of Europe, consolidating in the financial perspectives negotiated in 1992 and 1999.
The results of that policy have been extraordinary.
As Minister Straw acknowledged a few days ago, on presenting the British Presidencyâs proposal, there has been a similar increase in the commercial flows benefiting the most developed Member States and it is therefore perfectly clear that the net contributorsâ budgetary deficit with the European Union is in line with the trade surplus of those countries compared to the cohesion countries.
It is therefore clear that the cohesion policy â certainly the most effective of all Community policies â benefits all the countries of the European Union, allowing for the true convergence of the least advantaged regions within a relatively short space of time.
Minister, the British Presidency is therefore violating that cohesion policy, which means that the financial costs of enlargement will have to be met by the least-developed territories of the European Union, despite the fact that it is the richest that benefit most from enlargement.
In line with the views approved by the European Parliament, therefore, the Council must be very aware that it cannot assume that it will have parliamentary support for a proposal such as the one that the British Presidency is putting forward at the moment.
And if the Council approves it, I will of course do everything possible to ensure that Parliament vetoes it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many aspects of our cooperation with the British Presidency have gone well; the problem is that you risk giving this sort of cooperation a bad name if you fail to put together a proper and realistic Budget.
It was you who spoke of a realistic Budget.
There are just two points I would like to touch on, and briefly.
You yourself come from a region that has managed â not least with the help of European support grants â to move away from agriculture to being a leader in research and development.
Why do you now want to deny that to other regions by making massive cuts in this modern funding for research and development, or by not creating the conditions for them in an enlarged Union?
That leads me on to the issue of enlargement.
I share your view that we should negotiate with Turkey, and that the creation of a greater Europe, one that included Turkey, would be a good thing.
Do you think it realistic to pursue an enlargement strategy, as the British Presidency is doing, with a Budget like this one and this sort of financial perspective?
Do you think it realistic that this enlargement should include the countries of the Balkans?
Such a thing is not credible, and the public will not accept it.
That is why I find your proposal incomprehensible.
After all, you cannot achieve your own objectives, which both you and Mr Blair have defended, and so the only thing I can do is urge you to change your mind, and come back with a Budget proposal that is realistic in the truest sense of the word, while also taking some sort of account of Europeansâ hopes and aspirations.
What you have put before us so far is unacceptable either to this House or to the people of Europe!
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the European Council on Thursday and Friday, you, MrÂ Alexander, and MrÂ Blair will have the fate of Europe in your hands.
We expect you to deliver a balanced outcome.
Here in Parliament, we have in actual fact delivered when it comes both to REACH and data retention, on which we are voting today, showing that it is not only when there are summits that the EU actively makes things happen.
Six months ago, your Presidency made a point of presenting a very visionary programme that attached importance to future investment in research and development.
It was a fantastic performance that gave rise to great enthusiasm among us MEPs.
What, however, has become of those promises now?
I hope that, at noon today, MrÂ Blair will emerge from Sherwood Forest like a proper â and not a false - Robin Hood, who gives to the poor and takes from the rich.
The new proposal should also tackle the outdated British rebate.
We must show the necessary solidarity with the new Member States.
That is something they deserve, and it will also be in MrÂ Blairâs interests clearly to distance himself from the voice of the past, embodied by MrsÂ Thatcher.
If MrÂ Blair does not stand by the promises he made this summer, his Presidency will have been of no substance.
MrÂ Blair must and should show leadership so that the EUâs by now tarnished image can be polished up.
MrÂ Blair must show that he dares invest in the future.
Research and development are to be welcomed, but not rebates and support for the industries of the past.
I therefore call on the British Presidency to find a reasonable and balanced solution so that we might restore confidence in Europe.
The ball lies in your court.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat embarrassed because both I and the members of the Committee on Development from other political groups would have liked to see a more important subject for discussion in this debate and not merely the announcement of a document, which we have drawn up and which is certainly a positive one.
We were hoping for some kind of assessment as well, because there are in fact a great many positive points contained in the European Consensus on Development, although the budget cuts seriously undermine our ability to put this vision of development policy into practice.
The European Parliament was jointly involved, first with the Commission and then with the Council, in the analysis and debates that took place.
We also took part in a number of seminars.
Throughout the process, Parliament contributed a great deal and also gained a great deal.
This document, however, does not take account of the need to democratise the international financial institutions, for instance, and there is no assessment of the reasons for the lack of growth in economic equality.
Instead, economic disparities are growing, as is our responsibility for the consequences of the arms that we produce, for example.
There is no doubt that the process of redefining the European Unionâs development policies, financial instruments and economic agreements framework will be a challenge for the future.
In that sense, and also in our document, the question of trade still takes centre stage.
I feel I must also add that, although this document contains a great many positive points, many are still missing, but that would require another debate.
I should really like the Presidency and the Commission to respond appropriately to what we are doing with our development policies.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in the end Tony Blair has decided to don the robes of the Sheriff of Nottingham, with his drastic cuts to the budget and hard-line defence of the privilege of the UK rebate.
Unless there are last-minute changes, Londonâs proposal is liable to set the seal on a resounding failure.
In actual fact, we are facing a much deeper crisis: MrÂ Blair has simply chosen to exacerbate the clash, to show up Europeâs weakness and to bring its contradictions to the boil; he has simply highlighted the problems of a Europe torn apart by self interest, unwilling to make any effort to support enlargement, and unable to genuinely face up to the challenges of the third millennium or to assert itself as a unitary political entity on the world stage.
Italy, as a founding member of the European Union, has always played its part and has always been willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the future.
As a net contributor, it has paid 25% of the UK rebate for 20 years.
Now, however, we have reached a crossroads: we cannot pay for the costs of enlargement all by ourselves.
This time we cannot be the only ones to step back.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, punctuality is a virtue of kings.
Great Britain is a kingdom, but its ministers are not punctual.
As a matter of fact, this metaphor works on many levels.
The EU is waiting for sensible proposals from London, but London is behind schedule, in the same way that MrÂ Alexander was late getting here today.
Earlier MrÂ Cohn-Bendit said that there was an atmosphere of springtime revolution in the House today.
As I see it, however, the atmosphere is more reminiscent of winter, such as that experienced by the soldiers fighting at Stalingrad during the Second World War.
Relations between the Commission and the Council, and also between the individual Member States, are positively icy.
It is a shame that at the beginning of the 21st century, at a time when films are being released in 3D, Parliament has regressed 50Â years to the era of black-and-white films.
The film we are currently watching features MrÂ Barroso, the advocate of European solidarity, as a good sheriff, and Prime Minister Blair as a baddie.
Unfortunately, it is only American westerns that have happy endings.
The film of the British Presidency, however, is a horror film that will end in disaster.
Zorba the Greek will not appear and say âwhat a wonderful catastropheâ, for this is a terrible catastrophe, ladies and gentlemen.
Christmas is coming.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over 100Â years ago, MrÂ Blairâs fellow countryman, Charles Dickens, gave us a portrait of the current British Prime Minister in âA Christmas Carolâ.
Yet the hero of this tale, who was a real miser, underwent a transformation.
I hope that the same happens to that other miser, namely Prime Minister Blair.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Minister, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council is a vital stage in the difficult process of building the Union.
Agreement on the financial perspective would restore certainty in our political action and confidence in the integration process, whereas failure would trigger a serious political crisis.
The need for agreement must not, however, be mistaken for a willingness to accept just any compromise.
In his inaugural speech to this House, Tony Blair promised the revitalisation of Europe and major budgetary innovations.
Today, unfortunately, we have to accept the fact that the proposal is modest and low-key.
The Juncker proposal to reduce spending to EURÂ 871 billion was a difficult compromise to accept, but the proposed further reduction to EURÂ 846 billion, with substantial cuts in cohesion policies for the new Member States and in rural development, is unacceptable.
I should also like to point out that the contribution demanded from Italy would be greater than that of France or the UK.
Thus it would be the poor regions of the old Member States that would be penalised, while the privileges of the countries that want a pared-down budget would remain virtually untouched.
This kind of solution contradicts everything the UK Prime Minister put forward and cannot be accepted by this Parliament.
The only way to escape the squeeze affecting our countries and to give fresh impetus to our Europe is to reach an ambitious agreement that combines competitiveness and cohesion, solidarity and innovation.
To conclude, I should like to quote a man of the future: Alcide De Gasperi, whom we remembered yesterday.
To reunite Europe we have to throw out a world of privileges, a world of pusillanimity and resentments.
We must speak out, write and insist; we must not take a momentâs rest in order to keep Europe on the agenda.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in June the United Kingdom blocked the Financial Perspective proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency.
Prime Minister Blair told us that the EU needed a different kind of budget, in which less money was earmarked for traditional goals in the field of agricultural policy.
Instead, more money should go towards furthering modern goals, such as the development of poor regions and of the new Member States.
His words gave us hope that the EU would move beyond the era of national egotism, and that it might make some real progress in terms of modernisation.
Five months then passed in which nothing happened, and I regret to say that the proposal that was put before us after this five-month period was disappointing in the extreme.
The United Kingdom has proved itself incapable of persuading its partners to reform the common agricultural policy, and it has also been unable to forego further increases in its rebate.
The final result is that all the proposed cuts to the budget are unfair, since it will be the new Member States that are affected by most of them.
It turns out that one quarter of the cuts proposed by the British Presidency will affect one country alone, namely Poland.
This amounts to a figure of EURÂ 6Â billion.
I should like to ask MrÂ Alexander whether he thinks that there is any chance that the Polish Prime Minister will return to his country and tell the Polish people that he intends to agree to a proposal along these lines.
It would be entirely unrealistic to expect such a thing.
The British Presidencyâs proposal shows a lack of imagination, and it is based on a vision of Europe that this House finds unacceptable.
The European Parliament cannot consent to such a vision.
MrÂ Alexander, never before in the history of Europe have the principles of solidarity and cohesion been at such risk, and never before have European countries been so caught up in defending their own selfish and short-term interests.
I would ask you to tell the British Presidency that we expect it to rise to the occasion and to be able to achieve a compromise that upholds the principles underpinning the European Union.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is important because it voices the discontent felt in Europe about a European summit which, given the way it has been structured, can only lead to predictable failure.
If that is the case, it will be impossible to use the resources effectively in the early years of the programming period, that is to say from 2007 onwards, and that will result in serious harm.
It is preferable, however, to run that risk rather than permanently jeopardise the design for a strong, united Europe by agreeing to accept the 1% mini Europe.
The 1% idea is indeed a dreadful solution that the European Parliament cannot accept.
Worse still, it is a dreadful solution that comes without a substantial reduction in the UK rebate.
In order to grow, Europe has to be competitive, and to be competitive it needs cohesion.
With a budget that cuts spending and sets a ceiling of around 1%, with a budget that only guarantees existing privileges, there will be no investment in either growth or competitiveness or cohesion, MrÂ President, and Europe will be betraying itself.
We do not want that kind of Europe; we do not recognise ourselves in such a Europe.
We shall do everything we can for Parliament to reject any agreement on that mini Europe, which is not the Europe that Parliament wants.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Alexander, Europeans deserve more than the game of cat and mouse being played by the Presidency of the Union with its 24 partners on the eve of a European Council that is crucial for the future of Europe.
The proposals put forward over the last few days by the UK Presidency on the 2007-2013 financial perspective are unacceptable for two reasons.
They sacrifice the new Member States, they erect a new wall between old and new Member States and they seem designed to preserve the British rebate, which now has no reason to exist.
With regard to agricultural spending, there is, furthermore, a hidden meaning to the proposals, which verges on a threat and which we cannot tolerate within our Union.
If the common agricultural policy is not reformed in 2008, then the United Kingdom will hold on to its rebate as it stands.
There should be no taboo subjects whatsoever in our democracy, and this is the case whether it is a question of Europeâs overall budget, the apportionment of European expenditure, regional aid, the CAP, aid for research and innovation or any other Community policy.
Any subject can be debated, be looked into and form the subject of a compromise in our interests, and this is something that we all understand.
What we cannot accept, however, is one country retaining benefits that no longer correspond at all to todayâs economic and political context. This is all the more unacceptable when it is to the detriment of countries requiring aid to overcome the handicaps created by 50 years of Communist regime.
Nor can we accept the extensive efforts already made by the European Union in the area of agriculture being repudiated, particularly in the context of the WTO negotiations.
Europe has already done its duty on this matter and is looking forward to other agricultural powers, such as the United States, making similar efforts before Europe pursues, if necessary, its reforms.
The British Prime Minister, MrÂ Blair, formally declared to us in this very Chamber his desire to work for the common good of Europe, to go beyond national self-interests and to take European integration forward during his Presidency.
We are waiting for him finally to turn his words into deeds if he is to deserve the applause that a number of my fellow Members might have been slightly too quick to offer him back in June.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by apologising to the Presidency.
When it agreed to open negotiations with Croatia, I confess I suspected that a rather grubby deal had been done to overcome Austriaâs objections to Turkey.
I was wrong.
We now know that Croatia was cooperating very closely with The Hague and providing information which led to the very significant and important arrest of General Gotovina and I congratulate the Presidency on that progress.
If it is not too much of a shock for Mr Alexander, I would also like to congratulate the Presidency on its cooperation with the Parliament, which has led to huge progress on some very difficult dossiers, noticeably REACH, the long-running Eurovignette saga, and hopefully data retention.
I also understand the Presidency is making great strides, or trying to make great strides, in introducing transparency to the Council and I would hope Mr Alexander could tell us what progress he has made on that.
Nonetheless there is still a lack of transparency in the Council, so I wonder whether he could just lift the veil momentarily by answering some questions.
Which net payers, apart from the UK, are prepared to pay more money to solve the budget problem?
Which net recipients are prepared to receive less in order to solve the budget problem?
Which net recipients from old Europe are prepared to receive less in order to show solidarity to new Europe?
How many countries in the Council advocate spending programmes so long as they do not have to pay for them?
Which of the main beneficiaries of the CAP are arguing for further reform?
Which CAP beneficiaries are prepared, like the UK Government, to make public the information about where the money goes?
By that I mean information that shows that the benefit is felt not by farmers but by multinational processors of food and big landowners.
Which finance ministers are prepared to sign an annual statement of assurance of their accounts, which will put an end to the annual saga of us failing to sign off the accounts because of the failure of Member States to control their accounts?
Which Member States come to the Council meeting and ask not what Europe can do for them, but what they can do for Europe?
Â Â  Mr President, the EU needs a budget, but not at any cost.
The Commissionâs proposal was optimal and in agreement with the commitments of the Edinburgh Council of 1992.
Do you still remember the 1.27% of GNI from Edinburgh?
The European Parliamentâs bigger budget is realistic in protecting crucial areas of EU priorities.
Our Parliament wants to free the dynamism of new Member States and use it to the advantage of the economy of the whole Union.
We should not, as under the humiliating British proposal, penalise them and push them into second class membership status.
The Luxembourg proposal was already scarce and at the limits of acceptability.
The British proposal has crossed the red line in terms of the overall level of commitments and unacceptable reduction of funds for the poorest Member States.
Non-agreement is better than an agreement that contradicts the very principle of European integration.
The budget is not only about figures; it is about principles and policy choices.
Reducing the budget when our Union is larger and has new tasks is contrary to logic and common sense.
It means amputating EU policies, slice by slice: real salami tactics.
The budget is about the solidarity, cohesion and competitiveness of an enlarged Union, not about charity.
We do not want charity.
We are not beggars.
We want our money back.
But, even applying an accountantâs approach, the proposal is contrary to honest business practice.
New Members opened their markets and committed themselves to apply high and costly EU standards.
Matching transfers of 4% of GNI was a legitimate expectation based on political promise.
Limiting that support today means breaking the contract.
Our Parliament, showing self-respect, should prevent the erosion of the EU in the name of the impossible and destructive doctrine of âmore Europe for less moneyâ.
The primary source of that doctrine is the 1% budget proposal, the famous âLetter of Sixâ: the proposal to have, to use the words of President Barroso, âa mini Europeâ.
The 1% philosophy means of the Union and leading the Union into a trap of doing .
When there is a crisis of leadership â and there is â the European Parliament should take the lead and the responsibility, together with the European Commission, and veto the Council proposal if there is any bottom line set by the Luxembourg proposal.
Best wishes and Merry Christmas to the outgoing British Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, the structure of this debate creates great confusion, mixing up the Council on Thursday with the European consensus on development.
It is surely because of this misunderstanding that Mr DurÃ£o Barroso has not said a word about the latter, although Mr Alexander has referred to it.
I wish to talk about it on behalf of the Socialist Group.
With regard to the European consensus on development, we feel very satisfied, though we also have certain concerns.
Satisfaction at the process employed in drawing up the declaration; satisfaction at the initiative of the Commission and of Commissioner Louis Michel that a document should be produced to replace that of 2000; and also satisfaction at the decisive involvement of the British Presidency and of Minister Hilary Benn in this operation.
The flexibility demonstrated by the Commission and the Council with a view to achieving the final agreed text is also worthy of note.
The Presidencyâs determination to convince the other twenty-four governments, some of which were very unwilling at the beginning, to accept the compromise that was taking shape, has also been notable.
One significant change was the Commission and the Councilâs will to involve Parliament in the signature and, before that, in the process that has led to the wording of the statement defining the Unionâs development policy for the coming years.
Our participation, through Anders Wijkman and followed by all of the groups in the Committee on Development, has been effective; it was essential that we acted firmly and in a united fashion.
Thanks to this, the statement includes most of our suggestions.
By providing them with a political framework, this statement should enhance the commitments that were made a few months ago on the proposal of the Council of Development Ministers and which drastically increase the efforts of the Union and its Member States to overcome under-development and its consequences for the people suffering from it.
At least we are acting in accordance with the provisions of the European Constitution, which indicates that the Unionâs responsibilities in the field of solidarity with the South are one of our priorities.
We could talk about coherence if it were not for other greater incoherences, which are the source of the concern mentioned earlier: the financial perspectives announced by the British Presidency, showing a worrying degree of schizophrenia, are incompatible with the budgetary commitments made at the Leeds Council and the actions laid down in the statement being debated today.
That is why we are so worried that all our hopes are destined to be dashed.
And that is why my group would like to make it clear that we will not accept such a prospect and we will act to ensure that the hopes raised today are not dashed when the resources available for the coming years are approved.
Congratulations to everybody today, but I would point out that there will be great resistance if there is any intention to take with one hand tomorrow what is given today with the other.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell the President-in-Office that the United Kingdom is the main cause underlying the failure of the summit in Luxembourg.
The abandonment by the Heads of State or Government of their responsibility for Europe as a whole, along with their almost daily attempts at renationalisation and at the splitting of the European Unionâs policies into internal and European policy are, of course, not your problem alone, but you are constantly provocative, and you also play the blackmail card.
You are here today, and Tony Blair is again absent.
I had good reason for posting him as missing on 12 October.
You are here, and the proposal for the summit follows the debate; a few days ago, you told us that, if we did not agree to what you propose, you would reject everything next year.
That is blackmail.
What have you done over the past six months to combat this concept of the Councilâs political role, which is so lacking in solidarity and any sense of responsibility?
It takes more to make a successful presidency of the Council than two performances or rhetorical pyrotechnics by Tony Blair.
On the contrary, they confirm the fact that a gulf lies between speeches and reality, between aims and deeds, between tasks and competences, between what is announced and what is actually achieved, between the duellerâs glove thrown down in writing and the obligations to be found in the Treaties, as well as those of a moral and political nature.
Your mentality is one that I cannot fathom.
How do you tell the public that the want to reduce competitiveness, that you want less money spent on internal and external security, that you will, in 2007, be putting less money on the table than we agreed for the 2006 Budget, that you want to play down Europeâs role on the global stage?
The more arrogant your attitude to the citizens of Europe and to their Parliament becomes, the greater our confidence and determination, and all the greater the rage of the public.
Negotiation is possible only where there is mutual respect; it requires compliance with shared rules and must be between equals.
Far from us being the agents of the governmentsâ national and individualistic interests, our cause is that of Europe as a community, of an effective and decisive European Union united in solidarity.
We will not allow the future of the European Union to be determined by the success or failure of a Council Presidency or of the Council itself.
It is Parliaments such as our own that must assume leadership and responsibility in view of the vacuum that you are leaving behind you.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe that anyone wanting to put a title to the opinions being expressed by certain Member States in the Council would choose the title: 'How to have more Europe with less money'.
This, in my view, simply cannot be done.
I believe that there are numerous contradictions in the discussions being held in the Council and in the proposals by the British Presidency.
In this debate there is a huge contradiction between words and ambitions, on the one hand, and the fact that we only give the Community budget 2.5% of public spending in the 25 Member States, on the other.
Similarly, numerous Member States are putting the emphasis in this debate on how much money they personally give the Community budget.
However, these same Member States are forgetting what they receive, the net contributions, via the single market and via the Structural Funds, given that a significant portion of the budget of the Structural Funds finds its way back to these Member States in various ways, which everyone knows and I need not analyse.
In addition, farmers are being discussed.
If the common agricultural policy is ever revised, I propose to the British Presidency that we start with the large-scale farmers, who receive the lion's share of subsidies, rather than the poor farmers in the south, if we want the common agricultural policy to have a social content.
In all events, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on cohesion policy, I should like to say that Parliament has expressed its views. They are views that support a credible budget for cohesion, a cohesion policy without two tracks and with efficient management.
Parliament will not keep quiet; it is not prepared to accept every Council agreement, every decision taken next week; we are here to fight to the end for the cohesion policy and we shall exercise all our rights.
Â Â  Six months ago I called attention to the fact that the changes needed in the European Union should start with the elimination of the long-standing unfair discrimination still evident against new Member States.
We had to be disappointed.
Now, at the end of the year, not only did we fail to make any progress on the road taking Europe out of the crisis, but we actually started off in the wrong direction, in the opposite direction.
Mr Schulz, the iceberg is not ahead of us, but behind us.
We have already managed to successfully avoid it once.
The problem is that we are moving in reverse.
It is obvious that the outcome will still be certain shipwreck.
It has to be said that the budget proposal is not suited to serve as the foundation of the huge historical undertaking of European reunification.
It does not reduce the crisis of Europe, but increases it; it does not unite European Union Member States, but divides them.
It does not help new Member States, but humiliates them.
It does not make Europe more competitive, but pulls it back.
This budget proposal is a budget that slows us down and divides us.
A few years ago the new Member States of the European Union accepted the transitional disadvantages and differentiations in Copenhagen in the hope that they would be able to participate in the seven-year financial plan with full rights, without differentiation.
However, what we can now see is that the old Member States intend to solve their long-standing unsolved problems to the detriment of the new Member States.
This is unacceptable, humiliating and inadmissible.
This is not worthy of Europe.
The governments need to change their approach.
They should follow the European Parliament!
In spite of our differing interests, we already agreed on the budget in spring, and this House has more than 700 Members, while there are only 25 governments.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have little time in which to speak, and I shall therefore focus on the agreement reached on EU aid policy on the theme, âEuropean consensusâ.
I feel entirely positive about this agreement and the process that has led up to it, as I did not about the debate on the budget and the lack of leadership in that sphere.
The dialogue conducted during the autumn between the Commission, the Council and Parliament has been both positive and constructive.
I would thank MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Alexander for their positive comments in this Chamber today, and I should like to convey my thanks both to Commissioner Michel and to Secretary of State HilaryÂ Benn for what I consider to be their very constructive cooperation.
As has already been stated in this Chamber today, the EU is, overall, the worldâs largest aid donor.
To date, the effectiveness and quality of the aid has not, however, been commensurate with its size.
The EU Member States are poorly coordinated both among themselves and in relation to the Commission. This means high transaction costs, duplication of effort and major difficulties for many of the countries with which we cooperate.
The new development policy, with one part now dealing with the EUâs work and another specifically with the Commissionâs, will mean major progress in this area.
Better donor coordination, greater coherence and increased efficiency are, then, the cornerstones of this policy.
We have also obtained an agreement to define the Commissionâs specific role in development cooperation, something I believe will become very important.
Regarding the issues of substance, the fight against poverty continues to be given high priority.
We also give increased attention to issues such as democracy and human rights, the importance of utilising natural resources in a sustainable way and the role of women in development work etc. In conclusion, I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Development for their very constructive cooperation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I always enjoy these debates.
On the basis of this morningâs debate, I shall miss them!
Whether you will miss the British Presidency is perhaps a different judgement altogether, given the comments I have listened to during the last hour-and-a-half!
I will not be able to address every single point or charge that has been put to me in the course of the last couple of hours, but I will endeavour to answer some of the specific points that have been put to me by honourable Members.
Mr Poettering began the debate with what I judged a rather unworthy charge that I, and the Presidency, had got out of our beds too late.
If 4.30 a.m. is judged to be too late, then I apologise unreservedly to this House!
In the last 24Â hours, more seriously, not only â as you would expect â have I met with our Prime Minister, our Chancellor of the Exchequer and our Foreign Minister as we prepare our revised proposals, but I have also met with the heads of mission in London of every one of the other 24Â Member States of the European Union.
So I will happily discuss how late we are working and how early we get up, as we endeavour to secure the deal that we believe is necessary for Europeâs future this weekend.
As to the issue that you raised, Mr President, I can assure you that there was no discourtesy intended, nor is any intended now, in relation to the timing of the revised proposals being tabled by the European Presidency later today â not least given the timing of this important debate.
First, these will not be wholly new proposals but will simply be revised proposals, the principles of which I set out in my introductory remarks.
Secondly, the charge has been levelled that our Prime Minister is somehow not available for scrutiny on this, the second negotiating box.
Our Prime Minister will be coming to Strasbourg tomorrow to hold further discussions with the Conference of Presidents.
Thirdly, notwithstanding the criticism that has been directed toward the British Presidency in the course of this debate, I would respectfully reply that, as Mr Titley generously acknowledged, criticism of the Presidencyâs engagement with this Parliament is surely not something that deserves to be articulated by honourable Members.
My visit today is one of more than 80 visits by British ministers in the course of the British Presidency.
Mr Schulz was brave enough to acknowledge our friendship before this House, so let me further imperil his reputation by saying that I also like and admire him.
Let me return the candour with which he spoke to me directly.
Mr Schulz, you discussed whether a cut on a rise was still a rise, and spoke of what you described as âthe new arithmeticâ.
I should like to be clear that in relation to both the Commissionâs proposals and the Luxembourg Presidency proposals, an unfunded offer is no offer at all.
We need a deal that commands the support, not simply of those who spend the money, but also of those who contribute the money.
As to the , I accept that trying to secure agreement amongst 25 Member States of this Union does involve a âtitanicâ challenge, but I believe that it can end in agreement rather than tragedy.
In only a few daysâ time we will all find out.
To Mr Watson, who said that no deal is better than a bad deal, I certainly find myself on common ground on that particular issue.
Although I admire his erudition, his critique of how budgeting should work did rather call to my mind that it perhaps accounts for why the Liberals have now been out of power in the United Kingdom since 1929.
Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of a vacuum of achievements during the British Presidency.
Perhaps he chose to ignore the development agenda, of which a number of honourable Members have spoken in this debate today.
Also, given his concern for the environment, I am surprised that he did not pay due tribute to the work of Margaret Beckett, on behalf of the European Union, in persevering to secure agreement during what I judge to have been a hugely significant conference on climate change in Montreal, just last week.
Mr Farage began his speech by accusing my Foreign Office officials behind me as being both able and âtreacherousâ.
I was on the point of jumping to their defence and refuting this allegation, before one of them asked me to say that yes, that was entirely true!
We had the ghosts of Christmas past and Robin Hood bumping into the Sheriff of Nottingham in Mr Farageâs contribution.
Suffice to say, the kindest thing I can find to say about that particular speech is rather than being a convincing case, it turned into more of a fairy tale.
Mr Kirkhope, who, perhaps in a sign of disrespect to the Presidency, has now left the Chamber â I wonder whether he has returned to his bed rather than got up from it â made perhaps one of his final appearances as part of the EPP before this Chamber.
Something of a swansong before being banished to new irrelevance by the incoming leader of the Conservative Party!
He suggested that the Presidency would not be able to afford his fees, if he was representing us.
I do not know the level of the charge-out rates being sought by the present leader of the Conservative Party in the European Parliament, but I sincerely hope it is not very much, on the basis of the speech we heard this morning!
Mr Voggenhuber did not hold back and accused us of being surrounded by ruins at this stage in our Presidency.
He then went on to follow the charge by suggesting that our Presidency proposals were framed by national egotism.
This is a serious point, and I think it deserves a serious reply.
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that had the British Presidency sought to succumb to national egotism, it would have been far easier domestically for the United Kingdom and for the British Government to assume an approach which continued to advocate immediate and fundamental change, for example to the common agricultural policy and the wider European Union budget.
It has been a far more challenging route to walk to suggest that, notwithstanding our continuing desire to see more fundamental change in the Union, that there should be a clear recognition of the urgent need to find the resources to fund the costs of enlargement, and that explains the basis of the proposals that we tabled initially last week and the revised proposals that we will table later today.
Mrs de BrÃºn spoke of the need for further work to secure the peace process in Northern Ireland, and on that specific point I listened very carefully to her in relation to the proposals that, in turn, we shall make.
Let me deal, finally and briefly, with the issue of transparency which was taken up by Mr Titley.
I was invited to inform honourable Members as to the further progress during the Presidency.
I can assure this House, not least on the basis of the strength of opinions articulated within this Chamber on the matter, that we are making continuing efforts to increase the transparency of the Council.
We tabled an options paper last month.
There are proposals that have now been discussed both in Coreper I and Coreper II, and we continue to hope that the Council will adopt conclusions this month on the important matter of transparency.
However, most honourable Members directed their interventions towards the important issue of future financing.
Let those who criticise our proposals today pause, if only momentarily, to reflect on what we may all lose, but particularly the new Member States, about whom a number of honourable Members have spoken.
Speaking for just a second as a United Kingdom Minister rather than solely on behalf of the Presidency, let me underline that we are willing to pay our fair share of the budget but not than our fair share.
Back in June, we were asked to make a net contribution of an extra EUR 20 billion or more above and beyond the EUR 50 billion we were already going to pay, or, to put it another way, to make a net contribution about a third more than France as a share of gross national income.
So let me be crystal clear on this point: that was not fair then and it is not fair now.
We did not accept it then and we will not accept it this week or, indeed, next year.
Instead, for the first time in 30 years of our membership of this European Union â 30 years, in which we have always been a net contributor to the Union â and after years of paying far more than countries of similar levels of prosperity, we intend to make a contribution roughly in parity with similar-sized countries, like France and Italy.
We believe that is transparently and eminently fair.
Others have alluded, at least briefly, in this important debate to this weekâs other major event: the WTO ministerial meeting taking place presently in Hong Kong.
A globally oriented Europe is also one that takes seriously its responsibilities to tackle global poverty, and I once again pay due tribute to a number of honourable Members who have brought this to our attention this morning.
Following its decisions earlier this year effectively to double the level of development assistance by 2010, this Union needs to take the lead in securing a truly ambitious conclusion to the current WTO trade round.
We have in our hands the potential to create a fairer trading global system that will allow hundreds of millions to lift themselves out of poverty.
This is no zero-sum game.
A fairer global trade system can also act as a spur to the reforms that Europe needs if it is to enhance its competitiveness and deliver on its promises of social justice.
We need an outcome to the round, whether in Hong Kong or indeed in the months and years to follow, that is, therefore, pro-poor in the world and pro-jobs in Europe.
Let me finish my contribution to todayâs debate, however, by casting our minds back to July when we took over the Presidency.
A number of honourable Members have referred to the speech that our Prime Minister made at that time.
But let us remember also the context of that speech coming, as it did, soon after the twin rejection of the European Constitution in France and in the Netherlands.
There has been a lot of debate as to the exact significance of those two votes.
What, if anything, was wrong with the constitutional draft itself?
What were the citizens of Europe telling us about the way in which they wanted the European Union to be run?
I would agree with the commentator who said that what we saw in June was the rejection not just of the text but of the context.
People in France and in the Netherlands did not have deep-seated objections to a particular subparagraph or clause of the draft Constitution.
Rather the basic question, which should still be in our minds today and in our minds during this European Council, which these European citizens were asking, is what did the European Union deliver for them?
They were not sure enough about the value added to their lives.
They did not know enough about the decisions it made and they had not got the trust in Europeâs politicians to steer the right course.
People were uncertain about the broader forces of global change, about the economic challenges facing Europe and what they might mean for them and for their families.
Who can blame them at a time when one in ten European citizens today are out of work, in which one in twenty are long-term unemployed?
It is the duty of those who believe fundamentally in social justice to ask how the European Union can be part of a solution to that challenge.
The answer to peopleâs justifiable concerns about change is not, I would argue, to turn inwards, retreating into a politics of anxiety and, indeed, an economics of protectionism.
That way offers no solution and, I would argue, no hope.
If we are to meet the challenges of todayâs world, we must turn outwards with optimism and determination and become a globally oriented Europe.
That is what will inspire us in the days ahead.
I can assure you that I will, in turn, pass back the comments that I have received in the course of this morningâs debate to our Prime Minister and to other members of our government ahead of his visit here to Strasbourg tomorrow.
I can assure you of our best endeavours in the critical days and hours that lie ahead.
Â Â  Colleagues, please be quiet.
Our debate is not yet over.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
I was receiving the winners of the Sakharov Prize, but the noise of the applause for Mr Barroso was so rapturous that I felt obliged to rush to the Chamber to see what was happening, because it is not normal for Mr Barroso to receive such loud and sustained applause.
You are aware that, if there are no changes to the programme, Mr Blair, President-in-Office of the Council, will come to Strasbourg tomorrow to meet with the Conference of Presidents and to explain his proposal to the Council which the Minister representing the British Presidency has not been able, or has not wished, to explain.
The political groups and you as well, Mr Barroso, have spoken very clearly.
I would just like to offer you a warning: we must not underestimate words.
The unacceptable must not be accepted, because otherwise something that is declared unacceptable today and accepted tomorrow may turn the applause into boos.
The line between the acceptable and the unacceptable cannot be so thin.
That concludes this debate, and I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in it.
Â Â  The Presidency has a thankless task in trying to reach an agreement in Council on the financial perspectives.
It has to reconcile the six countries who wanted to limit EU spending to 1% of GDP with those who want a much larger budget.
It has to deal with Mr Chirac who wants to ring-fence all agricultural spending, from which his country benefits far more than most.
It has to deal also with the expectations of the new Member States and with longstanding members who wish to preserve their privileges â such as Spain which wants to remain a net beneficiary to a greater extent than the much poorer central European countries, and Luxembourg which, in per capita terms, is both the richest Member States in and the biggest net beneficiary.
It has to deal with all those who think that a cost-free âfor them! â way to increase resources is to cut the British rebate â although even with the rebate Britainâs net contribution is far higher than that of France and Italy.
I wish the Presidency well in finding an agreement which will serve as Councilâs negotiating position for the definitive negotiation with Parliament.
Â Â  â The run-up to this Council shows just how serious our problems are in the EU, and is indicative of the crisis arising from the increasingly neoliberal policies, which pander to the interests of the large economic and financial groups in the most powerful countries.
The wealthiest countries are showing less and less solidarity; the principles of economic and social cohesion in the Treaty are being totally trampled underfoot; the most recent rounds of enlargement have taken place without any fresh financial resources; and the situation is set to get worse, with the British Presidency proposing more cuts for the new Member States and for cohesion countries such as Portugal.
The great malaise in the European Union is embodied by the budget crisis, and the monetarist policies of the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact serve to exacerbate that malaise.
Furthermore, the problem will only deepen with the cuts imposed on the Community budget.
Despite all of this, attempts are being made to reinstate priorities contained in the â already rejected â so-called European Constitution, such as the militarisation of the EU, so-called internal security, immigration control and competition policy.
The upshot of this will be financial resources being channelled into meeting the needs of the economically most developed countries and the economic and financial groups in those countries, at the expense of social needs, the environment, cohesion and development aid.
Â Â  â The financial framework for 2007-2013 is the centrepiece of the European Council.
It is not the only âitem on the agendaâ, however: the liberalisation of services and the so-called âfight against terrorismâ also feature.
After the British Presidency had given precedence to the interests of the economically most developed EU countries, by putting forward a proposal to lower the bar still further and to overlook the contradictions inherent therein, pressure increased to reach agreement as quickly as possible.
UNICE (the European employersâ association) has been saying that an agreement has indeed been reached.
Whilst warning of the danger that the EU will lose âcredibilityâ, it has presented its wish list: an agreement on the financial perspective, reaffirming that this should âact in the interests of pursuing the Lisbon agendaâ; the prompt establishment of the internal services market (it is revealing that, by way of justifying the liberalisation of services, UNICE argues that this is an âessential element of the Lisbon Strategyâ and a ârequirement of the Treatiesâ, backed by rulings made by the European Court of Justice â and then tries to âsellâ us the idea that the so-called European Constitution has nothing to do with thisÂ ...); and the liberalisation of world trade within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
Behold the unmasked EU!
Â Â  It saddens me as a proud Scottish European that the UK has represented Scotland so badly during the Presidency, and everything I have heard in this debate confirms my view that the UK has lost friends and influence on our behalf by this wrongheaded stance on the budget.
The proposals announced today fail Scotland and they fail Europe also.
I have no doubt that they will be comprehensively rejected by other member states and with 11 of those states smaller than Scotland I am more convinced than ever that there is no substitute for independence in Europe.
Â Â  I would now like to welcome a delegation from the Central American Parliament who are in the official gallery.
I would also like to congratulate its President, Mr Julio Palacios, on his election as President of that institution, which emerged from the Esquipulas agreements that put an end to years of civil wars in several Central American countries.
Congratulations, Mr President.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is probably the wrong time to discuss the content of this proposal in detail, but I would like to say that I have received hundreds of e-mails â not sent in bulk, but individually written messages â and 58Â 000 verified signatures from members of the public right across Europe, giving vent to their grave concerns.
So much for the alleged great public longing for data retention!
The Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has taken these objections seriously and, by means of its amendments, balanced freedom and security against one another.
The accumulated pressure of time does not, however, justify the ways in which some elements are attempting to proceed.
If this project matters to the European public and is not meant to be just a favour done for the British Presidency of the Council, then we should proceed with caution, for if we do not, we will be fostering the prejudicial belief that the Council only has to call on Parliament to jump for this House to ask in reply âhow high?â
Under high-pressure conditions, that is the sort of thing that can happen.
It is high pressure that enables nature, over the course of millions of years, to produce the most marvellous diamonds.
Put a lemon under high pressure, though, and in no time at all, all that will be left is juice and pulp.
Whether this House is to be a diamond or a lemon depends on us, so, in order that it may remain a diamond, I ask you to join with me in endorsing the amendments tabled by your committee.
Â Â  . â It is scarcely to be expected that I should be happy with the outcome of the vote.
As I can no longer put my name to this report, I withdraw it.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome, on behalf of all of you, on behalf of all of us, the two winners of the European Parliamentâs Sakharov Prize 2005 and the representative of the third winner.
Unfortunately, despite all of the efforts made right up to the last minute, the âWomen in Whiteâ have not been given permission to leave Cuba to be with us today.
I believe that I can say on behalf of the entire European Parliament that we regret and reject this attitude on the part of the Cuban authorities.
On this formal occasion I would like to talk about the âWomen in Whiteâ and our reasons for awarding them this prize.
This is unfortunately not the first time that this has happened.
Neither Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Leyla Zana, nor Wei Jingshen were able to come here to receive their prize.
Their representatives came instead of them.
When they we able to â some have not yet been able because they are still being detained â they came to the House and we met especially to hear them.
This happened in the case of Nelson Mandela and more recently Leyla Zana.
We shall therefore continue to apply every possible pressure on the Cuban authorities to allow them to come, and when they do we shall organise a formal sitting so that they can address our House, as we have on previous occasions, and we will do everything we can to ensure that this happens as soon as possible.
What all of this yearâs winners have in common is their fight for human dignity and freedom.
They are worthy successors of the Soviet academic whose name is on the prize that the European Parliament awards.
In their different ways, all three symbolise the fight to consolidate human rights in the world.
The fight against regimes that imprison critics who dare criticise them.
The fight against inhuman laws.
The fight against those who deny the right to information and against the terrorists who want to banish the right to information.
The European Parliament has supported this yearâs winners by means of its resolutions and its initiatives.
They are well known to us.
We have followed their work, we have followed their fight.
Their presence here is just the end of a process that we have shared by means of our resolutions.
It is a fight for a more democratic and more just world.
Please allow me to point out, here in this esteemed Chamber, that many Europeans believe that the right to have oneâs human rights respected is something natural, something inevitable, which is practically free, and that it has always been the case.
No, it has not always been the case, and nor is it yet the case in many parts of the world, unfortunately.
For the great majority of humanity it is still a distant dream.
And for this reason, we Europeans have a special duty to defend and promote human rights in the world.
I would like to speak briefly about each of our prize-winners: the âWomen in Whiteâ are represented by MrsÂ Blanca Reyes, who has been a âWoman in Whiteâ until she fortunately ceased to be one when her husband was set free, whom I had the pleasure to receive on your behalf in this Parliament immediately after he was released from prison.
These women demonstrate peacefully every week in Havana to express their solidarity with relatives and friends in prison since March 2003.
To a certain extent they are also continuing the phenomenon that was known at the time as the âMothers of the Plaza de Mayoâ, to whom we also awarded a prize.
The only crime of many of these prisoners is to express publicly their opposition to the government as ordinary citizens, as independent journalists or as peaceful dissidents.
Many of them have become seriously ill during their imprisonment in conditions which MrsÂ Reyes will no doubt describe to us.
We called for the release of these prisoners in April 2004 and unfortunately this is still far from being achieved, despite certain individual cases that have arisen.
The experience of many European countries shows us that it is not possible to establish the conditions for a transition to democracy, a peaceful transition to democracy, by imprisoning dissidents, quite the opposite.
Let us hope that the transition to democracy in Cuba takes good note of the experience of certain European countries.
Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim:
You have used your talents as a lawyer to promote the rule of law.
Your strength, as you said to me when I received you this morning, lies in respect for the law.
We admire your determination.
In this enormous country of Nigeria, you defend people who live with the threat of cruel and inhuman punishments.
Punishments which are applied in accordance with Sharia law in twelve States of your country.
