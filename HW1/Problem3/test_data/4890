During the first two years there will be compliance with the decision made by the Committee on Budgets last autumn regarding beneficiaries, which is to say earmarking; the third year will see a switch over to open application.
The legal basis now coming into existence will also permit the financing of the work of the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and the Mercator network, as well as concentration camp sites as historical memorials.
The programmeâs total budget is EUR 19 million.
When the Commission proposal was being discussed it was evident, for example in the view of all the institutionsâ legal services, that the earlier procedure, in which Parliament mentions organisations to receive grants by name, does not accord with the new Financial Regulation.
I myself am also in favour of the open application method as a matter of principle.
Parliament is a legislative body and it is not for us to name individual beneficiaries.
It does not meet the requirements of transparency and good administrative practice.
Parliament lays down guidelines and evaluates decisions made by the Commission on the basis of reports.
Having worked closely with European cultural networks for almost five years, I am convinced of the European added value they produce.
It is immensely important that experts and creative people who work in or for museums, cultural administration, art colleges, schools, the theatre and music have an opportunity for cooperation.
I believe that cultural networks have an important contribution to make to the success of European enlargement.
They are not only important heralds of the diversity of our common European cultural heritage and civilisation but also creators of new ideas.
I believe that now that we are finalising a legal basis for funding for three years we can get off to a good start by making sure of the survival of European-wide cultural networks.
I am very pleased that the importance of European cultural and educational cooperation is being highlighted in the Commission proposal as a new financial framework in the building of Europeâs future.
My warmest thanks and congratulations go to Commissioner Reding for that.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, new obligations under the Financial Regulation adopted in 2002 are the reason for our debate today.
This new Financial Regulation now provides a clear legal framework for the subsidies we give to a large number of leading European organisations in the fields of culture, youth and education.
There will now have to be a legal base for all funding decisions.
That is of course a step forward and I am pleased about it, while noting, as Mrs Pack has said, that there are some perverse effects and I very much hope we shall find solutions in talks with the budgetary services of this House.
The changes that have been made led the Commission to present proposals for a new legal base in spring 2003.
Those proposals concerned in particular the fields of culture, youth and education.
They sought to ensure a smooth transition between the old system and the new, and we have tried to ensure the necessary continuity while being irreproachable in terms of the proper use of public funds.
Today I am grateful to the European Parliament and to Mr Rocard and his committee in particular for recognising the urgency of the matter and allowing the Commissionâs proposals to be examined quickly.
It seems to me that the most important matters have now been settled and I am therefore pleased that we are moving towards a compromise, which shows the European institutionsâ determination to find a solution as quickly as possible when that is necessary.
For want of a legal base, we have in fact been in a legal vacuum since 1 January 2004 with regard to organisations whose know-how and creativeness are well known, organisations which the citizens need if they are really to be able to operate in a European way.
The part played by those bodies is irreplaceable: they help to make Europe loved and to give Europe a soul, as some Members have so rightly said.
We have therefore all shown common sense in finding solutions that will enable us to put an end to uncertainty.
I believe everything is now in place to close this file and I would like to point out that the Presidency has sent three letters to the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport informing him that the Council is open to reaching an agreement at second reading on the basis of the common positions so amended.
The Commissionâs position on the amendments contained in the various recommendations is as follows: so far as the proposal in the field of education and training is concerned, the Commission is able to agree to the three amendments voted by the Committee on Culture at second reading because they bring major improvements to the way the programme is implemented.
So far as culture is concerned, the five amendments seeking to make the text compatible with the Financial Regulation and to take account of budget conciliation also meet with the Commissionâs agreement.
So far as youth is concerned, the proposed amendment introducing a transitional clause into the legal base in order to extend the period of eligibility to 1 January 2004 to take account of expenditure made during the period of legal vacuum also has the Commissionâs agreement.
The Commission therefore fully approves Parliamentâs amendments, Mr President.
As you see, there is no more ambiguity and I will therefore end by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Iivari, Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets, for the quality of their work and above all for the spirit in which they undertook it.
Thanks to you, ladies, we will be able to continue our very important work with European organisations that bring the Europe of citizenship to life.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, having listened to Commissioner Reding briefly, I am lost for words because it seems to me that this subject is very important.
One may be a qualified teacher, but what can you do without resources, without money, especially at European level? The Council of Ministers occasionally shows greater generosity towards European projects, but it is difficult for it to do so because, as we know, with subsidiarity education normally remains a national matter.
However that may be, if I am speaking on my own behalf and not as a Member of the European Parliament, if I am speaking as a former history teacher, I recognise that while money is indeed important for education there is something even more important.
As Mrs Reding would say, education is also about training and the mind.
Everyone here today, including those in the public gallery, was once a child and went to school and we can all remember good teachers.
We forget the bad teachers and remember the good ones.
What is a good teacher?
It is someone who loves his subject, who also loves his pupils and also, of necessity, their families.
This report by rapporteurs Pack, Prets and Iivari is very important and I pay tribute to their work.
It is not the end of the story, however.
The end of the story would be that the generations that come after us should perhaps be able to achieve something that goes beyond what our regional and national systems can give.
From our point of view as Members of Parliament, members of an EU institution, there is room for culture and education at European level.
I hope that this report will be well received by the Council of Ministers and that teachers and pupils will thus be able to expand their minds a little.
Culture and education are neither regional nor national nor European, they are all three at once.
Â Â  Mr President, should I now speak in English to further confuse the interpreters?
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs most warmly for having done a good job so quickly.
I see it as giving cultural, educational and youth organisations the important message that this House has powerful advocates to plead their causes.
If I may now speak on the area in which I have been heavily involved, with the White Paper on Youth, the new youth programme and the old one, I have to say that, as a result of their increasing contacts through the recent consultation processes, youth organisations and the European Youth Forum have had their expectations raised very high.
I believe that young people are very satisfied with the good legal basis for financially supporting over 80 youth organisations.
Compared with other policy areas â cultural policy, say, or education â the youth programme is so poorly endowed that we end up allocating less than one per cent of the overall EU Budget to this area, and that, in the long term, ladies and gentlemen, is no longer acceptable.
The public want to see the European Union reflecting their own interests.
This is an area into which we must breathe life.
For this reason, the geographical dimension, which we must always have at the back of our minds when supporting youth organisations, is about more than the enlarged EU.
It has to be clear to us that the European Youth Forum, as an umbrella organisation for youth, also works with the countries belonging to the Council of Europe, where it performs an important role as a political intermediary.
Youth associations, let me say, are always a bit ahead of the other organisations.
Young people think further ahead; they perhaps have a clearer view of their own future than do people like us who are immersed in day-today living and in the business of politics.
This explains the cooperation with the CIS, and the programmeâs importance in terms of peaceful political development in the Mediterranean is not to be underestimated either.
With regard to the elections on 10-13 June, too, I can only say that we have to persuade young people that Europe is the right place in which to take their political ideas further.
Today, then, is a good day for us to adopt these three programmes, after which we can have a bit more clout in the Budget negotiations and, where forthcoming youth programmes are concerned, look further into the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, the legal package before us aims at creating a legal basis for certain cultural, educational and youth action programmes.
The purpose of these is to provide institutions and organisations in this area with financial support.
The European Parliamentâs budget has been used, in accordance with the A-30 lines, to support certain institutions, and NGOs that function on a voluntary basis in particular, which have promoted European activity and strengthened European identity.
Over the years grants for organisations have become established to the extent that their allocation has been something that former recipients of aid have taken for granted.
Selecting which organisations and institutions should receive financial support seems to have been a remarkably arbitrary process.
New operators have said that inclusion has been very difficult, as the selection criteria have been vague.
The choice seems to have been influenced more by the fact that the organisations selected have had strong advocates on the relevant parliamentary committees than by the quality of their operation being superior to that of others.
This detail received attention when the Financial Regulation was being reviewed, with appropriations earmarked in the budget headings finally being cut or cancelled.
The legal package now under discussion will create a legal basis for grants to organisations active in the fields of education, culture and youth work.
The aim must be for the forms of financial assistance from the European Union to be transparent and properly justified.
This means that grants to organisations that are repeated and taken for granted should be few in number or they should not exist at all.
Organisations and institutions have to demonstrate clearly that they are centres of excellence and better than others in the field.
Funding must be based on applications assessed impartially and fairly.
Financing has to be channelled in a way that clearly defines those targets the achievement of which the EU supports, and any recipient of aid must produce a credible report on the use of funds.
I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Ulpu Iivari, Doris Pack and Christa Prets for their excellent reports.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all three rapporteurs for their reports, which I fully support.
In the ten years I have been in Parliament I have had responsibility either as the budget rapporteur or the shadow budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, often working very closely with Mrs Iivari.
I wish to concentrate mainly on the culture report.
She and I are broadly in agreement on the principles.
Perhaps we would differ to a certain extent in that I have always thought the parliamentary procedure for supporting activities is very open and transparent.
I also attended the conciliation meeting just before Christmas, when we hammered out the new legal base.
I want to pay tribute both to the Commissioner and to the Commission staff for their support, as also to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who was extremely supportive.
Let me just make three key points.
Spending on cultural activity is important.
I totally agree with the Commissioner: Europe has to be, and is, about more than economics and trade.
The activities of organisations such as the European Youth Orchestra, 'Swinging Europe', the European Forum for the Arts and Heritage â I could carry on â all help people to understand not just culture but also the cultural dimension of Europe and, through that, the European Union itself.
We all know that the Culture 2000 programme is grossly under-funded.
It is also restricted by its own terms, and many organisations that need help at a European level and have been turning to Parliament will now be able to use this new legal base.
We cannot expect the Member States to fund cultural activities of a European dimension â they will concentrate on the national dimension.
Culture funding is too small â that has been said before.
Nearly 50% of our money goes on agriculture â I make it less than 0.5% on culture.
But culture is an important wealth creator: 17% of UK GDP comes from the creative industries.
Finally, we have to ensure that organisations that receive funding support get the information in good time, so that money is spent efficiently as well as effectively.
Â Â  Mr President, I am especially glad that these programmes will guarantee the financial stability of organisations such as Youth Forum, Jeunesse, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator information and documentation centres amongst many others.
Youth Forum and Jeunesse fulfil an important role in empowering and engaging young people in civil society, which is so important.
They also provide young people with an environment to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding and self-motivated learning.
Likewise the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator have both played, and will continue to play, an important role in safeguarding and promoting minority languages in the European Union.
Their presence and work is especially needed now that 10 new countries will join the Union and further enhance the number of existing minority languages.
There are 40 million minority-language speakers now. Six million other people speaking minority languages will join.
It is crucial that the speakers of these languages enjoy the same rights and possibilities that have been available to everyone else.
I welcome also the measures to increase transparency in the decisions to allocate grants to organisations and also the user-friendliness of the grant application process which at the moment is far too cumbersome.
Nevertheless I regret that in the case of youth NGOs the principle of degressivity remains in the common position, which will mean that the reduction of their funds from the third year onwards will make things rather difficult for them.
Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs would be the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness in future.
I very much hope that these excellent reports will be endorsed by a substantial majority in Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, like the previous speakers, I believe it is essential to have a legal basis which provides us with a stable budget for European youth, culture and education programmes.
These programmes, which naturally the European Commission, Parliament and Council must be involved in, must have, firstly, the relevant legal basis, and that is moving in the right direction and, secondly, an adequate budget.
And that is what we in the European institutions must do next in relation to European youth, education and culture.
I have often said in this House, and I will not tire of doing so, and today I am going to say it again, that the future of Europe lies in its youth.
It cannot be any other way.
And the future of Europe is going to depend very much on the education received by these young people.
Although in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity education is not our responsibility, we can make a great and very positive contribution to the creation of a more united, knowledgeable, cohesive, cultured and educated Europe; this is what we all want.
In the end this will benefit all Europeans.
I would therefore ask that, when we have finished the battle over the legal basis, amongst all of us we begin the battle to increase the budgets for youth, culture and education until they receive the sums they truly deserve, because that will benefit all of us.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Communication on the new generation of Community education and training programmes 2007 â 2013 and on âActive Citizenshipâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, I promised that during the first half of 2004 I would outline the future prospects for the European programmes for which I am responsible.
It is done.
The Commission has just given the green light for the communication about these new programmes.
The two communications adopted today affect all Europeans, from their schooling to their lives as citizens.
That is important because Europe is not only about economics, finance and commerce.
Europe has a soul.
Europe is men and women in their cultural diversity, which is our Unionâs true wealth.
The new programmes are trying to listen to them; they are designed to respond to their aspirations and help them to create a genuine European citizenship.
Questions of education and citizenship will in fact be among the major issues of the coming decade.
In a Union which is expected to have nearly 500 million people in 2007, strengthening the sense of cultural belonging and of being a citizen of a community of extraordinary diversity will necessarily require mobilising all the tools and programmes at our disposal.
The programmes concerned by the communications adopted today will therefore form part of a new overall logic: building bridges between cultures and individuals.
Mr President, these programmes will be our future because their main thrust is to help young people to realise their European aspirations both in the field of education and in the vast field of citizenship.
I know that these programmes come up to a lot of expectations.
They have not been plucked out of thin air.
There have been public consultations with thousands of professionals, with thousands of people involved in culture and education.
We had the agreement and the express request of Parliament to go ahead.
I can also tell you in all honesty that the timetable will be tight because we will need 2006 to put these programmes in place and ensure a smooth transition between todayâs programmes and tomorrowâs.
I would also like to tell you that the Commission has taken advantage of this to propose a major simplification.
That simplification does of course have its limits because the legal bases, the customers, if I may put it that way, and the interventions are different.
We have, however, managed to reduce the number of legal bases from 13 to six and the number of budget lines from 26 to seven.
A revision of the Financial Regulation is also planned in 2005 and I very much hope that, in the interests of greater transparency, greater efficiency and less bureaucracy, we shall succeed in particular in making these programmes easier for the citizens to use.
All these programmes are European programmes which emphasise European added value and were therefore created and conceived at European level.
However, their implementation will be decentralised to national agencies closer to the citizens.
Those agencies will be responsible for the practical implementation of the programmes because they will be directly familiar with the citizens concerned.
I can tell you that there is a tremendous capacity for absorption in this respect because even today our budget execution is virtually 100%.
The applications we are receiving for projects connected with education and culture in the broad sense are at least 50% more than we are able to grant.
We really have capacity to fill because there is a very large public demand to be satisfied.
Why did I wait until today to present these new programmes to you?
Quite simply because I had to wait for the financial perspectives in order to be able to move forward.
As I believe President Prodi said in this Chamber, the Commission thinks that education and citizenship are very strong aspects of future European policy.
That is why the financial perspectives have offered us a greatly expanded budget.
However, even if that budget is four times greater than what we have today, it is still far from being enough, ladies and gentlemen, because at the moment our programmes still account for only 0.8% of the Community budget.
Even if the expenditure in question is appreciably increased in the interests of citizenship and in those of the men and women of whom Europe consists, it will still be only a very tiny percentage of the Unionâs overall budget, not to mention the fact that, as I can tell you very clearly, there is still a lot of political work, a lot of persuading, to be done if we are to have that tiny percentage.
I said there were two programmes.
The first is about education and is called âThe New Generation of Community Education and Training Programmesâ; its common theme is life-long learning, which must start at a very early age, teaching children how to learn, and must continue until citizens leave working life.
There will therefore be just one integrated programme, a programme whose aim will be to ensure that languages, new technologies and, very importantly, the dissemination of the results of our work, which are considered transversal elements, cover all aspects of education.
There will of course be different levels, as there are today: schooling, vocational education and training, higher education, adult education.
European added value will be introduced at all these levels: mobility, of course, because it is up to us to stress mobility; partnerships between school classes, between organisations concerned with education; transnational projects, in which our educationalists will develop new programmes at the leading edge of progress.
A few figures will illustrate what we propose.
We want at least 10% of primary school pupils to benefit from real or virtual mobility projects: todayâs figure is only 1.5% a year.
We want a threefold increase in the number of Erasmus students: the present number is 120Â 000 students a year.
We want the number of people benefiting from the Leonardo programme, which is concerned with vocational education and training, to rise from 45Â 000 a year today to at least 150Â 000.
We want genuine mobility in adult education: the present figure is, I am almost ashamed to say, 2Â 000 people, and we would like to increase that to at least 50Â 000 people a year.
I am speaking here of mobility within the European Union, because there is also, of course, the world outside the European Union.
There are our new neighbours, whom we shall have to bring into our way of making Europe.
To this end, Mr President, we want to develop Tempus and make it into Tempus Plus, which will no longer concentrate solely on the university level, but will also provide aid tailored to the needs and capacities of each country, aid for all areas of education policy, including schooling and vocational education and training.
Then there are our Jean Monnet Chairs.
Today we have them in 50 countries.
We think development at this level, too, is very important.
Another aspect which will be of interest to the honourable Members who were speaking of finance only a few minutes ago, Mr President, is the integration of institutions like Bruges, Florence and Maastricht into our programmes so that the legal base is regulated once and for all.
So much for the big new integrated Education programme.
Then there will be a second large integrated programme: âMaking Citizenship Workâ, which will combine several current programmes.
These will continue as at present, under the umbrella of citizenship.
It will cover three fields: youth, culture and media.
The first field is the Youth Programme.
I know that some of you are more particularly interested in this programme, several aspects of which will be developed.
The first aspect, the first strand, âYouth for Europeâ, will combine mobility, participation and exchanges.
Then the second major strand will be âEuropean Voluntary Serviceâ.
By extending this service not only to individuals but also to groups, we would like to make voluntarism among youth a really strong and visible policy with the intention of extending it even beyond Europe.
We want to make a kind of âYouth of the Worldâ programme, to contribute to the development of mutual understanding through an open-minded approach to the world and active engagement of young people.
I am thinking of the countries of the enlarged Europe, of strengthening cooperation with the candidate countries, with the Balkan countries and the EFTA countries, and also with other third countries.
Another aspect which must not be neglected is the action of socio-educational instructors and support systems for training youth workers, and support for political cooperation.
The second field is culture.
There will be three objectives with European added value here: professional mobility, the transnational circulation of works of art and intercultural dialogue.
These will be the three common themes running through all our cultural actions.
There will be no more rigid sectoral divisions like there are today, but rather the major emphases I have just described, with the three types of action we already know today: multiannual cooperation with private operators and businesses â an opening to the field of cultural businesses; innovative annual projects, no change there; and going back to the problems we have just solved, support for European cultural bodies.
Here, too, ladies and gentlemen, there will be much simplification.
There will be just one budget line instead of the five we have today.
The final field is the audiovisual sector.
Here, too, there will be three major objectives: the preservation and enhancement of cultural diversity and heritage, the circulation of works inside and outside the Union, and strengthening the competitiveness of the industrial sector.
You must understand that we are retaining the present scheme of things.
Even today we say that investment in film production is a national, regional, private investment, or whatever you wish to call it, but not European.
We are not changing that, but we are going to give the Member States the possibility of continuing that investment and continuing public aid for the cinema.
To do so, we are going to intervene up and down stream.
Upstream by acquiring competences.
Our cinema schools must be networked.
One might (why not?) imagine an Erasmus for cinema schools.
That would be a very good thing.
To have access to credits, it will be necessary to learn the specific work of filmmaking, including business plans.
We do not want to educate oddballs, we want to educate people capable of making good films which, moreover, will sell.
Downstream there is the problem of distribution.
You know that European films do not travel well, despite all our efforts.
There is always the problem that people will go and see a national film in the country where it is made, but then the difficulties start when it crosses the border.
We must therefore do all that we can to change the situation, not only to expand the market for films, but also for reasons of cultural diversity which I do not need to explain.
We are going to strengthen the system of support and of selective automatic distribution and we are going to add support for dubbing and subtitling, support for multilingualism, so that it will not be too expensive for films to travel.
I am thinking of new technologies in this connection, because 40% of the income from a film is already generated by DVDs.
DVDs already have the potential to be multilingual.
We will therefore have to work on that with a lot of commitment.
Then there is the question of greater promotion, in Europe of course, but also outside Europe.
I am thinking, for example, of packages of European films translated into different languages, that would be shown at a festival in New York or New Delhi, accompanied by the European stars to really make the most of it and for high visibility.
In order to prepare for the future, ladies and gentlemen, we are reserving a space for âpilot projectsâ, a space of flexibility, because there are bound to be big developments in new technologies.
We must therefore be ready to accompany those developments as required.
Ladies and gentlemen, that in a few words is what has been decided today.
It is of course a framework.
It is a structure, but I think that structure shows that the Commission is taking very seriously Europeâs most precious asset, Europeâs greatest wealth: the citizens and their cultural diversity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions to put to you.
Firstly, I would like to know if the extension of the Tempus programme to Tempus Plus is a response to the question raised in Thessaloniki as to whether the educational programmes were being extended to the countries of the Balkans.
I would see that as not going far enough; I would like to see the whole of the Socrates programme extended, rather than just having Tempus as a new one.
Secondly, does the reduction of the Budget line not have the result that we, in this House and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have even less of a say as regards who gets subsidies?
What are the facts of the matter here?
Thirdly, are the programmesâ titles being lost?
Are the names âErasmusâ, âSocratesâ, and âComeniusâ no more, or are they being retained somewhere?
It is not clear to me from the text.
Although I hope I will get an answer to this, I regret that I will not be here to hear it, as I have to go to a briefing before another meeting.
Please accept my apologies.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking you for keeping to the timetable.
It is good to see the new programme already up and running, and I would like to put three short questions to you.
Since you want to increase and extend everything â Leonardo, for example, from 45Â 000 participants to 150Â 000, 10% primary schoolchildren rather than 1.5%, a leap from 2Â 000 to 50Â 000 in adult education, and more of the same besides â how much can we expect in the Budget?
We used to get 0.8%; if we want improved performance and higher quality, that will have to be paid for somehow.
Also, in what sort of stages is this objective to be achieved?
How is it proposed to achieve it by 2012 or 2010, and who will then bear the additional expenditure if â as I am given to understand â many countries are no longer prepared to contribute more than 1% to the European budget?
Â Â  â First of all, allow me to congratulate you, Commissioner Reding.
In fact, in this period of gloom after the intergovernmental conference, this House does not often shake with enthusiasm.
You have given us the opportunity to do so, which is a pleasure to hear.
I have many questions, but I will put four of them to you.
Three of them are concerned with what you have just said and one strays slightly from an issue that you dealt with, but it concerns our problems.
My first question is this: could you be a little more explicit about what you just quickly touched upon as regards quadrupling the budget?
Over what period?
On what basis?
Is this about the whole budget for culture, youth and the media?
What news!
We are starting with such a small amount.
All the same, we would like to know a little more.
My second question concerns languages.
We know each other well, Commissioner Reding, and I admire the enthusiasm and the spirit with which you defend language initiation programmes and take on the defence of minority languages.
In this context, it is the Council that is delaying.
Will the Commissioner, in support of the programmes that she has just described, be prepared to go back to the idea that the Council must manage to put pressure on the Member States to make it compulsory to teach at least two modern languages?
Furthermore, according to linguists, it would be preferable for one of these two languages to be outside of the linguistic family of the mother tongue.
In this way, Europe would become multilingual and not dependent on our jargon that is similar to English.
My third question concerns the cinema.
It was a pleasure to listen to you on this point, Commissioner Reding.
On the issue of promoting cultural diversity and defending it in the area of cinema, however, you did not mention this unsuccessful text that wasÂ âÂ it seems to meÂ âÂ drawn up by the Internal Market Directorate General.
In the name of protecting competition, it claimed to harmonise, but in fact it is to remove or completely change all our structures for helping cinema and that worries us all.
In our opinion, this reasoning was stupid, but we would like to hear it from your own lips.
My fourth question is a point of application.
It concerns what you said on the issue of European high culture.
You spoke about Bruges and Florence.
I have just learnt that in Florence, following an international agreement fixing the budget of this institution, the notification sent to it was cut back by the Commission Secretary General by 20% compared with the sum agreed on and adopted by this Parliament, which is sovereign in Europe.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President, and congratulations to the Commissioner, who has conceived the educational programmes along very ambitious lines.
I hope that we, working together with the Commission, will be able to budget for them.
I would remind you that Erasmus aimed to include 10% of students in the programme.
Let us hope that we succeed in doing that.
Let me now turn to the new programme.
Our agenda simply describes this as a debate on the education and cultural programmes.
My fear is that young people will end up footing the bill if their concerns are thrown into a single package along with everything else.
We, I think, must ensure â and you, in your proposal, must specify â that the youth programmes must be properly funded, that the informal system of education will continue to be valued as it needs to be in the future, and will be able to be extended in order to prepare people for active citizenship.
If all these things â youth, culture, audiovisuals, media, and films â end up in a single package, my fear is that young people will end up paying the bill and losing out.
That must not be allowed to happen.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I will try to be as brief as possible, mainly because I will be in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport next Monday.
As a result, it will be possible to ask all the questions that I can currently read in the faces of those around me then.
There seems to be a fear that the various elements in the Socrates programme will be done away with.
I can tell Mrs Pack that the precise opposite is the case: the fact is that we will be extending the Tempus Plus programme to all types of schooling, that is to say, to schools, vocational training, adult education and universities.
She asked whether the names are being abandoned, to which the answer is both in the affirmative and the negative.
We now have an overall designation for the educational programmes, so that Socrates is no more, but Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundtvig will remain for schools, universities, vocational training and adult education respectively.
Mrs Prets asked me about the position as regards the Budget.
It is simple: when there is nothing left to be shared out, we will get nothing.
The Commission takes a different view; what it would like is for something to be left to be shared out, and that is why it has no sympathy with those countries that want to pay just 1%.
We need more if we are to be able to invest in the , in the citizens, in our young people, and the fact that the Commissionâs budget for the future is an enlarged one means that it has made more funds available for education and for citizenship.
I have quite deliberately sought not to get involved in this debate, believing as I do that it is very important â including in political terms â to clarify what we want for Europe, where we want to take it, and what we need in order to achieve that end.
Only when we have done that should we look to see how much money we need in order to make that a reality.
Tackling this from the other end is the wrong way to go about it.
I wanted to say to MrÂ Rocard that quadrupling the budget is in line with the Financial Perspective that the Commission has presented.
You will, therefore, experience a lot more pleasure, MrÂ Rocard, in negotiating and battling with the Council, which will surely want to grant less than the Commission proposes.
It will then be necessary to clarify the area where reductions will be made.
Do we want 120Â 000 or 360Â 000 Erasmus students every year?
We need to be very clear.
If we do not give ourselves the money to finance the 360Â 000 Erasmus students or the 10% of schools that could benefit from an education mobility programme, then we cannot do it.
That is clear.
Languages, MrÂ President, are included, as a common theme, in all our education programmes as well as in our programmes for citizenship.
Clearly, Europe cannot be built without linguistic diversity.
Despite everything, I am pleased to mention the modest progress achieved in our Member States and I will never fail to take the opportunity to speak to them to persuade them to forge ahead.
As regards cinema and aid for it, I thought that I said, MrÂ President, that we have to be logical.
If, in the name of the European Union, we do not want to invest in the production of films, then we must give Member States the possibility of doing so.
You will have to wait until next week, MrÂ Rocard, when, in your capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, you will hear an answer that will satisfy you and I am sure not just you, but all European film-makers and all those who love the cinema.
Mrs GrÃ¶ner gave voice to the fear that it would be detrimental to young people if youth, culture and media were to be lumped together in one package.
I can tell her that she can rely on me not to allow that.
When we present the actual programmes in July, you will see that young people will not have been forgotten.
We always say that they are the future of this Europe of ours, and that is indeed the case.
The only thing is our deeds have to back up what we say.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to Question Time (B5-0066/2004).
We shall take a series of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will give a very direct answer to that question.
The Commission is prepared to conduct an in-depth investigation of the alleged abuse of a dominant position in the European Unionâs fish production as and when evidence of such abuse is produced.
As long ago as 1992, we ruled to prohibit a price cartel operated by Norwegian, Scottish and Irish salmon breeders.
We are liasing on a regular basis with the Norwegian authorities as regards observation of the markets referred to in the question.
As I have said, I am prepared to examine the available information in depth and, if need be, to set in motion other investigations into this matter.
Â Â  I warmly thank Commissioner Fischler for that very direct answer.
It is extremely important that this allegation of abuse of dominant position should be investigated.
A particular concern is that the breeders of juvenile fish, or smolt, are mainly based in Scotland and Ireland and are dependent entirely on sales to the ongrowers who are in turn affected by the feed manufacturers.
The feed manufacturers and the ongrowing concerns are heavily dominated by Norwegian interests and that is where the abuse of dominant position within the market arises.
One particular risk that it gives rise to is that a particular asset currently in the hands of EU-owned salmon breeders is the genetic data and genotyped brood stock, which is of fundamental importance, as I am sure the Commissioner well realises.
In conducting his further investigation, with which I will be very happy to cooperate as much as I can, will he take a particularly close and concerned look at that aspect of the situation?
Â Â  . Mr President, I can only ask the honourable Member to forward to us whatever information he receives, as we are willing to give all these issues the attention they deserve.
Apart from that, I cannot do other than agree with what you have said.
Â Â  Commissioner, I join MrÂ MacCormick in thanking you for your direct answer.
He and I have been passing information week after week to you and your colleagues but have found there to be a rather roundabout relationship between you for aquaculture, Mr Monti for competition policy and MrÂ Lamy for trade, which makes life very difficult.
Can I ask the three of you to join forces and work in a joined-up way, in order to prosecute this particular problem with the utmost urgency?
The life is being squeezed out of our constituents in Scotland.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify something here.
There is indeed a difference between agriculture and fisheries in this respect.
The fact is that I am also responsible for the international side of agricultural matters.
As well as that, I am authorised to conduct negotiations relating to the agriculture sector, in the WTO for example.
There is a different situation in fisheries, where my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy has responsibility for the international dimension.
I am quite happy, though, to take up your suggestion and, the next time we have one of our bilateral and trilateral meetings â as I can assure you we do â we will certainly see to it that the information will be made available at an appropriately early stage to all those who may have some responsibility for this.
Â Â  . Very shortly the Commission is planning to present a proposal for a framework decision on certain procedural rights for suspected persons in criminal proceedings throughout the Union.
The draft instrument is in its final stages of internal consultation within the Commission.
When it is finished and has been translated, it will be sent to Parliament and the Council.
The draft framework decision covers five basic rights: access to legal advice; access to free interpretation and translation, ensuring that persons who are not able to understand or follow the proceedings receive specific attention; the right of foreign detained persons to communicate with their consular authorities; and written notification of their rights.
As regards the right to silence, the Commission has asked the Law Society of England and Wales to carry out a study on gathering and handling of evidence, including how the right to silence is interpreted in all the Member States and in the acceding countries.
Once the report of this study has been received, the Commission will evaluate the need for any proposal in this area.
Police immunity is not within the competence of the European Union, since the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security are explicitly excluded from the ambit of the Treaty on European Union.
Â Â  Thank you for the reply, Commissioner, which sounds encouraging.
I am aware of what a terrible minefield this proposal is going to be.
Take the example of the arrest warrant, which all the Member States have ratified but only eight have transposed into national law.
It is going to be very difficult to get this proposal through, but you have the backing of our committee.
Two big obstacles lie ahead of you.
There is a problem of mutual recognition versus standardisation.
Standardisation would be better, but mutual recognition is the easier approach.
How are you going to achieve that and ensure it works when there is the European Convention on Human Rights, and every smart lawyer will immediately say that he does not recognise somebody else's ability to pass judgement and is going to appeal to Strasbourg?
How are you going to make this work in practice?
It is going to be very difficult and I look forward to receiving some reassurance from you.
Â Â  . I confirm that it is extremely difficult, because almost half the Member States do not agree that there is a legal basis to deal with these issues at European Union level.
That is not the position of the Commission.
We think that mutual recognition, which is the cornerstone of judicial penal cooperation, requires mutual confidence among Member States.
To a certain extent, to create that climate of mutual confidence, we need a minimum degree of harmonisation or at least approximation of penal law, including procedural guarantees.
We are not working in an empty field; the European Convention on Human Rights lays down some standards.
We think that we should go further at European level and be more specific about how to use the procedural guarantees already laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights.
We will present our proposal fairly soon and we will try to get it through the Council.
It will not be easy, but I am determined to follow that path.
Â Â  Commissioner, you will forgive me for finding the situation unsatisfactory, as I am sure you do too.
We were assured, at the time the European arrest warrant was introduced, that effective common minimum standards would follow hot on its heels.
We now discover that they are not going to.
Those of us who suggested building a European into the arrest warrant find ourselves reinforced in our belief that this would have been wise.
Can you concede, Commissioner, as one who has been a doughty fighter in this regard that, if the new Constitution were to come into force, the Member States would in future find themselves subject to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when executing European arrest warrants, and that this would be binding law because in implementing European arrest warrants they would be implementing European law?
Â Â  . Mr MacCormick, I share your view that the situation is unsatisfactory but, nevertheless, there is no empty field, as I said.
Firstly, there is the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with fair trial rules, and which has been subscribed to by all Member States and all acceding states.
Secondly, there are some specific procedural rules in the framework decision on the European arrest warrant as such and, thirdly, I am fully supportive of the idea of the Charter of Fundamental Rights being legally binding, with constitutional status.
As soon as we resolve the minor matters of the weighting of votes, it will come into force, I am sure.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 30 lapses.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 December 2003, the European Council gave the go-ahead for the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency, on which, at the end of this month, the Commission will submit a proposal in which we will define this new authorityâs tasks.
The most important of these will be the coordination of the joint deployment of the control services in the Member States.
The checks are to be carried out by, among others, multinational teams, with the inspection strategies to be used, such as benchmarking and common priorities, laid down by the Commission.
We will also be involving experts from the Member States in the setting-up of the agency and consulting the various interest groups.
We expect a study to be produced in September on the operational aspects of this agency, and its results will be discussed by the Council when making its decision.
On the occasion of my most recent visit to Vigo, the Galician fisheries sector suggested potential sites for this agency; I will of course examine these suggestions in detail, and they will also be considered in the studies to which I have referred.
Provided that the Council accepts our proposal, it will then be possible to appoint the board of management and the executive director, and then this enterprise will be, in a sense, up and running.
Â Â  Commissioner, I was aware, as you would expect, of your visit to Vigo, my birthplace, and I know that the cityâs fishing sector, one of the largest in Galicia, in the Spanish State and in Europe, has just issued a set of suggestions concerning the duties and competences of this Agency, which I believe deserve a concrete answer from you.
Furthermore, I believe that you should promote an open dialogue with the sector before defining the Agencyâs regulations and I believe that this institution could provide the much-needed link between those working in the industry and the scientific institutions.
In any event, I wish to ask you expressly whether the Commission has already received the proposal from the Spanish State to ensure that the Agencyâs headquarters are established in Vigo and when you think it will be definitively established there.
Â Â  . Mr President, we have not yet had the official proposal for this Agencyâs actual base, but, as I have already observed, there is still enough time for this, as we first have to establish its legal base.
Although we will be making a proposal for this without delay, this proposal must then make its way through the legislative process.
Â Â  Mr President, my question is a specific one: as has been said, it is clear that it was the Council that decided that this agency should be created in Spain, that this decision was approved and that the democratically-elected Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, accepted that it had to be located in the city of Vigo.
I believe that the Commission has also accepted this, since the Commissioner has been there himself.
I therefore believe there is no doubt about this.
What naturally worries the sector now is when this agency will begin to operate.
I believe that Parliament will have to give its opinion on the Commissionâs proposal and that, once the new Parliament is constituted in July â and this is what I want to ask the Commissioner â I believe that in September â as he has said â it may be in the operational stage.
If in the Autumn â September or October â Parliament gives its opinion and it is in favour, does that mean that in 2005 the agency could be operational or that all the procedures for putting it into operation could be finished, if all the procedures can be carried out on the basis of the new membership of Parliament?
Â Â  . Mr President, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, I would like to make it clear that the Agency cannot start its work before the legal basis for it is established.
I have pointed out that the Commission â which is acting very quickly here â will this month submit the proposal for the legal basis, after which both the Fisheries Council and Parliament will have to state their positions and take a decision.
As things stand at present, we can expect an opinion from Parliament only after the Parliamentary elections, which means that the Council, too, will be able to come to a decision no earlier than towards the end of this year.
Only after this decision has been taken will it be possible to start the recruitment procedures and look for staff, which process will take up a certain amount of time next year.
I regret the fact that it is neither legally nor technically possible to do this more quickly.
Nor will we be able to draw on any funds until such time as the legal basis is in force.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the Commission is of course aware of the presence of Spanish fishing vessels in the waters off the Azores, there does appear to be a certain misunderstanding here on the part of the Portuguese authorities as regards the applicability of Regulation 1954/2003.
Article 5 of this Regulation, which governs the conditions under which fish may be caught in the waters around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, states that the Member States can reserve to local vessels the catching of fish within 110 miles of the coast.
That has been the case ever since 14 November 2003, when this legal provision entered into force.
It is for the Member States to ensure that these regulations are complied with.
It follows that the presence of Spanish vessels in the waters around the Azores outside the 100 nautical-mile limit does not justify any emergency measures of the kind suggested by MrÂ Casaca, as these ships are complying with the rules on access.
I would remind you, in this context, of the Commissionâs statement on the occasion of Regulation 1954/2003âs adoption by the Council, when we also announced a ban on trawling off the Azores, with the intention of preventing damage to the vulnerable ecosystems on the sea bed.
On 3 February this year, we submitted to the Council a proposal for a regulation on this subject.
The Commission is also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the Member States concerned with the intention of ensuring that any friction in the implementation of the new rules is minimised as far as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure this is an oversight, Commissioner, but you did not refer to ArticleÂ 15 of this Regulation, which is very specific as regards revoking the system that currently preserves Azorean waters.
The date referred to is 1Â August or, alternatively, the date of the entry into force of the set of implementing regulations on the fishing effort, which has not yet entered into force.
This article cannot be revoked on anyoneâs whim.
The Council, the only legal authority to have delivered an opinion on the matter to date, as stated in the Minutes of the Council meeting of 19 February, has stated unequivocally that this date must be respected.
I wish to ask you, Commissioner, by what right do you think you can revoke an article for which no other interpretation is possible and which protects the territorial waters of the Azores until 31Â July?
Â Â  . Mr President, for a start, I can assure Mr Casaca that we have consulted our legal services, whose view of these things is precisely that which I have put to you, and no other.
What we have decided, in principle, is that, on the one hand, a new boundary of 100 nautical miles has been laid down, whilst, on the other, the fisheries protection zone has been extended to cover more species of fish, instead of protecting only tuna fishing as was formerly the case.
So, even if you rely on Article 15, I cannot help you.
The Spanish action in the case to which you refer was quite proper.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me point out, by way of introduction, that we will be discussing the issues raised in the last questions in the course of this eveningâs debate on the reform of the olive oil, tobacco, cotton and hops sectors.
Turning to the question itself, the general principle underlying last Juneâs reform of the common agricultural policy was that the funds per country would have to relate to the average aid granted in the course of the reference period.
There is no reason why olive oil should be treated any differently.
The Council of Ministers has already decided to deal with it in parallel to the June reform.
Reviewing the national quotas at the present time would also be contrary to the thinking that prompted us to introduce them in 1998 and it therefore follows that the Member States are responsible for keeping increases in production under control.
At that time, the national quotas were fixed at a level that subsequent studies have confirmed as corresponding to the sectorâs structural dimension in the individual producer Member States at the time.
As you are no doubt aware, Spain has a 43% share of the overall maximum, between its share of the number of olive trees cultivated â 39% â and its share in the area under olive groves, which was 44% in 1998.
Looked at from that angle, what we are debating is very definitely a fair offer.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, you know that the basis used for this reform contains out-of-date quotas with regard to Spain.
You know that, in this regard, Spain is a specific case and that the studies carried out and all the surveys demonstrate that in reality Spanish production is greater than has traditionally been recognised.
Spain has been penalised in terms of its production quotas, and this is clear.
This situation must therefore be recognised because Spain is not the only Member State in it.
Bearing in mind that, in reality, the new reform of the CAP represents a settlement of the previous stage â and when it is settled, it is done in accordance with the calculation of the âreal realitiesâ, and not the out-of-date realities â and bearing in mind that throughout this stage we are now settling, Spain has been penalised in comparative terms â and this can clearly be demonstrated â with a disparity with its real production and, Commissioner, reminding you also that the Spanish olive growers received you always in the great hope that you would appreciate their reality and potential in terms of health and environmental defence, I would ask you: will you not consider the possibility of our real production being reflected in the national budget?
We call for transparency and an adjusted quota.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have to be quite frank in saying that I do not share Mrs Izquierdo Rojoâs view that Spain has been penalised, as there was a reform in 1998, in which absolute upper limits were agreed on, including by Spain.
It cannot therefore be said after the event that Spain was penalised.
Further to that, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I also have to tell you that what you seek will ultimately add up to over a hundred million euros, no more and no less, being spent additionally on support for the Spanish sector to the exclusion of all others.
The problem here is that I cannot, at one and the same time, do as I am required to do and keep this neutral in its effects on the budget while also acceding to your demand and getting another hundred million euros from somewhere.
The fact is that they simply are not there.
Â Â  Mr President, the 1998 review created serious problems in both Spain and Greece, especially with the 419 000 tonne quota, when it was a known fact, on the basis of the data from the directorates of agriculture, that production in Greece totalled 600 000 tonnes and more.
The quota of 419 000 tonnes created serious problems for small olive producers.
As the Ministry of Agriculture, in an effort to manage this issue, reduced production, we had these results; as you know, we had continual demonstrations in Greece because this tiny quota did olive producers an injustice.
So as far as the demand by my honourable friend from Spain is concerned, I think that the injustice is the same in Greece.
That is why, Commissioner, these quotas need to be changed.
Â Â  . I regret, Mr Patakis, that I have to correct you on this.
This is very far from being the same situation as in Spain, nor is it very astute of you, as a Greek MEP, to argue along these lines, as, in 1998, when these things were laid down, Greeceâs national guaranteed quota was â as you quite rightly said â 419.5 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 23.6% of the total for the EU.
If you compare that with the number of trees that you have, which make up only 20% of the overall total, and with the surface in hectares, which amounts to only 18.8% of that in the EU, there would actually be justification for transferring part of your guaranteed amount to Spain, rather than in the direction in which you have called for it to go.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are probably familiar with the traditional English appellations ârubyâ, âvintageâ, âtawnyâ and âlate bottledâ, which, at Community level, are protected terms when applied to fortified quality wines produced in Portugal.
To put it another way, these traditional appellations may be freely used with reference to other quality wines.
In order, though, to be allowed to use these appellations, which are traditional in Portugal, a third country must comply with certain requirements and meet the following conditions:
Firstly, the appellation must be specific, in other words, it must be recognised as a label of quality.
Secondly, the appellation must be characteristic or enjoy a certain reputation, that is to say, the average consumer must be able to recognise it as distinguishing between one wine and another.
Thirdly, the appellation must be traditionally used within the territory of the third country in question.
Fourthly, the rules laid down by the third country must not mislead the European consumer in the event of the wine from the third country appearing on a market within the European Community.
The fifth condition is that the official language of the third country must be English, which it is in the case of South Africa, Australia and the USA.
Where English is not the official language of the country in question, its use must be provided for in legislation and English must have been used for this traditional appellation for at least 25 years without interruption.
As English is not the official language in such third countries as Argentina, Chile or Brazil, and the laws of these countries contain no such provision, these countries cannot use the traditional appellations on the EC market.
In order to be allowed to use a traditional appellation in the EC, a third country must submit a dossier to the Commission, which will permit its use only if the various conditions I have enumerated are complied with.
Consultation of the Member States is guaranteed by the involvement of the Management Committee in this procedure.
Amending the Labelling Regulation will have no adverse effects on trade, as the traditional appellations for fortified wines are limited, whereas third countries generally export ordinary or unfortified wines.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your explanations.
You appear to believe, Commissioner, that designations of prestige are not simply arbitrary labels placed on bottles, but appellations of prestige matured by art, science and weather.
You have just said, however, that these appellations can now be used by third countries provided that they fulfil a raft of criteria, a set of requirements that you have just listed for us.
You even appear to believe that these requirements will protect us from adulteration, counterfeit and fraud.
I, however, do not believe this, Commissioner!
This will open the floodgates for serious damage in future to a very large demarcated region, the first in the world, the Port Wines region, which alone accounts for one-fifth of Portugalâs agricultural exports.
I am sorry that I cannot agree with you, Commissioner, but I am not sure that the requirements and guarantees that you have given us by means of this regulation will really protect the quality of these traditional appellations.
Â Â  . Mr President, if I may again clarify this point, I fully agree with Mr Lage that these appellations are indicators of prestige and are of corresponding economic value in the marketing of these wines.
That much is abundantly clear.
On the other hand, though, we have to comply with certain rules; if we do not, we run the risk of being taken to the WTO and, if we lose the case, then this system of protection is in ruins.
I do believe that the rules we have put in place are in any event sufficient to guarantee adequate protection.
The risk of misuse or of counterfeits, to which you referred, is another issue.
The new provisions do nothing to alter the risk of counterfeiting; it is always there, as the use of these prestigious names is always an attractive option.
In order to address this risk, we have to ensure that appropriate controls are in place, and also that names such as these are not used by those not entitled to them, as happened frequently in the past.
The main thing here is that cooperation with the import authorities should run smoothly, as these imports cannot just find their way across the border, but have to be declared.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Howitt, ladies and gentlemen, in the Commission Communication of 29 September last year, we put forward three possible options, one of which is based on a quota system.
As a thorough impact analysis has shown that implementing the âEverything But Armsâ agreement with the help of an ordered system of rights to supply the market would have a similar effect to what is being done already, we decided instead to consider the âfixed quotasâ option as a variant of the status quo, so all the options continue to be open to discussion.
I would also remind you, though, that the âEverything But Armsâ initiative is the part of the ECâs general preference system that envisages the complete liberalisation of sugar imports from the least developed countries by 2009.
Until then, the sugar trade would normally continue on the same basis as trade in other agricultural produce.
The least developed countriesâreference to flexibility in terms of quantity and negotiated quantitative restrictions could raise questions about compatibility with WTO rules if they were to be seen as a sort of voluntary limitation of exports.
As you will be able to gather from what I have said, we really will not, in our deliberations, lose sight of the situation of the least developed countries, and will be taking it very seriously.
On 3 March, representatives and ministers from the least developed countries presented a new initiative in relation to our rules on the duty-free preferential access of their sugar to the Community market, and I discussed it with them.
We will examine this proposal with great care, as we do all contributions to our preparations for the reform of the common market organisation for sugar.
The initiative aims, over an extended period, to broaden the access that is at present limited.
As we work on these proposals in preparation for their presentation this summer, we will take due account of all contributions received.
Â Â  I am grateful for that answer, Commissioner.
In particular, I am glad that you have been listening to the representations of the least-developed countries and that all options remain on the table.
I should like you to comment more specifically on their argument that the fall in price that is integral to two of the Commission's three options would 'make the EBA initiative meaningless for sugar.
The Commission seems to prefer maintaining free access for the LDCs into a market with a price that is too low for them to compete, over that of negotiating with the LDCs an orderly market that achieves a price that allows them to compete and create development'.
Commissioner, do you not see a parallel with that in the arguments from sugar beet growers in Europe, not least in the UK, who also call for an orderly market with, as they say, European price levels that would allow both domestic and developing country industries to invest for a sustainable future?
Given that the arguments are coming from both developing countries and developed countries within Europe, surely a higher sustained price with a managed reduction is the better course of action.
Could you comment on that specific point, Commissioner?
Â Â  . Mr Howitt, you are, in theory, right to say that higher prices in Europe help to make exporting to Europe a more attractive prospect for poorer states.
You must surely also be aware, though, that there are numerous reasons why the current price level is quite simply unsustainable.
We really should not be deluding ourselves where our own sugar beet farmers or the developing worldâs exporters are concerned.
The current price on our internal market is something like three times higher than that on the international market and, whatever happens, we will, in the current WTO round, be obliged to reduce our external protection for sugar.
That alone will be enough to bring the price down on the internal market; there is no other way of doing it.
That is the problem facing us.
To that we have to add other issues, such as how we can compensate for additional imports from the least developed countries merely by cutting back our own production, for sugar consumption in Europe is not going to increase.
Nor must it be forgotten that sugar faces ever-tougher direct competition from other sweetening agents.
No longer is there any sugar in Coca-Cola today â it contains isoglucose and nothing else. These sweeteners are also in direct competition with sugar.
If, as the USA did a long time ago, we create a free market for them, quantities will increase accordingly.
The result of all that is that, in the European Union, production will not decrease in the same way in every Member State; on the contrary, the simple fact of the matter will be that, in some of them, sugar production will quite simply no longer pay and so they will stop growing sugar beet.
That is what we have to reckon with.
I do not think it makes sense to arouse expectations that we can never satisfy.
There is also the problem of having to consider how we help those developing countries that have traditionally been our sugar suppliers â Mauritius is one example â if they begin to see exporting sugar to Europe as a less attractive prospect than it was in the past.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the poorest countries in the world â or so the media tell us â have asked to be allocated their own sugar import quotas.
Will the Commission be prepared to include considerations such as these in the legislative proposals that it is due to present in the summer?
Secondly, when, in the course of this summer, can the Members of this House expect to see the actual Commission proposals?
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mrs Schierhuber asked when the proposals may be expected.
We have said all along that we intend to present them before the summer and that is still our intention.
The only thing that could create problems is something I have not previously mentioned, namely that the EU is facing a panel in Geneva over the so-called C-quotas issue, and we need to know what can be expected from it.
It follows that another factor we have to take into account is the timetable of the authorities in Geneva.
Turning to Mrs Schierhuberâs other question, Europe is of course an attractive market and it follows that many states would be happy to export to it, but our view is that we need to have clear priorities in this area, and what these boil down to is that only the least developed states should have free access to the European market.
As you will be aware, we have also devised special rules for the Balkan states.
The ACP states are to have limited priority access with a clear preferential tariff, as will the other countries in so far as we have treaties with them.
If we were to allow everyone to export sugar to Europe, we would not need an organised sugar market, but its wholesale liberalisation, which would, however, mean that at least two-thirds of European sugar production would have to be abandoned.
Â Â  . I would like to thank MrsÂ Isler BÃ©guin for this question on a very important subject.
The link between human health and the quality of our environment is indeed a top priority and we need to understand this link better in order to assess the effectiveness of existing policies and ensure that we address the problem adequately.
In a global sense the links between environment and health are addressed in the communication on a European environmental and health strategy adopted by the Commission last year.
In this communication we announced the establishment of a European environment and health monitoring and response system to link information on health effects, exposure to environmental contamination and the emissions responsible for contamination.
Different parts of Europe are facing different problems.
The environment and health strategy is therefore being developed for an enlarged Union, fully involving the new Member States from the outset.
The Commission will now work on presenting an action plan setting out the programme for a first phase, focusing on selected priority diseases and pollutants at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest on 23-25 June.
We are also following the epidemiological work being carried out in the scientific community, and in particular working with the World Health Organisation and other experts to understand the results of research and promote further action.
For example, under the quality of life and management of living resources programme, which is part of the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, a specific key action on environment and health provided support for 16 multidisciplinary multinational research projects devoted to air pollution.
Such studies foster the development of protective measures and feed into the process of regulating pollutant emissions by revealing the causal links between pollutants and health effects and providing tools for measuring exposure and effects.
The Commission's Joint Research Centre is also contributing to increasing our understanding of the link between environment and health in various ways.
As far as air pollution is concerned, the framework for doing this will be the thematic strategy on air pollution, due to be adopted next year, which is currently in preparation through the Commission's Clean Air for Europe programme â 'CAFE'.
This programme includes a very broad survey on the health effects of air pollution, the expected evolution of air quality between now and 2020, the effectiveness of existing policy and the potential for taking further cost-effective measures to reduce emissions.
Â Â  I wanted to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for her reply.
I have no doubt that she is using all the means available to her to try to combat this scourge.
Even so, it must be stated that the situation is very serious both in the European UnionÂ âÂ the future enlarged EuropeÂ âÂ and at world level.
Let us also remember that it was difficult to accept this link between health and environment, and that has often been an excuse for doing nothing.
Today, it seems to meÂ âÂ and this concerns me a great dealÂ âÂ that Members and the politicians responsible are still looking for excuses not to act and give the excessive cost of investing in the environment as an excuse.
I am concerned, Commissioner, because it seems to me that we do not really have our finger on the pulse as regards the health situation in the enlarged Europe.
Have you succeeded in integrating the health situation in Eastern countries and our health situation into EU policies?
Today, in fact, we no longer need to prove that there are links between health and the environment and similarly between poor health and a poor environment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am very pleased about this question, which gives me the opportunity to talk in a little more depth about our communication on the environment and health.
This is one of the issues to which I give highest priority as Commissioner.
I have to admit that it is also one of the most difficult issues of all, because it cuts through the divisions we normally see, in both the Commission and the Member States, into different subject areas and spheres of responsibility.
It is necessary to work across all frontiers in order to link cause with effect, and that is not easy.
Nor is it easy to put a price on the health problems consequent upon environmental pollution.
I think that the World Health Organisation has nonetheless embarked upon a very important piece of work with a view to doing precisely that and to showing that society pays a very high price both for pollution and for health problems.
Clearly, we must also tackle this issue together with the new Member States.
Several of the conferences we have had in order to prepare our action plan have taken place in the new Member States.
We are mobilising their experts so that there shall be no doubt that this is a pan-European way of working on these issues.
We take these matters extremely seriously.
We shall continue to maintain that the cost advantages are so great that it is, in actual fact, profitable for both companies and society to invest in environmental measures that also lead to our having fewer health problems.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I share MrsÂ Isler BÃ©guinâs concern.
Air contamination is indeed a crucial issue as far as peopleâs health is concerned, and an epidemiological investigation such as this is definitely needed.
This would also lend much support to giving priority to scienceâs Sixth Framework Programme and improving the standard, quality and coverage of environmental research.
In your reply you mentioned the Clean Air for Europe programme: CAFE.
Will this programme concentrate just on the quality of the air outdoors and pollution, or could the investigation at the same time include a survey of the quality of the air indoors and especially passive smoking?
I am very worried that the investigation will restrict itself to the quality of the air outdoors and rather narrowly to the contamination of this type of air.
Might one consider it applying to clean air in all its forms, including that to be found indoors?
Could passive smoking in particular come within the scope of the survey in this programme?
Â Â  . This is definitely part of our approach.
There has to be a sound scientific base for any of the actions or measures we propose.
We are working with the World Health Organisation to ensure that we have all the knowledge necessary and that we work on a scientific base.
I should also explain that our environment and health strategy is called 'Scale', which stands for Science, Children, Awareness-raising, Legislation and Evaluation.
This means that the action proposed will be based on scientific results.
It will focus on children.
We will also use legal instruments, etc. We include, where necessary, new epidemiological work, and we are trying to do everything we can to ensure that we have a sound basis and all the facts necessary to do it in a proper way.
Â Â  . The Lada-Velilla power line project mentioned by the honourable Member would cross protected areas in the autonomous communities of Asturias and Castille and Leon.
In 2001, following a complaint filed in August 2000, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure pursuant to ArticleÂ 226 of the EC Treaty.
This procedure, based upon obligations under DirectiveÂ 79/409/EEC on the protection of wild birds and DirectiveÂ 92/43/EEC on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, reached the stage of reasoned opinion â the last step before bringing the case before the European Court of Justice â in April 2003.
Currently, the procedure is aimed at modifying the non-implemented part of the project in the autonomous community of Castille and Leon.
In their answer to the above-mentioned reasoned opinion issued by the Commission, the Spanish authorities undertook to examine alternatives for the remaining part of the project â Puerto de Tarna to Velilla â and confirmed in February 2004 that the necessary studies to comply with the requirements of ArticleÂ 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC will start soon.
These include a full environmental assessment in order properly to identify the effects of the projects on the conservation values of the affected site; if these are considered significant, alternatives will have to be examined.
If no alternative can be identified that is not damaging to the site, the project can only proceed if it can be justified on the grounds of overriding public interest and if provision is made for adequate compensation measures.
In the event of significant effects on priority species identified under the directive, such as the brown bear, an opinion from the Commission may be needed pursuant to ArticleÂ 6(4) of the directive.
The Spanish authorities explain that the necessary nature assessments will not be ready for ten months and that the resulting modified project will be subject to a full impact assessment procedure, in compliance with the provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.
The authorities submitted to the Commission, as supplementary information, a complete set of documents and studies concerning the original project and its likely effects on natural values.
An examination of the details of the above-mentioned Spanish answers is currently underway, which will permit the Commission to decide what course of action it should take in regard to this case.
With regard to the last part of your question, the Commission would welcome and encourage a fruitful dialogue between the interested parties in order to reach an agreed solution, but it cannot interfere in the constitutional competences of the various administrations.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the population is concerned about the Spanish Governmentâs lack of transparency and also about the lack of reliable information from this Commission, which says one thing and then reforms and does another.
I am just going to focus on three questions: will the Commission continue the infringement procedure rather than closing the case, as the Spanish authorities hope with its promise to modify just 30 km of the 90 km route planned, arguing that it is a new project?
Will the Commission consult the Court of Justice of the European Communities at the next infringement meeting without further delay, if there are no new elements a year after the notification of the reasoned opinion and after four years of investigation of this infringement case?
If the regions of Asturias and Castilla y LeÃ³n present it with a new project which respects all natural areas and which conform to Community legislation, would the Commission be prepared to cofinance such a project, in order to prevent the economic losses which the region of Asturias could face by dismantling the existing pylons?
Â Â  . The case in question concerns the part of the project that will not now be implemented.
That part of the project will be replaced by a new one once the full procedure of identifying impacts and exploring alternatives has been completed.
That means that it would, in any case, be a new project and that the old procedure may have to be discontinued.
In that case, should the Commission consider that the new project does not comply with European Community law, a new procedure would be initiated afresh.
The Spanish authorities provided information on these developments in February 2004.
The infringement covers only the non-implemented part of the project.
We cannot take that case to court as it stands.
Â Â  . It appears that a number of Member States refuse to give the public access to the Commission's letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions.
In the recent past the Irish authorities were willing to provide the public with copies of reasoned opinions on request, but the Commission understands that they are no longer willing to do so.
I would like to mention that, as far as possible, the Commission strives to be transparent with regard to its infringement procedures.
That is why it issues regular press releases on them in order to provide citizens with information on the main issues involved.
When it comes to public access to the actual texts of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions, certain rules agreed by the Council and Parliament need to be respected.
These are set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
One of these rules provides that the institutions shall refuse access to documents where disclosure would undermine the protection of the purpose of inspections, investigations and audits, unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure.
Indeed, the Court has held in the Petrie judgment that, in the investigation of infringements, sincere cooperation and a climate of mutual confidence between the Commission and the Member State concerned are required in order to allow both parties to engage in a process of negotiation in the search for a settlement of a dispute.
The safeguarding of this objective justifies refusing access to detailed arguments and representations.
That is why the Commission itself usually cannot give public access to its letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions when the infringement procedure is ongoing.
However, when none of the exceptions to the regulation apply, the Commission may provide copies of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions.
This can be the case in particular where the infringement has been resolved, the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that an investigation would be undermined.
Â Â  I take it from the Commissioner's response that basically, if letters of formal notice have been sent out and no subsequent legal action has been taken, citizens in Ireland who want copies of letters sent to the Irish Government can in fact get them.
That is my interpretation of what you have said, Commissioner.
In relation to ongoing legal action, I cannot understand who the Commission is trying to protect.
If the Commission is taking legal action against Member States it would seem that the interests or the protection of Member States are given priority by the Commission and that we basically end up with a situation where citizens throughout the European Union are going to be accusing the Commission of being extremely secretive and protecting the interests of the Member States.
If you have taken legal action against a Member State, surely the only thing you should be concerned about is any kind of information that would prejudice your case against the Member State?
In relation to access to documents, you are making an extremely restrictive interpretation of the regulation.
In relation to the public interest, surely in many of these cases the public interest should take priority?
I do not understand why the Commission is playing into the hands of the Member States.
By doing this, the Commission is encouraging a culture of secrecy where Member States are not providing the information.
This is going to have a knock-on effect, even in countries such as Sweden which have a tradition of much more openness.
Â Â  . I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission, along with Parliament and the Council, ought to send a signal to citizens all over an enlarged Europe that openness and transparency are what we are actively fighting for and that we want to implement them in such a way that citizens are provided with full information.
The rules in question have also been agreed so that we have decision-making processes through which we can solve problems, and which allow us to deal with cases in a dignified way for both parties.
The Commission may disclose copies of the letters of formal notice and recent opinions when none of the exceptions to the regulations I mentioned apply â i.e. when the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that the investigation could be undermined.
Many of the details are exchanged between the Commission and the Member State, but there is a fear that if these were in the public domain they could be used or misused in such a way that would undermine the whole procedure.
In general, I agree that we should strive for maximum transparency in these processes.
It helps when Member States and the Commission are able to agree.
The Commission also tries, when opening an infringement case, to disclose or give the reasons why it has opened that case against a Member State.
We do not want to disclose all the details of a case, but rather to give the public an idea of what it is about.
Â Â  I must admit I still fail to see how disclosure can really undermine the cases here, but my supplementary is about which Member States actually continue to give out the information on such letters of formal notice and which do not.
Ireland used to have a more open policy than it has now.
Could you please clarify, Commissioner, what the situation is at the moment as far as the other Member States are concerned?
Â Â  . I wish I could give you the full list immediately, but we think that the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands would do it, and most of the others would not.
That is the situation right now, although I may have missed out one or two Member States.
Â Â  . I appreciate that the World Health Organization is now raising awareness as regards climate-change impacts on human health, in a cooperative effort with the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization.
The Commission can support the general recommendations and conclusions of this World Health Organization report on climate change and human health because, for instance, it focuses on the precautionary principle and the principle of sustainable development.
Within the Commission we are taking this carefully into consideration in the formulation of our policies.
The largest benefits of climate policies for human health can be expected from the reduction in the concentrations of ozone and particles.
As climate policies in general reduce fossil fuel use, they also reduce related particulate emissions.
Additional health benefits can be gained by reducing urban concentrations of NO2 and SO2.
Thus, emissions-control strategies that simultaneously address air pollutants and greenhouse gases lead to a more efficient use of resources at all scales, also addressing human health concerns.
The World Health Organization report confirms earlier statements that there are still many knowledge gaps involving likely future patterns of exposure to climatic environmental changes and the vulnerability and adaptability of physical, ecological and social systems as regards such climate change.
Therefore, we need better information to establish further the links between the pollutants and health effects, with a view to improving our climate change and health policies.
The action plan on which we are presently working as a follow-up to the environment and health strategy is designed to integrate this information.
While the action plan focuses on a set of defined exposures and diseases in its first phase, broader issues, including those related to the health impacts of climate change, can be taken up in future phases.
Moreover, the forthcoming thematic strategic on the urban environment, to be adopted by June 2005, and for which an interim communication is presently under discussion within the Commission, should also help local authorities and Member States to improve the environmental performance of cities.
This in turn would also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and make cities healthier places to live.
We are also considering some projects under the Sixth Research Framework Programme.
Within the activities of scientific support to policies of the Sixth Framework Programme, research is also funded on the physical and chemical processes of air pollutants, in particular on particulate matter at the urban to regional scales, in view of their impact on human health.
Under the last Research Framework Programme, the cCASHh project â Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies for Human Health in Europe â was funded to assess the health impacts of climate change.
Â Â  I wish to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for her detailed, informative reply and to assure her that I am aware of the serious concern with which she has always treated this matter.
Indeed, in her reply, she referred to the action plan, the climate strategy and the Sixth Framework Programme.
I should like to compliment her on her interest in pursuing the whole matter.
I hope that the situation will continue to be monitored and will continue to improve.
This issue is one of major international concern, but I know that it could not be in better hands that those of the Commissioner.
Â Â  . The European Community regulates hunting trophy imports through Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein, and the associated Commission Regulation (EC) No 1808/2001, which sets out more detailed rules.
The objective of these regulations is to protect species of wild fauna and flora and to guarantee their conservation by regulating trade therein.
In line with this objective, they have strict criteria for accepting hunting trophy imports.
To begin with, import permits are required for any species listed in Annex A of the Council regulation and these include all species listed on Appendix 1 of CITES - (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), such as leopard, cheetah and elephant, and a number of other popular trophy species such as brown bear, lynx and wolf.
Before granting these permits the authorities in the relevant Member State must obtain scientific advice that the management of the trophy hunt in the country concerned is based on sound biological data, that harvest levels are sustainable and that illegal activities are under control.
There is one further requirement to which I shall especially draw your attention.
Trophy hunting of these species must generate significant and tangible conservation benefits for the species and for the local people who share the area with or suffer as a result of the species concerned.
Trophy hunting programmes that meet this criterion can play a vital role in conserving rare species, especially in developing countries and in encouraging local communities to value them as a resource that needs protection from other more damaging uses.
I am aware that in a number of countries, including Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania, carefully managed trophy hunting provides a major contribution to their relatively successful conservation efforts.
While many people find the concept of hunting trophies distasteful under any circumstances, the Commission considers that a general ban on the import on any CITES-listed species would not be in the best interest of species conservation and the sustainable use of resources.
However, in cases where the criteria for accepting hunting trophies are not met, the Commission has always taken, and will continue to take, the appropriate measures to suspend such trade.
Â Â  I am alarmed to hear the Commissioner's conclusions because it certainly does not seem that the trophy hunting to which I referred is being done with the aim of conservation at all.
I logged on to a website this afternoon, which would have given me the opportunity to go to Tanzania.
It offers the 'discerning sportsman' the ultimate hunting experience: large buffalo, lion, water buck, very rare East African sitatunga, leopards, antelopes, etc.
My information is that in the last six years British people have been abroad and shot at least 40 African elephants, 32 leopards, 18 polar bears, six hippos â I could go on.
Worldwide, this is something like over 3Â 800 African elephants, over 2Â 600 rare leopards and 9Â 000 bears.
These are not being slaughtered in the interests of conservation, or with any reference to conversation in the areas.
It is trophy hunting: people who go out and shoot big game and come home proudly but sickeningly with a trophy of the head of a rare animal.
Would the Commissioner think again, and would she agree to meet me to go through some of these statistics, to see some of the evidence and to put in place a ban on the import of CITES-listed animals into the European Union?
Â Â  . How could I refuse a meeting with a Member of the European Parliament?
I would be happy to meet with you; we could go through my reply, the Commission's position on this matter and the criteria that I explained to you.
We do not accept all types of trophy hunting.
We certainly do not accept the subsequent selling of such 'trophies'.
We have every reason to meet and go through the current situation.
It is also true that, done in the proper way, this can be a very important area of conservation in some of the countries concerned.
Those countries may get something out of this that means they will be better able to manage these resources and wild animals â we also have some good examples of that.
I am fully aware of the reports we have received and also of some very worrying trends, so I am more than happy to meet.
I also welcome nice comments from Members of Parliament!
Â Â  It beggars belief that, in a so-called civilised society in the 21st century, there is still trophy hunting.
It is horrific!
It goes back to colonial times when the British came back from the colonised countries and hung their trophies on the wall.
We should have got past this stage. It is ridiculous.
I agree with Mr Evans about CITES-listed species.
There should be a ban on them.
It is not acceptable.
Apart from that, it is clear that there are illegal imports of trophies into the European Union; surely there must be some way of ensuring that this does not happen.
The European Union puts huge resources and effort into keeping out so-called illegal immigrants, yet it cannot stop the illegal import of trophies.
We should get our priorities right.
Let people in, not these trophies.
Â Â  . I am the first to agree that this is all about how it is being done and that we should not allow something that is illegal.
We have to pursue the culprits in this area.
We must implement the rules that are in place.
As I said, import permits are required for any of the species listed in our annexes to the Council regulation. These correspond to the CITES listing as well.
We need to make sure that we have a judicial procedure and that we counteract illegal imports.
Â Â  â Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m knows full well that hunting raises a lot of passion in France, but I do not want to catch her off guard.
I would like to ask an additional question about hunting as it is currently practised in the future Member States, the Eastern countries.
Are you aware that hunters from the West, from the Fifteen, go in great numbers to hunt in these countries, because the fauna is still very interesting and there are still major trophiesÂ âÂ bears and wolvesÂ âÂ to bring back?
In terms of the Community and the implementation of Natura 2000, do you not think that Western hunters are damaging the wild fauna there, before its time, in search of trophies?
Â Â  The rules are such that the new Member States must already have implemented the nature protection directivesbeforethey join the EU.
It is therefore incredibly important to follow matters up and ensure that this happens, so that no hunting takes place that infringes the existing directives designed to protect wild birds, animals and various other creatures.
Â Â  As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 45 to 66 will be answered in writing (4).
That concludes Question Time to the Commission.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as I have already mentioned, I fully sympathise with the wish to ensure the full protection of public health as expressed in the amendments seeking to introduce binding limit values for arsenic, cadmium, nickel and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
Unfortunately, I do not believe that the proposed amendments would have the desired effect.
In reality, limit values would have to be accompanied either by exemptions for certain areas or by provisions allowing Member States to apply for derogations in cases where the limit values cannot be met. The proposed amendments envisaged the latter solution, but either way we can be sure that derogations will be granted in precisely the areas where the problems occur.
It is difficult to see how this would result in public health being better protected.
Similarly, there is little point in setting long-term objectives without having a clear idea of how such objectives can be met.
For these reasons, the Commission cannot, at this stage, accept any of the amendments that seek to introduce binding limit values.
On the other hand, the Commission could accept the reintroduction of the concept of upper and lower assessment thresholds foreseen in the framework directive, which is the subject of six of the amendments tabled. Although this concept is usually linked with the limit values, the concept has some advantages, even in the absence of limit values, since it provides a flexible regime where the degree of monitoring requirements depends on the level of observed concentrations.
As I said earlier, I am glad that the decision has been taken to postpone the vote to allow time to explore further alternative possibilities. I very much hope that, as a result, we will be able to move quickly towards an agreement on this important subject.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
As you know, the vote has been deferred to a later sitting.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, I will not repeat myself over tobacco, but I find it difficult to believe that Commissioner Fischler thinks that the Commissionâs proposal on tobacco is dictated by health reasons.
It is difficult to think this, and not to think instead that 500Â 000 jobs are being put in jeopardy in Europe. If there really were a link between the prevalence of smoking and the reduction or elimination of tobacco production, I would be the first in this Chamber to support the Commissionâs proposal.
There is no link, though.
By adopting the proposal we would only be harming the citizens of the Union and the tobacco producers without making a real contribution to the fight against smoking.
I would therefore call on the Commission to take into account this position, put forward by many quarters in this Chamber, both by political parties and by individual MEPs.
I am obviously expressing my personal opinion, but I believe that it is widely shared in Parliament, something which we will be able to verify tomorrow in the vote.
With regard to the proposal on olive oil, however, I can say that the approach of the Commissionâs proposal is fairly acceptable.
The need for transparency, attention to the quality, environmental and social value of this product are considered in the Commissionâs proposal and have been re-examined further in the opinion issued by Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The choice to make the decoupling percentage flexible, the possibility that the national States will have, I hope, to modify these percentages, is a positive process of osmosis between the rigid rules of the Commission and the choices of the Member States, an intelligent decision which will allow the national governments to adopt the most appropriate options for the regions.
The question of combating the mixing of oils remains unchanged and well-founded, in order to guarantee transparency and consumer protection, the fight against fraud, the scaling down of inward processing and the attainment of labelling which states and really enhances the place of production and not of processing. In this way, the monitoring agencies can continue to play a part.
I would just call on Commissioner Fischler to see that, following the vote in the Council, with Parliamentâs opinion, the regulations which are adopted are consistent with the decisions, something which unfortunately we have not seen in the past.


Â Â  Mr President, in line with the basic principles for reforming the CAP, which was approved last June, common rules have been established for systems of direct aid for farmers.
This proposal for a regulation consequently enshrines these principles for the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sectors and the proposal is examined by our fellow Member, Joseph Daul, whom I wish to congratulate on his work.
I shall focus, however, on the consequences of this proposal for Portugal.
As regards olive oil, the Commission appears to be unaware of the planting of 30Â 000 hectares of new olive groves with the right to production aid that the Council authorised in 1998.
In fact, Portugal has drawn up a programme for planting these 30Â 000 hectares, which will take place from 2000 to 2006, and its implementation will run as set out in the programme.
This proposal for a revision that the Commission has submitted, however, has destroyed this programme along with the expectations created for producers.
As regards tobacco, the Commission proposal to totally decouple aid will cause farmers to swiftly abandon this crop in Portugal.
This abandoning of production will have extremely damaging effects not only on employment in farming but also on the processing industry.
With regard to cotton, a sector which has expanded substantially in recent years, the Commission proposal penalises production by around 30% which, when taken together with the inadequacy of production-related aid, makes this crop rather unattractive and provides few opportunities to reconvert it.



Mr President, we are once again faced with a Commission proposal that fails to take account either of the specific characteristics of Portuguese farming and indeed of other regional forms of farming, or of the risks that farmers will desert farming altogether or of the unemployment-related social problems that go hand in hand with this process.
This is once again unfairly penalising the income of our farmers and we cannot ...
Â Â  â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to cotton and tobacco, I am bound to begin with a reference to these proposals by the Commission. A quick reaction to them would be that their objective is simply to ensure cultivation of both these crops is discontinued.
The implication seems to be that the whole sector is expendable, along with the thousands of agricultural workers involved who reside in the most disadvantaged areas of southern Europe. In addition, the fact that in the ActsÂ ofÂ Accession of Spain and Greece the MemberÂ States undertook to protect cotton production in those two countries has been completely disregarded.
Due to the penalties imposed pursuant to the 2001 cotton reform, the area under cotton in Spain has already suffered a 20% reduction.
Further, it does not make sense to use cotton as a bargaining counter in WTO negotiations with third countries, as the Commission would like to do.
After all, the EuropeanÂ Union only accounts for 2.5% of world production. In addition, at global level exports are dominated by the UnitedÂ States, whereas the Union accounts for a mere 1.5%.
This is not therefore a valid argument for reducing aid to cotton.
The further reform proposed amounts to an additional turn of the screw.
The very survival of the crop is now under threat.
The proposals for both cotton and tobacco will also cause serious large-scale damage to the entire socio-economic structure based on these crops. I can provide some specific instances drawn from Spain.
The cotton picking and ginning industry represents 2Â 000 jobs.
A further million jobs are directly linked to the sector.
There are also 600 motorised harvesting machines used exclusively to gather cotton.
They would all have to be scrapped.
The situation is even more serious in the case of tobacco.
Tobacco production involves up to 2Â 200 hours of work per hectare.
I shall take the town of Talayuela in the Extremadura region of western Spain as an example.
It is the leading producer of tobacco in Spain.
FiveÂ thousand of its 10Â 000 inhabitants are employed in the tobacco industry. The livelihoods of over 20Â 000 families depend on tobacco in Extremadura alone.
It has to be said that the report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does substantially reduce the level of decoupling of aid proposed by the EuropeanÂ Commission. It goes some way towards lifting the threat to the survival of the crops.
It is vitally important for the House to support this report. That will send a clear message to the CouncilÂ ofÂ Ministers, namely that Parliament is in favour of retaining these particular sectors that generate so many jobs in disadvantaged areas.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council in Brussels, 25 and 26 March 2004 â follow up to the IGC.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am very happy to address you today in relation to the preparations for the Spring European Council and the IGC follow-up.
As you will be aware from our detailed discussions on the Lisbon strategy at the last part-session, the Irish presidency is determined that the primary focus of the Spring European Council should be, as set out at Lisbon and Gothenburg, the follow-up to the Lisbon strategy with a strong emphasis on implementation and the need to target specific areas for concerted action by the Union.
The future financial perspectives and current issues on the international agenda will also be addressed.
The presidency has consistently reiterated the need for the Spring European Council to give a strong signal as to the continued importance of the Lisbon strategy in providing a framework for simultaneous progress on economic, social and environmental renewal throughout the Union.
When I addressed Parliament last month, I outlined the issues on which we intend to focus at the Spring European Council on 25 and 26 March.
I am pleased that Member States share our conviction that the agenda for the European Council should remain focused, and have given broad support for our approach of concentrating on a limited number of key issues.
Similarly, Member States have also agreed that the overreaching priorities for the Council should be those of sustainable growth and employment as identified by us in the first draft of the annotated agenda issued on 17Â February.
The Commission communication on the future financial perspectives â 'Building our Common Future' â was launched here on 10 February by Commission President Prodi.
The presidencyâs approach, which has been agreed by Member States, is that while no discussion is expected, the Spring European Council should agree conclusions on the procedure to be followed in considering the dossier over the coming months.
The Taoiseach will present the Irish presidencyâs report on where matters stand in the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is intended that this will be discussed over dinner on the first evening by the Heads of State and Government.
It is the presidencyâs intention to invite representatives of observers at the IGC, including the President of the European Parliament, to be present.
On the basis of our report and following discussions at the dinner, it will then be for the European Council to decide how best to proceed, and in particular whether the time is ripe for the IGC to be re-convened.
I hope you will understand that it is not appropriate for me at this time to go into any detail on what that report will contain.
We have still not definitively concluded our analysis of the situation.
Consultations and contacts are ongoing.
The Taoiseach owes it to his colleagues to present matters to them in a very direct manner.
However, I would offer the following observations.
In keeping with our mandate from Brussels in December, the Irish presidency has consulted widely among participants in the IGC, including the European Parliament.
The Taoiseach has spoken with all other members of the European Council.
Intensive and detailed discussions have also taken place at ministerial and official levels.
Partners have agreed with us in good faith and in a positive and constructive way.
As a result, we have a deeper appreciation of the concerns of all involved.
We also have a greater understanding of where scope for compromise and possible agreements might lie.
We have had very useful and detailed discussions with Parliamentâs representatives Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr Brok.
They have made clear to us Parliamentâs general approach to the IGC, and its priorities in the negotiations.
We very much appreciated the constructive and frank way they have dealt with us.
More generally, Parliamentâs strong support for our efforts is greatly appreciated.
In particular, you have tried to keep us and partners focused on the big picture, on the immense prize which adoption of the Constitution would represent, and on the very significant and considerable dangers for our Union which would flow from a continued stalemate.
In our consultations, we have confirmed that there is a range of outstanding institutional and non-institutional issues, of varying complexity and sensitivity, which have been raised with us.
Most of these were identified by the Italian presidency in the paper published ahead of the meeting of the European Council in December, though others are also on the table.
We have gone through all of these questions carefully and in some significant detail.
While there has been particular public focus on the institutional side of things, I can assure Parliament that our discussions with partners are not limited to those aspects of the draft Constitutional Treaty.
Our broad sense is that, while there are a reasonable number of outstanding issues, on the great majority it will be relatively easy to find consensus in the context of a process leading to an overall conclusion.
Moreover, we have ascertained that there are many other issues, including some of considerable importance, on which there is effectively already agreement â although formally nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.
Of course, the great bulk of the Conventionâs text has not been called into question at any stage of the IGC, and I am glad to say that very much remains the case.
I cannot say today whether it will be possible for the IGC to conclude its work during the Irish presidency.
I can say this, however. If it were a matter for the Irish presidency we would resolve it.
We have made it clear to this Parliament and we have made it clear in many statements that we are anxious and ambitious to achieve a resolution.
It is also, however, very important to put it on the record that 25 Member States and 25 governments have a responsibility in this matter: it does not come down to the presidency.
Whether it is decided to convene a further meeting of the IGC in the near future is very much a matter of judgment for the European Council.
However, I can say, and I have said it several times, that if political will is present, it will be easy to find a solution to the outstanding issues.
The key to early agreement is political willingness to agree.
It is now over two years since the European Convention began its work.
The issues have been debated intensively and extensively.
At this point, I do not believe that outstanding differences will become easier to resolve over time.
I have said this on several occasions in the last week or two: the difficulties that exist today will be more difficult in the future.
In the second half of this year it will not be any easier to resolve the issues.
There is a whole series of other issues that will make it more complex.
Parliament will change, the Commission will change, the political players will change and it would be unwise to take the view that we have time on our side.
There are important issues to be considered in the second half of this year.
It is my strong belief that these are all better considered independently of each other and that is another reason why we should go for the earliest possible solution, because if the issues come together it will make resolution more difficult.
I continue to believe that the new Constitution is profoundly in the interests of the Union and its citizens.
It is a quantum leap forward in terms of clarity and accessibility.
It will provide the Union with a solid foundation for its future growth and its future development.
It will enable the Union to respond more effectively to the concerns of citizens and to play a more dynamic role in the wider world.
In a sense it is a prize well worth striving for.
If there is a will to compromise â and let there be no doubt that without some compromise on all sides there will be no agreement â then I believe it should be possible to move things forward rapidly.
As we have said before, if there is a serious possibility of progress, the Irish presidency will immediately move to seize that possibility.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I regret the unavoidable absence of President Prodi but, as you know, he has official obligations elsewhere.
The Commission welcomes the opportunity provided by the discussion this morning to draw attention to the importance of a satisfactory agreement on the proposed constitution.
Obviously, the analysis made at Laeken still holds good and the enlarged Union still needs reform in order to ensure that it can work in the public interest with higher standards of efficiency and with greater democracy and transparency.
This is plainly unfinished business, and, equally plainly, it must be tackled with determination.
In the unique association of democracies that makes up the European Union careful deliberation is always necessary but no constructive interests are really served by prolonged stalemate.
That is why the Commission fully supports the approach taken by the Irish presidency.
Minister Roche's report is clear.
The Commission is convinced that the presidency has done, and is still doing, exactly what is necessary.
After the breakdown of the Brussels European Council, the only realistic course was to proceed in the way followed by the Irish presidency and to sound out the prospect for progress through bilateral consultations.
It is an arduous course and no doubt Mr Roche and his colleagues have the air miles to prove it.
However, our Irish colleagues have a true talent for promoting understanding â except, of course, where English rugby is concerned â and we hope that their diligent efforts will bear fruit and that the presidency report to the European Council will be able to conclude that all delegations are disposed to sign the constitutional treaty before the European elections.
Such progress will require some willingness to revise original negotiating positions, but the Commission continues to believe that such developments are feasible and that the conclusion of a constitutional treaty can be achieved under the present presidency.
As Mr Roche said on this issue â it is not always true in politics but it is in this case â time will not change the basics or make a resolution easier.
One of the factors which propels such a view is recognition of the reality that, if the IGC was not satisfactorily concluded this year, the prospects for establishing a constitution for the Union will begin to appear remote.
The momentum provided by the Convention will then manifestly continue to diminish and, in the very nature of politics, debate about the Treaty will become entangled with other controversies, such as those which naturally and inevitably will, for instance, be associated with the financial perspectives.
No democrat could, or would, fear the prospect of multiple debates, but clarity and rigour in all discussions would obviously be served best by ensuring that each salient issue is tackled on its own terms and merits.
Meanwhile, the rational desire to conclude the IGC successfully and with reasonable dispatch should not deflect us from the course which Parliament and the Commission have followed on the content of the constitution.
I am sure that the Commission reflects the majority opinion in this House by emphasising that the text drafted by the Convention should not be diluted.
We have all heard the maxim 'better no constitution than a bad constitution' and no sensible person could possibly disagree with that.
But those can hardly be considered to be the sole true alternatives.
The risk is surely not a bad constitution, since it is highly unlikely that the IGC would agree to something that was noxious or ineffectual.
The real risk is rather that the Convention draft becomes amended to the point where, cumulatively, almost accidentally, the ambition and the attractiveness of the constitution dwindles and the singular opportunity of clarifying and developing the Union provided by drafting a constitution slips away.
The representatives and, more importantly, the people of the European Union would then inherit problems rather than answers.
That is why the basis for the constitution should continue to be the text presented by the Convention.
Obviously, on some points, improvement is possible.
For instance, debates in the months before the Brussels European Council showed that the fact that a proposed change attracts widespread support from Member States does not necessarily make it a move in the wrong direction, as some seemed to contend at the time.
Meanwhile, in the Commission â and, I emphasise, explicitly in the interests of the Union â we were glad to note that most, if not all, delegations realised that making a distinction between voting and non-voting Commissioners would simply not work.
We trust, therefore, that no variations on that impractical and divisive theme will reappear.
Naturally, Parliament, the Council, the Commission and everyone else has to continue to exercise care.
For instance, the Italian presidency has helpfully made it clear that some of the texts circulating in the final hours of the December European Council â which some regarded as presidency compromises â have no formal status.
Most of those suggestions would, as it happens, have been unacceptable to either the Commission or Parliament or, indeed, both.
We are certain that the Irish presidency will, characteristically, show its own constructive sensitivity, regardless of the hour of the day or of the night.
The House is fully aware of the controversial issues that remain.
The Commission has made it clear on many occasions that it holds the view that the compromise reached in the Convention on the 'double-hatted' status of an EU foreign affairs representative should not be changed, that the enhanced budget powers of the European Parliament should not be altered, that the scope of qualified majority voting should not be reduced.
The Commission has also made clear its opinion, particularly when we are only weeks away from a European Union with 25 Member States, the practical case for an extension of qualified majority voting is stronger than ever.
On that particular point, the House will know that the Commission considers that the double-majority proposal of the Convention is the best approach for the definition of QMV.
That also reflects practicality and proportionality.
It is clear that full and necessary articulation of arguments will ensure that decision-making in the enlarged Union is never easy.
To make effective agreement on necessary decisions even harder by fixing a QMV threshold which is so high that the focus is on forming blocking minorities rather than on reaching consensus would, however, be a formula for and the Union as a whole could not benefit from that.
The Commission's view continues to be that a double majority of 50% of the Member States representing 50% of the population would be both clear and balanced.
However, the Commission accepted the Convention's compromise of 50% of Member States and 60% of population, although, I have to say, the Commission still believes that a 50% and 55% formulation would fit the purpose of effective decision-making still better.
Whatever compromise is eventually reached, it is obvious that no one should forget that the draft constitution will need approval and ratification through the democratic processes of 25 Member States.
An arrangement that increases complexity and intensifies the difficulties of making the enlarged European Union work well would hardly be likely to attract understanding or support in either parliaments or plebiscites.
We are certain that the Presidency, the majority in this Parliament, and a wide spectrum of governmental and public opinion understands that.
We wish the Irish presidency well in its sustained efforts in the interests of a modern Union and its citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin with a few words to the President-in-Office on behalf of my group to express our sincere appreciation and admiration of the way in which the Irish Government is conducting its presidency of the Council.
It is working with goodwill, a strong sense of purpose, discretion and efficiency.
I believe this is a good example of the way in which even our less populous countries can achieve major political progress.
Mr President-in-Office, I emphatically welcome your statement that, if it were a matter for the Irish presidency, you would bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion during your tenure.
This confirms our impression that your presidency is giving of its best.
Let me say on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that we warmly welcome the fact that things have started to move and that this movement extends to unresolved issues, particularly that of the double majority.
For my own part, I have always urged the Government of Germany to be flexible and move forward.
Since this is now happening, I must clearly acknowledge it.
But these efforts by the German Government must be accompanied by similar efforts on the part of other governments.
This is not the time or place to be apportioning blame for mistakes or for obstructive rigidity; the time has come for all governments to make compromises, and we call on them to do so.
The stakes are high; the President of the Council spoke of dangers â that is how his words were translated into my language â and so it is important that we remind ourselves again of what we seek to achieve through this constitution.
Our European values are described in the preamble, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The functions and responsibilities of the European Parliament are described in the draft constitution.
Its provisions represent a huge leap forward for the European Parliament, democracy and parliamentarianism in Europe.
The legislative activity of the Council of Ministers is to become more transparent, even though we will not get the legislative council we have asked for.
Under the Conventionâs proposals, the Commission will be appointed in such a way, with the President of the Commission being proposed by the Heads of State or Government, that its composition will reflect the results of the European elections.
This is truly great progress, because it would enable the people of the European Union to influence the nature of the Commission through the ballot box.
While we are well aware that this is not yet applicable law, we advocate the introduction of such an arrangement in time for this yearâs European elections. This would mean that, in proposing a President of the Commission, the Heads of State or Government would take account of the result of the European elections.
This accords with democratic principles; it is a fair solution; it is not motivated by party-political considerations but is a matter of principle.
Mr President-in-Office, when the nomination of a President of the Commission is discussed under your presidency, we urge you to take the outcome of the European elections into account in your deliberations.
We do need to call to mind the strenuous efforts that were made before the Conventionâs proposal materialised.
I should like to reiterate my thanks to the two representatives of Parliament, KlausÂ HÃ€nsch and ElmarÂ Brok, for their great work and, of course, to ValÃ©ryÂ GiscardÂ dâEstaing for his chairmanship of the Convention as well as to all those from our Parliament and from the national parliaments and governments who contributed to the final draft.
This whole effort must not be allowed to end in failure now.
I remember very well how the President of the French Republic, as President of the European Council, explained the Treaty of Nice to us in December 2000 and how, in his response to our criticism of the outcome of the Nice Summit, he made a declaration of intent.
The first step towards the creation of the Convention on the Future of Europe was taken when the French President agreed that there was a need to think about introducing a new method of reforming the EU, and the next was the Laeken decision and the work with which we are all familiar.
That work must not be in vain.
From the first of May, we shall be a Community of 455Â million people.
We need clear and sound legal foundations for the European Union of the future, so that this whole structure can be held together.
At the heart of the constitution are the means by which we can agree on common methods and peacefully resolve conflicts of interest and disputes.
In short, the constitution is all about a peaceful future for our continent, and it is a project that must not be allowed to fail.
MrÂ President-in-Office, I wish you every success and hope that you will harvest the fruits of these efforts before the end of your presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to genuinely apply the principles of fraternity, solidarity and equality and to bring forward the European Constitution.
The has taken up that task and I would suggest that the Irish Presidency â a country of poetry and literature â remember a phrase by a great European, a French citizen, who proposed a United States of Europe in the nineteenth century, Victor Hugo, who said: the future has many names.
For the weak, unattainable.
For the meek, unknown.
But for the brave, opportunity.
I believe that moment has come, because we must remember that, according to the Eurobarometer, enthusiasm for Europe is decreasing in almost all of our countries.
Nevertheless, 78% of citizens are in favour of having a Constitution, including the British â 51%â which is interesting.
I would therefore appeal to the Spring European Council to renew the Intergovernmental Conference or, better still, to take the bull by the horns and for the Heads of State or Government to sit down to resolve the outstanding issues.
That is what they should do if they really understand what an historic moment we are at.
With regard to the issues that are still contentious, we should work on the premiss that our Unionâs power must not lie in blocking decisions but in reaching decisions by majority.
In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to express the support of my group â and specifically my Party â in order to unblock the situation in my country, in order to replace the cat-fighting method with constructive debate.
It is truly an important step; to use the double majority and a weighting which allows us to move forward and to function.
Another important issue â above all fundamental to Parliament â is the scope of qualified majority voting and the balanced distribution of legislative power between Parliament and the Council, including budgetary power.
There have been significant backward steps in the recent drafts of the Italian Presidency.
And it is an issue of serious concern to us.
I believe that Parliament should express its opinion clearly.
We are not prepared for there to be a clear backward step because the Constitution is approved.
Another important point dealt with in the informal meeting, as well as many others, which was held in Berlin amongst three countries is the creation of a person in charge of the economy in the Commission, a minister for coordination.
Parliament had repeatedly argued that we needed responsible economic governance.
We have a draft Constitution in which there is a Minister for Foreign Affairs but there is none for the economy.
If we seriously want the Lisbon strategy to make progress, a strategy which creates employment and which also creates technological conditions for the future, we must give it a face.
There is no reason why this cannot be subject to consideration and an amendment to the Constitution by the Intergovernmental Conference.
With regard to the financial perspectives â which also continue to be a contentious issue â we support the Commissionâs presentation of the proposal for the financial perspectives in accordance with its responsibilities and we cannot accept being haggled down, above all at a time of enlargement.
Parliament could have said that it is in favour of 1.4% of GDP.
We have accepted the Commissionâs position, but we do not believe that haggling is a good sign for the future.
Finally, Mr President, my group is clearly in agreement with taking account of the result of the European elections, on the basis that we all want to win them.
In any event, however, there is a fundamental point: given the European political landscape, no party is going to have a hegemony and, if we apply parliamentary thinking when it comes to proposing the President of the Commission, we must be consistent.
In a parliamentary system, the important thing is the capacity to create majorities, and that is done according to a programme.
Therefore, Mr Poettering, it makes no sense to issue vetoes prematurely.
We are also prepared to win the elections and we are then prepared to create a progressive and Europeanist coalition.
We will now have to see how prepared you are to do the same.
Â Â  Mr President, this Spring Council will be dominated by the economic reform agenda and rightly so.
Yet there is something a little strange in talking about the future of Europe when the draft constitution fashioned to facilitate that future languishes in Council.
Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House welcome the intensive consultations undertaken by the presidency.
Signs from most national capitals suggest that it should not be beyond the wit of our Member States to deliver a deal.
President-in-Office, we urge you not to give up on your efforts to break the deadlock at the IGC and secure a constitution for Europe before the elections to this House in June.
I should also like to thank you, President-in-Office, for going off-script in your remarks.
Your line that it is 'possible to find a consensus in the context of a process leading to a conclusion' is one of SirÂ Humphrey's finest.
I am pleased to see that he is alive and well in Justus Lipsius.
However, your line that the key to it all is political will is exactly right.
The potential problems of an EU of 25 are painfully clear.
Without institutional reform this Union cannot function effectively.
It is time to stop pretending that life will somehow go on if the IGC fails.
Forget the infamous Polish slogan 'Nice or death'.
For an enlarged Europe, Nice death.
I share the Commission's concern about tinkering with the draft constitution.
Some of Europe's leaders are playing poker with the Union's future in the last chance saloon.
It is time to show our cards: governments, people, parliamentarians alike.
Do we demand a stronger, more credible Europe at home and abroad?
Do we insist on integration where it is needed?
Do we want the President of the Commission to be Europe's best and brightest, able to command support across party lines?
Liberal Democrats and Reformers are in no doubt about our answers to these questions: yes, yes and yes!
I regret that the European left, which gave us the inspirational leadership of JacquesÂ Delors, now seems to lack conviction about the future of our continent.
MrÂ Poettering's platoon seems more concerned about making the next President of the Commission their political plaything than about the content of his or her programme.
It is alright, Mr Poettering, for Wilfred Martens to claim that the PPE-DE is 'uncompromisingly pro-European': you look more like pro-European to me!
Do you speak in the name of all of your Group, or just one part of it?
The European Council also has to debate Europe's external relations.
It should be recognised that without exception, Europe speaks more strongly in the world when it speaks with a single voice.
That is why, President-in-Office, I make this appeal to you: last night, five of the nine British detainees at Guantanamo Bay were repatriated to the United Kingdom.
Even as a British citizen, I see this less as a gain for Britain than as a loss for Europe.
Because if the Council had pushed Europe's case over bilateral bargains, we might have had a more united and principled stand.
We should have insisted on securing the release of all Europe's detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
I challenge your presidency to stand up for our Union's values by speaking for Europe as a whole at the EU-US summit on the issue of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees.
We have to pull together now as a continent or we will fall apart.
The pro-European forces in government and this House have to make their case with conviction, because we need a new constitution, a new credibility and a new self-confidence, and we need them now.
Â Â  â Mr President, one of the European Councilâs tasks will be to conduct an impact assessment on the Lisbon strategy, and, in this, it would do well to ponder the lesson contained â or so I see it â in the document addressed to it by the Commission, which shows how the free-market approach that characterises the EUâs current policies is incompatible with an advanced social model based on the non-elitist and inclusive encouragement of peopleâs abilities.
I will of course reassure Commissioner Kinnock that the Commissionâs document refrains from drawing such conclusions from the four years of the Lisbon strategy, but its circumlocutions and other understatements are eloquent testimony to its authorsâ embarrassment at having to draw up this particular balance sheet.
One of the objectives that the EU set itself at Lisbon was full employment by 2010.
How far have we got?
Employment has proved pretty resistant, or so it appears from the report, which goes as far as to invent the piquant neologism of âdelayed improvements in employment levelsâ, before admitting the bitter truth that, âin its first decline in ten years, the euro zone recorded a loss of some 200Â 000 jobs (in net terms) in 2003, and the unemployment rate should continue to rise slightly in 2004â.
At Lisbon, the EU also set itself the goal of becoming, by the same date, the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
What view does the Commissionâs interim report take of that?
Let me quote: âfollowing the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, this has given rise to undeniable progress, instituting the transition needed towards a competitive economy characterized by growth, etc.â.
Then come the facts in all their brutality.
After four years of the Lisbon strategy, let me quote the Commission, âthe percentage of young people dropping out of the school system without any qualifications was over 18% in 2003, 17.2% of young Europeans aged 15 do not have the minimum necessary skills (reading, writing, arithmetic)â.
Those are the words of the Commission.
This unsparing judgment is followed up by reference to âthe decline in overall investment, in both the public and private sectors, to the detriment of the priority areas identified by the Lisbon strategy, such as research, innovation, education, and trainingâ.
Finally, the Commissionâs report offers a new and bold definition of another of the Lisbon strategyâs key concepts: âthe sustainable development approach is beginning to be taken into account in the definition of policies [...] it is thus that several Member States have embarked on reforms to their pension systems in order to face up to the problems of an ageing populationâ.
If that is what sustainable development is, then the Council must surely be full of ecologists.
Having laboured and brought forth this diagnosis, the Commission offers its solutions: the free-market model is getting nowhere, long live the free-market model â or so its watchword appears to be.

It thus sees it as âvital to maintain a strong-competition policy in the internal marketâ, going on to add that the Stability Pact must be adhered to, that it is necessary to press on with reforms to pensions and healthcare systems, that environmental policy must be made to pay, and even that the most profitable areas of education and training must be identified.
How bad, though, must the social and political crises brought about by this free-market ideology be before a glimmer of critical intelligence has the chance to make its presence felt in the EUâs corridors of power?
All the evidence indicates that the only way of saving the European ideal is to make a clean break with this machinery for churning out human mess and despair.
After the Spring Summit, it will be time to work towards a new spring for Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, somewhere in Paris, in the care of the Chairman of the Convention, ValÃ©ry Giscard dâEstaing, is a huge display board which, on the day of the Conventionâs last meeting, stood at the front of the conference Chamber.
All the members of the Convention affixed their signatures to it, thereby declaring their consent to the Conventionâs great draft Constitutional Treaty.
Yesterday I asked President Giscard dâEstaing to release this board.
My proposal is that it should be displayed in front of the next summit of Heads of State or Government, some of whom have completely forgotten that they sent their own personal representatives to take part in that constitutive process and that the signatures of those representatives attest to their having endorsed the result of the Conventionâs deliberations.
In addition, this might also make the Heads of State or Government remember what the Convention was and what it achieved.
At the present time we have two main problems.
The first of these is that the Convention cannot defend its own draft and, with the Convention having completed its work, the European parliaments have lost the only place where they could coordinate their efforts and join forces to defend the parliamentary and democratic dimension of the constitutional provisions.
Our second main problem, Mr President-in-Office, is that the Convention was public.
The Intergovernmental Conference marks a reversion to those clandestine, discreet and conspiratorial gatherings of our imperial potentates, who presume to develop the European constitution in this feudal manner â a constitution which, by its very nature, is a parliamentary matter.
It would therefore be good and seemly if governments were to show due respect to parliaments and to the authors of the draft constitution by ensuring that their deliberations are not governed entirely by one single motive.
The Convention had aims.
Those aims related, quite simply, to democracy, effectiveness and Europeâs place in the world.
What has driven the governments to formulate the 320 proposals of which we here have become aware?
Only one motive: more power for the national governments.
That is their one and only goal.
All 320 proposals have but one common denominator: no more social Europe, no more democracy, no more fundamental civil and other rights, no more parliamentarianism, no more efforts to build an effective EU, but only more power for themselves.
Whether that upsets the democratic balance, whether it is an affront to republican principles or disenfranchises parliaments, is of no consequence to them.
Anyone who is seriously concerned about this trend might recognise a second motive, namely nationalism.
The entire Intergovernmental Conference is imbued with a spirit of nationalism that we no longer want to see in Europe, and this mixture of more power for governments and nationalism represents the greatest danger to our continent.
I marvel at the gentle patience of the honourable Members of this House.
Every four weeks, we submit a petition in the form of a resolution: âMost gracious Intergovernmental Conference, we humbly beg that democracy might exist alongside the power of governments; we plead for fundamental rights, including civil rights; we beseech you to let parliamentarianism exist alongside the power of governmentsâ.
But we are not even successful supplicants, for they do not listen to us, and nothing changes.
Five months!
It took 105 people 16 months to develop a constitution for Europe, but it has taken 25 governments only five months to tear it to shreds.
Mr President, thank you for your patience.
Perhaps you can help in some way to ensure that this board, which will have historic importance one day, is displayed on the wall in front of the Council.
Let it serve as a reminder that the future of Europe is at stake.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, my sincere thanks and appreciation to the President-in-Office for the very open, sincere and straightforward presentation he made this morning; it clearly shows his respect for Parliament, for which I thank him.
I also thank Commission Vice-President Kinnock for his congratulations and good wishes for Ireland winning the Triple Crown, particularly after their tremendous win at Twickenham last weekend.
The spring summit will focus on two primary issues: first, to move forward a raft of new EU legislative provisions to ensure that the European Union becomes more competitive; second, to assess the state of negotiations with regard to enacting a new European Union treaty.
A strong competitive and stable economy is essential in order to deliver sustainable growth and a better quality of life to the citizens of Europe.
We must do more to advance the Lisbon strategy so as to ensure the Union becomes the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
In creating more and better quality jobs in Europe, we must implement a broad-ranging set of policies at EU level.
We know that the internal market is said to have created over 2.5Â million jobs within the last ten years alone.
We must fully implement the Action for Growth initiative, which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks.
The Action for Growth initiative must also ensure that the research and development investment target of 3Â % of GDP within the Union will be met by 2010.
All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for its impact on enterprise and competitiveness.
The financial services action plan must be implemented so that there will be an integrated financial services market in the Union by 2005.
A Community and patenting system must also be enacted within the Union.
The Union cannot become the most knowledge-based economy in the world unless it takes full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies.
The e-EuropeÂ 2005 programme will seek to introduce a greater level of broadband to schools to guarantee access to high-speed Internet services and increase skills development for our young people.
I firmly believe that the benefits of the information society must be spread to both urban and rural areas and to all regions within the Union.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, will present to this meeting an assessment as to the state of the negotiations with regard to the new EU treaty.
MrÂ Ahern has accelerated the process of negotiation with other EU governments, in an effort to move quickly forward the discussions concerning the key bottom-line issues.
We all know that we must put in place a new European Union treaty, if the European Union is to modernise and become more effective in a Community of 25 Member States.
