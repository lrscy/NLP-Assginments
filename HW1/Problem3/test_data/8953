There was a lingua franca but no monetary union, and so on his return his honestly earned pounds sterling were confiscated from him.
Today there are no more journeys on mule-back because we use aeroplanes, there is no longer a lingua franca but we have our wonderful simultaneous interpreters.
In short, all the material conditions are in place for a European culture to spread its message of peace and civil order throughout the world, because Europeans can tap into a rich vein of cooperation in the cultural field.
Such cooperation is affirmed, or rather invoked in the Treaties and official speeches, but funding does not follow as it could and should do.
Instead, concrete decisions end up loudly contradicting the solemn declarations, decisions and non-decisions, like the unfortunate one at Nice which paralysed European cultural policy.
This motion for a resolution is an attempt to react to this paralysis, to pragmatically encourage cooperation among European countries in the field of culture, beginning with the obvious requirements of adopting a common vocabulary, comparable statistics, the reciprocal provision of information, systematic comparisons, a selection of best practices and the opening up of areas in which it seems most suitable and appropriate to adopt common approaches and policies.
I ardently hope, Mr President, that the Commission will match its efforts to the aims and give the resolution the attention it deserves, placing the problem of culture and cultural cooperation at the centre of the great European project.
We are different and united at the same time: this is an opportunity to show it!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ruffolo' s report seeks to achieve better and deeper cooperation between the Member States, with regard to their respective cultural policies.
It also makes another good point that should be highlighted: the Commission' s cultural policy, specifically in its implementation of the Culture 2000 framework programme, should prevent a degree of fluctuation in the criteria for the selection of candidates.
The Commission is swamped every year with a huge variety of proposals, but the resources available to it are ridiculously limited and there are many agents and operators whose valid proposals are passed over as a result of these limitations.
The Commission is currently trying to come up with procedures that will, in its opinion, provide a better response to these problems.
The follow-up to Culture 2000 will soon be studied and we shall make a statement on it.
Using the instruments described in Mr Ruffolo' s report will ultimately provide the Commission with more precise data on the cultural policies of the Member States and on the cultural requirements they feel they have.
A cultural policy at European level must take these factors into consideration when defining its objectives and outlining its criteria for selecting candidates.
We should not forget that we are talking about a European cultural policy and not about national policies.
These, incidentally, are also covered, to a great extent, by the Structural Funds, and it therefore makes sense to take account of the dual nature of the resources involved. Nevertheless, we must methodically separate the scope of a European cultural policy, on the one hand, from the range of national policies, on the other.
At European level, therefore, the institutions should concern themselves mainly with the implications of the cultural heritage common to all of Europe and avoid confusion with national policies developed by the Member States without prejudice, of course, to stimulating multilateral dialogue between the contemporary creations of these States.
A European cultural policy must contribute to actively placing Europe' s huge and multifaceted cultural heritage within the grasp of its citizens.
Mr President, I welcome what I believe we will all agree is an exemplary piece of work.
We now have a comprehensive blueprint for the way in which cultural policy could operate in the Union.
The rapporteur has worked particularly well with the initiator of policy and legislation in the European Commission.
I should like to make a few points.
First of all we have to acknowledge in this House and beyond that the creative and knowledge industries have become a driver in our new global economy and that the skills that we need therein have become vital to our performance in the European economy.
More than this, the social and philosophical needs that we have in mastering the cultural question become central to ensuring that we have stability in our globalised world.
This means that we have to recognise the importance of funding for cultural activities.
We have to face some very difficult questions: for instance, an increasingly small part of our economy in the new global world is agriculture.
The common agricultural policy, as we all know, takes a vast amount of our funds.
If we are to recognise the primacy of the knowledge and information economy in the new global economy then we have to face the reality of looking at different priorities for our fundings.
All the measures in the Ruffolo report are deliverable, but in order to deliver we must ensure that we have cooperation across institutions and at different levels of government.
This means that we must look, for instance, at the structural funds and the way in which we monitor the amount of money that is spent on cultural activities.
Recently a Commission official said to me that we could not do this.
I have to inform him that all he needs do is to go to any of the municipalities in the Union and they will tell him how to do it.
That is what officials are employed to do.
He could even look at the Single Programming Documents in order to do this.
It is possible to do it when we need to.
I say this not to slight the Commission or their staff but to say that cooperation is needed in order to achieve what Mr Ruffolo, in such an exemplary manner, has set out.
Mr President, I want first of all to thank Mr Ruffolo for all the dedicated work he has done on this report.
Allow me to remind you that it was also at Mr Ruffolo' s request that a statistical comparison of the Member States' cultural activities was made.
This was a very interesting and relevant document.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has no doubt that culture is a fundamental component of the EU' s identity.
Our group believes that respect for, and promotion of, cultural and linguistic diversity and of the common cultural inheritance is an essential factor in integration and the promotion of human individuality.
We want to see a European cultural policy which is not in any way aimed at uniformity but which offers the kind of identity that arises in the encounter of differences - a policy which contributes to social cohesion and which is essential to the sense of being a European citizen.
Cultural policy is one of the EU' s small policy areas, and that is the way it should be, too.
The EU must expend its energies on the key areas: the internal market, economic policy, foreign policy and asylum and immigration policy, and that is why we must also be very cautious about otherwise well-meaning initiatives in the area of cultural policy.
Allow me also to remind you that people want decisions to be taken as close to themselves as possible.
That was what the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, emphasised here in the House earlier today.
The EU must not be involved in governing Europe in detail. That is best left to the Member States.
That is why the ELDR Group has tabled amendments designed completely to remove conclusions 8 and 10.
We believe that these are conclusions intended to broaden the scope of Article 151 of the treaty, and that is not something we want to be a party to.
We also believe that the proposals are contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, something we take very seriously. Finally, we do not consider that the time is ripe for extending the economic framework of the EU' s activities in the area of cultural policy, something to which the proposal also refers.
The ELDR Group cannot support the report if conclusions 8 and 10, or the compromise amendments to these, are adopted.
Mr President, a very good evening and welcome to Europe's first culture channel.
But joking apart, what can I say to you in just a minute?
Perhaps I should try to take the wind out of the sceptics' sails.
This is not about intervention, it is not about interfering in national cultural policy, no new wave of harmonisation is being started; on the contrary, it is about bringing sermonising politicians down to earth and saying, could you please stop using subsidiarity as a veto.
It is about saying, if you really mean that culture is one of the most important models for the peaceful integration of Europe, then you must put your money where you mouth is.
We try to join forces in so many areas; why should culture go it alone?
Joint investment by Europe in culture - I like that expression better than subsidy, it is not just a question of financial support - is long overdue.
May I run over time slightly in order to pay my respects and offer my thanks to all the members who have patiently fought to make headway here over the years, long before my arrival here.
I should like to thank them for every millimetre of ground won and I too shall fight for more, millimetre by millimetre.
Mr President, Commissioner, the nicest compliment that can paid to Mr Ruffolo, I think, is to ask a question which, to my mind, is the most significant, the question of the budget.
If he tells us that 0.1% of the Community budget is set aside for culture, when we know full well that a Europe of Culture is advancing, how much is coming from the European Structural Funds, as Mrs O'Toole stated?
What I would like to know, and I think Mr Ruffolo would also like to know, is what are the European Structural Funds set aside for culture, what this represents and what this means for a Europe of Culture currently under construction.
If this Europe of Culture is effectively under construction, then let us take on board all of Mr Ruffolo' s proposals: it could be that he is proposing to change the Treaty by proposing a cultural observatory.
Perhaps we could also propose a cultural policy, and I would really like to know your feelings on reinforced cooperation, on the extension of the qualified majority, in short, on all that could be used to build a cultural policy in Europe in a concrete and non-abstract fashion.
Mrs Echerer told us no long debates, and I agree with her, of course, but I must say that as far as I am concerned there should be a clear description of budgetary expenditure on culture.
We know very well that wherever we go in Europe, we find out that it is not such and such a programme that provides the appropriate financing but these often talked about Structural Funds.
Why can we not find out what is happening with these Structural Funds?
This would perhaps be the best proof and the best argument if those Members who are not interested in culture are to support us in our cultural project.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to offer Mr Ruffolo my warmest thanks for taking the initiative because, without such an effort on his part, we would have no own initiative report and we would not be able to talk about it today or ask for funds from the budget.
So my warmest thanks.
The report was adopted with a broad consensus, it has come at the right time and it represents a political challenge for everyone involved in it.
And I hope that means a lot of people at all levels.
Setting up an observatory for cultural cooperation and the proposed three-year cultural cooperation plan will, in the final analysis, be a gauge of just how seriously politicians at all levels are trying to maintain and develop a European area of culture.
I am also delighted that two points have been included which I addressed in my report on the status of artists in 1992, Mrs Echerer.
I called at that time for greater support for patrons, including through greater tax incentives.
I called then - as I do now - for a long overdue study to be drafted on the approximation of taxes on works of art and the work of artists.
Because we have social cohesion and are citizens of Europe, we need a European cultural policy and our amazing diversity must be highlighted time and time again.
Project Europe shed its economic and technical orientation a long time ago.
We desperately need to draft a common cultural policy and common education policy if we are to rekindle the soul of Europe, which has been choked by economic expediency and covered in a thick layer of bureaucratic dust at all levels, regional, local, national and even European, for far too long.
Our citizens today simply want more beautiful things.
More beautiful things will reawaken their enthusiasm for Europe and more culture costs a bit more.
So please let us add something to the budget now.
Mr President, we have before us a great own-initiative report which is so important that, in my opinion, it could easily have been called 'Bases for a common cultural policy' , because this is what they could be if the Council takes a sensitive approach to our requests.
Our cultural identity is being protected all the time and this is right and proper because it is an important part of Europe' s cultural heritage.
The rapporteur himself, in a cogent phrase, defined the situation in Europe as the unity of diversities.
But do the Members of the Council not think that it is also time that we discussed what is common to all our cultures, to seek it out, to cherish its common components, ways of life, customs, shared values, knowledge, art and scientific development?
Do they not think that it is time to state that a European culture does indeed exist, to develop joint cultural policies and to set common objectives for all our member States?
In a globalised world and given the danger of passively adopting one particular dominant culture, cultural convergence within the European Union represents a powerful political bulwark that we should not reject.
To those nationalists who, from within or from outside the Union, reject the future of the European Union because, according to them, we do not share a common identity, we must reply with the words of Levy Strauss, who said: "We do not need one, because we have something much stronger: a common destiny" .
The purpose of my words, Mr President, is to congratulate Mr Ruffolo for having reminded us so brilliantly of the path that we must take in the field of culture.
One final comment.
The request that a work of art be installed in infrastructures and installations financed with Community funds seeks not only to protect and to spread art in Europe, but to ensure that the public knows and remembers that this airport, that motorway, or such-and-such railway line, comes from the Community, a fact of which today, unfortunately, people tend to be unaware.
Mr President, this resolution is Parliament' s first legislative initiative in cultural matters based on Article 192 of the Treaty and is distinguished from the other resolutions approved by Parliament in the field of culture not only in its content but also in its procedure, certainly the most authoritative yet allowed under the Treaty.
The resolution has come at a delicate time for the European Union, on the eve of major institutional reforms; it is therefore seen as an indication and a contribution from Parliament to the debate on the future of Europe.
If all this is true, you will of course allow me, Mr President, sincerely, in my capacity as committee Chairman, to congratulate the rapporteur in advance this evening - something that we generally do as a matter of course when we vote - because I really believe this is a step forward, a major revolution that Parliament is on the point of making.
Actually, the lack of coordination at the level of cultural programmes, which the rapporteur has highlighted, is in my mind the most important fact in being able to make Europe grow and, as Mr Ruffolo has said, culture has until now had a much lesser role than the economy. With the Maastricht Treaty conditions improved but it remained marginal; then in Nice it was held paralysed in the bonds of unanimity.
All that shows how Europe can be made, Commissioner, not just through the economy, but through a major cultural initiative, of which Parliament should take full note.
Precisely because this resolution is wanted and has, I believe, been passionately discussed by the committee until they reached unanimity - wanted by the rapporteur and discussed and wanted by the committee as a whole - I believe it really shows a difference, a diversity, a new reason for this Parliament, as part of a strategy that must, at a cultural level, lead us to unity in the cultural diversity that this great Europe has, in order for there to be a future in a real strategy over the coming years.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his report, not merely for form' s sake but from the heart, because it provides a timely opportunity to renew our discussion of the future of cultural cooperation in Europe.I regret, Mr Ruffolo, ladies and gentlemen, that the discussion on this report is taking place at almost midnight, in front of an empty chamber, not qualitatively, but quantitatively so, for I think that what we are talking about - and I am not only saying this as the Commissioner responsible for this dossier - is the future of Europe.
In fact, the future of Europe, even if current themes centre around the euro and our economic development in a globalised environment, will depend on the following question: how will we know how to deal with culture, our cultures, our cultural diversity, founded on common roots, that has so much in common and is so diverse, united in the construction of a common European cultural unit?
It is therefore the ideal moment to talk about it and to act.
You will all know very well that the move to qualified majority voting for Article 151, that Parliament and the Commission had requested, has not been included in the Treaty of Nice.
Therefore, we have to face facts, we have to make realistic policies.
We did not get the qualified majority, we therefore have to act without it and try to create a situation in which we can evolve.
That is the merit, by the way, of the Ruffolo report, which takes us away from what seemed to be an impasse.
I see Mr GraÃ§a Moura here, who is currently preparing another report on the evaluation of the "Culture 2000" programme, which will, I suppose, be similar in nature.
So, Parliament is taking the initiative. Parliament is attempting to break this deadlock and it is Parliament that has also, and I thank you for this, I thank your Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mr President, put forward very sturdy budgetary proposals.
Now, it has to be said that this will not be easy because, given our institutional situation, with unanimity, making budgetary innovations is a delicate and difficult matter.
Yet together, I am sure that we will get there.
Mr Ruffolo has asked all the right questions: what should the objectives of our cooperative action be?
What values should they defend?
These questions should serve as the basis for the revision of the "Culture 2000" framework programme.
I would also like to underline the interest of the study of national cultural policies in Member States which has provided the basis for this report.
I would like to say to the rapporteur that incidences of convergence, as he says, are many in number, both in terms of definitions in the cultural field and in terms of the objectives of national policies.
It is also important, as has been revealed by the numerous MEPs present at the debate this evening, that this leads to a more profound awareness of the fact that, in order to make advances in national policies, there needs to be convergence and collaboration at European level.
I would now like to react point by point to the fundamental elements of the motion for a resolution, Mr President.
With regard to points 1 and 2, the importance of culture and cultural cooperation for European identity, a lengthy explanation is not necessary.
We are in agreement, culture is an intrinsic value for the peoples of Europe, it is the essential element of European integration.
It contributes to the affirmation and vitality of the European social model as well as the influence of Europe on the international stage.
This recognition of culture as a vehicle for European identity should be shared not only by the European Parliament and the Commission, but also by the Council, currently discussing a motion for a resolution from the Belgian Presidency on the role of culture in Europe.
I really hope that Parliament and the Commission will do everything necessary for this resolution to succeed.
Point 4: culture and the information society.
You will already be aware of the Commission' s numerous initiatives: e-Europe for audiovisual material, e-content, and, for educational material, e-learning.
I would quite simply like to thank you for having tried, through a budgetary action, to strengthen the Commission' s efforts in this direction and I would also like to tell you that the Belgian Presidency is very interested in this dossier.
It has presented a motion for a resolution that aims to improve access to culture via the Internet and we are going to organise, with the Belgian Presidency, a seminar entitled "Culture and Internet" on 22 September.
This seminar will facilitate the development of an electronic European cultural network and the presence of culture on the Internet.
Points 5, 8 and 10: strengthening cooperation.
Parliament is hoping to strengthen cultural cooperation using a three-year plan for Member States and through the creation of a European Observatory for cultural cooperation.
These two proposals open up new perspectives and I am delighted that the amendments set out by Mr Ruffolo, Mrs Pack and Mr GraÃ§a Moura in the name of the two main groups in this Parliament allow the Commission to lift its reservations, which were not fundamental reservations, but formal reservations which called for these two proposals.
We are therefore in agreement on the basis.
In fact, by strengthening cooperation between Member States and between cultural institutions, we can develop improved knowledge of the cultural world with all that that implies.
Some honourable Members have said this with a great deal of commitment and much talent.
So, in concrete terms, I want to tell you this.
The Director-General of the Directorate-General for Education and Culture regularly brings together the Directors-General of Culture of the Member States.
The objective of these meetings is to strengthen cooperation.
They know each other, they know what each other are doing, they can work together, they can think of common actions to take in cooperation with one another, and how to apply them in practice.
On the same subject, the Commission is hoping to strengthen the visibility of the European Community' s numerous cultural actions.
I will return to this subject.
This is the reason why a portal devoted to all Community actions linked to culture will be opened in a few months time.
This will not only have an influence upon the actions initiated by my Directorate-General: it will also encompass that taking place in other Directorates-General.
It goes without saying, Mr President, that your Parliament will be invited to the inauguration of this portal because I am also counting on you.
It is very important that the cultural actors from your Member States and your constituents know that it exists and that it works.
You will be one of the important outlets for spreading the word about this portal.
I would also like to thank the Culture Committee for having requested that a budget heading be set up for the creation of a European Observatory or an equivalent structure.
You voted for this, Mr President, and I hope you will be followed by the Committee on Budgets.
Point 9: Structural Funds.
We have decided to devote EUR 167 million to the "Culture 2000" programme over five years - a cause for some jealousy, perhaps.
I would like to give you a few figures on the investment of Structural Funds in culture whilst pointing out that there is no automatic element in this process.
In fact, Member States and regions have to ask for these investments, without which the Structural Funds cannot be effective on the ground.
The Commission has precise information available for countries that have decided to devote a proportion of Structural Funds to cultural actions.
I will cite three: Greece, Portugal and Italy.
Portugal, for example, has voted for a budget of EUR 327 million for culture for the 2000-2006 period.
The European Community contributes up to EUR 237 million.
This is a question, for a small country - a great country in terms of culture, of course, but a small Member State all the same - of a sum that goes way above that which is available, for fifteen Member States, for the "Culture 2000" action.
In Greece, the total Community contribution for culture will rise to EUR 414 million and in Italy, we will also contribute by participating in seven regional operational programmes and in devoting a large budget to culture in which Structural Funds constitute more than EUR 1 200 000.
Even if we only take the example of these three countries, that is to say not all fifteen, Mr President, we see that in one year Structural Funds invest more than EUR 250 million in culture.
You will therefore have an idea that this involves amounts that are very much higher than those we have available as European politicians responsible for culture.
Point 11: The Observatory.
You have adopted the steps necessary for the introduction of two new budget headings in the 2002 draft budget.
I am delighted with this initiative.
Point 12: the contact points.
An examination of the role of the contact points and their finance contract is being undertaken.
It should also be concluded this year.
We will keep you informed of the conclusions of this examination.
Let me in any case draw your attention to the fact that these contact points should remain information structures used in the decision-making process that will have been taken by the political authorities.
Points 13 and 14: the Cultural Forum.
On 21 and 22 November, the second forum on cultural cooperation in Europe will take place and the President and the rapporteur have already been informed.
I have also asked Mr GraÃ§a Moura to speak during this forum in order to have direct contact.
Mr Gargani, Mr GraÃ§a Moura and the rapporteur, Mr Ruffolo, have received an invitation to participate, to have direct contact with the major players and to tell them what Parliament wants, what Parliament decides and what this implies.
It will be the ideal opportunity to be able to explain Parliament' s position on cultural policy issues directly to the operators on the ground.
Points 15 and 16: patronage.
I am completely in agreement with your analysis of the importance of patronage.
I know that Mrs Pack, present here today, put forward this proposal in 1992, and I regret that, almost ten years later, we still have no policy on this matter.
Strong from the experience we have gained, we are going to look into this question.
We will not abandon the European authorities without having achieved this objective.
Together, we shall get down to the job.
National and European budgets are ever "tighter" .
Now, we have an extraordinary capacity on ground level: the private sector, the institutions, the organisations, the industries.
These need to be mobilised, we need to give incentives for them to invest in culture.
I would like us to think about a "patronage" action that includes a study of the possible harmonisation of VAT on works of art and artistic work, in such a way that all these elements are indissociable.
With all the national resources that are available to us, we should favour investment in culture and the participation of cultural players.
As you can see, I have been very positive up to this point.
Point 18: the cultural percentage, that is to say the principle of cultural endowments for works financed by the Structural Funds.
I am not very much in favour of a system of quotas in this field, for this risks introducing an element of rigidity in an intervention system based on subsidiarity and the initiative of local and regional authorities.
I think that, on the other hand, governments and regions should be encouraged to ask for more investment in culture by the Structural Funds.I find it remarkable that Mr Barnier, my colleague responsible for Structural Funds, has, since assuming his responsibilities, decided to open up these funds even more to culture - that is to say to you who work at ground level in close relation with cultural players and communities - and to encourage municipalities and States to submit more applications for Structural funds for this purpose.
With regard to the WTO, I cannot be more clear: at the time of the next negotiations, the European Union will undertake to guarantee, as in the Uruguay round, the possibility for the Community and its Member States to maintain and develop their capacity to define and implement their cultural and audiovisual policies for the preservation of cultural diversity.
This is a matter of principle, a prerequisite, a general approach and a position decided on by the Fifteen, on which there can be no question. In other words, we shall maintain our cultural diversity and the mandate for negotiation expresses the desire of the European Union to strengthen competition in the European audiovisual industry by means of appropriate policies.
I will present you also in the forthcoming weeks with a report, a programme on cinema that will really allow this policy to be established, not in the sense advocated by the WTO, but in the sense of the reinforcement of audiovisual policies.
It is also worth noting that the application of competition law alone, in particular the prohibition of the abuse of a dominant position, would not guarantee the preservation and development of cultural diversity.
This is why the Community and the Member States remain fundamentally attached to their freedom of action to develop and adapt their cultural policy.
As you can see, nothing has changed.
The credo remains.
We are going to defend it together, with you and with the Member States.
Mr Ruffalo, I hope that I have answered your questions, even if I have taken far too long at this late hour.
I thought it was important to give my response for these are questions that are sometimes considered by the public to be of minor importance.
In my opinion, they are fundamental.
In effect, Europe wants to move forward and must one day be judged on her cultural dimension, which is a human, civil dimension.
I think it is normal for Parliament to be committed to constructing this Citizens' Europe and I thank you for it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, this concerns a matter arising from the Minutes in connection with the distribution of the report promised by Mr Kinnock in response to my oral question on Monday, which was raised in the Chamber yesterday afternoon.
I should like to confirm that this report is available.
I received it by e-mail from Mr Kinnock' s office, but as far as I can tell it has not yet been officially distributed to Members.
I know that Mr Kinnock was very keen that we should all have it as soon as possible so can I ask you once again to make sure that this is distributed.
On the same topic could I ask you, Mr President, on behalf of all the Members of this Parliament, if we could have a similar report to the one prepared by the Commission on the progress of the human resource reforms as regards the work that is going on with the staff of Parliament.
We are currently in a position where we know less about the progress of the personnel reforms in this House than we do in the Commission.
Could I ask you to discuss with your colleagues and arrange for a statement and a report to be made to this House as soon as possible about the progress of these crucial reforms which were solidly supported by the House when it approved my report last year?
On the first part, I was here when the President gave you the assurance that Mr Kinnock' s report would be distributed.
I will ask the services to make sure that is done.
On the second part, the Bureau of Parliament is meeting tonight.
Unfortunately I will not be there but I will ask for this to be raised at the Bureau this evening.
(The Minutes were approved)
Echelon
The next item is the report (A5-0264/2001) by Gerhard Schmid, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System, on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system) (2001/2098(INI)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than a year ago the European Parliament set up a special committee to ascertain whether there was in fact a global interception system for which the US National Security Agency was ultimately responsible and which was able to intercept any communication by telephone, fax or e-mail in Europe.
This system is allegedly operated by a group of states which includes one of the Member States of the European Union, namely the United Kingdom. Now that the Cold War is over, the main function of the system appears to be industrial espionage.
The system, it is alleged, bears the code name Echelon.
This, Mr President, was a difficult investigative mission, because the European Parliament has no access at all under any circumstances to the files of the intelligence services of the EU Member States, let alone access to details of the activities of American agencies.
However, after a year of painstaking investigation, we are able to communicate the following to the House without any lingering shadow of doubt: first of all, there is no intelligence system operated by the secret services of any one state by means of which any communication in Europe can be intercepted.
This allegation must be consigned to the domain of creative journalism!
The assertion is not made any more credible by the fact that it is repeated, and regrettably so, in a study commissioned by the European Parliament, a fact that lends it a certain cachet of respectability.
What we are looking at here is not what we were expected to find.
Telecommunications obey the laws of physics, and without access to the media of communication it is impossible to intercept the messages they carry. The secret services do not possess magic powers with which they can alter the laws of physics!
The second point we are able to make, however, is that there is indeed an interception system, and these are its characteristics: it operates globally and is run by an intelligence alliance comprising the parties to the UKUSA Agreement, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
There is nothing coincidental about this combination of states, which has its roots in the Second World War.
By and large, it only has access to intercontinental communications which are transmitted with the aid of communications satellites or undersea cables serving the UKUSA countries.
Communications within Europe, therefore, are scarcely affected, but communications with African, Arabic and Latin American countries most certainly are.
We do not know exactly how much local radio communication can be intercepted by embassies, but it is evident that this does not represent the bulk of intelligence operations.
By way of contrast to police surveillance operations, which always target an individual or a clearly defined group of people, the system concerning us here intercepts every communication to which it has access and feeds it into a computer search engine.
On the basis of a catalogue of search terms, the search engine selects those communications that are likely to be of interest to the intelligence services.
In other words, the system works like a vacuum cleaner and the intelligence services operate the filter.
In technical terms this is known as strategic communications monitoring.
The search engine can identify telephone numbers, the voices of prime targets and the content of e-mails and typed faxes.
Given the present state of the art, these search engines will not be able to interpret handwritten faxes and spoken messages in the foreseeable future, which means that these forms of communication cannot be automatically processed by the intelligence services.
In addition, we have evidence that the system does indeed have the code name Echelon.
Its name, however, is irrelevant.
It might just as well be called Rumpelstiltskin; the important thing for us is what it does.
These are the findings, and let me add that we are not simply hypothesising.
We can back up these statements with a strong chain of evidence that could stand up in a court of law.
Those who wish to know precise details will have to read the report for themselves.
Suffice to say that, if we had made any false allegations in this report, you can safely assume that the intelligence services of the countries in question would have been only too delighted to take us apart in public!
This they did not do, which speaks volumes.
How do we assess these findings?
One of our assessment criteria must be to ask what our own services actually do.
That is not the sole criterion, but it must be taken into consideration if we intend to hold an honest debate on this subject.
Most of the intelligence services in the EU Member States engage in strategic communications monitoring.
Only Austria, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal do not use such technology.
Secondly, it goes without saying that the purpose for which strategic monitoring is used will also affect our assessment.
If it is targeted at internationally organised crime, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, the arms trade, terrorism, proliferation or sanctions busting, or if it is used to protect national security, there can be no questioning the legitimacy of its purpose as such.
But if it is being used to spy on foreign companies in order to tip the competitive balance in favour of domestic industries, that is quite a different matter.
Thirdly, the end does not justify the means.
In short, the end is not everything, for each individual case of eavesdropping is an invasion of privacy.
It is not a problem of quantity either.
Human rights are individual rights; they are not a matter of statistics.
Such an invasion of privacy is only permissible on certain conditions.
The case law of the European Court of Human Rights is crystal clear in this respect.
Briefly, the conditions are as follows: there must be a legal basis for such an operation - it cannot be arbitrary; a value judgment must be made, the breach of privacy being weighed against the morality of its purpose; the operation must be foreseeable, which means that the general public must know that such a system exists, and recourse to interception must only be permitted if there is no alternative.
It is, in other words, an ultima ratio.
There are Members of this House who agree that it is acceptable for the police to intercept communications in pursuance of a court order for the purpose of criminal prosecution.
But in the case of the intelligence services, they call it an infringement of human rights.
I fully understand anyone expressing political opposition to this type of action by the secret services.
I can see the logic of that.
It is not my position, but I can follow their reasoning.
But anyone who says it is illegal is disregarding the rulings of our own European Court of Human Rights.
Industrial espionage is certainly not a legitimate reason for intercepting communications.
All intelligence services do, of course, deal with economic issues too, examining developments in financial and commodity markets, for example.
To that extent most of the services engage in espionage in the economic domain.
But we are not criticising them for that.
The problem arises when this espionage goes beyond the clarification of general security issues and the intelligence services pass on details to industrialists in their own country in order to give their companies a competitive advantage.
Such behaviour between EU Member States, furthermore, would be incompatible with Community law, because it constitutes a type of prohibited state aid.
On the international stage it is more than just an unfriendly act, and between allies it is nothing short of a scandal.
Incidentally, intercepting communications is not the preferred method of industrial espionage, which is generally conducted by conventional means.
But there are individual cases in which the instrument of interception can be used to great effect.
The United States, as you know, has come in for the heaviest criticism.
The United States has always denied that intelligence is passed on directly to US companies.
It has admitted, however, that it intercepts detailed communications concerning major contracts that are open to international tender.
The argument used to justify these measures is that European companies would offer bribes and that there is a need for a defence against this.
This position, to put it very politely and diplomatically, must be scrutinised.
First of all, we know that US corporations engage in bribery too.
In the latest Bribe Payers Index published by Transparency International, the United States occupies a mid-table position among the world' s major exporting countries.
Secondly, this type of thing is now prohibited within the OECD by a Convention, which the Member States of the European Union have transposed into national law.
For the United States, despite this, to remain entrenched in the cowboy mentality which holds that might is right would be a denial of the principle that such problems can be solved by formal international agreements.
Thirdly, if it is true that the American intelligence agencies do not engage in detailed industrial espionage, why is there no law in the United States of America that proscribes such activity by intelligence agencies?
Why ever not?
The real political problem, basically, is that, in the European public debate, the United States is considered capable of such measures.
The political problem highlighted by this whole issue is the prevalence of profound mistrust.
This mistrust has to be weeded out.
We have developed a host of proposals, some of which relate to the monitoring of the intelligence services here in Europe, to a code of conduct for the EU Member States and the like.
Ultimately, however, it all boils down to one simple main problem: the protection of privacy is guaranteed by the national legal systems, but communications are becoming increasingly international.
There is no world government to protect them.
This is one of the many problems posed by globalisation.
We must reach agreements and enshrine them in international law so that privacy is protected worldwide.
Apart from this, a second problem remains, a problem to which I referred at the start of the report with the Latin tag Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes, meaning 'But who will watch these watchmen?'
That is the perennial problem.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the presidency has read the European Parliament' s motion for a resolution on the ECHELON interception system with great interest and will be following the debate on the subject intently.
I am delighted with Parliament' s thorough investigation into this matter.
This initiative is in line with the traditional democratic supervisory role of legislative meetings.
It reflects the concerns of many EU citizens with regard to that system.
Moreover, I should like to draw attention to the fact that, during your activities in this connection, the Council presidency has, at all times, shown its willingness to cooperate loyally with Parliament.
The Portuguese, French and Swedish Presidencies have all accepted Parliament' s invitation to clarify their position in this matter, both at plenary meetings and at meetings of your temporary committee.
It is therefore in that capacity that I am here today attending the discussion of the report and of the resolution of the temporary committee and that I wish to express my sympathy with Parliament' s concern in this matter. As you will know, the word 'sympathy' in Greek - to refer to one of the old languages - means 'empathy' .
The fact that the parliamentary bodies of my own country have also devoted attention to the interception of communications, as evidenced in two Belgian parliamentary reports which were sent to Mr Schmid and which are mentioned in his report, reinforces my belief that the political issue involved is complex, yet important.
I hope that you will nevertheless understand that I, as President of the Council, must limit my reaction to those aspects which are related to the Council or the Union' s institutions in general.
It is not my role to react on behalf of or in respect of individual Member States.
The basic principles that must govern all communications interception systems are well known.
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - an article that the EU must respect under the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty establishing the European Union - stipulates that everyone has a right to the respect for his privacy.
Under the same Article, and also according to the Court of Justice' s established case law, there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and which is necessary to achieve precisely stated aims and where this respects the principle of proportionality.
Basing its work on these principles, the Justice and Home Affairs Council met on 29 and 30 May 2000 and reiterated the Council' s commitment, as regards the Echelon network, to the respect of fundamental rights and people' s freedoms.
The Council also stressed that although a telecommunications interception system may be an important tool to combat crime and to defend national security, under no circumstances, however, should this system be used to gain commercial advantage.
These principles were also included in the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000 between the Member States of the European Union.
Article 20 of this Convention thus specifies the conditions in which telecommunications interception may be permitted within the framework of cooperation between Member States in criminal matters.
(FR) The respect for one' s private life is now also one of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice at the end of last year.
Article 7 of the Charter lays down that any person has a right to the respect for his privacy and family life, the respect for his home and his communications.
The Council is obviously willing to make full use of these provisions.
You will see that Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by Community institutions and bodies, is evidence that the Community institutions already share the determination to protect people against the abuse of their personal data.
(NL) The right to respect for private and family life and data protection are closely related.
Moreover, we know that thanks to continuous technological advancements, the efficient protection of personal data cannot remain restricted to the Union' s borders but must be extended worldwide.
That is why the Union is trying to promote a dialogue with third countries, as well as a transatlantic dialogue with the United States and Canada.
An initial meeting of experts on legal systems for data protection has already taken place last May in Brussels during the Swedish Presidency.
During a Legal and Home Affairs meeting involving top American officials, which took place on 17 July of this year, both the presidency and the United States recognised the need for reaching an agreement in this area.
A second meeting was to take place under the Belgian Presidency, this time at the invitation of the US, to lay the groundwork for future agreements.
With this report by Mr Schmid drawn up on behalf of the Temporary ECHELON Committee, Parliament has more than met what is expected within the Union in terms of quality.
Therefore, Parliament and the Schmid report are fundamental to greater awareness of this issue.
The Council and the presidency, each within their own remit, will make every effort to guarantee fully respect for private and family life and data protection, both within the Union and elsewhere.
After all, electronic communication is only set to increase in future.
Communications are, by definition, private in nature, and their confidentiality must be guaranteed.
It would, therefore, be totally unacceptable, on grounds of principle, for communications to be tapped without a very legitimate reason indeed and without those tapping the communications being subjected to any kind of democratic control.
The Belgian Presidency sets great store by the security of networks and information. A policy which is predominantly based on Commission communication COM (2001) 298 which, on the one hand, draws attention to the need to fight cyber crime and, on the other, indicates the need to protect data in the field of telecommunication.
Today' s communication offers fresh food for thought, and the Belgian Presidency intends to continue on this path.
Accordingly, we wish, first of all, to make progress in the development of an alarm and information system which aims to combat the risks inherent to the use of IT.
More specifically, the presidency hopes that the Telecommunications Council of 15 October next will result in a clear, common objective. That should enable the Telecommunications Council of December to lay down a detailed action plan and timeframe in terms of e-security.
Moreover, we intend to examine further the progress made by the Member States in the field of systems security within the framework of the implementation of the e-Europe 2002 action plan.
Different initiatives have been launched in the Member States in order to encourage citizens and businesses to make use of safe IT material.
In addition, the sixth Framework Programme concerning research, which is currently being discussed in the Council, should also emphasise all aspects related to security of networks and information traffic.
(FR) The revision of telecommunications legislation also contains some provisions updating European regulations, particularly on the protection of personal data and privacy.
Parliament will soon issue an opinion, at first reading, on this important text.
The text includes, amongst others, general provisions on the confidentiality of communications, and on the general principle of deleting traffic and location data relating to these communications.
The general principle is, of course, qualified by the option given to the authorities responsible for public safety and for combating crime to request access to the information on a case-by-case basis.
As you know, the debate is still open on the length of time such information can be stored.
To sum up, I would like to return briefly to the issue of intelligence gathering.
In the military capabilities commitment declaration, annexed to the Nice European Council conclusions, the Member States acknowledged that serious effort would be needed in the area of intelligence so that, in future, the European Union has more strategic intelligence at its disposal.
The European Parliament motion for a resolution highlights the need for democratic monitoring of intelligence operations that might be established within the European Union.
This is a general principle, which we can only support.
More specifically, the presidency currently believes that, should this type of intelligence capability be established within the EU, we would have to investigate the procedures that would need to be implemented in order to ensure democratic monitoring of these activities.
These procedures would naturally have to take into account the particular nature of the intelligence field which, in order to function effectively, requires that information gathered remains confidential.
Mr President, to sum up and in conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Watson once again for his excellent work and I hope that you have an interesting debate.
I shall be staying in the House to listen to what you have to say.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, when I had to explain the function of our Echelon Committee, I used the following example: I said, 'Imagine you are a detective sergeant.
Various people come to you and report a bombing, carried out by five terrorists.
At the scene of the crime indicated there are two possible victims, but they say nothing.
The five suspects are also silent.
The explosive device is not immediately apparent and no details of the incident are known.
In short, it is a rather difficult case.
This is tantamount to what happened when journalists began to tell us that there was a global interception system called Echelon which was operated by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and which could intercept and analyse phone, fax and e-mail communications worldwide.
Individuals, businesses and institutions, they said, were subjected to systematic surveillance.
So what facts have we established after a year of investigation?
As the detective sergeant, I would say that the five suspects were indeed at the scene of the crime, but the weapon was a precision rifle rather than a bomb.
Each of the suspects was capable of firing the weapon, but all the evidence suggests that only one of them actually acted in a criminal manner.
The victims have given us clues to help us in our investigations but are not prepared to testify in court, and so we unfortunately have insufficient evidence to secure a conviction.
It will be essential, however, to keep the suspects under observation and to take further precautions.'
What this means is that the five aforementioned states do indeed cooperate within this espionage system.
Its name is irrelevant, but let us call it Echelon for the sake of convenience.
The system, however, can only intercept civilian communications that are routed via Intelsat satellites.
And these satellites only carry a small percentage of global telecommunications traffic and an even smaller percentage of private telephone calls.
Moreover, these activities by intelligence services were tolerated by the international community on condition that they were essential to the protection of national security interests.
There are now indications, however, that the United States is using some of these intercepted data for purposes other than the preservation of national security.
The US agencies have admitted, for example, that they eavesdrop on European companies bidding for major foreign contracts, allegedly because these companies engage in bribery.
The agencies' intelligence reports are then forwarded to US embassies so that the ambassador to the awarding country can influence the host government by making it aware of the bribery allegations.
The US Department of Commerce also has an Advocacy Center, which maintains, through the US embassies, a worldwide network devoted solely to helping US corporations land major contracts.
There are clear grounds for suspecting the United States of illegal industrial espionage.
Regrettably, the companies that have been victims of these activities remain silent for fear of tarnishing their image.
At this point I should like to thank the rapporteur and his team for resisting the attempts of the Greens, as well as those from the Left of this chamber, to have him write a cloak-and-dagger thriller.
His report is responsible and objective, presents the conclusive and presumptive evidence, distinguishing clearly between the two, and does not prejudge the issue.
Some may feel that his conclusions do not go far enough, but they do exhaust the available legal options.
Protection against illegal acts committed by non-European intelligence services can only be achieved through global instruments.
As far as our own area of responsibility is concerned, the main priority for us is to close the confidentiality gaps in the Commission.
Unlike the Council or the Central Bank, the Commission persists with data protection and confidentiality mechanisms that belong to the Middle Ages.
The dangers posed by non-European countries in this domain have obviously been entirely underestimated.
We therefore call on the competent committee to initiate its own report on this issue.
We also call on our British friends, since they are fellow members of the European Union, to establish effective and legitimate control of American espionage conducted against European targets from British territory; otherwise they are in breach of European data protection law.
Let me thank the rapporteur once again for his cooperation with us.
I am sure that this report will carry the support of an overwhelming majority of the Members of this House.
Mr President, the Temporary Committee on ECHELON and other large-scale tapping systems was launched over a year ago.
There was then serious doubt as to whether this Committee would be able to complete its mandate that was issued by Parliament within the time period given.
My colleague, Mr Gerhard Schmid, presented the report with the results of the work of this temporary committee a moment ago.
On behalf of my group, I should like to express my great appreciation for the work that the rapporteur, but also the President of the Committee, Mr Coelho, have done over the past year.
The report contains proof for the first time that ECHELON exists, a system based on the cooperation of five countries in the worldwide tapping and interception of international telephone and message traffic.
In addition, it is indicated that other countries too, including most EU Member States, use systems for tapping international telecommunications traffic.
At the same time, the report, however, explodes the myth that, via ECHELON and similar systems, every phone call would be tapped and every fax message or e-mail read.
It is technically impossible to do this, and most countries involved are democracies which impose clear restrictions on the activities of the secret services, at least with regard to their own citizens.
Mainly based on information which was published in the course of the investigation of the ECHELON Committee by the Dutch and German governments, we know that systems for tapping international telecommunication are often used as an aid in the fight against international terrorism, trafficking in human beings, the drugs trade, the illegal arms trade, and to enforce internationally established embargoes.
And nobody objects to that, at least, provided that this is done under sound democratic and political control whilst guaranteeing that the international and national rules protecting the privacy of citizens are upheld.
The unnecessary secrecy, the surreptitious behaviour of the secret services and the lack of openness of many governments prevent systems for tapping international telecommunications from being deployed in a more transparent manner.
Clear and enforceable rules to protect the privacy of all European citizens in all EU countries must form an inherent part of the constitutional rights as laid down in the European Charter.
With this, it must be ensured that the strict rules which currently apply in most countries for tapping a country' s own citizens will, in the near future, apply to all EU citizens.
Effective democratic and political supervision of activities carried out by secret services, and hence tapping international telephone traffic, form an essential part of every state' s right to defend the security of its citizens or its democratic fabric against external attacks.
A change in mentality is required.
It is inevitable that some aspects of the work of the intelligence service should remain confidential, but there is also a great deal that could most certainly be brought into the open in a democratic society.
Only countries which, in respect of its citizens, deal with their intelligence services in an open and honest way will also be able to provide the necessary cooperation at European level and be able to help set up a European intelligence force in the framework of an effective common foreign and security policy.
With this, the traditional distrust which intelligence services harbour in respect of outsiders and the equally traditional priority given by countries to their own national interests must be turned into a kind of cooperation in which the treaty concluded between the UK and the US, underlying ECHELON, completely fades into the background. Not only because it was agreed during the European Summit in Helsinki that a European intelligence force will be created as part of a European intervention force, but especially because the fight against international terrorism and the trafficking in human beings, for example, is a joint European task.
However, I should like to add one more observation in this connection. Further European cooperation in the gathering of intelligence, which is also significant to the EU in terms of its position within the confederate framework of NATO, will force the British government to make a fundamental choice: either it continues to favour transatlantic cooperation or it becomes fully involved in cooperation at European level.
A bit of both would not only lack credibility, but is also practically impossible.
During the investigation by the ECHELON Committee, we have not obtained any evidence that citizens' privacy is being intentionally violated or that systems designed for large-scale tapping operations involving international telecommunications traffic are deliberately being used for large-scale and direct industrial espionage.
Furthermore, specific enquiries made to large European companies elicited no reaction.
However, based on remarks made by America, it has transpired that intelligence received accidentally is, in a number of cases, most definitely used.
If one casts the herring nets, but happens to catch a salmon, then that salmon is not always thrown back into the sea but sometimes ends up on the table.
Whoever has confidential information at their disposal does well to protect that confidential information.
In this respect, the European Union and Member States are required to cooperate by giving advice, by developing user-friendly cryptographic hardware and software and especially by raising public awareness.
I hope that the report by the ECHELON Committee in particular has made a major contribution to the aforesaid.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate Gerhard Schmid on his excellent report.
The reports reaches the conclusion that a global communications interception system exists within the framework of the UKUSA Agreement, that this system is definitely known as Echelon, that it is used to intercept private business, and not military, communications, that the system' s technical capabilities are probably not nearly as extensive as some have assumed, but that prevention to some extent is necessary.
In spite of what some minority voices say, Mr Schmid was not more preoccupied with industrial espionage than with individual monitoring.
He is proposing no less than eight specific measures to enhance the protection of citizens' rights within the framework of various international treaties, and he calls upon the Member States and the Council to adopt at least seven specific national legislative measures to protect citizens.
Of course, some specific measures are proposed to assist businesses, but these are more vague and their scope is less extensive than the measures on individual monitoring.
As a citizen of a country whose intelligence service is certainly very small-scale compared to those of its larger neighbours or allies, I still believe that it is misleading and futile to suggest abolishing the secret services.
They exist and they will continue to exist.
We should, therefore, draw political conclusions and seek solutions at this level - we should monitor the activities of these services, subject them to legal and parliamentary scrutiny, adopt uniform rules to protect citizens at the highest national level and apply this throughout the European Union.
The proposals in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the resolution must also be seen from this perspective.
With the strengthening of European security and defence policy and the EU' s increasing involvement in crisis prevention and management, collaboration amongst intelligence services is growing and the EU will eventually have to have an autonomous European intelligence capability.
This can only be achieved if there is a system for democratic monitoring.
With regard to Echelon, the resolution specifically calls upon Germany and the United Kingdom to make authorisation of communications interception operations by US intelligence services on their territory conditional on their compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
Far from having wanted to create repeated diversions, Mr Schmid has dotted the i' s and crossed the t' s, he has more than fulfilled the mandate bestowed upon him by the Temporary Committee on Echelon and he has provided Parliament with a tool to enable us to continue the work he has done in the interests of protecting citizens.
Mr President, we welcome the fact that the report recognises and accepts that Echelon exists.
This is something that the Green Group stated a long time ago in this Parliament and we have now been vindicated.
However, the report fails to draw any political conclusions.
It is also extremely hypocritical in that it criticises the Echelon interception system, while at the same time we are planning to establish a European secret service.
In other words, it is not that there is a problem with this system as such, it is just that the EU wants to be able to do the same and have its own system.
The report naively gives the impression that if you have some sort of democratic control, all will be okay.
It is a well known fact that there is no effective public control mechanism of secret services and their undemocratic activities anywhere in the world.
By their very nature, secret services cannot be controlled and therefore we, as Members of this Parliament, who claim to be concerned about human rights and basic civil liberties, should be questioning their very existence.
But, on the contrary, the report serves to legitimise a European secret service which will inevitably infringe fundamental rights in the same way as the Echelon system.
The temporary committee and the report focus mainly on the threat to European industrial competition and the threat posed by industrial espionage.
But this is not the vital and fundamental issue.
The real issue at stake, which is totally lost in this report, is that nobody can communicate in confidence any more.
This is the real threat to us all.
Political spying is a greater threat than economic spying.
Recently there have been reports in British newspapers which point out that European leaders have ordered police and intelligence agencies to coordinate their efforts to identify and track anti-capitalist demonstrators.
This will give a green light to secret services to put under surveillance people whose activities are entirely democratic and legal.
Whole political and social scenes will be criminalised.
Very private information about people will be accessible to police and secret services without those people having any say or control.
The report goes to great lengths to push these kinds of dangers under the carpet.
It also ignores the plans that are forging ahead on the Enfopol interception system in the EU.
We, as Members of the European Parliament, should be demanding that people' s freedoms and the right to privacy, as enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention and Article 6 of the EU Treaty, are protected and that people are not forced to live under permanent control where the possibility exists that every communication they make will be accessible to unknown forces.
Finally, the report lets the UK off the hook.
It should have requested at the very least that the UK dissociate itself from the management of the Echelon system and it should also have asked Germany to close down the interception base which is located on its territory.
These Member States, which are collaborating, were let off the hook totally.
Mr President, Echelon is an interception system which does not differentiate between communications, data and documents. It does exist and represents a considerable step forwards.
From now on, the Union' s institutions, particularly the representatives of the Council and the Commission, will no longer be able to say that information reported in the media is inaccurate.
There is, however, inconsistency between what has been ascertained and the conclusions of the report, for the system flagrantly infringes the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
In fact, because of its technical capabilities, the system nullifies the relationship of proportionality which, precisely within the meaning of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, has to exist between interference in people' s private lives and the benefits of interception for protection purposes.
This is all the more serious in that interception is currently carried out by means of these technical capabilities by a third country on EU territory and to the detriment of the citizens of the countries of the Union, without the possibility of any sort of legal, administrative or parliamentary control.
A further problem is that one of the countries managing the Echelon system is the United Kingdom, a Member of the European Union, while other Member States such as Germany have made their territory available for the siting of antennae, listening posts and other equipment. Quite simply, the group of English-speaking countries managing Echelon is doing what it likes with the privacy of European citizens, as is explicitly noted in point 26 of the conclusion, cited by Mrs Flesch moreover, which means that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is being infringed.
However, rather than trusting the United Kingdom not to abuse the information, we should at least have recorded its infringement of this article and noted the fact that its participation in the Echelon system is incompatible with its responsibilities under the European Treaties.
Genuine safeguarding of fundamental rights in the USA is essential for the credibility and democratic legitimacy of that country.
However, we have, yet again, chosen to waste an opportunity, at least for us, to uphold a democratic principle.
For others, on the other hand, at a historic moment when great, dark clouds are gathering over the right to dissent in the EU and at world level - as we have learnt from Genoa - it would be unthinkable to abolish or at least attempt to modify and reduce the capabilities of an indiscriminate listening system, one of the most useful systems for social monitoring and, where necessary, crime prevention.
Mr President, this report and its failure to draw the appropriate conclusions reduce the fundamental right to privacy, so solemnly enshrined in our Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to a right which only exists on paper, or rather to a right which, tragically, is worth no more than the paper it is written on.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to congratulate Mr Schmid on his competent and skilful work, and also to praise Mr Coelho, who conducted the debates and organised this work in a very courteous manner.
We cannot, however, accept the political conclusion of the report, and we will therefore vote against it, and I call upon all my fellow Members to do the same.
As previous speakers have mentioned, the report confirmed the existence of a US espionage system, operated by the Americans in collusion with two Member States, in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and of the most basic rules on respect for one' s private life, a system which involves intensive industrial espionage to the benefit of American companies.
The report has shown that the European firms Siemens, Dassault, Phillips, Thomson and Airbus were the targets of espionage, and this has consequently had a serious effect on employment in Europe, on our commercial stability and on Europe' s defence industries.
Most of the Members in this House from the United Kingdom have put solidarity with the US before solidarity with Europe.
This is something we regret, but the report does not answer two fundamental questions.
The first is, although it has been established that at least one country, the United Kingdom, has been involved in espionage activity against Europe, in breach of the Treaty on European Union, what sanctions must we take?
This is the first question, which remains unanswered.
The second question is that the Committee' s work has demonstrated perfectly well that, as long as we are within NATO, and as long as we are tied to using NATO' s technical and logistical resources, an independent European and common security policy will not be possible.
This is something we deplore.
The conclusion of the report is quite simply disquieting.
Mr President, as a European citizen, even more than as a Member of Parliament, I would like to quietly express my indignation at the way the committee' s work was carried out.
In its work, the committee systematically violated the Rules of Procedure, failing to comply with the obligation for transparency in Parliament' s activities and infringing the right of access to public documents.
Without wishing to belittle the work of committee chairman, Mr Coelho, or the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, in any way, it was necessary to organise the work in this way not in the interests of European security - which is an abstract concept in this context - but in order to conceal the responsibility of the Member States of the Union.
The report states quite clearly that Echelon does exist, that it systematically spies on citizens and companies of the Member States of the Union on a huge scale and that the United Kingdom is part of the system, but it does not condemn this fact openly because systematic and generalised interceptions, filtered using search engines are already being carried out by Germany, while Holland, which clearly has the necessary technology, is in the process of producing legislation which will allow it to carry out interceptions as well.
We can see from the report that Echelon is a prime example of a system which does not recognise citizens' right to privacy and subordinates privacy to national security, which is primarily endangered by the inability of politicians to foresee, prevent and deal with threats.
In the face of all this, the practical, immediate solution that emerges from the report is to invite companies and citizens to encrypt documents, as if the indissoluble link between cryptographic, code breaking and technical interception systems were not well known.
Mr President, the only political response which it is possible to give today is to be found in my minority opinion. Democratic scrutiny is essential.
Mr President, the Temporary Committee on ECHELON has resulted in a thorough investigation which is being backed virtually across the political spectrum, at least where its analysis is concerned.
A sensitive issue, however, is the desire for more European cooperation in intelligence activities.
It would have sufficed to state that cooperation in defence and security affairs gives the Member States a joint responsibility to protect privacy.
The report cannot address all political considerations.
Therefore, it would have been better not to include in the report any references to the desirability for closer cooperation.
To date, moderate use has been made of the current capacity to exchange information.
The protection of privacy is already problematic and the discrepancies between the Member States are considerable.
The consistent exchange of information is therefore not very likely in the near future.
The key reason for setting up the temporary committee was the fear of industrial espionage.
There is no reason to doubt that military and security targets are the primary concern of the intelligence services.
As might be expected with secret service activities, proof of actual industrial espionage by the US is absent.
Neither do the findings substantiate the American accusation of European corruption.
Restricted supervisory scope illustrates the importance of effective access to encryption.
Although confidentiality typifies the very nature of the activities of intelligence services, more supervision is required.
For example, Member States must monitor compliance with the mandate of the intelligence services, hence my amendment to protect communication against interception where supervision is lacking.
By directing efforts to that aspect of interceptions, we can try to prevent their inappropriate use.
This is one of the obligations of the Member States, pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights and does not only apply in respect of their own citizens.
Similarly, Member States may not allow their intelligence services abroad to act in contravention of privacy.
Similar arrangements can also be sought in a larger context, not least with the US.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make five brief observations. The first is to thank all of those who worked so hard to achieve this final outcome: the specialists and technical experts whom we invited and those who wrote and e-mailed us with their studies and opinions, the coordinators of the political groups and the Members of the European Parliament, the staff of our committee, who provided high quality support for our work and the rapporteur, Gerhard Schmid, who has produced an outstanding report and provided evidence once again of his great qualities as a human being and as a politician.
It was an easy task to chair this committee with this kind of rapporteur.
Secondly, Echelon exists, whether under this name or any other.
The European Parliament should be in no doubt about this.
Thirdly, Echelon runs a risk, a serious risk of its network being abused. This is a commercial risk, which compromises the concept of fair trade, but also presents a risk for civil liberties.
The same Union that proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights and which I hope will make it binding cannot be negligent in this matter.
Fourthly, we must improve the relationship between the European Union and the United States. We must be more effective.
In our mission to the United States, we were well received by Congress but met with the hostility of the Administration.
The report contains various important recommendations.
Europe and the United States must cooperate fairly - and I mean fairly - for the sake of the common values that they most definitely share.
Lastly, 44 recommendations have been tabled.
Giving the lie to those who predicted that the committee would not produce anything tangible, we are making 44 recommendations to the House.
I must emphasise the need to strengthen the European Convention on Human Rights with regard to protecting privacy in the information society, the need for Parliamentary and judicial control over the activity of the secret services, the need to extend defence practices such as the use of cryptography and electronic signatures, and the need for the European Institutions themselves to set an example by using these technologies.
Lastly, the request is made to the Union' s Member States to ensure in the future that the use of their countries by information gathering services, whether their own or of third countries, respects the European Convention on Human Rights.
Mr President, first of all, a big thank-you is due to Mr Schmid for an outstanding piece of work.
I think there are two good reasons for highlighting this work. For one thing, it has been a mammoth task, but I also think that Mr Schmid can justifiably be commended specifically for not having succumbed to what might be referred to as sensationalism.
It would have been tempting to do so on this particular issue, but he confined himself to the facts and to what is actually the case.
We have, of course, managed to ascertain that ECHELON exists, and this naturally highlights the dilemma arising, on the one hand, from the fact that countries have a legitimate interest in using interception as one means of protecting themselves and their citizens against attacks and terrorism and, on the other, from the fact that the same citizens, as well as companies, have a need for protection against the misuse of precisely this type of surveillance.
Moreover, I specifically think that Mr Schmid' s report, which we must adopt today, is forward-looking and contains sound proposals for initiatives that might be taken.
I can only highlight a few of these: first and foremost, that the Member States should prepare a code of conduct to ensure the protection of citizens and companies throughout Europe, as required by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I also think it right to point out that there is a need to reach an understanding, and arrange for an agreement to be prepared, between the EU and the United States so that there might be mutual respect for the protection of citizens and companies.
We have a need for international rules in this area that are as tough as is humanly possible.
The need for legal and parliamentary supervision of the intelligence services in the Member States is also emphasised. Finally, I think that the fourth important point is that both the EU and the Member States have an obligation to ensure that people are thoroughly informed about the risks of interception and about the ways in which they, as well as companies, might best protect themselves against misuse of the system.
I want to say that, with this report, the Member States can no longer put their heads in the sand where this issue is concerned.
They can no longer say that it is just something they have read about in the newspapers.
There is now a need for countries to take responsibility for protecting their citizens and companies against violations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ECHELON exists, as has already been stated this morning by different speakers.
But do you realise that it only managed to surface thanks to the tenacity of this Parliament?
For when I questioned the Council and Commission about this in 1997, my questions were not at all taken seriously.
This situation is now very different.
The Dutch government has issued a report in which a reasonable case is made for the existence of ECHELON and the Council has also said that it supports our findings.
In the United States too, it has been openly admitted that 5% of all information the US collects for economic purposes originates from non-open sources.
According to an estimate, this translates for American industry into more than 7 billion dollars in the way of contracts.
That is why agreements must be made globally, preferably in the context of the World Trade Organisation.
Cryptography is a crucial point in the debate on protecting citizens and businesses.
The protection of privacy via legislation is only effective if the law is enforced.
Enforcement is much more difficult if cross-border espionage is involved.
That is why it is necessary to encrypt information, and people must be equipped to protect themselves against espionage.
That is why, Mr President, I should like to hear from Commissioner Liikanen as to what his proposals for additional legislation or measures in this field are.
For whatever is technologically possible will be implemented.
Mr President, it is no secret that the Group of the Greens wanted to introduce a stronger investigative tool, a committee of enquiry, in order to ascertain the truth about ECHELON, but unfortunately, the majority of this Parliament did not feel up to it.
However, a temporary committee has been set up, which is something.
Although a committee of enquiry might have revealed more secrets, I can now say that it is not the lack of facts which disappointed my group, it is the conclusions.
Tapping can be necessary sometimes, but the improper tapping of our citizens and non-governmental organisations contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, because it is disproportionate by definition.
Although the European Convention on Human Rights has been mentioned, the conclusions do not state in so many words that ECHELON violates citizens' rights.
Similarly, it is not written anywhere that the United Kingdom and Germany must stop facilitating ECHELON.
Of course, the world will not immediately change by a vote we take in Parliament, but that does not mean that that vote is unimportant: we need to make it clear what is and what is not acceptable.
The Netherlands will soon be debating a law on intelligence and security services in parliament. This law legitimises ECHELON-type activities.
An increasing number of governments want to narrow the information gap compared with other governments by setting up large-scale and improper tapping operations themselves.
It is our task to stop this snowball effect by making clear, political statements against the violation of human rights.
Otherwise, I have no choice but to vote against this motion.
Mr President, it is fortunate that the report, which most of the members of the temporary committee voted in favour of, acknowledges the existence of the Echelon network, despite American authorities maintaining a guilty silence.
I myself did not vote in favour due to the poor quality of the report' s conclusions.
Echelon is, in fact, one of the essential parts of the NSA, a sprawling global espionage network which employs approximately 90 000 people and which has the technical capacity to carry out hundreds of millions of interceptions each day.
This system is a real instrument of war against individual freedoms, and is controlled by only eight people, one of whom is the President of the United States, cynically called the 'gang of eight' by the chairman of the Congress monitoring committee.
The industrial and political espionage system was set up during the Cold War and its role is to defend what some dare to call the free world.
The people who hold these views met us in Washington, in this state of mind and not without a degree of annoyance. They asked us why we had come to try to cause trouble for them, when the money, armies and secret services of both the United States and Europe are defending the same values.
These are values that mean, for example, that on entry visas to the United States, the question 'Are you involved in Communist activities?' has been replaced by 'Are you involved in terrorist activities?'
It is now clear why no state or company has ever complained about the workings of Echelon - it is obviously to acknowledge the debt for services rendered.
It is now known that the United Kingdom and Germany act as intermediaries in this system, despite being members of the European Union and signatories of all the conventions on human rights.
Other countries, however, such as France, have similar practices.
Our response to Echelon will not be fine sounding speeches or technical measures such as encryption. We will respond by providing accurate information to the public about the choices it has in terms of society and by strictly applying the basic rights enshrined in the conventions on human rights.
Industrial espionage is the lot of a society motivated by profit and competition; political espionage is the by-product of an undemocratic society and this is the basic problem posed by the Echelon system.
We must respond to the global policing of interceptions with vigilance and popular intervention on a global scale and I maintain that European laws of today are better equipped to protect people against industrial espionage than against individual espionage.
This is one perception of Europe, but it is one that I do not support.
The temporary committee' s report expresses a thought-provoking blend of power and impotence, something we can, of course, see in the introductory quotation from one of the great satirists of antiquity, Juvenal, who formulates the hard but highly thought-provoking question, 'Who watches the watchmen?'
Everyone seems to be agreed that the Committee' s main conclusion is an important demonstration of the fact that this Parliament can achieve a certain power.
The main conclusion is that completely convincing documentation has now successfully been put together to show that this worldwide surveillance system does in fact exist, but that is something of which we were, in actual fact, already well aware.
The Committee has assembled and registered documentation that has actually been available for years, at any rate to whoever has been prepared to do research into this state of affairs. However, it is valuable to have the huge amount of documentation that has been assembled.
It is required reading for every democrat.
However, this is, of course, where the impotence comes in, first of all through the documentation we have to do without.
The report concludes that it is 'surprising, not to say worrying, that many senior Community figures including European Commissioners, who gave evidence to the temporary committee, claimed to be unaware of this phenomenon' .
The statement is the closest approximation to an acknowledgement of the fact that the senior figures in the Commission are hiding behind a wall of silence and selective memory loss.
To put it bluntly, they are full of lies.
Did you hear that, Commissioner?
A further demonstration of impotence lies in the sad conclusion that there is no effective supervision in terms of the national constitutions.
The report has an annex containing a survey of parliamentary and judicial supervision in the Member States.
Quite a few Member States have neither judicial nor parliamentary supervision and others - such as my own country, Denmark - have formal systems which, in practice, have shown their astonishing lack of effectiveness.
The sad answer to the question, 'Who watches the watchmen?' , is nobody.
Mr President, I believe that if ever there was a time to congratulate a rapporteur and the Chairman of a temporary committee, this is it, since they have produced a report which has been produced against all the odds.
The results of the work of the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON interception system, in my view, send the important political signal that the European institutions, and in particular the Commission, must take much more care over the security of their communications and that the Member States and the European Union must create a new legal framework to protect their citizens and to guarantee that the privacy of their communications is not jeopardised as a result of interception because those States have the technological means and potential to use it inappropriately.
These days, electronic mail, mobile telephones, videoconferencing and the Internet have broken down the physical borders between countries across the world.
And the most serious thing is that organised crime is using these means for their own advantage and even funding.
This gives rise to a question: why not direct all this potential for intercepting communications which, as has been demonstrated, the countries making up the ECHELON system have at their disposal, to combat terrorists, drug traffickers or the organised mafias which traffic in human beings, instead of using it for an international competition between States which is unfair by any reckoning?
All Member States of the European Union must dedicate all their efforts to defending the rights of their citizens, whether they be economic, social or political in nature, since anything less would represent a lack of compliance with the commitments laid down in the Treaties and, in particular, with the recent Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed at the Nice Summit by the fifteen Member States.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Gerhard Schmid, and other colleagues on the committee.
As Mr Schmid said, he had at the beginning a very difficult brief.
Let us remember that the pressure for this report came as a result of some quite fanciful journalism in different countries and some wild, weird and wonderful assertions, most of which served to undermine the very case that the authors themselves were trying to make.
The surprise of this report is the fact that very few of these allegations are substantiated.
Several speakers this morning have referred to the UK' s role in this matter.
The report acknowledges that every state in the European Union and elsewhere in the world needs some sort of interception to protect national security, safeguard its economy and fight crime.
That is nothing exceptional.
All the Member States do it, cooperating with each other and with other friendly democratic countries.
For example, to counter terrorism threats we need to collaborate with those who have the right skills and can help.
I know the United States is helping Spain in its current difficulties.
The UK also already ensures that any operations on UK soil are carried out with the full knowledge and consent of the UK government and are subject to UK law.
That means - I hope Mrs McKenna is listening - that everything is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
I hope we can put to rest some of the assertions and allegations that are still flying around about what is going on in the UK as well.
Furthermore, the UK stands completely by the conclusion reached in Council that in no circumstances may telecommunications interceptions be used to gain commercial advantage.
Numerous allegations were made before the report was published.
They have been repeated today by a colleague who has since left and, as Mr Schmid will testify and the report shows, there is no evidence to substantiate them.
I thank the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report and Mr Coelho for chairing the committee.
I too should like to thank the rapporteur for an outstanding piece of work.
I want to thank him for having taken the lid off this area and for having found an appropriate balance in the report.
It would not have aided further developments if Parliament had gone off in all possible directions at once.
This is one of the best examples of the European Parliament' s being able to make a difference and of its being able to perform a task which otherwise could not have been carried out because the individual parliaments would not have been up to the job. It is also a good example of there being a common area of effective operation in Europe that is of potential benefit to all citizens.
The purpose of the task can be summarised in three points.
Is there such a thing as an ECHELON system?
If so, what does it do?
And is there a need for democratic initiatives?
We can conclude that the system exists.
Some say that we knew that already, but it is nonetheless necessary in a community founded on the rule of law to also supply proof of the fact.
We can also conclude that there are unacceptable interceptions of private and commercial communications and, against that background, the European Parliament proposes a long list of initiatives concerning what can be done. Above all, a higher degree of democratic supervision could be introduced.
In that connection, it was also very pleasing to hear the presidency of the Council speak here today.
It offers hope that something will happen, both in the Member States and in the EU, for it is really astounding to hear those who exercise power reveal the extent of their ignorance and say that they have never heard of the system, even though there have been plenty of odds and ends written about it.
Had it not been for the European Parliament, they could have remained ignorant, and there is now a rather special form of democratic deficit that amounts to the inability either to hear or to read.
'Who watches the watchmen?'
Well, the people do, of course; and if democracy is not working, the representatives of the people must be replaced by other representatives.
Mr President, we have now heard it said several times that Echelon really does exist.
The question is: what does Echelon entail?
It entails a monitoring system which is tantamount to a massive global violation of fundamental rights, infringing not only the privacy of industrial communications but also the privacy of every form of communication between individuals.
This violation of human rights is surely the real scandal of Echelon.
But what exactly is the statement on this issue from the European Parliament?
The essence of the message contained in this report is, in fact, that we condemn this system because it is operated primarily by the United States and because it works too well.
What countermeasure does the report propose?
As a countermeasure, it proposes the establishment of an EU intelligence service.
As we know, there are also monitoring standards such as ETST, and European monitoring plans bearing the name Enfopol have come to light too.
Neither of these points is mentioned in the report, which essentially focuses on the monitoring that is undertaken by national intelligence agencies in violation of fundamental rights.
If we are tempted to follow the path that some Members would wish us to pursue and restrict our efforts to establishing control over the intelligence services, relying on democratic control of these bodies to solve the problem, we must first look at the various secret services around the world; as we do this, it will become clear to us that democratic control has never worked.
I know of no country in which it works.
So in my view it is no solution.
Let me make one more point on the subject of foreign policy, to which several references have already been made.
If an EU armed force is established, the logical consequence would be the creation of an EU intelligence service as well.
I am opposed to both of these developments, because I believe they will result in the militarisation of the EU.
If there is any serious intention to create an area in which peace, security and justice reign supreme, the intelligence services will have to be disbanded; the surveillance authorities will also have to be dissolved.
Then, perhaps, even former employees of the surveillance authorities will be taking advice from computer hackers on how to protect themselves with the utmost effectiveness against government infringement of their fundamental rights.
Mr President, people outside this House must really wonder what is going on here.
First of all, we conclude that there is in fact such a thing as ECHELON, and then this politically elected assembly chooses not to draw political conclusions.
We then go on to conclude that privacy is being violated, whereupon the European Parliament, which at other times talks of course about guaranteeing people' s rights, chooses to shift responsibility for guaranteeing these rights from the EU and the Member States to the individual citizen who then has to protect himself through encryption.
Finally, the observation is made that Great Britain and Germany are, in different ways, parties to this cooperation, and yet the report recommends ever closer cooperation on intelligence matters and no conclusions are drawn in relation to the two Member States that are involved in infringing our rights. On the contrary, they are free to participate in this cooperation.
I believe that the European Parliament has lost an opportunity to make it clear that it is serious about citizens' rights.
It is more than just a matter of high-flown speeches and expensive documents.
It is also about taking action, and action is what is completely missing from the report.
That is why I shall not be able to support it.
Mr President, I should like to say a big thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, and also to Mr von Boetticher and to the committee chairman, Mr Coelho.
You have all carried out important work.
ECHELON proved to be less extensive than we had believed, and the issue has now been somewhat defused.
The ECHELON debate has nonetheless helped increase awareness of these issues, something which was vital.
Interception and military espionage are phenomena which we shall not be able to abolish, or which we even wish to abolish, as long as terrorism and threats to the EU and its citizens exist.
The issue for the future concerning the way in which total security systems are to be developed without violating fundamental principles has advanced a stage.
There is no proof that the United States has damaged global competitiveness by spreading information about companies.
However, the report shows the need we have to develop security and encryption.
I particularly welcome the clear opposition to bribes.
As a Swede, I feel that is an extremely good development.
Obviously, cooperation at EU level on this issue involves having national control stations in accordance with the network proposed.
The committee' s work on ECHELON helped bring us closer together, thanks to the very special qualities of the rapporteur, Mr Schmid.
Mr President, I was given the opportunity to take part in the work on Echelon as a representative of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which was a very welcome change, and I should like to concentrate on a few legal and institutional aspects of that work.
The rapporteur is to be congratulated on presenting us today with a report which is exceptional in terms of both methodology and content.
Another exceptional feature of the report, to my mind, is the response it has already evoked far beyond the bounds of the European Union.
Just recently I had the opportunity to discuss the contents of the report with prominent US senators.
Firstly, they were very familiar with the report - which is highly unusual for one of our parliamentary reports - and, secondly, they did not question its findings and even expressly confirmed the designation or codename Echelon.
How different this was to the situation only a few months ago, a situation that had prevailed over a number of years, when the observations we made in the pursuit of our efforts to clarify the Echelon question fell on many a deaf ear.
The dismissive and stonewalling replies to the questions we have put to past and present commissioners, such as Mr Bangemann and Mr Bolkestein, as well as to the Council, fill bulky volumes in our private archives.
This makes our constructive cooperation on this occasion with Commissioners Liikanen and Vitorino all the more gratifying, and I should like to lay special emphasis on that point.
I am therefore confident that the Commission will help us to ensure that the concrete measures proposed in our draft report are actually taken, particularly the legislative measures to improve the protection of European citizens and European companies, the specific proposal for an additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which would elucidate Article 8, efforts to reach a much needed agreement with the United States and many more measures besides.
We must appeal to the Member States to desist from any illegal activities in which they may have been engaging, to exercise more effective democratic control of their intelligence agencies and to attach greater importance to protecting the rights of all citizens of the European Union in addition to those of their own nationals.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a sound report.
The most important conclusion may appear simple: ECHELON does in fact exist.
It took a long time for us to establish this, however.
Allow me to highlight two aspects of the report.
In my view, there is not enough about personal privacy and the protection of individuals.
That is why it was good that the rapporteur should have especially emphasised those issues in his presentation.
As was also pointed out, management interests are obviously very important, but these are not the whole story.
According to certain indices, the surveillance system has not only been used for industrial espionage, but also for intercepting the communications of individuals or organisations.
ECHELON has, of course, the capacity to intercept communications such as e-mails, faxes and telephone conversations between individuals.
The British journalist Duncan Campbell even believes that ECHELON is used to intercept communications from Amnesty and the Red Cross.
If that is true, it is an incredibly serious matter.
Just as was stated earlier, the EU will, in that case, have to be able to take action, in common with national parliaments and governments.
In a democratic state governed by law, protection of the individual must always come first, just as the President-in-Office of the Council indicated earlier.
My second remark concerns encryption.
Encryption offers the only effective protection against interception.
However, encryption technology is still in its infancy, and there are quite a few barriers to the export of civil encryption systems.
Nonetheless, the extensive exchange of information that takes place in Europe lends topicality to the issue of common standards and rules for encryption.
The institutions of the EU must be able to act jointly on this issue.
Mr President, may I say that I share the indignation, doubts and criticism voiced by numerous honourable members in the House about Echelon which, as we can see from the Schmid report, is not the stuff of detective novels.
However, I should like, if I may, to focus on one point.
As I understand it, Echelon allows certain Member States of the European Union - one Member State at least and maybe others - to attend top-level meetings in the European Union armed with knowledge of the negotiating tactics, positions and strategy of the other Member States. What I want to know is, if this is true, then exactly what are the final decisions worth?
How can we trust them, how biased, to use the English expression, are they? And how can the Heads of State and Government of the other Member States accept them?
Madam President-in-Office, I would be most interested in hearing your views on this.
How long will it be before we read the memoirs of some US president or high-ranking British officer and see how much political capital they made from Echelon and how big a laugh they had at our expense?
Mr President, I have to say that I was slightly surprised that Mr Coelho, who did an excellent job in inspiring difficult debates and maintained a completely objective approach, was given so little speaking time.
I would also like to thank Mr Schmid who has obviously worked very hard on this issue, even though I disagree with some of the points in his report.
The resolution poses a fundamental problem.
It highlights that the Echelon system exists and was set up by the United States with the help of the United Kingdom, in particular.
On the other hand, the resolution raises the problem of whether the participation of an EU Member State in the Echelon system is compatible with European law.
This is a genuine problem in cases where Echelon is used to carry out commercial or industrial espionage and to quote from paragraph F of the resolution "if the system is misused for the purposes of gathering competitive intelligence, such action is at odds with the Member States' duty of loyalty and with the concept of a common market based on free competition, so that a Member State participating in such a system violates EC law."
In my view, this point is fundamental and that is why this report, in spite of its values, leaves me with mixed feelings.
In particular, I do not accept the way the use of the territory of a Member State by a third party state - whether or not an ally - is trivialised with the argument that another Member State, France, in this case, could have the resources to set up its own global interception system.
This is not the same situation at all and that was not part of the work of the Echelon Committee.
Today, economic conflicts can be very serious and industrial espionage is only an instrument and, therefore, we should perhaps take care to ensure that we do not use this sort of war-mongering vocabulary to refer to our allies, and, even more so, to the EU Member States.
We in Parliament have a right to expect the Member State or States involved, the Council and the Commission to take preventative measures and action.
Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Schmid in my capacity as a member of the Temporary Committee on Echelon for his extensive, far-reaching endeavours in collecting and organising a truly impressive mass of highly technical information.
The report and its extensive conclusions and recommendations section, in particular, represent a major contribution on the part of Parliament to the protection of European citizens' and companies' freedom.
The main results have already been presented by Mr Schmid and so I will not go back over that ground in my speech, although not all the conclusions are consistent with some of the information given in the report, as Mr Di Lello pointed out.
To increase the effectiveness of the report and with a view to the protection of citizens' privacy, in particular, as well as companies, may I suggest to Mr Schmid, once again, and to the Members that they include some amendments tabled by Mr Di Lello and others, specifically Amendments Nos 12, 20, 21, 22 and 30.
These amendments have been rejected by the temporary committee but I believe this was purely out of concern for practicality.
It has, in fact, been maintained that a form of huge-scale, global non-differentiating interception such as Echelon, based solely on recognition of a number of keywords and using search engines, would be invaluable for combating terrorism and crime.
Now, the amendments which I recommend should be put to the vote state, on the other hand, clearly - and rightly so - that these interceptions are contrary to the principle of legality and proportionality which should govern every operation compromising the confidentiality of communications, and therefore cannot be permitted.
It may be that, in the future, we will have to amend the laws in question in line with the development of information technology but, as things stand at the moment, this is the situation.
Including the amendments cited in the Schmid report would be a decisive contribution towards ensuring that the European citizens feel that their interests are fully represented and that the Unions' institutions do not lose credibility as a result of the report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Gerhard Schmid for his excellent work.
Wiretapping and spying are an intolerable invasion of people' s privacy and are in direct contravention of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
When the Cold War ended, a massive system that had reached the pinnacle of its development sought a fresh role: it would seem to have gone from spying on enemies to spying on friends.
It was exactly the same in NATO: when the communist system ended the highly paid personnel who depicted images of enmity suddenly looked around for new roles to play, and they appear to have found them.
It even feels as if a sort of bellicose mood somehow lingers in the United States of America.
They are now building a missile shield against a threat that is actually hard to see.
Furthermore, certain recent selfish moves on the part of the new US administration seem bewildering to us here in multicultural Europe.
What is actually happening over there?
Perhaps we ought to go and take another look, as only one in three of our American colleagues have a passport.
They are notoriously not the most widely travelled of people.
I think we must now establish a watertight agreement at charter level that we do not engage in industrial espionage amongst one another, and our most important trading partner and friend, the United States, must be persuaded to adhere to this principle.
At the same time we must ensure that we are able to check that nobody is violating the privacy of European Union citizens.
And thirdly, here in the appropriate committees, we must continually monitor the situation to ensure that that is what is happening.
We have important work to do in this area.
Mr President, it is a known fact that, when the Cold War ended and the system of the two superpowers broke down, numerous national secret services extended the scope of their activities to commercial and industrial espionage.
The United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and our own United Kingdom excelled in this sort of espionage by setting up Ãchelon, as our committee has confirmed thanks to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, and the coordinators.
In my opinion, Ãchelon is one of the greatest scandals of all time.
It is a political scandal, it is an economic scandal and it is a scandalous mass violation of human rights and the rules of democracy, which is why any strategic plan dealing with Echelon-type espionage systems should force governments and international organisations to face squarely up to their responsibilities.
Globalisation needs to go hand in glove with legal guarantees that both privacy and the rules of healthy competition will be protected.
We need to improve the security of information technology infrastructures and the application of efficient parliamentary and judicial controls on how secret services operate at national and European level, otherwise our citizens will lose all confidence in the information society.
Finally, European companies need to develop ways of protecting themselves by reviewing their internal procedures, informing and training staff and using firewalls to protect their electronic communications.
Healthy competition between companies should be the cornerstone of the global economy.
In all events, intelligence services should operate on the basis of respect for fundamental rights, as set out in the Charter and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
It is high time we gave European citizens an answer to their question: quis custodiet ipsos custodies?
Mr President, I have the greatest reservations regarding the mild and, in parts, hesitant nature of the report, for it underestimates the dangers of global monitoring of communications and does not propose adequate autonomous defence measures for Europe.
In theory, the European Union could certainly negotiate a memorandum of understanding allowing the Member States to use this information but, for the moment and in the short term, the European Union must think about protecting itself autonomously with a different cryptographic system from those currently in place, such as the state of the art Hermes system which is the product of European research, with remote point-to-point transport so that the data cannot be captured by the spy satellite.
The report appears to avoid this specific question: can the use of data collected using Echelon by the security services of one of the Member States, the United Kingdom, actually lead to tangible cases of espionage against European citizens or companies by the United States?
These are questions which we must ask ourselves, seeing as the same US Congress raised the issue of whether the surveillance carried out by the NSA on US citizens was not a practice which contravened the Constitution.
It has been said and must be said again that even NGOs such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace and even people who are completely above suspicion such as Mother Teresa of Calcutta have been intercepted by the Echelon system.
That is worrying.
The President of STOA, an ex-Member of Parliament, Mr Pompidou, commented that many European companies have already suffered because of the existence of ECHELON, but they do not expose it because they still trade with the United States and have to continue to do so in the future.
Therefore, we wonder what legal protection there is to protect European companies against such damages.
What means do they have of proving that they have been wronged?
Moreover, what funding is there for European research in major, strategic sectors such as cryptography?
These are questions which the report does not answer.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coelho, the chairman, and the honourable Members of this Parliament who participated in the work of the Temporary Committee on Echelon, especially the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, for the comprehensive and well-written report on the Echelon interception system.
I should also like to thank Parliament as a whole for this very important debate.
The Commission has been following the parliamentary work over the past year with great interest.
The issue touches on complex technological and political considerations.
The report presents a large number of references to the existence of a global interception system.
These build up a body of evidence.
The Commission stated on 30 March last year: "It is the very nature of intelligence activities that those that are not involved in those activities are not able to confirm nor deny their existence" .
Even though the Commission is not involved in intelligence gathering activities, we do not question the findings of the European Parliament.
The report by the Echelon Temporary Committee is based on careful and thorough work.
The European Union is founded on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, based on Article 6 of the Treaty and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
As the guardian of the Treaty, the Commission attaches the utmost importance to the observance of those principles.
The abuse of large-scale communications intelligence is something that can make an individual living in a democratic society feel very uneasy.
Privacy is a fundamental right.
Any derogation from this right has to be specifically provided for by law, necessary for the achievement of objectives, in the public interest, proportionate and subject to adequate checks and guarantees against any form of abuse.
The Commission is determined to look at the practical implications of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights where, in particular, the protection of communications and personal data will be further enhanced.
The Commission has already stated that it considers it would be preferable for the Charter to be integrated into the Treaties for the sake of visibility and legal certainty.
At the same time, the Community has to act within the scope of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaty.
The findings of the committee concerning the compatibility of a system of the Echelon type with EU law distinguish between two scenarios.
First, the use of such a system purely for intelligence purposes and second, abuse of the system for the purpose of gathering competitive intelligence.
The Commission shares the opinion that the operations envisaged in the first scenario in the interest of state security fall within the scope of title V of the Treaty on European Union, which sets out the framework for the establishment of a common foreign security policy.
This lays down no provisions on intelligence activities.
Member States remain responsible for the conduct and supervision of intelligence operations, unless the Council decides otherwise.
The EU Treaty does not empower the Commission to exercise its prerogatives as guardian of the Treaty in this field.
Maintaining an interception system for the purpose of gathering intelligence, even in the context of a Member State' s defence or national security, is outside the scope of the directives in force on data protection.
As to the second scenario, the gathering of competitive intelligence does not come within the scope of a common foreign and security policy.
It is not an activity that would be allowed in pursuit of a common foreign and security policy.
As far as Community law is concerned, such activity could fall within the scope of data protection directives.
This is the case if data gathered by Echelon-type systems is collected or subsequently passed on to commercial undertakings for purposes unrelated to the prevention of criminal offences or state security matters.
We are all aware that electronic communications play an increasingly important role in everyday life.
Properly functioning electronic communications infrastructures are crucial for our economies.
As was stated in Lisbon, Europe wants to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
A precondition for this is the need to build trust in electronic communications.
This concerns both our citizens and our businesses.
The development in technologies can bring protection against surveillance.
It is reassuring that the use of fibre-optic cables instead of satellites for transcontinental communications has decreased the possibilities for large-scale routine interception.
The argument that the rise of the commercial Internet has significantly diminished the possibilities for interception is convincing.
Today the majority of Internet communications by cable no longer leave the European continent.
The Commission has taken important steps over the past years to develop a policy to improve the security of electronic communications.
Encryption has been mentioned here often.
The availability and free circulation of encryption products and technologies in the European Union has now been ensured with the dual-use regulation in place since September 2000.
The support, through the Community' s research framework programme, in particular with the information side of technologies programme, has improved the conditions to develop top-of-the-range European encryption products in order to enable EU citizens, companies and governments to protect their communications.
I would ask for your support in this context in our discussions on the next framework programme.
However, it is not sufficient to guarantee a widespread use of encryption.
Citizens and small businesses are not always aware of the potential effects.
We need to inform them about the possibilities of encryption.
We need to empower them.
In June this year the Commission adopted a communication on network and information security.
The purpose is to tackle this awareness problem and to further develop a European approach on security-related issues.
I am pleased to note that the conclusions of the report under discussion are very much in line with the approach adopted by the Commission.
The honourable Members are aware that there is already a legal framework in place at EU level addressing data protection and obligations for operators.
There is also an emerging policy on cybercrime, which will be discussed later today.
Network information security is now coming as a third element to complete the picture.
However, communication is not meant to contain a fully fledged action plan.
We have already initiated some broad action lines where progress needs to be made.
I will highlight some of them.
To raise awareness, public information and education campaigns should be launched and best practice should be promoted.
A European warning and information system is needed to strengthen the activities of computer emergency response teams - CRTs - or similar entities and improve the coordination amongst them.
I have noted Parliament' s support for this idea.
Then we need to examine how best to organise at European level proactive and coordinated measures to develop forward-looking responses to existing and emerging security threats like the European information security observatory.
Finally concerning the legal framework, we will set up an inventory of national measures which have to be taken in accordance with the relevant Community law.
Here I reply to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel' s question.
I would also like to mention that further action is needed to support the development of technology, to streamline standardisation and certification work, and for the introduction of security in government use and better international cooperation.
As a next step, it is our intention to develop a road map before the end of this year containing concrete actions with firm deadlines in order to start putting a European information security policy in place.
Finally, the Commission is constantly improving the production of its own information systems in terms of availability, integrity and confidentiality, especially in view of the changing nature of the various existing and potential threats.
The entry point to the Commission networks is constantly monitored and actively tested.
Similar efforts are conducted through projects for secure video conferencing, secure telephone systems and encryption of databases.
Furthermore, security audits of Commission information systems are conducted on a regular basis.
A new information system security policy has been drafted and is currently being prepared for discussion within the Commission services.
In addition, the Commission is reviewing its overall security policy as a result of internal reorganisation activities and policy developments.
The new internal Commission security provisions will follow the model of the Council security regulation adopted earlier this year and will be based on the following principles: proportionality of security measures in relation to existing risks; shared responsibility and accountability of staff, management and security experts; the creation of all elements into a coherent security strategy, such as personal information and physical security; and finally, close cooperation between European and national security organisations.
The Commission intends to allocate additional resources to the security domain.
However, scarce technical and human resources, especially in the field of information security specialists, hamper the full deployment of security policies.
This concern is common to most public administrations including the European institutions.
I welcome the support in the report to allocate more resources for the task to be undertaken and I sincerely hope that Parliament as a budgetary authority will follow the position of the committee.
The trust of European citizens and businesses in electronic communications and the well-functioning of information infrastructures has become crucial for economies.
Let me reiterate once more that the Commission attaches the utmost importance to respect for human rights and respect of rule of law.
Mr President, at the end of this debate I should like to say a few words of thanks, first of all to the chairman of the committee.
We did not know each other before the committee was formed, and yet within a few days we were cooperating as if we had been working together for years.
This is not to be taken for granted; it is no everyday occurrence.
Thank you very much for that.
I thank the members of the committee.
We did not always agree, but the atmosphere between the members was never unpleasant, and our cooperation was constructive.
These are also things we cannot always count on in this House.
So let me express my sincere thanks to them too.
My thanks go the Secretariat, the Secretary-General and his staff, and to the many people who have helped us with their advice and information.
Some of them are mentioned in the report.
There are others who have not been mentioned in their own interest.
My gratitude to them is no less heartfelt.
(Applause)
Combating terrorism
The next item is the report (A5-0273/2001) by Mr Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the role of the European Union in combating terrorism [2001/2016(INI)].
Madam President, I have the honour to bring this report to the House on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
It was felt appropriate for the chairman of the committee to pilot through the House a report on a matter which requires a wide consensus of support.
As a Liberal Democrat, I regard terrorist acts as a unique category of crime which negates democracy.
They are designed to destroy the very basis of civil society and I am grateful to committee colleagues for their support for this view and for our subsequent recommendations.
There are some who see my report as a response to current terrorist attacks on the Iberian Peninsula.
I share the profound concern of those who recognise this as an open wound in Europe' s polity and on behalf of the committee I extend to them my deepest sympathy and solidarity.
In my mind, however, my analysis and recommendations should be no more and no less a response to the situation there than to similar situations which have existed, and in some cases continue to pose a threat, in Northern Ireland, in the UK, in Corsica, in France, in Germany, in Italy or other countries which have been subject to attack by ideological terrorist groups.
Terrorism is not a new phenomenon, but today it has many new aspects and features.
Links between terrorists in different countries now form part of the fretwork of internationally organised crime.
In August, we saw evidence of contacts between terrorists in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in Colombia.
Such links enhance the capacity of those who use terror for political ends to find weapons, exchange ideas on techniques and escape the arm of the law.
Terrorism is also inspired by new motives and new weapons.
Some animal welfare groups launch campaigns to terrorise those connected, sometimes only tenuously, to experiments on live animals.
Some environmental protection groups harass those involved in oil exploration or exploitation.
Computer terrorism and environmental terrorism are worrying features of today' s world.
Previous attempts by democratic societies to tackle this threat have met with varying success.
Where they have signally failed is in the field of international cooperation between law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities.
In the case of the European Union, the tools to improve such cooperation are provided by Articles 29 and 31 of the TEU and yet governments have hesitated to use them.
Such reluctance is strangely out of place in a Union founded on the values of humanity and dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, respect for human rights and freedoms and the rule of law.
The decision of Member States to make the Union an area of freedom, security and justice should provide a basis for urgency in tackling a growing terrorist challenge.
An unqualified rejection of terrorist organisations and of terrorism should lead to a coherent and binding set of coordinated policies and a spirit of cooperation between governments at all levels.
Cooperation between France and Spain or between Britain and Ireland has improved in recent months and yet the opportunities offered by the Amsterdam Treaty for more effective action have not been grasped.
I would like to thank Members from all parties in this House for their generous advice and assistance to me in drawing up this report.
The report commands a wide consensus of opinion.
I am pleased that it opposes the introduction of exceptional laws and procedures.
Such measures should not be necessary.
They frequently deprive governments of moral superiority and can descend into instances of state-sponsored terrorism.
Herein lies a potential danger to democracy.
Where the state is not prepared scrupulously to pursue criminal actions against soldiers or policemen guilty of torture, it has little legitimacy.
Nonetheless I am opposed to Amendment No 2, which could be interpreted as justifying terrorism and to Amendment No 1, which would delay action in this fight.
I believe that the legal systems of all the EU Member States have the capacity to guarantee justice.
That is not to say that judicial standards could not be higher.
They could be, and raising them is a major challenge for the Union.
Unless we are prepared to trust each other' s judicial systems and democratic practices, however, more and more families will be deprived of their loved ones as innocent people lose their lives to those who murder for political ends.
My report therefore calls on the Council of Ministers to establish common minimal laws and penalties to counter terrorist acts, to abolish formal extradition procedures for those suspected or convicted of terrorist crimes and to establish a European search and arrest warrant in the fight against terrorist groups.
Some may regard such measures as extreme.
I believe that all are justified in tackling a form of crime designed to destroy democracy based on the rule of law and I hope that the Commission and Council will respond early to this call for action.
Madam President, this part session marks the beginning of a political year which presents us with tasks which could be described as historic: in the coming months we have to launch a constitutional reform of the Union, we are going to introduce the euro and we are going to face the most important chapters in negotiations which will lead to an unprecedented enlargement of the European Union.
For thousands of European citizens, however, these debates pass over their heads.
The fundamental concern of these citizens today is that their children receive a pluralist and open education in their schools; that they may safely walk the streets of their towns; that they may be able to publicly express what they think; that they may be able to exercise their right to a free vote; that they may be able to hold a position representing their people, without endangering their lives or those of their families.
And these thousands of European citizens rightly expect local, national and European administrations to guarantee their fundamental rights.
That is why it seems to me essential that the Community institutions, as well as dealing with the constitution, the euro and enlargement, respond to what we European citizens, in Spain for example, who live there, consider to be our first priority: the fight against terrorism, that is, the fight for freedom, for respect for human rights and for the rule of law which we Spaniards have built after four decades of dictatorship.
The creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice is what the European Council in Tampere in October 1999 called for.
We must congratulate the current Belgian Presidency for having made this one of its priorities, and we place great value, of course, on the laudable work of Commissioner Vitorino, who I hope will find support in this debate for the use of his powers of legislative initiative.
I believe that the European Parliament, the House which represents the European citizens, has had a special responsibility in this task, which our President, Nicole Fontaine, has taken on with a decisiveness and courage that those who have directly or indirectly suffered terror will never forget.
I am sure that your successors will have this same attitude.
I therefore also believe that we can be reasonably satisfied in voting for this report today on the role of the European Union in the fight against terrorism, the importance of which is demonstrated by the fact that its rapporteur is the very Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Graham R. Watson.
He is presenting this House with a text approved in committee by a huge majority, as he has said, and which contains such fundamental considerations as the statement that democratic dialogue must be based on mutual respect and non-violence, or the recognition of the debt that society owes to the victims of terrorist acts and their families.
In approving this report we are making a series of recommendations which, when implemented, will allow us to create a common definition within the European Union of the crime of terrorism; to adopt the principle of mutual recognition of judgments; to replace the formal extradition procedures with a European search and arrest warrant for those crimes which cause particular revulsion in society. I am talking about terrorism of course, but also human trafficking, crimes against children, illegal drug and arms trafficking, corruption, fraud and organised crime.
Madam President, with absolute respect for all the parliamentary groups, regardless of their political orientation and, of course, for the free vote of Members, I would now ask you to support the report because this is a fundamental issue which goes beyond party disputes.
Through the implementation of the measures proposed in it, justice will have more instruments for guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms that formed the basis for the construction of Europe and which have been restricted by terrorism for thousands of Europeans.
Madam President, I will begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Watson, in particular, and naturally all the members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, for their work, their cooperation and their efforts on this report which today we are going to firstly study and support, and then vote for.
Ladies and gentlemen, I feel happy today as a Basque, as a Spaniard and as a European.
I am happy because Europe has understood that when ETA violates human rights, when organised Basque fascism commits xenophobic crime and ideological cleansing, when this terrorist organisation, which in Spain today represents the final dying embers of Franco' s legacy, continues to operate, based within Europe itself, it is not a problem for the direct victims, those of us who live with escorts, those who cannot appear on electoral lists, those who have to overcome fear in order to write daily or in order to talk to the media.
The problem is for Europe. It is a problem for European democracy as a whole.
Therefore, European democracy is also acting as a whole and is reacting by uniting in the battle against terrorism.
I feel happy because Europe has understood that it is time to go beyond words, beyond fine statements, beyond bilateral cooperation, though this is important.
It has long been time to mobilise the instruments necessary to bring the criminals, the terrorists, the fascists, to justice, to finally arrest the criminals, to implement all the necessary instruments which will make the European democratic institutions more effective in achieving this end.
It also makes me happy to see that Europe has discovered that, when criminals are at liberty, when organised criminals are attacking human rights, freedoms and lives of citizens, the first political decision that must be taken is to make it possible for the criminals to be brought to justice.
We do everything we have to do to ensure that all citizens live in freedom, regardless of their ideology, their beliefs, their origin, their surnames, their native culture, and everything we have to do to defend - if you will allow me - the very concept behind European citizenship: human rights.
The Watson report and its recommendations are not just a commitment against ETA: they are a commitment to democracy.
The aim is to beat ETA, but the fundamental commitment is to defend democracy throughout the whole of Europe.
To defend the idea that everywhere in Europe people may live in freedom, in plurality, and may live together.
And in one place in Europe, in the Basque Country and in Spain, the fascist organisation ETA is jeopardising that coexistence and plurality.
It is said that there will be operative problems, that some countries will have problems harmonising their legislations.
President Verhofstadt said here, during his first intervention, that those who do not believe in utopia do not deserve to be called Europeans.
I believe that a political will which has been capable of introducing a single currency will be capable of also introducing single instruments to fight terrorism.
But please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to end by making a comment in my capacity not just as a European, but as a Basque and a Spaniard.
As a Basque and a Spaniard, as the daughter of a generation of Spanish democratic citizens who lost the war against Franco and who resisted forty years of dictatorship, I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that through this act today, Europe is performing an act of historical reparation, because for many years, for a long time, we Spanish democrats have felt a sense of isolation, of indifference and distance from Europe.
We often felt it during Franco' s time and we have often felt it - I can assure you - during these years of fighting the fascism of ETA, of fighting for democracy and freedom.
Today the debt of indifference is being paid off and I feel proud to share this moment with you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you as a Basque for this decision.
I would like to thank you in my name but above all in the name of many ordinary anonymous people, who every day fight for freedom, who overcome fear in order to appear on the electoral lists, who overcome fear in order to write, and in the name of those people who cannot talk because ETA has silenced their voices for good.
On behalf of all of them, thank you very much and congratulations on this act today.
Madam President, I would firstly like, of course, to congratulate Mr Watson on his excellent work and his important and difficult report.
Mr Watson has not theorised, but has taken account of what afflicts us and, in particular, he has dealt directly with what is inflicted on us by ETA, and of what affects Basque society, Spanish society and, in my case, Catalan society.
His total condemnation and his call for the need to respect victims must be a constant element in our statements and our positions.
I would firstly and clearly like to highlight in this report the fact that important positive action measures are proposed for the legal and police areas: the establishment of minimum standards, the establishment of a form of extradition, the recognition of judicial resolutions, the execution of arrest warrants and the approximation of national legislations.
I believe that these measures improve the important and priority legal and police action.
In the time that I have available, I believe I should stress that the report has not renounced important values in the fight against terrorism in Europe.
It is very important that Recital N incorporates the idea that ideologies are legitimate if they are compatible with democratic respect and values.
It is significant that in Recital O, the expression 'democratic dialogue' reappears, as a fundamental principle, based on mutual respect and non-violence.
It is also significant that Recitals R and S state that measures must have restrictions on the part of States so that there is no abuse of the legal regulations.
I believe that all of this is important, given the balance which is provided by priority and efficiency of action and respect for European values.
I must mention my satisfaction with these changes, because they change the resolution, approved by written declaration in September 1999 and in which I expressed my disagreement - even though I signed it - with the removal of the expression 'democratic dialogue' .
Through this report the European Union is fully recovering its values on this issue, because peace, understood as the exclusion of violence, on the one hand, and dialogue, on the other, is an essential pairing for the European Union, inside and outside Europe.
Europe, when it goes anywhere, inside or outside, does so with this pairing of 'peace and democratic dialogue' and clearly, as I insist inside and outside, I do not want to give any example because I would not want it to provoke comparisons which would alter what is positive about this report and this debate.
I am very satisfied that this report can be approved and that it will be an effective tool for resolving this serious problem which affects many people.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report about terrorism.
I should therefore like to examine now what is meant by terrorism, because it is recognised as something evil and is often used as an excuse to legitimise the infringement of fundamental rights by the state.
And so I have considered the things that are designated as terrorism in this report.
Trafficking in drugs is one example.
As we all know, the line between illegal and legal drugs is drawn in a fairly arbitrary manner and cannot be inferred from the principles of health policy, for example.
Many people here in Parliament, indeed, consume copious quantities of drugs.
But I am well aware that the report refers to illegal drugs.
I simply mean to say that drugs are an intrinsic feature of every society; they always have been, and no doubt they always will be.
Criminalisation will not get us anywhere.
The report then deals with trafficking in human beings, for example.
If the smuggling of human beings is meant - and these two concepts are frequently confused - it would be sufficient to include a reference to the fact that people who have had to enter the EU by illegal means have been recognised here as genuine asylum seekers. They are compelled to seek help from people like the snakeheads because we have created Fortress Europe here.
If traffic in human beings is meant, in other words the essential denial of people' s fundamental rights and the imposition of forced labour, this raises the question why the report on which we have just voted devotes so little attention to the protection of victims, of those who are traded.
That would surely be the best way to go about eradicating abuses such as traffic in human beings.
At this point, the report says that terrorism is also to be found in the context of illegal trafficking in drugs and arms.
I have already said something on the subject of drugs; as for arms, I believe trafficking in arms is illegal but, what is far worse, it is immoral.
Quite simply, the question is whether this immorality only applies to illegal arms trafficking.
Does it not, in fact, extend to the legal arms trade?
Is it not terrorism when civilians are attacked by NATO bombers and killed or made to suffer for the rest of their lives?
There are people who resist, who take action, such as civil disobedience.
They know very well that such action is illegal.
Whether it is a crime is another matter.
The report refers to corruption and fraud; many people are sick of government corruption and fraud and decide to do something about it, and we are supposed to construe that here as terrorism.
If the House does not even accept the Greens' amendment that seeks to establish fundamental human rights as a common minimum level of protection for everyone in the EU, the proposed recommendation must be rejected for the sake of those same fundamental rights.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his work on the extremely serious, topical issue of terrorism, which has recently been spreading with appalling, renewed vigour.
We may have been deluding ourselves in thinking we had banished this scourge which had stained Europe with blood for so long.
It may be that contemporary terrorism is more difficult to fight because it is less ideological and more sensationalist, because it is not based on political ideals but purely on violence, with precisely the aim of destabilising the institutions and terrorising the public.
What, then, should be Parliament' s role?
On the one hand, Parliament must certainly address the causes of that social and cultural malaise and distress which clearly lead to terrorism, but, most importantly, it must endeavour in some way to prevent the emergence of terrorist groups, to anticipate it and to identify the first signs as soon as they appear.
There are so many resources available to us: so many data banks, so many police resources and so much legislation, and yet, all too often, when faced with the emergence or transformation of large-scale criminal phenomena such as those related to drugs, crimes against children, the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and, of course, terrorism, Parliament continues to be taken by surprise and ends up arriving too late, incapable of defining effective preventive actions.
This was the case of those violent groups, many of them in contact with terrorist organisations, who infiltrated the peaceful, legitimate anti-globalisation movements.
I therefore look forward to the measures envisaged in the report to contain the spread of terrorism, particularly the European search and arrest warrant and the abolition of the formal extradition procedure.
I would like to end, Madam President, by saying that - to give just one example - there are still Italian citizens who used to be part of the Red Brigades and have been condemned as guilty of terrorist homicide for almost 20 years now, who have been in hiding for that entire period as the guests of other European States, despite repeated applications for their extradition.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with great attention to Mr Watson as he spoke about his report. I support the report for the most part, although I do wonder - as we often ask ourselves - what exactly terrorism is.
During the debate, we talked about the need to define the nature of terrorism today.
In my view, the measure discussed in the report deals with European terrorism, not just that despicable method which - I regret to say - is developing in present-day Spain, for if we can call that method despicable then we must see the methods used in other European countries by movements with much more dubious aims as just as contemptible.
Italy has suffered a terrible period in which we witnessed the murder of activists in their offices, the murder of young people in the squares and children burned alive in their homes, in the name of an ideology which ultimately led to the murder of the government adviser, Mr D' Antona, and which often leads, in practice, as happened in this case, to the death of young people during demonstrations which result in blind violence which has nothing to do with opposition to the globalisation of the markets.
Therefore, I look forward to a coordinated policy of all the European States which excludes the abominable special laws which proved to be genuine tools of political persecution when it was a case of striking one party and then tools of political protection when it was a case of protecting others, as Mrs Angelilli said just now.
I look forward to the introduction of the European search and arrest warrant, but let it be genuinely established now. Let the governments be called upon to incorporate the measures into their legal systems and to ensure that, as of the next few months, we no longer witness events in our squares such as those which took place in Genoa a few days ago.
Madam President, the report describes very graphically the dangers of terrorism in both its old and new forms and the threat it poses as well as the powerlessness of Europe' s traditional institutions in the face of the terrorist threat.
If I may take the liberty to contest perhaps only one point, the threat of terrorism really has nothing to do with a democratic society - even though such societies are often the target of terrorist activity - but is a far more pervasive threat against all people, whatever the political conditions in which they live.
That is why it is so difficult, and perhaps not even so important, to define the concept of terrorism more precisely. Maybe we should rather do as the report suggests and proceed from a definition of terrorist acts which focuses on the threat they pose to individuals and groups of people.
Agreement at European level is the prerequisite for more effectively coordinated action, and the acceleration of extradition processes, which the report proposes, is certainly important too.
The principle enunciated in Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union, which calls terrorism a form of international crime, must be binding on all EU Member States, whose political representatives of particular ideological persuasions defend acts of violence inside or outside the EU as justifiable.
I recall the discussions on the Middle East conflict, when some of our colleagues were suddenly able to sympathise with terrorist activities on one side or the other, although these were quite simply death squad operations and attacks on the civilian population.
Besides the organisational requirement, namely cooperation between the responsible institutions, the political will to combat terrorist activities is also essential.
There is never any justification for threatening an innocent person.
Madam President, if something characterises the production of this report on terrorism, it has not just been the rigour and know-how of the rapporteur, Mr Watson, whom I would expressly like to congratulate, but also the willingness and understanding of almost all the political groups in this House to reflect not only their rejection and condemnation of terrorism, the people involved in it and the methods it uses, but also to reach a consensus on the legal instruments which we must create at European level in order to combat and pursue the crimes involved in terrorist activity and organised crime.
We can state unreservedly, without any doubt - at least on my part - that the approval of this report would represent a European pact against terrorism.
Because, for the people of Europe, violence and terror are absolutely incompatible with democracy, dialogue and the rules of the game which the democratic States have set ourselves in order to live together in peace and, in particular, in order to resolve absolutely every - and I stress, absolutely every - one of our problems and differences of whatever nature.
Nationalist or independence movements that use terrorist organisations such as ETA in Spain as decoys are only really hiding the reality of their trade whose only objective is to spread terror, destabilise democracy and indiscriminately murder children, young people and adults of any trade or profession.
Another argument endorsed by this report is the urgent need to update the legal instruments which a new area without borders, such as the European Union, must have so that it is not easier for the violent people and terrorist groups to carry out their criminal acts than it is for the police and judges to pursue and punish them.
Because, Madam President, Commissioner, it is contradictory that there should be barriers and borders for judges and police while, for example, criminal groups organise themselves in one country of the European Union, carry out attacks in another and then return to shelter under legislation that is obsolete and incompatible with a common area of freedom, security and justice.
Hence the need for the four recommendations, which are the backbone of the report.
It is true that Spain and its government are particularly interested in what we resolve here today, but so should other countries such as France, Belgium, Italy or the United Kingdom or the other countries of the Union, because the roots of terrorism are in violence, its funding, the technological means it employs and the recruitment of young people who are trained, with money and hatred, to kill.
And this is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, which transcends the borders of the European Union.
Madam President, we are moving in the right direction.
I must insist once again on the urgency of the proposals and the urgent need for us to continue truly creating a new area where there is only room and freedom of movement for those of us who want to live in peace and freedom.
Commissioner Vitorino has the political support of this House.
We genuinely await his proposals with great interest.
Madam President, for reasons that are sometimes hard to admit, Europe is helpless in the face of terrorism.
Most Member States have no anti-terrorist legislation, prison sentences vary from State to State and the tracking of criminals outside the territory in which a crime is committed is only possible - when it is at all possible - by means of the extradition mechanism, which is always subject to the limitations of the reciprocity and constitutionality of each Member State.
Terrorism in Europe, consequently, slips through the net.
Fortunately, the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Tampere Council and our own Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino have brought about changes in judicial cooperation in Europe.
For this purpose, in this excellent report by Mr Watson, the European Parliament recommends that the Council lay down minimum rules for a definition of the constituent elements of the crime and its sanctions, replacing extradition with the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments, the definition of a European search and arrest warrant that does not allow criminals to laugh at the courts and the police, and standards for harmonisation in the field of compensation.
Madam President, in addition to these penal and legal matters, we must also ensure that intellectual prejudices and outdated historical opinions do not continue to portray terrorism in the heroic and romantic light of a fight for freedom.
Freedom is guaranteed in constitutional States, which, today, all Member States of the European Community, fortunately, are.
FranÃ§ois Mitterand taught us that nationalism is war and we are today seeing, very close to us and right under our eyes, in the name of various cultures, languages, regionalisms and religions, murders, deaths and violence that Europe cannot tolerate.
Europe must either trust in its values or become diluted in their opposites.
Terrorism is the main weapon of madness and of ethnic, religious or cultural fanaticism.
It is the opposite of freedom and of life.
Let us rid Europe of it, with the full might and power of the law.
Mr President, I belong to and represent the Basque Nationalist Party, the party which has been governing the Basque Country uninterruptedly for more than twenty years.
It is a party which, while calling for an independent personality, sovereignty and a right to self-determination for the Basque people, nevertheless firmly rejects and condemns the use of violence and terror as instruments to achieve any political objective and, even more, condemns the unacceptable State terrorism, which we Basques have also suffered, perpetrated by the apparatus of the Spanish State.
