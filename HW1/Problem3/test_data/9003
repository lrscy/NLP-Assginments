We are discussing the obligation in a war situation of an occupying power to respect the Geneva Convention and to give access for the delivery of neutral impartial humanitarian aid.
We have good reason to take that discussion quite seriously and we are engaged systematically in that discussion.
The next issue is to ensure that the different international humanitarian NGOs will be given access without having to obtain clearance from either party in the conflict.
This is what we, as a major provider of humanitarian assistance, see as our role and that is what we are concentrating on.
We hope to see the oil-for-food programme which is, and should be, managed by the United Nations, restarted shortly. The Secretary-General has made this clear.
It is an obvious way to organise it and we hope to see it up and running again soon.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
We will move on to the second part of Question Time, during which the three Commissioners present will be providing answers.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
Question No 35 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0177/03):
Subject: Are hotline numbers known sufficiently to the public?
The Commission has been given money by the Budgetary Authority to encourage all Member States to publicise hotline numbers for use by the public when they encounter unpleasant material on the Internet.
Is the Commission satisfied - looking deep into its heart for the truth - that these numbers are known to anything more than a tiny minority of the public?
When does it believe that these useful numbers will become sufficiently widely known?
Mr President, hotlines exist to take reports from the public about illegal content on the Internet.
They deal with these reports in accordance with established procedures and pass them on as appropriate to police, Internet service providers and other hotlines.
The awareness projects funded under the Safer Internet Action Plan have as one of their tasks to spread awareness of hotlines.
The expenditure in the period 1999 to 2002 totalled EUR 9.869 million.
The Commission considers this to be the most cost-effective approach.
This task will therefore continue for awareness notes under the new European Awareness Network which will be set up in the second phase of the Safer Internet Action Plan 2003-2004 where the honourable Member acted as rapporteur.
The Safer Internet Action Plan currently funds hotlines in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom and Iceland, as well as the European Association of Hotlines.
Expenditure from the Community budget in the period 1999 to 2002 totalled EUR 3.9 million.
The average annual contribution per hotline is EUR 76 500.
The main method of contacting the hotlines is not via the telephone but through forms on web-pages and email.
The hotlines have used a variety of methods to inform the public about how to contact them.
For instance, in Spain, the national hotline has a hyperlink on the homepage of Terra, the main Spanish portal.
The Commission does not currently have figures on the visibility of hotlines in terms of recognition by the general public, but a question about hotline visibility will be included in a Europe-wide Eurobarometer survey planned for later this year.
I am sure that then we will have more accurate information.
Statistics show a steadily increasing number of reports to all hotlines.
Over a six-month period, hotlines funded under the Safer Internet Action Plan processed more than 35 000 reports, of which almost 19 000 were reports on child pornography.
The Commission considers this to be a significant number and that the hotlines give good value for money.
The situation underlying this number of reports is a matter of gravest concern.
The Commission has been an active participant in further action to deal with it, including proposing a framework decision on child pornography.
We are happy to supply further details on the actions and events provided by the hotlines directly to the honourable Member.
Commissioner, thank you very much, that is very promising.
When the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs debated this Commission proposal on which I was a rapporteur, we found that none of us in the Committee were aware at all; and I wonder if the public listening to Question Time in the gallery are aware either.
So there is still a great deal to do.
Thank you for your offer to send me more information.
I accept your offer and since we 626 MEPs are the contact between the EU and the public, would you like to write each of us a simple little letter making all of us in the Parliament aware of it?
You could just print these off in the eleven languages and every Member will become conscious of it and we could all help to publicise this European Union facility in our Member States!
I am ready to do it, but given that we are talking about the Internet, could I send it by email?
I would like to follow up my colleague Mr Newton Dunn's inquiry by asking the Commissioner whether he has sought cooperation with the major Internet service providers in publicising these numbers.
That would obviously be a major gateway of access for many Internet users.
A linked point is the sort of cooperation he perceives is being offered by Internet service providers in being able to take down offensive sites that are reported through the hotline service.
Also related is whether action can be taken on sites that are fed in from other Internet service providers from outside the European Union.
The hotline links to Internet service providers, but of course we are also in contact with the European Association for instance, to ask them to circulate this information.
We must remember that when this action plan took off some years ago, awareness of child pornography was much more limited.
Since then the number of sites has been increasing and at the same time the attention of parents, teachers, and everyone in society has clearly been raised.
That is obviously the reason why we have had 35,000 reports, out of which no fewer than 19,000 were on child pornography.
I am ready to contact Internet service providers, and, as I said to the rapporteur, I will send a short note with links to all of you.
Perhaps we could also raise the issue with the Internet Service Providers Association, drawing attention to what Terra, for example, is doing in Spain, putting a link to the website.
I have not been aware of any situation where service providers would have refused to act if it was brought to their attention, but if there is something particular, I am happy to report on it.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
We will move on to the questions to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Questions to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m
Question No 37 by Torben Lund (H-0179/03):
Subject: Endocrine disrupting chemicals and test methods
In its opinion of 26 October 2000
In June 2001 the Commission adopted a follow-up communication to the Council and European Parliament on the implementation of the Community strategy for endocrine disrupters - that is, hormone-disturbing substances.
This communication set out the actions that would be undertaken to address the potential environmental and health impacts of endocrine disruption, in line with the Commission's obligation to protect the human health and the environment within the European Union.
In this context, the availability of agreed test strategies and methods to identify and assess endocrine-disrupting chemicals is a basic requirement for comprehensive legislative action.
The Commission participates in the OECD Endocrine Disrupters Testing and Assessment Task Force (EDTA) which was set up in 1998.
The main duties of this task force are to develop an internationally harmonised testing strategy and to coordinate and oversee the work of different sub-groups charged with developing new test guidelines, or revise existing ones to assess the potential endocrine-disrupting properties of chemicals.
The task force has reached a consensus on the development of a conceptual framework.
This will provide the opportunity for sorting and prioritisation of chemicals of concern based upon existing information rather than on new data to be generated as part of the assessment process.
This framework generates information on mechanistic data in vitro, in vivo, and/or on other adverse effects from endocrine and other mechanisms.
In addition the task force has defined a set of methods to be developed and validated: a comparison of sensitivity, relevance and reliability of the tests for testing the effects of endocrine disrupters on human health and/or the environment.
The latest estimates are that agreed test methods for some environmental effects are expected from this year to 2005 while some test methods relevant for human health risk assessment are expected to be finalised between this year and 2004.
New validated and agreed tests for endocrine disruption will help a clearer identification of endocrine disrupters and allow informed judgements to be made on the likelihood of adverse effects.
As part of the Community strategy for endocrine disrupters the Commission launched a dedicated call for research proposals in 2001.
A total of EUR 20 million was allocated to this initiative and, together with further funding under the Fifth European Research and Development Framework Programme, approximately EUR 59 million is currently being spent on research into the potential impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on human health and the environment.
This research includes the development of novel testing methods.
It is important to recognise that endocrine disruption is not a toxicological end point per se, as is cancer or allergy, but that it is a mechanism of action that may lead to adverse toxic effects.
By the nature of their effects most of the endocrine disrupters would normally qualify as CMRs - carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.
Such chemicals will have to undergo authorisation under the REACH system foreseen in the White Paper on the Future Chemicals Policy.
Furthermore, adverse affects on the endocrine system of wildlife species have been causally linked to certain persistent biocumulative and toxic substances which will also be subject to authorisation.
The Commission is currently considering whether to include in the draft proposal for the REACH regulation a provision to the effect that substances characterised as persistent biocumulative and toxic, or very persistent and very biocumulative - and, on a case-by-case basis, those substances of equivalent level of concern, such as endocrine disrupters not already caught by the CMR criteria - should be subject to authorisation.
Mr President. I would like to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for a very full answer.
The reason for my question is, of course, that it is taking time to find these recognised test methods.
We should have had a method for the effects on health last year, and for the effects on the environment now in 2003-2005.
Now I understand that the methods for health effects will not be produced until 2004; these test strategies that are to be developed through OECD systems have become something of a perpetual motion machine.
I find this very alarming, since it means that nothing can be done.
Unless the substances are also toxic or hazardous for other reasons, we cannot even start to apply the precautionary principle, since there are no recognised test methods.
I would like to ask about the last thing that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m mentioned, namely the issue of getting hormone-disturbing substances included in the category of 'hazardous substances' in new chemicals legislation and as an independent hazard criterion, on a par with what may be carcinogenic or mutagenic substances.
Surely it is important to take the step now and say that this is something that is so risky for us that there is a need for us to include it as an independent hazard criterion?
Mr President, Mr Lund, what we have here is an extremely complicated procedure.
At the same time, it is important for the EU to participate in an international context.
This is clearly a cross-border problem.
It is important for us to remain within the framework of the OECD's activities and to try to develop these methods.
I do not believe that there is anyone who wants to delay this work.
On the contrary, we all feel a need to press on and ensure that we as quickly as possible obtain test methods and systems for working with these hormone-disturbing substances.
We can only promise that we shall do everything we can to ensure that the work produces good results.
What we are now discussing in connection with the new chemicals legislation is the fact that, as long as we lack clear definitions and clear test methods, together with agreed systems for using these, we must act on a case-by-case basis.
The fact that, in the discussions we have had so far, specific mention has been made of the group of endocrine-disrupting substances is a factor pointing in the direction of future clarity.
The next stage is just to work as quickly as we can to come up with agreed methods of dealing with such substances.
Question No 38 by Jan Dhaene (H-0197/03):
Subject: Setting up a European civil defence corps
There is an urgent need to set up a European civil defence corps. This became apparent once again after the Prestige disaster.
These 'Green Berets' under the European flag could provide assistance in the wake of disasters all over the Union and would have specialised equipment which not all Member States can afford.
How much progress has the Commission made on implementing this proposal?
Which Member States have already agreed to cooperate?
When will the Commission present the proposal to the Council?
Questions on European civil protection corps, or ideas for similar initiatives in specific areas, such as a European coastguard, have been raised at different times in the past and also recently.
However, to my knowledge, there is no specific proposal on the table.
We must be aware that, according to the Treaties, civil protection measures fall under the competence of the Member States.
Therefore, any such measures at Community level must strictly respect the principle of subsidiarity.
Furthermore, many different sectors are involved in civil protection.
The ways in which they cooperate are organised differently in different Member States.
Therefore the practical implications of establishing an EU-wide civil protection corps would require thorough analysis.
However, the idea of creating such a corps is certainly interesting and I shall follow with interest the discussions on this issue in the European Convention.
Independently from these discussions, I can inform you that the Commission is already active in this field, although this seems to be little known.
At the Commission's initiative, a Community mechanism to facilitate and reinforce cooperation in the field of civil protection has been set up.
At present, all Member States, eleven candidate countries and the three EEA countries participate in this EU framework, which can provide a method for better civil protection coordination inside as well as outside the European Union.
One of the key elements in this context has been the establishment, within the Commission, of the EU Civil Protection Response Centre.
This centre has been in place since 1 January 2002 and is available on a permanent basis, 24 hours a day.
Once activated by a request from one of the participating countries, the centre can immediately call upon Member States' civil protection resources, as already pre-identified for all types of major emergencies.
If you wish, I can also mention when this response centre has been used and where we have intervened.
The Commission considers that the EU Response Centre, which builds on all available national capacities, represents an effective tool that responds to the concerns expressed by the honourable Member.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner, but I still have a few questions.
You say that this EU Response Centre is operational, but did Spain, for example, call on it for help at the time of the Prestige disaster?
When did they appeal to it?
What happens if a Member State does not appeal to it and is not itself able to act?
I was in Galicia ten days after the disaster.
The Belgian civil protection service arrived, but nothing was organised.
If there were, for example, to be a disaster off the Latvian coast in two years' time, that would be a problem.
I think that we do need to have at our disposal a corps that can take immediate action.
A second point is that the technical know-how needed in order to act in a proper and environmentally friendly manner needs to be gathered and made available to all Member States.
I should like to thank you for that question, because actually the case of the Prestige is a clear illustration of the added value of the Response Centre.
Immediately after the accident on 13 November 2002, the Centre was first activated by the Spanish authorities and subsequently by the Portuguese and French authorities as well.
Altogether, eight requests for assistance were registered and their immediate treatment through the Response Centre made it possible to organise and channel the offers made by all the other European countries.
Thus, following the accident, an impressive range and quantity of resources - including 15 oil-combating vessels, more than 20 kilometres of booms and several specialised surveillance aircraft - were put at the disposal of the national competent authorities affected.
The Response Centre also coordinated the assistance offered to the three countries, it sent a group of Community experts immediately following the accident and has offered to co-finance, with Spain, an environmental study on the consequences of the accident.
What if one of the new Member States requests our assistance?
Of course the Response Centre will be used in the same way and we will offer assistance from all Member States.
Now we can mobilise and coordinate the help and assistance of all Member States.
In addition, we are cooperating on a regular basis with those national authorities and services that deal with civil protection, so we can learn from each other.
We also have exercises whereby we can actually simulate a major accident, even with biological or chemical weapons.
This has improved our capacity considerably, but it is perhaps not so well known.
It is time to make it more visible and time to ensure that we actually intervene immediately after accidents.
All the new Member States know about our Response Centre and we offer the support of all Member States in cases like this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your extensive and very well-informed reply.
Four Members have requested the floor, but according to the Rules of Procedure, only two supplementary questions can be put.
In accordance with the policy of transparency which we value so much, I will tell you the order in which the floor was requested: Mr RÃŒbig, first of all, then Mr Ortuondo, and next Mr Nogueira followed by Mr Wuermeling.
I am therefore going to give the floor to the first two Members, Mr RÃŒbig and Mr Ortuondo.
There cannot be more than two questions.
Mr RÃŒbig, your supplementary question.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of importance to all of us that speedy and effective help should be provided in disaster situations.
Might you not contemplate the compilation of a Green Paper, listing for the benefit of all our offices and of all the voluntary organisations, what the options are, or create a virtual platform where the relevant bodies could coordinate their efforts in an emergency?
We are at the moment.
Any information is good on this and my intention is to make it more visible.
Even with scant resources we have been very effective.
We can say that it is very well known in all Member States, as well as the candidate countries, and, as I said, we work regularly with them in order to improve our preparedness and also to do more on the prevention side.
We are currently preparing a communication and perhaps we could look at that as a first step where we deal with prevention and preparedness for man-made and other disasters.
If Parliament and Member States so wish, I am willing to take it further, but this is an excellent opportunity for us to inform Parliament of what we have been doing, how we can intervene and how we can use our mechanism for civil protection.
Commissioner, since the Erika accident on 19 December 1999, several initiatives have been taken by the European Parliament and the other European institutions to increase maritime safety.
Unfortunately, the appropriate measures must not have been taken, because subsequently, in November 2002, we suffered a new maritime accident - involving the Prestige - and now we are revising what was approved at the first opportunity, resulting from the Erika disaster.
To this end, we are currently also working in the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the reform of the Regulation on single-hull and double-hull oil tankers and there is a very important issue, which relates to the contribution.
You have said that there is a European Union response centre, and I would like to know whether in it you have established emergency plans, above all for sensitive coastal areas, such as those of Galicia and Brittany, where year after year there are successive oil tanker accidents which cause damage to the environment.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea, you are absolutely right.
This is a matter of implementation.
The Commission acted at an unprecedented speed after the Erika accident.
In three months we have prepared a full proposal for doing more to prevent such horrible accidents from happening again.
But this also takes implementation; Member States must be serious about that.
As you know, after the Prestige accident we followed up to ensure that a time plan was enforced and that we could move more quickly than we previously planned.
The response from the Commission has been a serious one.
It has been very quick and we have been ambitious about what needs to be done.
Now it is a matter of implementation at Member State level as well.
When it comes to emergency plans, this is a matter for Member States.
They should identify the areas which are the most sensitive. They regularly do this.
This is the work of civil protection authorities in each and every Member State.
For us it is a matter of reacting as quickly as possible, making sure that we mobilise and send whatever equipment, expertise or help that we can, immediately after an accident has happened.
From now on we can respond on a 24-hour basis.
Through very intensive cooperation we can be better prepared because we will know about the plans of each and every Member State.
It is a matter of subsidiarity to formulate those emergency plans in each Member State.
Question No 39 by Alexander de Roo (H-0211/03):
Subject: Scientific meeting at Ispra to discuss Spain's national hydrological plan
There are press reports of a planned meeting at ISPRA between the Commission and Spanish Government representatives, including leading scientists, to discuss the scientific evidence regarding the impact of the Spanish national hydrological plan.
Can the Commission confirm that such a meeting is planned?
If so, when will it be held, and who will participate?
Can the Commission also indicate how this meeting will contribute to its consideration of the various concerns raised about the SNHP and its environmental impact in Spain?

On 24 March I had a short meeting with the new Spanish Minister of the Environment, Mrs Elvira RodrÃ­guez, during which we touched on a number of issues, including the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, and in particular the proposed Ebro transfer.
Both the Minister and I recognised that there are a number of fundamental environmental issues where expert opinion remains deeply divided.
As Commissioner for the Environment I am particularly interested in the projected future flow rates in the Ebro river, as well as the definition of the flow regime necessary to protect the ecological and chemical status of the lower Ebro and the Ebro Delta.
One of the ideas that came out of my discussion with the Minister was to organise a small meeting bringing together some of the key experts - Spanish Government experts, academics and NGOs - in order to address some of these outstanding issues.
I suggested that the Environment Institute at the Commission's Joint Research Centre site in Ispra might be a suitable location for such a meeting.
Neither the agenda nor the procedures for identifying the experts to be invited to the meeting have yet been agreed.
It is therefore unlikely that the meeting can be organised before June at the earliest.
Commissioner, I have one supplementary question about the minimum ecological flow of the Ebro.
You have talked to the new Spanish Minister about it, however, in Spain there is a difference of opinion between the Catalan Government - which also has a say in the matter - and the Spanish Government.
Are you aware of that difference of opinion?
It is essential because it concerns the issue of the correct minimum ecological level of flow for the Ebro in order to save its ecological functions, which are so important.
This especially applies to the Ebro Delta and the sites there which are protected by the European Habitat law.
If you are not aware of this, I would like you to ask the person responsible in the Catalan Government because he or she made a public statement about the difference of opinion with the central government of Spain.
This point is very important.
This was exactly the point.
This was the whole idea of setting up a meeting.
We have such different views on this.
Even the experts are now used by one side or the other.
We wanted to bring the experts together so that we could get some more facts and have all the different views reflected in such a meeting, and actually check at expert level why we have such different figures and results.
First of all, it will be a technical, scientific meeting, because everything is being politicised.
This is where we wanted to have a flow of information which could give us some more facts before we can continue to work on this issue.
Mr President, I am going to ask two very short supplementary questions.
The first is this, and I am asking Mrs WallstrÃ¶m: what is the amount of and the timetable for the financing of the national hydrological plan by the European Union for 2000-2006?
In the second, which also has to do with the environment and Spain, I ask what is the amount forecast by the Commission for the financing of the Galicia plan established by the Spanish Government to recover the Galician coastline and to develop Galicia after the Prestige accident, also for 2000-2006, bearing in mind that the Spanish Government considers that EUR 12 billion of global funding is needed over this period?
This is a completely different issue.
This is not a follow-up to the kind of issue that we started with.
I will be happy to respond to any questions that Members may have for me, but they should be presented according to the procedure laid down.
I have the impression that part of Mr Nogueira's question is supplementary to the previous question on Ispra and that another part is not supplementary. Mr Nogueira should not have asked it since it could lead to confusion.
I would ask you to repeat the first part of the question which was supplementary, if that is convenient.
Mr President, Commissioner, the first part of my question is crucial; it is absolutely fundamental.
Spain's national hydrological plan absorbs a fundamental part of the Cohesion Fund for that Member State.
The Commission's attitude to this financing is decisive for Spain's national hydrological plan to be taken forward or not.
I believe the Commissioner is aware of this and she should have clarified and explained this decisive point.
I am happy to give a general answer to that question, which is that the use of Community funding will have to be in compliance with environmental legislation too.
That is the general guideline for the use of structural funds and other funds.
The funding will be tested against existing environmental legislation.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission, because I have the impression - from its answers to various questions - that in relation to the Spanish national hydrological plan, it has so far been able to distinguish between the technical and the legal problems.
Given, however, the pressure and harassment from certain Members who believe that we politicians have the right to interfere in the intimate informal relations between the countries and the Commission and particularly in the role of technical experts, I would like to ask the Commissioner, are you prepared to guarantee freedom of work for the experts in the Ispra meeting, which is technical - as she has said - and to prevent politicisation as a result of individual and specific interests?
Because we could also interfere in relation to some issues, such as nitrates in the Netherlands, amongst others.
My question is, are you prepared to guarantee the intimacy and freedom of experts to work so that their work is not interfered with or subjected to pressures?
Let me repeat that the nature of this meeting will be technical-scientific.
It will address a number of the environmental issues associated with the proposed Ebro transfer.
The objective is to bring together these experts to review the existing information and, if possible, to clarify the reasons for divergent opinions.
The meeting is not in any sense a hearing on the whole Spanish national hydrological plan, nor on the Ebro transfer.
There are different and diverging positions involved: this is the starting point.
But we will bring them together and, I hope, we will be able to clarify how they have come to these positions, how they have been counting, how they have been calculating and what kind of information they bring.
I can never promise that there will be no political background.
There is one on this issue.
I am fully aware of that.
I have met with people on both sides in Spain over a long period of time.
I have listened very carefully to both sides and to many different stakeholders.
This is another attempt to ensure that we have all the information that we can get, especially on these, the most crucial environmental issues in this plan.
Thank you very much, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, for the information you have contributed to Parliament this afternoon.
We will begin the final part of Question Time.
Mr Vitorino will answer these questions.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Question No 40 by Bernd Posselt (H-0139/03):
Subject: Common border policing
What is the Commission's view of the latest efforts to introduce joint border policing with the applicant countries, and what steps are planned in the near future with a view to achieving EU border policing?
The ten States that are going to accede to the European Union in May 2004 have benefited substantially - and will continue to do so until 2006 - from funding available under the PHARE programme and from the expertise of specialist staff seconded by the Member States to these countries as part of the sectoral twinning initiatives between the Member States and the candidate countries, with the purpose of reinforcing the protection of the European Union's external borders and speeding up the gradual process of their achieving conformity with the Schengen Agreement.
Between 1997 and 2002, the candidate countries received an allocation of more than EUR 300 million from the PHARE programme for external border management.
Romania and Bulgaria continue to benefit from PHARE assistance and will see their national budget under the programme increase between 2004 and 2006.
For its part, Turkey will also receive more European funds for the same objective.
As you know, Article 35 of the draft treaty of accession provides for the creation of a temporary financial instrument comprising EUR 858 million for seven new Member States.
Between 2004 and 2006, the Schengen mechanism will cover the cost of the investment necessary to increase the level of security and protection along the European Union's external borders after enlargement.
Priority will be given to investment in infrastructure, equipment, training of border guards, logistics and operations.
All of this is necessary to guarantee compliance with Schengen standards for protecting the future external borders and thus to ensure an appropriate level of security within the European Union.
Thank you, Commissioner, for that very important information. Now, I would just like to ask you further whether you can give me answers on two specific points.
Firstly, what is the situation as regards the training of the border guards, particularly as regards the project for a European police academy?
Secondly, I would like to ask you when you think the Council will or might come to a formal decision on the project for a European border police force - or is that, at present, purely a figment of the imagination?
I am aware of the importance that you attach to this question. As regards the prospect of a European corps of border guards being created, I would draw your attention to the fact that the action plan that was proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 13 June 2002 provides for cooperation to be gradually stepped up and for joint teams to be gradually put in place to police the external borders, leading, eventually, to the creation of a corps of European border guards.
This means that the political decision has not been taken and that the Council has said that this will come later, after cooperative operations have been developed.
What I can say to Mr Posselt is that cooperative operations already started during 2002, both to police internal borders, with a centre for the control of land borders being set up in Germany, and on the southern maritime border, in the Mediterranean, with operations being undertaken jointly by Spain, Italy, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
All of these specific examples of joint operations were funded by the ARGO programme.
The natural development of these centres for border control and the joint operations should raise the question of the formal creation of a border police.
But the Council has not set a date.
I hope that the need for such a border police will be demonstrated and that the Convention on the Future of Europe will give impetus to this project.
The police academy does exist virtually.
We continue to support the idea that it should be a formal institution with a formal headquarters.
As you know, this issue is part of the 'agencies' package that is under scrutiny by the European Council.
Unfortunately, we do not yet have a response from the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that there are various weak points on the shared external border, for example with Slovakia, where there is still a border line running for some forty kilometres, which is difficult to police properly.
Could you envisage a force of this kind being deployed on a short-term basis in especially vulnerable border areas where help and protection might be needed?
Mr President, Mr RÃŒbig, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Member States have been working together with the candidate countries on matters relating to the land border for years now as part of the twinning programmes between them, because the Commission does not have any border guards of its own.
Several Member States are working with Slovakia and Poland to police the external land borders.
In this respect, I can say that the Commission is insisting that the candidate countries take their commitment to police these borders seriously and that the Council working group tasked with assessing border controls and the centre for land borders, based in Germany, are monitoring all issues relating to the future external land border very carefully, and that includes the Slovak green border, but also the Polish green border, which is quite extensive.
I can therefore say that although the Commission cannot provide border guards itself, we are supporting all of the joint operations carried out by Slovakia and the Member States that seek to improve the policing of this border.
Perhaps I might also add in this regard that I believe it is right to acknowledge that all of these countries have made very significant progress on border policing.
They have not yet reached the standard required by the Schengen Agreement.
That is precisely why accession to Schengen will take place in stages and in accordance with a method based on assessing each country's actual ability to guarantee the security of the European Union's external borders after enlargement.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he believes that expectations at the Seville European Council on the question of border police were raised somewhat too high.
Does he believe that reactive approach has created the expectation amongst the European public that we will have a border police around the external border of the enlarged European Union in a very short space of time?
Despite the Seville Conclusions, is the Commissioner still committed to the far more comprehensive approach to asylum legislation, and indeed illegal immigration, in the Tampere Conclusions, which looked at the causes of migration to the European Union?
Is he still committed to that far more comprehensive approach and will that still feature in his work?
The Seville Conclusions are balanced conclusions.
They emphasise the need to fight against illegal immigration, and that is definitely an issue that concerns us all, but at the same time they emphasise the need for the ever better integration of immigration policy into our external relation policies, including the development of a partnership with countries of origin and transit in order to cooperate and have better control of illegal immigration.
In the communication that the Commission issued a few months ago on immigration and development policy, it tried to give you a picture of everything it is doing in the field of development policy that is relevant for migratory flows, not only fighting poverty but also guaranteeing the rule of law and respect for human rights, and guaranteeing there are no 'pull' factors inducing people to leave their own country and travel, sometimes illegally, to the European Union.
Such an approach has been not only a balanced but also a realistic approach.
We are developing all the elements of the action plan, not only the operational part, but also the legislative one, and in several areas that you have mentioned, such as asylum legislation, we have been adopting the necessary rules that were provided for by the Tampere programme.
It is probably happening more slowly than some political rhetoric might lead one to expect, but at least I can assure you that we are progressing on a solid basis.
Question No 41 by Sarah Ludford (H-0141/03):
Subject: Crime: EU-wide measures to prevent mobile phone theft
The number of mobile phones stolen in the EU, often by international gangs, is probably in the millions every year, and a recent Eurobarometer survey showed that one-fifth to one-third of people in most Member States fear being the victim of such a theft.
In the UK reprogramming of a stolen mobile has been made illegal and there is now cooperation among UK operators through the GSM Association, with a shared database of IMEI numbers of stolen handsets so they can be immobilised.
Continental operators have also joined but only around 20 out of a total of some 500 European operators are signed up.
What steps is the Commission taking to encourage the setting up of an EU-wide industry IMEI database equivalent to the UK scheme, so the crime can be tackled through barring of stolen handsets on an EU basis?
Will the Commission consider putting forward a proposal, under Article 34 TEU, for an EU decision on a common offence of mobile phone reprogramming?
I would say to the honourable Member that the Commission has been in contact with the United Kingdom authorities on this subject since July 2002.
Since then, the Commission has also drawn the attention of the European Crime Prevention Network to the possible usefulness of EU-wide measures to prevent mobile phone theft.
The European Crime Prevention Network is now discussing the issue.
Nevertheless, the Commission does not foresee tabling a proposal on this subject under Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, as it has not been identified, for now, as being one of the priority areas for approximation of substantive criminal law.
All Member States' criminal justice systems contain provisions criminalising theft, which would, of course, be applicable to the theft of mobile phones.
Therefore, for the time being, in terms of the principle of subsidiarity, we consider that those legal provisions in the Member States are sufficient to tackle this particular kind of increasing criminality.
I thank the Commissioner for his reply but have to say, nonetheless, that I find it a little disappointing.
I am aware that it is being discussed in the crime prevention network, but it seems to me that there is scope for further action.
Millions of mobile phones are stolen every year.
Eurobarometer shows that up to one-third of people in Member States fear that they could be a victim. Also, with all the travel around the European Union, it has a cross-border dimension.
Although, as you say, theft is an offence in all Member States, I am talking specifically of the offence of reprogramming the mobile phones.
As far as I am aware that is only illegal in the UK.
There is justification for an EU proposal to make that a crime everywhere.
There is also a data protection problem.
We must have consistent interpretation by data protection commissioners that the IMEI number is not personal data - which it is regarded as in Germany.
Thank you very much.
I can confirm that the issue of the IMEI database, the International Mobile Equipment Identity numbers database, has been raised in the discussions on the Crime Prevention Network.
I can confirm that some Member States are in favour of creating such a database, but others are reluctant and doubt the usefulness of such a database.
That is why I told you that the discussion is still going on in the Crime Prevention Network.
The only reference I made was about the possibility of approximation of criminal law, and there I think we have no specific legal basis in the Treaty.
I do not anticipate that Article 34 could be used for that purpose.
I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs Ludford, for tabling this question.
I would like to ask the Commissioner to expand on a genuine cross-border problem in the theft of mobile phones: their extensive use in a form of carousel fraud on the VAT authorities in different Member States.
This is being used by sophisticated organised criminals and is therefore something that, I hope, he will be taking a serious interest in.
The issue of using the IMEI numbers is clearly a first step, in that bulk transactions of mobile phones should only be authorised if the IMEI numbers are checked to make sure those phones have not already been subject to a previous fraudulent transaction.
Second, I suggest that measures should be taken that would allow VAT on mobile phones to be paid directly to the tax authorities so that criminals cannot get their hands on the proceeds.
Finally, I am happy to send the Commissioner documentation from a major mobile phone trader in my region.
This undertaking is being discriminated against by the German VAT authorities.
This is actively discouraging legitimate business and will simply be handing this business to fraudulent traders.
I hope that he will be able, with the assistance of DG Tax, to take some serious action to stop the German authorities penalising legitimate trade in this area.
I am willing to receive any information that the honourable Member can give us on the economic implications of these criminal activities.
I recognise that the figures are impressive: I recognise that 48% of all robberies in central London involve mobile phones and that the rate in Paris is about 40%.
I am very much aware of the fact that last year approximately 700 000 phones were stolen in the UK, 150 000 in France and 130 000 in Spain.
I do not deny that there is an important cross-border dimension to this kind of criminal activity.
The issue is how to prioritise the actions that should be taken.
My view is that priority should go to operational cooperation.
I do not see any need for harmonisation of legislation.
Therefore we will go on discussing a European network of crime prevention and what concrete operational activities should be developed to fight this kind of crime.
The IMEI approach has already been discussed.
We can only decide by unanimity and the Member States are split on this issue.
However, we will definitely not drop the issue.
Question No 42 by Alain Krivine (H-0174/03):
Subject: Franco-German charter flight
On Monday 3 March 2003 France and Germany collectively expelled 54 Senegalese and Ivorian nationals on a Euralair Horizons charter flight.
On board the aircraft hired by the two governments were 30 Ivorians and 23 Senegalese, who had not been admitted to France or whose request for asylum in France had been rejected, and who had been detained in the transit area at Roissy airport, and a Senegalese who had come from Germany by road, having been expelled from that country.
Does the Commission consider that Article 4 of Protocol No 4 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the first paragraph of Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as ratified at the Nice Summit, have been respected?
Does the Commission consider that the second paragraph of the same Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been respected with regard to the Ivorians rejected to a country currently in a situation of unrest and that the asylum procedures guaranteed by the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 and the protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status of refugees have been respected?
What measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the treaties, in particular the provisions thereof on the right of asylum and protection against removal, expulsion and extradition, are respected?
Mr President, as has already been pointed out, in the debate we will have to have on cooperation at an operational level between Member States regarding the repatriation of illegal residents, joint charter flights are one of the measures for strengthening operational cooperation laid down in the repatriation action plan approved by the Council in November 2002, on the basis of a Commission communication.
Legally speaking, these joint charter flights currently mean two or more national removal operations carried out at the same time in one and the same aircraft.
These joint charter flights have nothing to do with collective expulsions, which are prohibited by the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Joint repatriation flights, with a certain number of people on board, are organised for logistical reasons, but the underlying expulsion decisions are always made individually.
Each case is examined individually according to the personal circumstances and legal situation of each person.
In other words, everybody on board a flight of this kind has been the subject of an individual procedure that has led to an individual rejection of any application or appeal to obtain legal residency.
Therefore, the decisions are based on individual grounds and not collective grounds.
In connection with the case mentioned by Mr Krivin, the Commission has received no indication and has no reason to suppose that the specific circumstances of each of the people on this flight was subject to an infringement of any instrument of international law, or, in other words, that the people on this flight had not had their applications examined individually and effectively by the Member States that adopted the expulsion measures.
Commissioner, thank you for your explanation.
It seems to me that this is a very serious problem, because since I asked this question five joint flights - as you call them - have departed from France.
They were carrying groups of people of the same nationality leaving under the same conditions, often handcuffed, sometimes gagged, so effectively that two immigrants even died of suffocation.
The government has, I might add, decided that from now on there will be a Red Cross doctor on board these so-called joint flights to ensure that everything runs smoothly.
My question then is as follows: what is the difference between a joint flight and a group flight?
By definition a group is a number of individuals.
When you have 42 Senegalese together, who is going to decide what criterion should be used to determine whether they constitute a group or a number of individuals?
I am not aware of a group that is not a number of individuals.
But it is my misfortune to believe that when you have 42 Senegalese or 20 Ivorians together - Ivorians, I would point out, whose lives are in danger in their own country - it is more or less the same thing.
So my question is as follows: who determines the difference in meaning between a joint flight and a group flight?
Explain to me what a collective expulsion is, that is what is forbidden.
Gladly, Mr Krivine.
First of all, a joint flight is a flight that has been organised by at least two Member States.
It is at this level that the intention is a joint one, in this case the intention of France and Germany.
These two countries assembled a certain number of people in one place who were to be deported and they left on the same flight. It is a joint flight from an organisational point of view.
As regards collective expulsion, which is prohibited by the European Convention on Human Rights, the question is: when does collective expulsion arise?
A collective deportation order is not made for each of the individuals that make up the group; there is just one order that applies to a whole group of people and that does not take account of the specific situation of each of the individuals in the group.
That is the difference.
Collective expulsion is prohibited.
It is not permitted in the European Union in any shape or form.
On the other hand, if you have ten individual deportation orders and if you see these ten people together, there is no doubt that they form a group, but, whether they go on a joint flight or not, it is not a collective expulsion.
That is the essential difference in my opinion.
Thank you very much for your cooperation this afternoon, Mr Vitorino.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 43 to 80 will be replied to in writing
President Trajkovski, you are very welcome to the European Parliament today.
It is a great honour and privilege for me to be able to introduce you to our House.
In this Parliament we know all too well what the countries in your region have gone through in the past decade, and in particular the ordeal by arms and violence which you have all had to live through, but nonetheless yours is a country which in its current phase brings us a certain message of hope.
The crisis in 2001 was one which, with active assistance from the international community - including, I am proud to say, a very hands-on and determined approach by the European Union - managed to avoid slipping into a costly civil war.
It has instead resulted in steady progress in terms of democracy and in your commitment, and the commitment of your country, to developing good neighbourly relations, respecting the rule of law, boosting the economy through trade and cooperation and working through the Ohrid Framework Agreement over time.
This provides the bridge for your country to make a full return to its international connections and to a point from which you may begin to realise your European vision.
We in this House strongly support the policy of the Union seeking to develop a European perspective for the Western Balkans.
Your address here today, and in the context of current progress being made in your country, is an important bridgehead towards the EU for the region in general as well as for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in particular.
The recent despicable assassination of Mr Zoran Djindjic in Serbia highlights again to us the need for stability in this region and reminds us of our duty of care to act when we have the capacity to do so and the circumstances present themselves.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, like all the former Yugoslav states, already belongs to the European family.
This was explicitly recognised at the European Council in Feira in June 2002.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, like the other countries of the Western Balkans, has a European perspective.
We are very pleased in this House that the first ever operation of the European Rapid Reaction Force has started in your Republic.
This is the clearest possible signal of the Union's commitment to the region.
Indeed, at a moment when we are living through a sense of Europe having failed to find its voice in an adequate way on the Iraqi crisis and in the UN, we look to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as one of the successes of the embryonic and emerging common foreign and security policy in Europe.
(Applause)
You are now on the path to this European vision which we share.
I believe that the speed of your advance depends on you, on your progress in reform, on your political determination and your strong resolve.
But each step you take in that direction, we will travel that road with you.
That is the message I would like to give you today on behalf of my colleagues here.
You can count on our support.
It is now my great honour and privilege to invite you to address the House.
(The speaker began in Macedonian.
The following paragraph is a translation)
Mr President, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, it is with great appreciation and pleasure that I speak to you today.
The European Parliament embodies a vision of Europe that is shared today by millions of people, not only inside but also outside of the current European Union, including by the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia.
It is vision of a continent of diversity, where different traditions, cultures and languages meet on the basis of mutual respect and common interests.
It is the vision of an integrated space for people, of freedom of movement, of a common market and European policies to address common concerns.
(The speaker continued in English)
This vision of the European founding fathers has today become a reality for the citizens of the European Union, for millions of students studying at universities outside their country, for businessmen linked through trade and investment, and for politicians and civil servants who meet on a daily basis to develop joint responses to the challenges of our age.
Soon the European Union will embrace 10 new countries, with their citizens partaking in the European dream of common peace and prosperity.
Elected representatives from these countries will sit in this Chamber, as a result of one of the greatest achievements of international politics: the peaceful pooling of sovereignty on the basis of shared values and common interests.
I want to use this opportunity today to share with you my thoughts on what this vision of a united Europe means to the people of my country, the Republic of Macedonia.
The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia share the same values and have the same interests as the citizens of those other countries that will soon join the Union.
There is a strong political consensus that accession to the European Union is the overriding political objective.
There is a strong commitment to do what is necessary to meet criteria for accession and to undertake the required efforts.
Two years ago some - in the European Union and in the Republic of Macedonia - might have had doubts about whether European accession would actually become a reality in our lifetime.
The State then faced the most serious crisis in its recent history.
We were all looking into an abyss and feared the worst.
Then, however, we managed to step back.
I want to express the appreciation of the citizens of my country to all those, in this Chamber and in other European and transatlantic institutions, who stood by the Republic of Macedonia in these difficult moments and supported our efforts to move from armed conflict to peaceful, political conflict resolution.
When a conflict is resolved peacefully and no longer makes newspaper headlines it is sometimes quickly forgotten, but the ceaseless efforts made by Romano Prodi, Javier Solana, Chris Patten and Lord Robertson deserve to be remembered as one of the most successful and timely interventions ever undertaken by the European Union and by NATO.
In this difficult period, Macedonia discovered that it had many friends - including in this Chamber, where parliamentarians from all political groups, have supported the cause of stabilising our state and reassuring our citizens.
The role of the special representatives has also been very important and much appreciated.
Today, Macedonia has returned to peace and we are more determined than ever to make up for lost time.
Progress in implementing the Framework Agreement is steady.
We recently signed a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
The Republic of Macedonia was, of course, the first country in the region to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.
It is my conviction that the momentum created in the last two years, and which has allowed my country to move from armed conflict to renewed progress on the road to European integration must not be lost.
The Republic of Macedonia is taking part in the development of a common European security and defence policy.
The SOFA Agreement of the EU forces has been unanimously adopted by the Assembly, which clearly reflects the trust of European defence and security capabilities.
This European mission must be a success, and it will be a success.
This is important, and not only to those who want to see the European Union play an active role beyond its borders.
I have stressed how much progress has been made recently - bringing hostilities to an end, strengthening the rule of law, implementing the Framework Agreement - and how important the role of the European Union was in this effort.
It would be a mistake, however, to become complacent and overlook just how much remains to be done to move not only Macedonia but the whole region towards a point where a return to instability becomes inconceivable.
Let me now turn to the challenges of the present and of the near future.
Let me stress what efforts we - the elected representatives of Macedonia - will undertake to meet those challenges, as well as express concrete ideas about what contribution the European Union and its institutions can make to help us in these efforts.
To secure the investment made - in particular by the European Union - in the stability of the whole region, we must be bold and visionary.
There are concrete steps which we must take that will require no less commitment than we have shown in the past two years.
Macedonian citizens are looking forward to the historic enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and then in 2007.
We must make sure that there are no fears arising that, following these enlargements, the Western Balkans could become isolated from developments in the rest of Europe.
There are three things that need to and must be done: we need to continue our efforts to strengthen the rule of law and combat organised crime and corruption.
We need to refocus our attention to deal more effectively with issues of economic and social cohesion.
And we need to work on realising the vision of a Europe not just for states but also for citizens, enabling free movement of the citizens of the Western Balkans across the borders of the European Union.
There is today a clear consensus on the importance of strengthening the rule of law across the region.
This is, above all, the responsibility of our governments.
We need to strengthen our institutions, improve our legislation and work on our border management.
Recent months have seen substantial progress across the region.
Our states are not so weak that they cannot take on organised crime, and our citizens support our institutions when we do.
There is much that the governments of the region can do, and there is much that is being done.
The Republic of Macedonia is in the final stage of preparations to organise a Regional Conference on Border Security and Management in Ohrid to take this agenda further.
The reality is that the effects of economic transition, the consequences of a decade of hostilities in the region, social dislocation, the creation of new borders and the formation of new and sometimes weak institutions combined create challenges that will take some time and a lot of effort to be met.
The most important thing is our determination and the support of our citizens in meeting them.
Ensuring lasting stability is also linked to success in the field of economic development.
In this respect, the governments and the people in the region have high hopes for the upcoming Thessaloniki Summit.
As the point is shifting from post-conflict reconstruction to development, our citizens are increasingly focused on issues related to economic and social cohesion: high unemployment, decaying or absent infrastructure and the need to adapt skills to new economic realities.
There is an obvious link between success in implementing the Framework Agreement, the success of the first EU Military mission and a concrete prospect for economic development.
Unemployment, particularly among the young, is extremely high.
Economic reform will require further painful decisions which might raise it even higher.
This makes the development of a vibrant private sector all the more important, not just for economic reasons, but also for social and security reasons.
In the next few years the European Commission will make a major effort to help the new candidate countries to catch up with the rest of the European Union.
It will also undertake a major effort to help Bulgaria and Romania, our eastern neighbours, to catch up with the new candidate countries.
This builds on the astonishing success the European Union has had in helping other emerging democracies - in our region, our southern neighbour Greece - to catch up and develop a strong private sector driven economy.
This is why we support so strongly the idea of the Greek Presidency to make pre-accession assistance available also to the countries of the Western Balkans.
We are very much hoping that, at the Thessaloniki Summit, a European commitment to the Western Balkans might lead to the creation of a complement to CARDS, with instruments of structural policies offered for pre-accession, as has been discussed by some EU Member States.
We are aware that such assistance will impose many conditions on us, including the need to co-finance projects with our resources.
However, such conditionality will help us to strengthen our administrations and prepare for a future in Europe.
We do not want to be treated as a humanitarian case but want to take ownership of processes of development in genuine partnership with the European Union institutions.
This brings me to the third issue which I wanted to raise today, and which is of great significance to the citizens of my country and the whole region.
The idea and the reality of Europe is the idea of mobility, of freedom of movement for goods and for people.
There are potential advantages of a visa-free regime in relation to the democratisation process in general.
A positive democratic and economic evolution will be nourished by simplified international exchange and travel possibilities for students, researchers and businessmen.
The successful continuation of the reform process depends on a new generation of responsible citizens with international experience and knowledge.
The Republic of Macedonia with its 2 million citizens borders the EU.
It has strong trade links with the EU.
Until the break-up of Yugoslavia our citizens travelled to all EU countries without restrictions and the Republic of Macedonia is not a country of transit.
I have been following very carefully the debates in your Parliament on the issue that has been imposed on us, related to the usage of the constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia.
Coming from a country with a rich cultural tradition, which has always seen itself as having European values at its heart, I can only be inspired by the principles that are the very foundation of the European Parliament and which are safeguarded by you, the parliamentarians.
It will take much more effort and more time until the Macedonian State will be able to become a full member of the Union, although I am looking forward to the day when Macedonian Members will sit in this Chamber.
(Applause)
In this I am hoping also for your support.
Let us forge a strong joint partnership and work together to ensure that the European dream will come true also for the young people of the Republic of Macedonia who look forward to being proud citizens of Europe in the 21st century.
(Applause)
We thank President Trajkovski for taking the time to be here, for his shared European vision, for his message of partnership and for his expression of hope for future developments and opportunity, both in his country and region and in their relations with Europe.
We thank you.
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0086/2003) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification (COM(2002) 225 - C5-0220/2002 - 1999/0258(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first of all to congratulate my colleague, Carmen Cerdeira, on the excellent work that she has done on this very important issue.
Indeed this text constitutes the first directive on legal immigration since competence for this area moved to European level.
I should like to say straight away, however, that I regret two things: firstly, that we have had to wait so long; secondly, that the end result is such a cautious position, the unfortunate consequence of a policy that is based exclusively on controlling migratory flows, despite the objectives set in Tampere.
After more than three years of fierce negotiations, after two markedly different proposals, despite a European Parliament opinion expressing support for the first proposal and despite the excellent work done by our rapporteur, the text that we have today contains minimal provisions on family reunification and, moreover, the Council will take absolutely no account at all of the European Parliament's opinion, which will nevertheless - at least, I hope so - confirm our previous position.
Tampere had, it is true, given us a glimpse of something entirely different, but at this stage it is unfortunately a certainty that the process that was begun in 1999 is turning out contrary to expectations.
Parliament really must vote in favour of Mrs Cerdeira's report tomorrow and in so doing clearly express its rejection of a fortress Europe, of the kind that is in the process of being created, and it must also clearly declare its support for the right to live in a family, which is an absolutely essential right in all of our democracies.
That is why we will be voting against - and we are against - the provision that allows the Member States, in certain cases, to refuse entry to a child aged over 12 years.
We also reject the proposal that authorises a waiting period of three years and we are unfortunately obliged to note that this episode constitutes yet more proof of the lack of political will on the part of the Member States to share competence for immigration.
It is not by adopting this kind of overcautious attitude that we are going to resolve the problem of illegal immigration; nor is this the way to avoid secondary movements of asylum seekers, which is nevertheless one of the main objectives of this directive.
In short, with the various steps backward in the second directive and the various ?
(The President invited the speaker to conclude)
... we are a very long way from achieving the objectives set in 1999 by the Tampere Summit for bringing this field within the Community system as such.
Mr President, I too should like to start by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent standard of her report, as the Commissioner acknowledged earlier, and I should also like to say how pleased I am that the Greek Presidency managed, after long consultations, to close - it did not start but it closed - this chapter on reuniting the families of legal immigrants, which had been pending before the Council for several years.
However, Commissioner, it is my opinion that you should take also serious account of the proposals of the European Parliament.
As chairman of Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I think this initiative on family reunification is important, because it will be especially helpful to the women and children who are often not in a position to follow their husbands in their attempt to emigrate to the countries of the European Union in search of a better fate for themselves and their families.
Let me give you an example. Three years ago, I was invited to a general assembly of the Bangladeshi community in Athens.
I entered a room where there were thousands of people, but only a few women.
It was when I asked why the women were not taking part in the assembly that I realised for the first time the extent of the problem.
They replied that their women and children were back home, in their countries, because they did not have the right to bring them here.
I am highly satisfied, therefore, that - even with this decision by the Council which does not fully satisfy Parliament - a serious decision has been taken on this matter.
Similarly, one particularly positive point of the directive is that the rights of the members of the reunited family are defined, rights relating to education and employment, in order both to ensure that they are smoothly integrated into the society of the Member State and to safeguard their employment rights, so that they do not turn into cheap labour on the job market.
Finally, I must stress that family reunification does not just form part of efforts to achieve a cohesive immigration policy; it is also a means of strengthening the Community's own social policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I should like to thank Mrs Cerdeira for her report and say very sincerely that I agree with several of the comments that have been made during the course of the debate about the minimal nature of the agreement that we have reached.
I can tell you that after three years of negotiations I am convinced that it was impossible to go beyond the level that was reached thanks to the commitment of the Greek Presidency, as Mrs Karamanou has stressed.
I am also sure, however, that this is not the last time that we will discuss family reunification.
It is a process that is going to evolve and I hope that two years after the directive has been incorporated into national law we will be able to assess the added value of the minimal standards that we are about to adopt and see what further avenues might be explored on family reunification then.
I do in fact think that it is a fundamental right, that it is key to the success of our integration policy and that, as the Member States develop their own integration policies, family reunification will become an increasingly important lever to help to integrate migrant workers successfully into the host European societies.
I do not imagine that it will be possible to depart from the essential shape of the political agreement that the Council has adopted.
That is why I would ask Parliament to show understanding for the fact that the Commission itself is not going to move away from this political agreement either.
I should like to add, however, that this political agreement must not be any weaker than what is already on the table.
That is why, for example, although I agreed in the past not to include subsidiary protection and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection in this proposal - at the request, incidentally, of the European Parliament amongst others - I do not think that it is acceptable to exclude refugees from this directive.
You see, we have to recognise that refugees have to have a right to family reunification, that this right needs to be included somewhere in a legal standard and that this instrument is the appropriate place to enshrine such a right to family reunification.
Finally, as Mrs Hazan said, this is the first instrument on legal immigration.
I think that it sends out a strong political message: a European Union policy on immigration cannot only be a repressive policy, it also has to be a policy of legal immigration.
I hope that this first instrument - as minimalist as it is - will form a foundation on which we can build the political will to adopt the Commission's other legislative initiatives on legal immigration, because if you are going to have an immigration policy that is not only credible and consistent, but also respectful of our common values, you need to have a complete set of legal instruments.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, as well as all the Members who have stayed here until this time, but I believe that the occasion warrants it, since this is an important issue and we have been waiting for it for a long time.
I entirely agree with what the Commissioner has said, but there have been certain statements made during the debate which I would like to clarify.
At no point does this report on family reunification allow for situations such as those Mr Pirker has mentioned: polygamy or the possibility of applying this directive to future wives and I would like this to be recorded in the Minutes because I think this is a very serious statement which can only be born of ignorance or bad faith.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, I am slightly at a loss, for the necessary political interlocutor in a debate such as this, the Council, is not here.
I feel that the presence of a high-level representative is necessary in a debate on an issue to which Parliament attaches such great importance.
That said, and I would like it to be recorded in the Minutes, at least, I would particularly like to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, especially Mr Deprez and Mr von Boetticher, for their hard work which has enabled us to achieve a common position.
I would like, first of all, to point out that Parliament has repeatedly called upon the Council to reform the Europol Convention to allow for concrete democratic control and powers over Europol, notably in the Nassauer, Karamanou and Deprez reports.
With these reports, we are calling once again today for greater European Parliament involvement in the Europol budget procedure and for Europol to be funded through the Community budget.
We are calling for European Parliament involvement in the appointment and dismissal of Europol's Director and Deputy Directors, and for two European Parliament elected representatives to take part in the Management Board meetings.
We are calling for full respect of Parliament's rights to be informed and consulted.
We are calling for the revision of the Europol Convention to bring it into line with higher standards and methods of democratic control.
We are calling for the strengthening of judicial control by the Court of Justice. Lastly, we are calling for the communitarisation of Europol.
The European Commission has already expressed itself on the issue of democratic control, proposing to establish a joint committee, consisting of members of both the Member States' and European Parliament committees responsible for police matters.
The issue of democratic control of Europol has also been recently debated in the Convention Working Group 'Freedom, security and justice'.
According to the Minutes of the Working Group, during a hearing, the Europol Director, Mr Storbeck, affirmed that 'parliamentary control of Europol is currently unclear'; he stated the difficulties in being accountable to too many national parliaments and that stronger and more efficient democratic control would be in Europol's own interest.
He mentioned the prospect of control by the European Parliament as a possible solution.
The same Convention Working Group has drafted a final report which states: 'Europol activities will need in the future to be subject to democratic accountability to the European Parliament and to the Council, as well as to judicial control by the ECJ in accordance with the normal Treaty rules'.
Notwithstanding all these repeated appeals and specific proposals, here we are today discussing a Protocol to the Europol Convention on which the European Parliament is being consulted.
Not only does it not solve these issues, it does not even address them.
The results of a comparison between the current powers of democratic control over Europol and the proposed reforms contained in the Protocol are extremely disappointing.
In the face of all this, we in the committee - and, I hope, tomorrow, the House - noting that repeated requests and proposals for real, improved democratic control and powers on Europol have been ignored, can only condemn the fact that the proposed changes are mainly aesthetic and make a mockery of the European Parliament and the European citizens which elected it.
The Council has not followed Parliament's repeated requests for increased powers over the Europol budget and in the appointment and dismissal procedures or for European Parliament representatives' participation in the Management Board.
Neither has it followed the Commission proposal for a joint committee, or the Europol Director's view in favour of increased democratic control.
Under these conditions, the European Parliament will keep its current role with regard to Europol: discussing without anybody listening and making reports without anybody implementing.
Inevitably, one day, the Council will have to realise that increased democratic control and powers with regard to Europol are the only guarantee for its correct functioning and administration in everybody's interest.
Our rejection of the initiatives and the resolution we have tabled confirm this: as I said, it was a difficult decision; we discussed the matter at least four times in committee, but, in the end, all the political groups agreed on this document.
I know it has been said countless times before, but the Council cannot be allowed to continue to ignore this position - which is no longer just Parliament's position - ad infinitum.
I hope and trust that Commissioner Vitorino will have a helpful suggestion as to an effective course of action, as he has proposed many effective measures in the course of this legislature.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow on directly from Mr Turco's speech and respond to it with my own thanks.
In this instance, we agreed on a common approach, one that would involve rejecting the Danish and Greek initiatives and adopting our own recommendation on Europol's future development, but, despite the common draft, our arguments do of course differ to some extent.
It is the case that, in the past, we in the European Parliament made matters easy for ourselves by rejecting every proposal for amending the Europol Convention.
Our justification for doing so was the lack of democratic and judicial control over Europol, for, belonging as it does to the third pillar, Europol has hitherto not been subject either to parliamentary control by the European Parliament or to judicial control by the European Court of Justice, whilst the national parliaments mainly had no interest in controlling it either.
There were a number of extensions of Europol's competences that we in the European Parliament were unwilling to agree to without increased powers of control.
The Danish proposal, though, on which I am reporting, contains precisely this increase in Parliament's opportunities for control, in that, according to it, Parliament is to be consulted on numerous issues, including the collection, processing and utilisation of personal data, the transmission of data to third states, the establishment of rules on secrecy and the protection of confidentiality in relation to personal status and, finally, any amendment of the Europol Convention as well.
Even the proposed facility whereby national authorities should in future be able to communicate directly with Europol would be a real step forward.
It strikes me, for a start, that it would not make sense to reject all this, and, even though this has been the line we have taken in the past as a matter of principle, I considered welcoming the proposal, on the grounds that it should be seen in the context of the debate in the Convention, where, at this time, Working Group X had proposed the dissolution of the European Union's third pillar - Justice and Internal Affairs - and the transfer of Europol to the first pillar.
This would entail both judicial control by the European Court of Justice and parliamentary control by way of the European Parliament's budgetary rights.
Seen in this light, then, it initially made sense to anchor a consultation procedure in the Europol Convention.
Now, though, the proposals put forward by the Convention presidium have caught up with the Danish initiative, something for which thanks are especially owed to Commissioner Vitorino.
I will be honest, Commissioner, and concede that I did not at first think it possible that the Convention would indeed bring itself to make Europol subject to a codecision procedure, to be termed in future a legislative procedure, with equal rights for Parliament and for the Council, but what I asked for at the end of each of my previous speeches has now been granted.
In this area, the Convention has indeed demonstrated courage.
Whilst, when I consider the amendments tabled by members of the Convention, I do find a few asking for the Council to reach unanimous decisions in this area, I can find not one single amendment intended to curtail the role envisaged for the European Parliament.
That being so, we can assume a broad consensus, and so the Danish initiative, with the consultation procedure it contains, can be shelved.
It is, nonetheless, possible to make improvements to the presidium's proposals.
For a start, the Council's authority to draw up guidelines should be done away with, as, secondly, should Article 9's restriction on control by the Court of Justice.
Thirdly, in general terms, unanimity in the Council in matters concerning Europol, as requested by a number of members of the Convention, is something to be rejected.
Fourthly, the legislative procedure must make it possible for Europol to conduct its own investigations, in collaboration with the appropriate officials in the Member States.
Such a transfer of competences could, in the first instance, also be subject to unanimity, although Parliament's rights must under no circumstances be curtailed.
Fifthly, Europol must also be able to act in defence of the EU's financial interests when asked to do so by Eurojust or of the Public Prosecutor yet to be appointed as part of it.
This is where cooperation with this institution must be regulated in even more precise terms; it must not be left to internal agreements, as was the case before.
Sixthly, control by Eurojust will be meaningful only when Europol has had real executive powers handed over to it, for, until they have been, the fact that Europol remains subject to the control of national public prosecutors will result in structures being duplicated.
The seventh point is that Europol must be given access to the various computer systems - among which I will mention only the Schengen Information System, the Customs Information System, and Eurodac - which are to be united in one single uniform computer system with different entitlements to access it.
My eighth point follows on from this. Europol has to have standardised data protection along the lines of Directive 46/95, and it needs simple language rules.
Last but not least, the requirement that the Member States cooperate with Europol needs to be enforced more strictly.
Many Member States are still sending Europol too few data or none at all.
We now urge the Council not to go on blocking the use of EU Budget resources to fund Europol in its counter-terrorist activities until such time as the Intergovernmental Conference has adopted such a constitutional treaty.
The public cannot be persuaded that their security suffers when the Interior Ministers feel that their competences have been trespassed upon.
In any case, the Convention leaves room for a generous interpretation.
At the same time, the Council must make preparations for the Europol Convention to be carried over into legislation.
It is now for all of us to ensure that the Convention is a success.
I believe, indeed, that our success is predestined, for without these advances we will, in the long term, fail in our attempts to combat crime in Europe.
So, today too, I will end with words that even Mr Coelho will endorse: by the way, it is my opinion that the Convention must be even more courageous.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher on the reports they have drawn up, which aim at analysing the initiatives taken by certain Member States both to improve the operation of Europol and to align the classification levels of Europol documents with the classification levels of Council documents.
The Commission shares Mr Turco's opinion that it would be difficult for European Union citizens to understand that the classification system of Europol documents should be different from the classification system of European Union documents.
As a result of this initiative, Europol would have four levels of classification corresponding to those adopted in the Council decision of 19 March 2001 and the Commission decision of 29 November 2001.
Mr Turco refers in his report to Council Regulation No 1049/2001.
I should like to call this House's attention to the fact that this regulation addresses the question of public access to documents.
It is not, however, a regulation that sets the levels of classification of Council or Commission documents.
With regard to the rules on public access to documents held by Europol, Members are certainly aware that the Danish initiative provides that Europol's Management Board should adopt rules on access to Europol documents taking into consideration the principles and limits laid down in Regulation No 1049/2001.
In the Commission's opinion, this means that officially Europol's Management Board only has to adopt such rules when the Danish initiative is ratified.
Nevertheless, given the importance of this issue, I should like to stress that in our view there is nothing to stop Europol from acting straight away to adopt rules on document access that take Regulation No 1049/2001 into consideration, as suggested by the rapporteur.
With regard to Mr von Boetticher's report, the objectives of this initiative are to define the competences of Europol better, to make Europol the point of contact in the European Union for issues relating to the counterfeiting of the euro, to improve contacts between Europol and the Member States' police forces, and lastly to provide a better basis for informing the European Parliament about Europol activities.
It is clear to me that these initiatives we are discussing do not solve the basic problems raised regarding the status of Europol.
I am of the opinion, however, that they are moving in the right direction.
I do, of course, understand Parliament's position of wanting to show its disagreement with the insufficiency of the solutions by recommending that the initiatives by the four Member States should be rejected.
But it must be remembered that the questions raised by these initiatives are at the same time being examined by the Convention on the Future of Europe.
Rejection of these initiatives would probably be a bad sign for change in the right direction.
I believe Parliament agrees with the Commission that the Europol Convention needs to be replaced with an instrument that is more easily adapted and allows for adequate legal and democratic control at a European level.
The Europol Convention should be replaced right now, today, through a Council decision, just as Eurojust was set up on the basis of a Council decision.
Europol's budget should be financed from the Community budget, and the information given to the European Parliament should likewise be looked at from a different viewpoint.
In fact, in the communication that the Commission presented to Parliament on the democratic control of Europol, we recommended that a joint supervisory body should be set up composed of representatives of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments.
Lastly, as regards the field of data protection, the rules that exist in the current Europol Convention must be extended.
These objectives are only very partially achieved by the Member States' initiatives.
As Mr von Boetticher has just pointed out, however, the Convention on the Future of Europe is right now discussing a draft article on Europol which, as I see it, addresses precisely the concerns I have just mentioned.
This should not, however, prevent the adoption of the initiative by Denmark.
It is true - and I recognise Mr von Boetticher is right - that the ratification process for this Convention is going to be slow and cumbersome because we know that all conventions under Title 6 of the Treaty have been extremely slow and cumbersome.
We only have to recall that the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests was ratified by all the European Union Member States only last month, yet it dates back to 1995.
This is a good reason for getting rid of the 'convention' instrument within the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.
We should not forget, however, that the outcome of the Convention on the Future of Europe, that is, the Constitutional Treaty, will also be subject to a process of ratification by the parliaments of all the Member States, all twenty-five Member States, and will therefore be a similarly slow and cumbersome process.
The immediate triggering of the ratification process for these amendments to the Europol Convention does not conflict with the Constitutional Treaty, since the rules of the Constitutional Treaty will prevail over the rules that are now the subject of this initiative by the Member States.
Finally, I should like to express my support for Parliament's position when, in the recommendation to the Council, it refers to Article 22 presented by the Convention Praesidium.
I should like to point out that the objective with which the Commission has approached the debate on the Convention is to make Europol an agency of the European Union with a normal statute within a single institutional framework.
This means Community financing, a legal basis that can be changed more easily, a European Union law and the use of the normal legislative procedure, that is, the qualified majority and codecision rule.
All these elements are welcome; they are in line with the Commission communication of December 2002 on the institutional architecture of the European Union and I believe they fit in with the objectives of more effective police cooperation in the European area.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has been consistent in giving its support to various initiatives aimed at broadening Europol's mandate.
We want to help Europol become an effective instrument in the fight against organised crime and to take on a primary role in cooperation between the Member States' authorities on investigations into cross-border criminal activities.
While we support the introduction of operational powers in Europol, which the Treaty of Amsterdam itself provides for, however, we have also repeatedly pointed to the need for the strengthening of its role to be accompanied by measures to ensure both democratic control and jurisdictional control.
In this respect we have consistently rejected all the initiatives with which we have been presented that ask us to decide on questions of detail concerning Europol.
As the representatives of the European citizens, we have repeatedly asked for the necessary powers so that we can exercise the desirable democratic control over Europol.
The rapporteurs, Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher, are rightly asking us once again to reject these Danish initiatives, to which a Greek one is now added, to remain consistent with the positions that this Parliament has been adopting.
This rejection must be used as an opportunity to restate our position.
First, that Europol cannot continue to be maintained within the framework of simple intergovernmental cooperation.
The Europol Convention should be replaced with a Council decision under Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union, to which the Commissioner has just referred, which will allow changes to be introduced through a simplified procedure and the adoption of executive measures by a qualified majority; it would thus become integrated into the European Union system of institutions.
Secondly, the role of the Court of Justice must be aligned with the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that there can be effective judicial control.
Thirdly, Europol clearly needs to be subject to an adequate level of democratic control, putting an end to the current situation in which the European Parliament has been playing a purely marginal role.
We very much welcome the result of the Convention's work and the proposal by the Convention Praesidium, which clearly requests a move towards the communitisation of Europol with the incorporation of Europol into the first pillar, the Europol Convention being replaced with a Council decision.
In addition, Europol's structure, working methods, fields of activity and missions would be defined in a codecision procedure by the European Parliament and the Council.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore supports the motion for a resolution that Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher have tabled asking the Council and the Member States to support the Convention's proposal.
Mr President, I am going to do something unusual, but I believe it to be necessary.
I think it is a pity that I cannot put my laboriously-crafted four-minute speech on the record, but it is apparent to me that my speech would have been a mere repetition of everything that has been said so far, and which has also been true.
For that reason, I do not, at twenty to ten in the evening, want to repeat what has already been said.
I have nothing to add to what has been said by Mr von Boetticher, Mr Coelho or Commissioner Vitorino.
We are all in agreement.
My group endorses the proposal made by Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher, and we approve the position they have taken.
I do not think that there is more to be said on the subject.
My colleagues can use my speaking time if they really want to.
Thank you very much, Mr Ceyhun.
Perhaps I might respond to your observation by commenting that the well-known German comedian, Karl Valentin, once visited the Bavarian Parliament.
Halfway through a debate, he left the room.
To a journalist's question, 'Why did you do that, Mr Valentin?' he replied that everything had already been said, but not yet by everybody.
With that in mind, many thanks for your contribution.
Mr President, I want to speak on the linked issues of data protection and parliamentary accountability.
The joint supervisory authority responsible for data protection is composed of a Member from each Member State.
It is supposed to ensure that Europol respects the Convention's provisions on data protection.
It has to review the activities of Europol in order to ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated by the storage, processing and utilisation of data held.
It must monitor the permissibility of the transmission of data originating from Europol.
It submits regular reports to the Council.
The Convention itself, in several Council acts, lays down rules on the use of data and the communication of that data to third states and bodies.
But to judge from the evidence given by the UK Member of the joint supervisory body to the House of Lords European Select Committee, we have reason to ask if we can have total confidence in the thoroughness with which the joint supervisory authority is doing its job.
I therefore fully support the recommendation in the reports we are debating that this authority should report to both the Council and Parliament and should be available for questioning before the relevant committee, which would be the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
The evidence that worried me was given last November.
Mr Francis Aldhouse, the Deputy Information Commissioner in the UK, was responding to questions about the Europol-US agreement on exchange of personal data.
He discussed the difficulty of evaluating the adequacy of data protection in the United States - because they have no federal law or data protection authority, but rely largely on case-law, judicial supervision and audit.
He expressed concern at the very wide provisions for transfer of data and the potential for abuse in the Europol-US agreement.
But then, abdicating any responsibility for being vigilant and active, he concluded: 'I think we ought to take the view, particularly as between Western European countries and the United States, that here is a set of countries which take a pride in abiding by the rule of law and will honour their agreements.
I share the view of my JSB colleagues that this is acceptable.' - i.e. that we trust the guys.
I do not believe it is responsible for him to abdicate responsibility like this, and he is the UK Member on the joint supervisory body.
The House of Lords was not impressed either and urged the body to adopt a robust approach to the protection of personal data in third country agreements.
By requesting accountability to the European Parliament we can help ensure this, although we must also have partnership with national parliaments.
A joint committee of European and national parliaments would be an excellent way forward.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports before us take considerations of principle as a reason for rejecting the Danish and Greek initiatives on the development of Europol.
That is only right, as the only possible response to the continued attempts at letting Europol carry on working as it did before is to say that the Europol of the future must not function without being influenced and monitored by Parliament, nor will it if this House has anything to do with it.
I therefore want to thank both rapporteurs for having again put this message in unambiguous terms.
I find the goings-on in this sensitive area scarcely credible.
A number of reports by Parliament have, over and over again, demanded real Parliamentary control of Europol, but to date nothing has happened.
Instead, Europol is to continue to be strengthened and extended.
I find this quite simply scandalous.
In view of what is going on in the background at the European Convention's discussions, the various initiatives by individual governments seem positively Kafkaesque, for they go beyond the proposals before the Convention on the reform of internal affairs and judicial matters.
Being a member of the Convention, I therefore support the idea of this House again putting its main demand before the Council and the governments and confronting them with it.
I also endorse Mr von Boetticher's demand for there to be no amendments made to the Europol convention before the European constitution is ratified.
I think this should be obvious if the Convention and its work are to be taken seriously.
I endorse the demands in the motion for a resolution, for Europol to be transferred to the first pillar and funded from the EU Budget, thus becoming subject to Parliament's full Budgetary control, and for the constitution to contain a legal basis for clear and utterly stringent data protection, with public access to documents not being able to be improperly restricted.
The most important thing, though, is something that my fellow-Members have already emphasised, namely that Europol should be entirely subject to Parliament's control.
As a member of the Convention, I can only ask you to continue to observe carefully the negotiations in progress in the Convention on this issue, for, in my view - if I may give an example - the basic thrust of the proposals on Europol from the Convention's Praesidium is that it should be, to a large degree, left to its own devices when it comes to laying down precisely what its role is.
As I do not regard that as acceptable, I have asked that it should be the legislatures alone - by which I mean specifically the Council and Parliament acting together - that should legislate to define the precise functions of these authorities along with all their ramifications.
Mr President, the atmosphere is a lot more pleasant this evening.
Parliament is as united now in rejecting the Council initiatives with regard to Europol as it was divided this afternoon in the debate on the UN Conventions on drugs.
In both debates, Parliament demonstrated the alternative ways in which it can exert influence in spheres in which it does not have legislative competence: this afternoon as a political and public forum in which debates sometimes become heated, and now as a guardian of the rights of our citizens.
It is clear to us all that the present situation is unacceptable, as Europol is under neither democratic nor legal control.
We are not joining in the game, therefore; we are not dutifully delivering our opinion.
I should particularly like to thank the two rapporteurs - Mr von Boetticher and Mr Turco - most sincerely for ensuring an approach and a solution according to which, on the one hand, we are able to openly voice our criticism - which we do by rejecting the Council proposals and, on the other, we are able to express our positive, constructive suggestions in a recommendation, such as our recommendation that Europol be made part of the first pillar.
I think that this is a very constructive approach.
I am also pleased that we tightened up the wording yesterday by means of an amendment explicitly stating that Europol must bring access to documents into line with the European rules on transparency; for public access to information must also apply to Europol.
That does not mean, of course, that there is not sometimes good reason to keep something confidential, to not put it in the public domain, but objective criteria must be applied, and those are worded excellently in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
That Regulation must be applied.
I welcome Commissioner Vitorino's confirmation, according to which Europol can simply apply that Regulation now, in anticipation of formal rules being drawn up.
Finally, I wish to try to win you over to the amendments that my group has re-tabled.
If I succeed in this, I think that it is abundantly clear that this debate is radically different from this afternoon's, because this afternoon everyone was, first and foremost, absolutely convinced of being in the right.
I want it to be clear from the Europol database where the data come from.
Do they originate from individual investigations, or were they obtained through national police or intelligence services?
This is important, because in some countries certain data may and other data may not be used as evidence in criminal cases.
If there is no clarity, there is a risk of evidence being termed illegal and thus inadmissible.
My amendment to Recommendation No 5 argues in favour of clarity as regards the origin of evidence, due to the importance of this clarity for legal cases.
I hope it will have your support.
Mr President, I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteurs for their initiative and tact in dealing with this situation.
However, I have some differences of opinion with regard to some of the speeches and comments.
Firstly, we should recognise that Europol did not appear out of thin air.
It was established by rules and protocols agreed by the Member State governments, acting on the authority of the people who elected them, to ensure that they could bring forward ideas and proposals on their behalf.
Secondly, Europol, by its very nature, is reactive rather than interactive or proactive.
It depends on information which is given to it by the national police forces, on cooperation with those forces and also on the requests from those forces for it to undertake action.
However, that said, there is an opportunity for greater accountability of Europol.
There is a necessity for their data-protection systems to be put in place and to be clear for all to see in operation and to understand.
I also believe that there should be an opportunity in the future for this House, through its own committees and the plenary, to debate the activities of Europol on an annual basis.
However, where I would differ from my colleagues is in trying to use strong-arm tactics against the Member State governments by telling them what they can and cannot do.
My final point is that much mention has been made recently in Parliament of the ongoing work of the European Convention.
Whilst we all await with great uncertainty and excitement the outcome of the Convention, it plays no role whatsoever in forming the basis of our work today.
We have to deal with the legislation, the powers and the Treaties before us today, and not with what may be given to us in the future under any future Treaty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the thoroughly positive effects that Europol's excellent work makes possible is the high visibility of the European Union's internal security policy.
We must, however, seek to adapt Europol's position to its present tasks, and to give it the best working conditions possible.
This, though, is where we have the problem referred to earlier, in that, even though we transfer functions to the EU level, we still have to use the tools provided by intergovernmental cooperation, because that is what the legal base requires, and we need unanimous resolutions.
We will, tomorrow, decide to enlarge the European Union to twenty-five Member States by adding another ten, and, when we have done that, we will have to give some thought to whether this arsenal can indeed remain functional when there are twenty-five Member States.
My fear is that Europol is no longer able to perform its functions, and no further amendments will be feasible if we wait for twenty-five states to ratify the convention.
So it is the debates currently in progress that once again call on us to emphatically demand what the two rapporteurs have demanded in their joint report - the necessity of securing for the future Europol's existence and that of the European Union's security policy.
We must therefore press home the demand for those things envisaged by the rapporteurs - communitisation, that is to say, transfer to the first pillar; control, as is necessary, by Parliament; allocation of the budget to the European level, and, most essentially, the transfer, subject to appropriate controls, of operational competences.
What other speakers have already mentioned must of course be added to this - namely, more intensive coordination between the computer data systems that we have, in order to conduct investigations into organised crime and criminality in an even more efficient manner.
We have no more need of systems that work in parallel or that hinder each other; what we need instead is one system, to be used in the same way by all, combined with a single system of data protection.
Here is a wealth of options, of which we may well be aware, but of which we must now make use if they are to be implemented with the help of the Convention documents and with full backing and support from all parties in the European Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Police Office having functioned for ten years as an intergovernmental institution of control, European policing is now to be put on a Community-wide basis.
Some may object that Europol is thereby being transferred from the third pillar to the first and thus being removed still further from the European nation states' control.
That is both true and irrelevant, for the character of the Police Office is not determined by which state body is meant to be controlling it.
The new plans for Europol are even more repellent than policemen are in any case required to be.
In any case, it is the police who, by upholding public order, enforce all the constraints of employment and citizenship.
It would be ridiculous for this Chamber to lament such an utterly vile stunt, as these are constraints of which you all approve!
Even if you are unwilling to understand rational criticism of bourgeois society, you can - if you want to be bourgeois humanists, refuse to endorse these plans, for Europol's true nature is apparent from its areas of responsibility.
Pride of place goes to the efficient organisation of Fortress Europe, in other words deportation for outsiders and the maximum of control within the European area, so free and secure and just as it is.
Not only people-smugglers and dealers will be affected by this.
It is irrelevant whether they do what they do as a matter of conviction or because capitalism obliges them to.
More and more citizens will find themselves targeted by the Persecution Authority, for communitisation will enable the Euro-police to be deployed more flexibly, and Europol's competences will be capable of being extended by a simple Council resolution.
Its operational powers will be introduced along with communitisation, representing the final step towards the completion of an EU police force with the powers of a secret service.
In any case, communitisation makes the police force even more important.
To be sure, the Europol convention has to be done away with and replaced, but by a protocol abolishing it rather than by creating the legal basis for even more surveillance.
Mr President, there is no reason to doubt the good democratic and legal policy aspects that are behind these reports and, in particular, the recommendation on the future development of Europol.
I would, however, question both the realism of the proposal and its political wisdom.
Since the proposal's ambitions cannot be realised on the basis of the existing treaties, those tabling the proposal have taken their arguments from the expectations of the European Convention, the aim of which is clearly - as has been said several times - to transfer these topics from the intergovernmental pillar 3 to supranational regulation.
A supranational Europol is nothing less than a federal police force.
It is both an objective of, and a means of establishing, a European federal state.
The logic behind Europol is a lesson in EU integration.
Random parts of the regulation that until now has been the responsibility of the national states are removed.
Nations are forced to lift national border controls.
Free movement opens up the borders to the best-functioning part of the internal market, namely cross-border crime.
Consequently, Europol is created.
In short: the federal state is built up by knocking down the national state.
Without, as mentioned previously, doubting the good intentions behind it, as a Scandinavian I am convinced that the rights of control that we have over our Danish police - and which are far from satisfactory - do however serve democracy and the rule of law far more securely than any supranational system.
The existing control arrangements with regard to data protection that it is proposed be continued are a parody of the rule of law.
As a Northerner, I say that we can do better ourselves, at least while we have not yet squandered the whole of our heritage in terms of legal culture.
The debate is closed.
The vote on the first two reports that we debated will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The vote on the report by Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher (A5-0116/2003) will, for technical reasons, take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0104/2003) by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Council Directive (14848/2002 - C5-0011/2003 - 2003/0801(CNS)) on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air.
Mr President, although what I have to say is not quite as exciting as what we have just discussed - at first sight, that is - I must say as a former UK immigration minister, that one of the most difficult processes in the immigration system arises when you have to remove a person who has gone through all the legal processes and no longer has a legal right to remain, or has not provided a legal reason to remain in a Member State and has to be returned to the place from whence they came.
This is of course a difficult decision for everybody involved in the handling of the matter: it is difficult for the officials, it is difficult for the Ministers themselves; but it has to be done in a way which is both humane and also effective.
Up to now there have been considerable problems in achieving this, where the travelling arrangements require assistance to be afforded by moving those particular persons by air and transiting them through other European countries on the way back to where they have to go.
Because of a lack of coordination or cooperation, it has often meant much more suffering for the people concerned; it has also meant that this operation has not always been carried out in a successful manner.
Therefore this German initiative, one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur, is aimed at trying to bring this matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion.
What we are really looking for here is that the persons concerned should be afforded the necessary support, if required, in terms of sustenance, in terms of medical assistance, should that be necessary when they transit through airports on their way to their destination.
But in particular, we need also to make sure that the airlines carrying them are aware of what they are carrying and the situation during the procedures.
That has not always been the case in the past, and this report should assist in achieving that end.
Similarly it is important that the documents sent with the persons concerned are treated in a proper manner during the process of transit.
That is not by any means the case at the present time.
This is something we also wish to see as a result of this work.
The difficulty has consistently been that it has always been someone else's responsibility to see that these matters occur in the proper way.
Officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this not only in Britain, but indeed in most of the EU Member States.
I know that this is a measure that will be greeted with considerable support and enthusiasm by those who will see that at last we are beginning to realise that we have to get together in order to achieve ends such as this.
This does not in any way affect the individual Member States' procedures, nor is it a measure which tries to be ambitious and look again at the whole issue of asylum procedures as such, or indeed asylum criteria.
That would indeed be ambitious, and it is not something that I aim to pursue.
It is purely a simple and very practical measure which will bring about the result which has to occur from time to time once the proper legal processes have been exhausted.
In conclusion, I am proud to be the rapporteur of this report because it is a clear demonstration that regardless of our political views on Europe and its future role, there are many areas like this where we can work together in a way which makes a practical difference to many people - both those who are dependent on our care and those who have to implement our rules and regulations.
For that reason, apart from any other, I am pleased with this report and I hope that it is supported in the House tomorrow.
Mr President, concerning the German initiative, the Commission stated in its communication, of 14 October 2002, on a common written policy on illegal residents, that there is a clear need for improvement of operational cooperation among Member States.
The Return Action Programme of the Council adopted on 28 November 2002, which is based on our communication, also calls for a comprehensive Community return policy, which should be gradually developed, starting with some practical steps for operational cooperation as the matter in hand.
In that framework, reference was also made to the German initiative for a Council directive on assistance in cases of transit for the purpose of return by air, which I support, as you do.
I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report.
Indeed, a common framework should be set for questions relating to transit during the return process.
The Commission has presented a proposal on burden-sharing of costs during the return operations.
But often it is necessary to use airports of other Member States, due to a lack of direct connections to the country of return.
In such cases it is important that we establish a clear legal framework for the transit procedures, especially as far as the use and competences of escorts in transit is concerned.
Nevertheless a fully-fledged common return policy must additionally strive for medium-term legislative measures which will not only smoothen cooperation among Member States, such as the binding mutual recognition of return decisions, but will also set certain common minimum standards on expulsion, detention and removal, to guarantee that all Member States - not only the 15 but all 25 - abide by and respect human and fundamental rights standards.
Consequently the Commission envisages presenting a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for return procedures and mutual recognition of return decisions by the end of this year.
We will of course be voting against this report which, in the guise of technical neutrality, seeks to organise deportations of so-called illegal immigrants.
The fact that the only elected European Union institution is justifying these expulsions and helping to organise them shows that it is worth no more from a human or social point of view than the national institutions, that is not very much.
On top of inhumanity comes hypocrisy, because no one can ignore the fact that industry, construction and industrial agriculture rely to a large extent on immigration, whether it be legal, illegal or seasonal.
Turning so-called illegal immigrants into fair game for the police means above all handing them over with their hands and feet tied to their employers: this reduces some workers to semi-slaves, it pushes down everyone's wages and it is part of the war being waged on the poor by all the governments of Europe.
I therefore protest against these expulsions and call for all those without papers to be given a proper legal status and the same civil and political rights as all workers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that has been proposed seeks to set out the measures that may be taken by the authorities to provide assistance for the purposes of the removal, with or without escorts, of third-country nationals.
This proposal is one of numerous initiatives seeking to combat unorthodox immigration.
If the European Union has to have a common immigration and asylum policy and has to provide itself with the means to manage migratory flows, this policy should respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are universally recognised and acknowledged by the Member States.
This is why we cannot support an approach which seeks to make the deportation of third-country nationals who do not have the right papers a populist tool at the service of a repressive policy on the reality of immigration.
Too many expulsions by air have ended in the death of human beings because of the way in which they have been treated.
Everyone remembers Semira Adamou, who suffocated in a plane in Belgium while being deported.
Last month, again, in France, two other immigrants who did not have the necessary papers died at the hands of the same violence.
Recently, on 3 March, France and Germany expelled a group of 54 Senegalese and Ivorians who had not been admitted to these countries, had had their asylum applications dismissed and had been kept in a waiting zone.
This sounds to me very much like forced and - at the very least - mass repatriation.
Were Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that was ratified at the Nice Summit, respected?
Furthermore, in the Ivorians' case they were sent back to a country where there is currently unrest and civil war. Were the procedures for applying for asylum that are guaranteed by the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees also respected?
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the principle of non-refoulement, that is recognised in asylum law, was fully respected.
The security-based approach that is being proposed to us today is entirely in keeping with the Union's practices, which, we have to admit, have not enabled the problem of illegal immigration to be resolved.
We urgently need to recognise that the myth of zero immigration and its corollary, the all-repressive approach, are a failure.
So far the Member States' repressive immigration policies have not caused a decline in illegal immigration.
Quite the opposite: they have reinforced it by breeding more immigrants without the proper papers and they have sent hundreds of thousands of people underground, people who are now in the grip of networks of exploitative criminals, traffickers in human beings and advocates of modern slavery.
This failure demands a thorough revision of the immigration and asylum policy.
This is a major and complex issue with a great deal at stake in the long term and our democracies have an important responsibility to assume for it.
In rejecting a Community policy so as to meet the national demands of the Member States, in putting the rights of migrants and their families at risk, thus handing them over to the violence of deportation, and in refusing to recognise the wealth that these citizens, whether legal or not, bring to the project of European integration, this proposal is based on a philosophy that runs counter to our conviction that Europe should be a place of openness and solidarity, and that is why the Group of the Greens rejects it.
We call on the Council to establish a genuine Community asylum and immigration policy that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We recommend a European campaign to legalise the situation of all those who do not have papers, who have ties in the host country and who reside there on a long-term basis.
We recommend putting an end to the injustice of people being punished twice and sometimes even three times because of the readmission agreements.
We urgently need to remedy the contradictory situation of people who can neither be deported nor given legal papers, by finally recognising the right to live in a family.
After the minimalist proposal for a directive on family reunification that we examined just now in this House, we can only imagine the kind of discrimination that the European Union intends to reserve for the most marginalised and weak in the future.
We are against these practices and assure you that we will remain vigilant and active in our efforts to ensure that all those who reside in Europe can be full citizens and enjoy equal rights.
Whatever their nationality or their administrative situation, these people should be treated with the dignity that all human beings deserve.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0053/2003) by Mr Bayona de Perogordo, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on an information and communication strategy for the European Union (2002/2205(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to warmly thank everyone present for taking part in this debate.
The report presented for debate is intended to be the European Parliament's response to the Commission's Communication of 2 July 2002 on an information and communication strategy for the European Union.
In order to briefly present the report I will point out that its main characteristic is that it makes information a condition of citizenship.
My hope is that, in the future, following the recognition of the legal personality of the European Union, this citizens' right will combine with the European Union's right to express itself, in what we could call the European Union's right to an image, the European Union's right to explain what it is and what it does, and the combination of these two rights provides a firm legal basis on which to create a genuine information and communication policy.
The report opts decisively for the consolidation of interinstitutionality in the three phases of the process, that is to say, in the production of messages within the Interinstitutional Information Group, in application, using for this purpose the representations of the Commission and the offices of the European Parliament, as well national, regional and local authorities and interinstitutionality, and also in the assessment both within the Interinstitutional Information Group and by means of an annual debate on the information and communication policy.
With regard to the conditions for information, I will simply comment on the analysis of the languages in which information is provided and the accessible style of language.
Languages should not just be the official languages, but also the co-official languages and all those languages by means of which the message can reach the citizens in the most direct manner, with the participation, of course, of local, regional, national and Community authorities, in accordance with the scope of their competences.
With regard to the content, I will focus on just two points.
On the one hand, the content should indicate the European Union's influence on the daily actions of the citizens, rejecting the European Union's frequent image as an arena for confrontation, with opposing interests on the part of the different Member States.
On the other hand, we should consolidate a permanent flow of basic information for the citizen.
It will be difficult for the citizens to become involved in the priorities which I am about to mention if they are not conversant with the fundamental and basic operation of the European Union.
With regard to the current priorities, those already included in the Prince programme are taken up, that is to say, enlargement, the future of Europe, the area of freedom, security and justice, the establishment of the euro and the role of the European Union in the world.
And attention is drawn to the imminence of the 2004 elections, which are of symbolic significance because this will be the first time that 25 countries will elect their direct representatives to this House.
The analysis of the report raises certain critical questions.
On the one hand, the question of the legal basis.
The time has not yet come to create a legal basis for the drawing up of the programmes, but the Convention and the future Intergovernmental Conference provide the opportunity to support the idea that the future Constitution should include - within the democratic life of the European Union - a reference to the citizens' right to information, so that they may be genuine citizens.
Secondly, I will refer to the issue of sectoral information, which - I am perfectly aware - as the representatives of the Commission have tried to demonstrate, is the exclusive responsibility of the Commission.
The truth is, however, that the European Union's image is either promoted or harmed directly as a result of the actions resulting from the various sectoral policies.
Coordination of the various sectoral policies, orienting sectoral policies towards a common objective - the development of the European Union - should be subject not to decision, of course, but at least to consideration, within the interinstitutional information body.
Thirdly, there is the issue of whether it is better to provide systemised, basic, pedagogical information, or whether we need the impact of spectacular campaigns which demand the attention of the citizen and for the fundamental elements to be expressed through them.
Finally, the national authorities act as a filter.
The citizens perceive Europe by means of their national authorities, for whom a success is something they have won from the rest of the Europeans and for whom harm is anything that they perceive as negative.
Partnership and integration amongst the Member States and the regional and local authorities is fundamental for this purpose.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following our communication of 2 July on an information and communication strategy for the European Union, the Commission is very pleased to note Parliament's support for this initiative, which is expressed in the report by Mr Bayona, whom I should like to congratulate.
Indeed, in view of the interinstitutional strategy that we wish to develop to bolster the European Union's image, it is particularly important for all of the institutions to support this initiative and participate in making our shared objective a reality.
Following the adoption of a particularly positive position by the Council of Ministers on 10 December and the first report of the European Parliament, which was drafted by Mr Andreasen, the Commission therefore welcomes Parliament's commitment to this cause and the specific proposals that Mr Bayona makes in his report, which combine technical expertise with an awareness of the political sensitivity of the subject.
I should like to respond to these under two headings.
I will speak first about the general objectives of this joint strategy and then about how it will be implemented.
We clearly cannot define and implement an information and communication strategy for the European Union without the support and active participation of the Council, but also and in particular the Member States.
This causes us to reflect for a moment, as Mr Bayona invites us to do, on the link between information and citizenship, in particular with a view to next year's elections.
For the Commission, the main objective of a proactive information and communication strategy has to be to improve the perception that the public has of the European Union: in essence, it should improve the public's awareness of the European dimension of their citizenship.
The Commission therefore takes good note of the rapporteur's proposal to have an explicit reference in the text of the Constitution, which is currently being drafted, to the need for an information and communication policy as a condition for the exercise of European citizenship.
The Commission also fully supports your proposal that information distributed by the Union should highlight common European values, namely democracy, pluralism, security, solidarity, equal opportunities, cohesion and so on. The objective is indeed, Mr Bayona, to show citizens the practical advantages in their daily lives of belonging to the Union.
With this in mind, as you yourself underline, the policy of distributing information in all of the Union's languages is something that we need to continue and build on further.
The visible expression of this citizenship should be active participation in the next European elections.
There is no doubt that this decisive milestone in the democratic life of the Union should be our shared objective.
It goes without saying that this alone provides ample justification for stepping up our interinstitutional cooperation.
But is not the best way to encourage the public to turn out to vote to provide objective educational information to help them better to understand the major issues at stake in the project of European integration?
That is why we have agreed on four major information themes for 2003 to 2004 after the big campaign on the euro: enlargement, the future of the Union, the area of freedom, security and justice and the role of Europe in the world.
Alongside other issues, in particular the social and economic agenda, these themes, especially enlargement and the future of the Union, are a priority concern today, particularly given that they are running on parallel timetables.
They are therefore the best vectors for raising awareness amongst national public opinion of the importance of the major milestone in 2004.
On this subject, I should like here to give full reassurance to the House.
The Commission will scrupulously respect the priorities adopted by the European Parliament at the vote on the budget and has no intention of modifying the balance - in terms of either the detail or the broader picture - of the Prince programme as adopted by the budgetary authority.
Nevertheless, allow me to point out - and I do so entirely objectively - as I have done several times previously, that the doubling of the appropriations allocated to the Prince programme that was approved by this House for the 2003 Budget, is obviously going to raise some serious practical problems when it comes to implementation.
The Commission would have appreciated being given advance warning of this state of affairs at a prior meeting with the competent authorities in Parliament, as befits the spirit of interinstitutional cooperation that should prevail in the running of the Prince programme.
As far as the practicalities of implementation are concerned, in response to the rapporteur's invitation requesting, with a view to the 2004 elections, an information campaign making particular use of television - it being understood that this campaign should be promoted and coordinated by the Commission - we have decided to launch a huge call for audiovisual proposals, which will cover both the theme of enlargement and that of the future of Europe.
This integrated approach, which befits the complementary nature of these two subjects, will have a significant and renewed leverage effect for the audiovisual sector in Europe.
The effect will be felt as much by the programme producers as by the audiovisual distributors and will enable us to reach the public more directly using their media of choice to find out more about the Union.
As you know, the role of the European Union is viewed much more favourably by third countries than from within the Member States themselves.
At our last meeting of the interinstitutional group, we thought it was essential to start working this year on information actions, targeted initially at opinion formers and the appropriate intermediary information providers, on the role of the Union in the world.
As the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy rightly stresses, rapid progress needs to be made on this dimension of our information and communication strategy.
This is all the more justified in the light of the seriousness of recent events.
At this stage, and with the Council's full agreement, it is proposed to adopt a three-pronged approach to this theme.
First, globalisation, which ties in with the Cancun meeting this autumn.
Secondly, the proximity policy, which will accrue renewed geostrategic importance after enlargement.
And finally, the common foreign and security policy and its initial work on defence policy.
As you are aware, in order to do this, the Commission has submitted a supplementary and amending budget.
From now on then the amount of work that is done on this new theme as of this year is in your hands.
Mr President, those in a few words are the Commission's main observations on Mr Bayona's excellent report.
As you will have noted, there is no doubt that our joint approach, the result of long interinstitutional experience, is bearing fruit.
But to be effective, it is vital for a majority of Member States to follow the example of the coordinated approach adopted by the institutions.
Only a structured partnership with the competent national authorities will enable us to exploit this strategy to its full potential, a strategy which is now co-owned by the institutions, and to ensure that it has maximum impact at regional and even at local level, in the general interests of the Union and for the benefit of all of its people.
Mr President, it is true that public opinion is bombarded nowadays with a plethora of news, messages and information, thanks to the multiplicity of means of communication and easy access to them.
So you would expect, under these conditions of global knowledge, information and communication, that every citizen would be given the chance to obtain a tangible picture of reality.
And yet, the result is increasingly intense confusion of public opinion, with all that implies, by which I mean a warped or distorted image of reality, an uncritical rejection or acceptance of facts, information, advice, perceptions and opinions and, hence, the opportunity for leading people by the hand.
These are all consequences that cannot be combated, as we know from experience, with individual information programmes and strategies.
The information given to the citizens of the European Union should therefore be objective and free from the influence of political or other authorities.
Citizens must be told about European stands and policies, especially as regards important issues such as foreign affairs and issues relating to the security and defence of the European Union.
Special attention must be paid to issues such as political legitimacy, democratic control and transparency in decision making.
In addition, information must be clear and documented. This means that the mass media need to report not what they consider to be essential reporting, but any decision taken on matters of importance to the Member States.
This will give all the citizens of the European Union a clearer understanding of the decisions taken by its institutions, which are often wrongly presented, with the result that impressions are created that have absolutely nothing to do with reality.
Top priority issues, such as enlargement, the links between European policies and daily life and the problems of European citizens, especially following the accession of new countries to the European Union, which is expected to bring about considerable changes in European agricultural, budgetary and financial policy, need to be the subject of full, substantiated information.
There is a serious problem in the regions, where information is either limited or totally lacking.
In these areas, closer and more fundamental cooperation is needed with local agencies in each Member State, so that information is accessible to everyone.
More immediate and more objective information could be achieved with live coverage of important events, such as decision making in plenary sittings and at committee meetings, for example in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on television channels or, in order to avoid high costs, on the Internet.
Proper, objective information for citizens is a necessity.
Proper information for European citizens is also an appropriate and necessary condition for extending European integration and strengthening its role in the world.
Consequently, efforts and initiatives need to be stepped up and systematised, given the deficit in this sector, and citizens need full, documented, clear, accessible information.
The report we are debating today is the very substance of the issue of information and policy on this strategy of communication with the citizens of the European Union and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Bayona, on his excellent work.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, my friend and colleague, Juan JosÃ© Bayona, on his work and his good ideas in this report, and also the Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, on his initiative.
When we talk about Europe, it reminds me a bit of school, where we always said 'I have passed' or 'they have failed me'.
Here, when something goes well, it is the country or region that claims all the credit, but when something goes badly, or there is a disaster, Europe is usually blamed.
When they say, 'it is Europe's fault', the citizens do not even know which institution they are referring to, because in reality they do not know them, and they cannot distinguish between them.
We must acknowledge that we have not made it at all easy for them.
There may be languages in which it is not so difficult, but in Spanish we have the ComisiÃ³n Europea [European Commission] and the comisiones [committees] of Parliament, the Consejo de Europa [Council of Europe] and the Consejo Europeo [European Council].
We know that they are completely different things, but the public in general does not know, and we must acknowledge that these coincidences or similarities are very unfortunate.
That is why I believe that this report on the European Union's information strategies and subsequent implementation of the programmes are so important and vital to the citizens of the Union.
Please allow me now to relate this issue to my field; the field of sport.
We must not forget that sport is a great instrument for communication and has a genuinely important multiplying effect.
If we in this Parliament support the inclusion of an article referring to sport in the new Treaties of the European Union, we may have sport programmes which have a great impact, and this would benefit all of us.
Furthermore, if we bear in mind that the essential thing is to educate and inform young people, who will be the real protagonists of the European Union within a few years and who will be its future, and that it is they who sporting information can mostly reach, we would truly be completing a circle which would be of the greatest interest and benefit in terms of the image of all the institutions of the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to protest at the absurd nocturnal and almost clandestine hour allocated to a debate which should be one of the most important debates of the year.
Mr President, we are dealing with a great report, which is timely and of a high quality, on which my fellow Member, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, deserves the congratulations of the Socialist Group, and I am very happy to express them.
In the Andreasen report this Parliament has already defined, together with the Commission, an information strategy intended to reach all the citizens.
However, despite the fact that we are in the middle of the process of creating a Constitution, opinion polls are still indicating a certain lack of interest in European construction.
We could sum up the situation by saying, like Marianne Thyssen, 'Europe has been created, now let us create the Europeans'.
To this end, the information flowing from our institutions must not be neutral, we must create feelings of citizenship and of belonging to Europe in every European.
We Europeans have an historic duty: we can and we must identify with each other and this must be accompanied, promoted or even provoked, if necessary, by the European institutions.
In contrast with what happens in the individual countries, European construction is not the result of feelings, but of reasons. It is not driven by peoples, but by political, economic or media elites.
Many things are still lacking, including a European civil society, in other words, a system of intermediary organisations, which are relatively independent from the States and from the market, which are able to gather information, to deliberate, to make decisions and to act in a joint and cross-border manner.
The priority tasks for the Commission, for the European media and for opinion-formers in general - including us in this Parliament - must be empowering the European political area, the development of a European image and identity, strengthening - as the Commissioner has said - a core of common values, the debate on the future of Europe and the European approach in all types of information.
In summary, the task must not be to restate the identity of Europe over and over again, but to seek, define and consolidate the bases on which the Europeans can identify with each other.
Mr President, the approval of this report and the fact that Commissioner Vitorino has been charged with implementing these policies, are, in my view, significant reasons for us to be hopeful.
Mr President, I share your and Mr Aparicio SÃ¡nchez's concerns regarding the fact that we are discussing such a fundamental proposal so late.
I would also like to thank Mr Bayona de Perogordo and congratulate him on the report on which we are now finally adopting a position.
It is a comprehensive report, and I know from experience that the work involved in such a report is fairly demanding.
The report takes us a good step closer to our goal of a comprehensive coordinated and decentralised information and communication policy, or in Commissioner Vitorino's words in the 'Friends of Europe' debate: 'the fight against apathy and ignorance regarding the EU'.
I would also like to thank you, Commissioner Vitorino, for your great commitment to this issue.
I would also express my regret at the form of debate that we are having here in Parliament, since it excludes you from being able to answer questions here and now.
Although we have made some great progress, many questions remain unanswered, and I will mention some of them and will happily send them to you as well, for it is important that we do not rest on our laurels in the information and communication strategy at a time when so much is at stake concerning enlargement and the future of the EU and when we are also coming up to elections to the European Parliament.
That is why I ask: how far has the feasibility study got and the opportunities for a European 'C-SPAN' that the Commission is to implement?
How far have we progressed in the work on the 'Channel Europe' concept?
How far have we got with establishing a common visitor centre for the institutions in Brussels?
How far have we got with calculations and costs for the initiatives proposed previously?
How far have we got in our efforts to get the information offices of the Commission and of Parliament under the same roof in the capitals?
I know that nothing has happened in Copenhagen.
Allow me finally to ask the Presidency of Parliament: would it not be an idea, Mr President, for us to hold a debate in plenary on Parliament's role in the information strategy up until the 2004 elections?
Mr President, the results of Europe-wide surveys clearly show that the European public are distancing themselves more and more from the Community ideal, and one substantial reason for that may well be the way in which many EU citizens have been given false information over recent years.
For example, 43% of Europeans continue to believe that a work permit is required if they want to work in any other Member State.
It is regrettable that the advantages offered by the EU are not always recognised as they should be.
It is clearly evident from this, and also from many other examples, that the EU's existing information and communication policy is not working.
Negative public opinion is of course reinforced by the EU's inability to get a grip on corruption, and by its failure to effectively dismantle the bureaucratic apparatus - I am thinking, for example, of the way our Parliament meets in two places.
We should be a better state that what the public has at home.
We have to take urgent action, by which I mean that the EU has to take a position on the things that have gone wrong, do away with them and put together an additional package of measures.
For example, the EU could be introduced in schools as a specific subject, and pupils could be offered more opportunities to inform themselves locally about what is going on in the EU.
Such measures would be a step in the right direction, so that negative preconceptions about the EU could be eroded and public support for the Community ideal would be restored.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the eve of the European Union's greatest political project - the overcoming of Europe's enforced division into two parts.
Tomorrow, we will be deciding on the enlargement of the European Union by the addition of ten new Member States.
Despite this success for the European Union, the Eurobarometer published in March 2002 clearly shows that fewer than one-third of the members of the public questioned regarded themselves as well informed about the European Union.
Most indicators confirm that a large section of the population - 50% - is completely ignorant of the European Union or indifferent towards it.
Voter turnout has fallen from 63% in 1979 to 49% in 1999.
There is something not quite right here.
I believe one of our main problems to be the fact that we speak of the European Union as a distant structure.
That also came across from what Mr Ilgenfritz said.
The European Union is made up of all of us!
I do believe that the main cause of our problem is the mental and emotional distance between people, wherever they live, and the European institutions.
The political will to make European policy into internal policy is lacking.
The political will to reduce the distance between Europe's citizens and its institutions is absent - not from the European institutions, but from the Member States.
Does, for example, every government state that there is no EU competence without the Member States' consent?
Are people in the Member States told about how no directive can be enacted without the Member States' consent?
Is it being stated openly that enlargement of the European Union cannot go ahead without the European Parliament, the Heads of State and of Government, the Member States and the candidate countries agreeing to it?
No: whenever there is any doubt, people are told, 'Brussels is doing it to us!'
The public do not know about the shared responsibility of the Member States for all European decisions, because this is not lived and communicated.
Let me end by asking whether the regional parliaments are performing their task of exercising parliamentary control over their representatives in the Committee of the Regions.
No, they are not!
Are the national parliaments performing their task of exercising parliamentary control over what the Council does?
No, they are not!
Is the European Parliament adequately discharging its duties in exercising parliamentary control over the Commission and in working on legislation?
Not satisfactorily so!
If we do not fully perform our parliamentary functions at regional, national and European level, the connections between them and the interlinked decision-making mechanism cannot be presented in a transparent way.
The best public information campaign is of no use if the public are not aware that they, through their governments, have a part in every decision.
Mr President, Commissioners, although we say that we live in an information society, information in itself is a problem for us, one to which the Commission's communication strategy is now seeking solutions.
It had better do so too, because the Union is aiming to become the world's leading knowledge-based society within seven years.
I do not believe it will.
Why not?
Because the Member States are not implementing the jointly agreed decisions under the Lisbon strategy.
So the Commission is worried about the indifference of our citizens to the Union and information about it, as fewer than half of them go out and vote.
Has not the same thing happened, however, with regard to the Member States themselves, which are so indifferent that they are not implementing the Lisbon process?
Moreover, the information-based economy is an issue connected with that very thing, information.
We have to remember that information is only raw material, knowledge is its product, and civilisation is its end result.
Our objectives are good ones, but the media and the people are not very interested in them.
We might say that brains that have been softened over the years by soap operas and television action series are our opponent in this.
Could you not imagine making an action film about the European Union?
That way we would get the audience we will not reach otherwise.
Euronews is a good objective.
Other important matters include ties with everyday life, and, of course, the visitors service.
The Secretary-General, for example, cancelled the Finnish language post and now there is no visitors' service in Finnish.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on his initiative, although I know that his hands are tied as a result of a lack of budget and because it is not so easy to introduce anything new in the European Union.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Bayona de Perogordo because he has listened, he has taken account of many opinions and, in fact, the final document is a document of consensus, enriched by Parliament, which has many new figures and many new initiatives, and I believe that that is the way to work in terms of institutional cooperation.
I believe we still have to take a further step, because the model in force, with the offices and the current system for disseminating parliamentary policy, is essentially a bureaucratic model. I believe we must change to a model of open and direct communication.
Another point which I believe to be extremely important, and which I believe must also be revised, and in relation to which this document introduces a very clear request, is the issue of languages.
Parliament's reform policy on languages reduces the equality between them, it creates differences between some languages and others, and, in particular, in terms of translation, there is a difference between the dates for the delivery of documents.
What does this mean?
That in terms of communication, we are moving backwards, because some citizens will receive the information first and others later.
And given the speed of many processes, there will be some citizens who do not receive the documents in their language and will hardly have the opportunity to present amendments on time.
I therefore believe that the guarantee of the maintenance of languages is an essential point, particularly in view of the fact that the new technologies allow for much more direct dissemination.
I therefore support an improvement in terms of the issue of interpreting.
Another issue in this document which I believe to be essential, and which must be taken into account, is something which a previous speaker mentioned: there can be no communication without participation.
And in view of the new technologies and the current capacity for communication, the citizens will not feel connected with these institutions unless they can participate in dialogue.
And I believe that Parliament and the Commission must establish communication departments which, as in the case of other national parliaments, allow for an open system by means of which there can be access to what we are doing from any place and in any language.
The new technologies make this effort and this investment possible.
And I am surprised that, in the reform, including of buildings, there has been no intention to broaden languages and communication, but rather a reductionist spirit has prevailed.
I would therefore call for equality between all citizens to be respected and for the reform of communication to be dealt with from a more modern point of view.
Mr President, like everybody else in the House I am concerned about the low turnout in European elections, but that is not a phenomenon that is confined to the European Parliament; it is a phenomenon that national parliaments face too.
It is not to do with apathy either, strictly speaking: in the past month or so we all have seen millions of people exercising their concern about an issue that directly affected them - not necessarily in a personal way, but in a broader international way - and making their voices very clear in relation to the issue of war and peace.
So it is not that people are disconnected from concerns about the world, but they certainly do not necessarily see any relevance in being asked to vote for the European Parliament, or indeed in some cases for national parliaments.
That is a failure on the part of our institutions and it is a failure on our own part as politicians.
I have made a proposal in the European Convention that we should bring Europe home by having a coordinated European Week in each of the national parliaments, where we would invite a Commissioner to a national parliament to present the annual legislative programme; where the MEPs from a particular Member State would be present in the Parliament; where you would generate some national interest in what the European Union is doing, and what the European Parliament proposes to do in terms of scrutinising the Commission and the Council for the following year.
It is a fairly simple idea, but it one which would, in my view, generate a lot of interest amongst the citizens of Europe.
I would urge the Commissioner to take it on board as a proposal.
It does not require a constitutional amendment, but it would be useful to have it incorporated into the protocol relating to national parliaments which we are currently debating in the Convention.
Mr President, I want to add my congratulations to Mr Bayona de Perogordo and to thank Commissioner Vitorino for the attention they are drawing to the need for information.
Are we mad to be here at this time of night debating this issue?
Really, it is the people who are not here who need to understand the importance of explaining what the European Union does.
