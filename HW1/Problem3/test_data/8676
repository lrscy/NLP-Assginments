Conservation is not something that can be imposed by the international community, and we should not want that to be the case.
There are, therefore, good reasons not to transfer the African elephant to Appendix I tomorrow. However there are also good reasons to do so, and that is sending a political signal.
The signal that the European Parliament takes the protection of biodiversity seriously. That the European Parliament is now committing to going all out to preserve biodiversity within the European Union.
To summarise, I can reluctantly approve the resolution, but, as far as I am concerned, it must incorporate a political pledge - the pledge that we ourselves will also do something about biodiversity.
That we must try to find a solution that will also work for the African peoples.
I would also like to speak about the elephants.
Five countries in southern Africa want to sell their stocks of ivory.
That would be very wrong.
The previous CITES conferences took the decision to stop protecting the elephant.
Unfortunately that was approved by the Commission with the majority of the fifteen EU governments, but against the wishes of the European Parliament.
This has proved disastrous.
Illegal elephant poaching is now taking place on a much bigger scale, also in southern Africa.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes unanimously to give elephants full protection once more.
The Commission must abandon its cowardly, half-hearted position.
MIKE (monitoring of illegal killing of elephants) does not work.
Let us use European money - EUR 10 to 15 million would be enough - to buy up and destroy southern Africa's ivory stocks, and if the majority of the European governments will not agree to that, then the NGOs will have to collect enough money to stop all the elephants being sold off.
There are only 10 000 elephants left in Asia and 300 000 in Africa.
Twenty years ago, in 1981, there were as many as 1 500 000.
Whoever maintains that elephants are in a strong position is mistaken.
I do not approve of the culling of elephants; it is uncivilised.
I am curious to see who will vote for culling tomorrow.
Mr President, I do not think that any of us here are contesting whether or not there should be an ivory trade: of course there should not.
But that has nothing to do with the fact that southern African elephants should not be moved back into Appendix I.
I do not know whether you have seen the letter we received this week from the European Sustainable Use specialist group.
It reminds us that such a decision would be directly contrary to the scientific advice given to the parties by IUCN, who are the official advisers to the CITES conference on species listing proposals.
This advice points out that the elephant populations of the southern African countries mentioned do not meet the criteria for Appendix I, but meet the criteria for Appendix II.
So, scientifically we have absolutely no reason to move them.
Nor should we if we want to maintain the populations because it is quite clear that the use of wild living resources, if they are sustainable - and they are in southern Africa - is an important conservation tool.
The social and economic benefits derived from such use provide incentives for people to conserve them.
As it is, if we were to take them back into Appendix I, it would send the wrong signal to those countries that have a small elephant population.
It would say to them that if they try to invest money in preserving their elephants, they will not get back any revenue.
So they will pay out for the elephants, instead of paying for schools or hospitals.
What kind of incentive to preserve elephants does that give to countries with small elephant populations?
It is a pity that more of you were not at the presentation by the Minister of Wildlife and Tourism of Botswana.
She said that they loved their elephants.
They want to preserve them and the way they can best do this is to keep them in Appendix II.
Mr President, I am going to comment on paragraph 3 of this motion for a resolution and, specifically, on the species with the scientific name of Dissostichus, which is known as the Patagonian or Antarctic toothfish.
The Dissostichus is of great commercial value (it is known as 'black gold') and its balance is very delicate.
The Committee on Fisheries, of which I am a member, has produced three reports on this resource and I am rapporteur for the one which relates to the creation of a system for documenting catches.
Today I would like to argue to the House that it should not be included on the CITES list, for the following reasons: we cannot forget that there is already an international organisation - the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which from now on I will refer to by its initials, CAMELAR - which, for twenty years, has been successfully dealing with the preservation of this and other species in the Antarctic Ocean.
The Community is a contracting party to this Convention.
The proposal to include Dissostichus in the CITES Convention did not come from us but from Australia.
Neither we nor - as far as I know - the Commission oppose this; we simply believe that it would be more useful for CAMELAR itself to take this decision at its annual assembly, which is taking place this week and next week in Chile, and in which the European Parliament will be represented by Mr Stevenson, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
Following tough negotiations, CAMELAR has now incorporated Canada and Mauritius with the status of associate members.
Together with the United States, Canada is the main commercial destination of the species Dissostichus and Mauritius, a significant place of transit.
Their entry into CAMELAR gives this international organisation control of 98% of the world trade in Dissostichus.
For us, CITES would be useful as a complement to CAMELAR.
But we must be cautious, because - if our decision-making moves faster than the natural course of events - we could unintentionally cause unwanted contrary effects, weakening an organisation that, during its long life, has done a great amount of good work with regard to the Antarctic marine environment, which is extremely delicate.
We must concentrate our efforts, not disperse them, and we must increase our presence in multilateral fisheries organisations, which is the only way to respond to the challenges that the preservation of fish species confront us with on a world scale.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you - and also my fellow Members - have already said, the issue of elephants will once again be discussed at the forthcoming CITES meeting.
If we move elephants back into Appendix I, at the request of India and Kenya, will this be enough to prevent these animals from tragically becoming extinct in some countries of Africa, even though their numbers are on the increase in other countries?
Opinions are divided.
The MIKE system that has been set up, which is highly sophisticated, has not yet provided, and will not provide, according to a number of specialists, a satisfactory answer.
It has, in fact, absorbed a substantial amount of funding which could have been put to better use, had it, for example, been spent on ways to combat poaching or on the training of keepers.
Elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitat has been considerably altered and reduced.
Even if their use is authorised, whatever the precise and restrictive framework that might be decided upon, there is a danger that poaching will once again become widespread and that this, in the long term, will led to elephants becoming extinct in some countries of Africa.
The European Union must therefore very firmly reject any unlawful resumption of the trade in ivory.
At the same time, what lesson could we have to give the local populations who would levy a reasonable tax on their fauna, when we ourselves, in France for example, are incapable of providing adequate conditions for the survival of bears in the Pyrenees or rare wolves in the Alps?
By way of comparison, we welcome the gesture made by Cuba, which has withdrawn its request for the use of turtles and, in parallel, the European Union has a duty to reject the request, submitted by the Cayman Islands to breed green turtles in captivity, which could facilitate the illegal trade in these animals.
The desire and the need to safeguard biodiversity on the planet requires the adoption of tough and proactive decisions which must not allow any loophole for traffickers of any kind, whilst enabling the local populations to use their natural resources, including fauna, in a sustainable manner, even if this may sometimes be akin to attempting the impossible.
Mr President, I would like to conclude with two short remarks on elephants and toothfish.
First, I would like to reassure you that the Commission remains opposed to any measures that could increase the illegal killing of elephants.
I have already stated that we are opposed to the resumption of the commercial ivory trade until it can be demonstrated that this will not lead to an increase in poaching.
At the same time, I acknowledge the excellent record of a number of southern African countries in managing their elephant populations.
It is easy to understand why these countries sometimes feel they are penalised rather than rewarded for their efforts.
If their concerns are not addressed, there is a real risk that these countries will be unable to maintain popular support for elephant conservation or for CITES in general.
We should avoid measures such as the proposed stricter classification for elephants in CITES which will only serve to polarise the debate, without achieving any real additional protection for these animals.
On toothfish, we must respect the competence of CAMLAR and other fisheries organisations, at the same time taking a constructive approach to any proposals that might achieve better protection for commercial fish species.
Accordingly, if CITES listing can strengthen and complement CAMLAR's current management of toothfish you may rest assured that it will have my support and that of the Commission.
To conclude the debate on this statement I have received a motion for a resolution B5-0527/2002, pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on two reports by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy:
(A5-0291/2002), on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals (COM(2001) 803 - C5-0320/2002 - 2002/0026(CNS)),
(A5-0290/2002), on the proposal for a Council decision approving, on behalf of the European Community, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (COM(2001) 802 - C5-0095/2002 - 2002/0030(CNS)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you two Commission proposals concerning the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade.
One is a decision to ratify this Convention on behalf of the European Community; the other the regulation required in order to implement the Convention in the Community.
The decision on ratification hardly needs further elaboration.
The Commission proposal for an implementing regulation reflects the position of both the Commission and the Member States: that the provisions should go beyond purely incorporating the Convention, which was the result of a compromise between all of the parties to the negotiations.
The Community called for stricter provisions in certain respects but did not manage to push them through.
The Commission considers that the proposals are well balanced and that they will contribute to the achievement of the Community's objective of improving the protection of human health and the environment in importing countries - especially developing countries - from hazardous chemicals, without preventing the smooth application of the Convention.
The Commission is grateful for the support the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has given to the proposals.
It wants the Community to ratify the Convention early on, in accordance with the spirit of the conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit.
The Commission hopes, therefore, that agreement can be reached as soon as possible on the implementing regulation, which it considers to be a prerequisite for the work on ratification to continue.
In this connection, the Commission wishes to stress the efforts of the Council and Parliament in making progress with the work on the proposals, above all, the compromises reached as the basis for a possible agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading of the proposal for an implementing regulation.
By way of conclusion, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, something which I should have said right at the start.
. (NL) Mr President, I do not often get 10 minutes of speaking time but I hope I will not need it all.
We have before us two reports regarding the import and export of chemical products.
The first report supports the approval of the Treaty of Rotterdam in respect of specific hazardous chemical products and pesticides in international trade.
I propose that we do this as quickly as possible, given that the Treaty can enter into force from the moment that it has been ratified by sufficient parties.
The report concentrates mainly on the following three points:
First of all, parties to the Treaty can only export chemicals included in the Appendix to another party to the Treaty if they have obtained prior approval from the importing country.
This is called the PIC procedure - Prior Informed Consent.
Secondly, new products may be added to the Appendix to which the PIC procedure applies.
Thirdly, a party exporting prohibited or strictly regulated chemical products must provide information to the importing party.
Moreover, all products listed in the Appendix to which the PIC procedure applies, must be labelled.
These matters have already been more or less laid down in a regulation dating back to 1992.
The chemical industry also began to implement the Treaty of Rotterdam voluntarily in April of this year.
There is therefore no longer any reason to delay the ratification of this Treaty any longer.
The second report aims to implement the Treaty of Rotterdam through a regulation. This regulation goes further than the Treaty of Rotterdam on a number of points.
It is somewhat stricter, more precise and broader, and this can be seen as an improvement to the legislation.
More has also been done in respect of providing information to third countries, especially developing countries.
A more difficult issue is that in the original proposal by the Commission, the Commission itself wanted to impose a monopoly on the procedures.
This is not sensible, as Member States do not all have the same legislation with regard to chemical products.
I am referring particularly to pesticides and biocides.
As you know, it will take another five to ten years before we have Community legislation on this area.
It is also possible that, even after this period, Member States will make use of exceptional provisions.
It is therefore a good idea to leave some leeway for the Member States in this regulation.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted 15 amendments.
The legal basis for the regulation has been amended from the internal market to the environment. This means codecision for the European Parliament.
More freedom has also been created for the individual Member States, meaning that individual Member States can pass more far-reaching measures.
This will be evident from the fact that individual Member States may also make proposals with regard to adding new products to the list to which prior informed consent applies, as there is still a group of products for which there is still no harmonised European legislation, such as pesticides.
Another improvement is that the lists of hazardous products will only have to be updated each year at the most.
It is very important that persistent organic products are added to this regulation.
The arrangements made as part of the Treaty of Stockholm are included in the list of prohibited products.
As it seems that the Council had a similar vision to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as rapporteur I have tried to complete the legislative process at first reading.
For this purpose I was given the mandate by the parliamentary groups.
The talks on this area were most satisfactory.
The Council adopted most of the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Council's mostly technical adjustments were easy to incorporate.
This led to 42 new amendments, which were signed by most of the groups.
The Council sent a letter which promised that if the European Parliament accepted the total package of compromises, the Council would lay down the common position accordingly.
This means that we could complete matters by the end of the first reading, saving a considerable amount of time - at least a year.
I am really pleased to hear from Mrs WallstrÃ¶m that the European Commission is also able to endorse the measures wholeheartedly.
I would like to request that special attention be paid to Amendment No 22.
With regard to the scope, it has been agreed with the Council that the rules will in any case apply to amounts exceeding 10 kg.
This will be very sensible in practice for feasibility and control purposes.
This is also part of the whole package of measures.
Mr President, the package of compromises before you is a very satisfactory result that I can heartily recommend to Parliament.
The voting slip comprises 4 blocks.
Block 1 covers the compromise amendments with the Council.
If block 1 is adopted, block 2 will no longer apply.
Block 3 comprises the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy which were approved by the Council, so we must vote in favour of these.
Finally block 4 comprises 3 amendments which must be rejected by Parliament, based on the total compromise.
Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Danish Presidency for their proper, constructive cooperation.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with two proposals: a proposal for a Council Decision and a proposal for a Council Regulation on the trade, export and import of dangerous chemicals.
The proposal for a Decision requests ratification as soon as possible of the Rotterdam Convention, whose main objective is to regulate the international trade in hazardous chemicals, but also, and this is what we believe in Parliament, to protect human health and the environment, and it is important that this be done now.
We have therefore asked that the legal basis be changed from Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which regulates commercial trade, to Article 175, in accordance with codecision.
The proposal for a Regulation, which is exhaustive and very strict, lays down very strict rules for intra-Community trade in pesticides.
What we are asking for is a degree of flexibility.
As Mr Blokland has already said, we have reached an important agreement after many discussions amongst all the political groups, so that, after the change in the legal basis, this package of amendments can be ratified and accepted both by the Commission and by the Council, and so that Parliament's position can end at first reading and we can reach a conclusion which we all agree on.
Not all regulations - as Mr Blokland also said - relating to pesticides are equivalent in all countries, and the Commissioner is perfectly aware that they will be unified, but not before the minimum time limit of between 5 and 10 years.
The regulation on pesticides and the analyses for approval are very delayed, since of the over eight hundred active areas to be regulated, not even one hundred have been analysed.
We can therefore assume that this issue will be delayed.
The Regulation we are going to approve, on the prior informed consent procedure, is important because it gives the receiver prior information on what the sender is going to send.
This is not only valid for the Member States of the European Union but also for non-Member countries, to which we must apply the same requirements.
I would ask the Members of Parliament to support the report as it stands, with the voting list proposed by Mr Blokland, whom I warmly congratulate, since he has done great work on an issue which is very controversial and difficult and highly scientific.
Mr President, there is not a lot more which needs to be said, because most of it has been said by Mr Blokland.
I would like to start by agreeing with the last speaker.
This is a good report and the rapporteurs have worked really hard on it.
A first-reading agreement, though it is not absolutely certain yet, is what we would like to see.
We think that by and large the amendments are sensible additions to the text.
We are a little concerned about the proposals on Member States including chemicals in the PIC procedure and think that everyone should be properly consulted if that is going to happen.
We need this measure without delay.
It will help to improve our public health and environmental protection, both inside and outside the European Union.
We are anxious to go through with it and we will be supporting the vast majority of the amendments and following the rapporteur tomorrow.
We would like to see a solution as quickly as possible.
We need more international agreements like this and we need speed.
Many pieces of chemical legislation have taken too long to be properly implemented in the past.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am tremendously pleased that we have reached this compromise, which means that we will now also be able to arrive at a compromise with the Council at first reading.
I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, the Danish Presidency and the Commission for making a real effort to arrive at a solution which is satisfactory and acceptable for us all, even if not all of our amendments have been adopted.
The intentions of the Rotterdam Convention are important, and it is also important that it be ratified as quickly as possible, because it concerns the trade in extremely hazardous chemicals.
I also think that it can be said that the Commission did an excellent job in presenting this proposal for a regulation, which is to replace the present legislation on hazardous chemicals and pesticides with the rules of the Rotterdam Convention.
The proposal actually goes beyond the Convention, for example in proposing that the export notification procedure, too, must be extended to cover articles containing so-called 'unreacted' forms of chemicals and that the export of certain chemicals must be banned outright.
I am extremely pleased with the proposal, therefore.
The aim of this whole exercise and of the Convention is to improve the control of the trade in hazardous chemicals and to place joint and increased responsibility on importing and exporting countries.
It is about protecting human health and the environment.
For this reason, I also believe that it is reasonable and fair that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with the help of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has changed the legal basis from Article 133 to Article 175, which means that the European Parliament has codecision powers and, at the same time, enables the Member States to have stricter rules.
I really hope, therefore, that we obtain a large majority, perhaps unanimity, in favour of this report tomorrow.
I believe that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves.
Mr President, the legislative proposals under the Rotterdam Convention being discussed are an important step towards ensuring the protection of human health and the environment in all countries from the possible dangers resulting from trade in hazardous chemicals and pesticides.
Our rapporteur, Mr Blokland, has, as always, done a precise and excellent job, for which he deserves our thanks.
The Convention has the objective of increasing shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among parties to the agreement in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals, thus promoting environmental and health protection.
At the same time the intention is to encourage the environmentally sound use of chemicals with increased transparency and information exchange.
All these are aims worthy of support from the point of view of the EU's targets, but some of the provisions now being discussed go even further than the Rotterdam Convention.
For example, the rules relating to the timing and frequency of export notifications and the level of information required are clearly more advanced than the rulings of the Convention.
That is how I think it ought to be too.
Parties to international agreements on the environment are countries at different levels in terms of commitment and the levels agreed in the Convention do not necessarily go far enough at all with regard to the EU's targets.
For that reason, agreements on the environment in my view should always be implemented to a more ambitious degree in the EU than they would require in themselves.
Only then would we achieve a dynamic that would help steer the negative development that we are seeing in the areas of the environment and human health in a healthier direction.
The rapporteur's suggestion that this proposal for a regulation should take into account the Stockholm Convention concerning POPs concluded in May last year should be supported.
The objective of the proposal for a regulation is the protection of the environment and human health.
That is also the main goal of the Rotterdam Convention.
That is why the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, has arrived at the absolutely correct conclusion when he proposes that Article 133 of the Treaty that relates to common commercial policy should be replaced with Article 175 as a more suitable legal basis for the proposals.
The legislative proposals thus also clearly come under the codecision procedure.
Mr President, I shall make short comments on some of the amendments tabled for the vote tomorrow.
Most relate to the draft implementing regulation.
Firstly on the legal base, as the Commission has already made clear in the Council, it believes that Article 133 - not Article 175(1) - is the correct legal base.
The Commission has to reserve its right to make use of the legal means at its disposal.
Given our position on the legal base, the Commission cannot accept that national regulatory actions taken by Member States should only fall within the scope of the regulation and be subject to the procedures for export notification and PIC notification.
It follows that the Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 20, 26, 33 and 34.
On the other hand, the Commission recognises that Community import responses for PIC chemicals should, additionally, give us as complete a picture as possible.
The Commission can therefore accept Amendments 11 and 18.
On the Commission's role as regards Community participation in the Convention, given its position on the legal base, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 28.
Article 14 of the Commission proposals provides for the possibility of an export ban for certain chemicals to be listed in Annex V. The Commission knows the wish of Parliament and the Council to add the chemicals subject to the POPs Convention to Annex V, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant annexes to that convention.
However, the Commission can accept Amendment 56, as drafted, together with the associated Amendments 41 to 46, 48, 50 and 53.
The remaining amendments are technical, mainly aimed at giving greater precision to certain provisions.
The Commission can accept all these amendments.
I now turn to the draft ratification decision.
Three amendments have been tabled and, for the reasons I have already explained, the Commission cannot accept the change of legal base proposed in Amendment 1, nor can it accept Amendment 3 that stems from it.
Finally, the Commission can accept Amendment 2 which reintroduces the principle of a key Commission role in the Community's participation in the different bodies implementing the convention.
I shall hand over a summary of the Commission position on oral statements, if that is acceptable to you.
Finally, once again I thank Mr Blokland for his hard work on a constructive and valuable report.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-320/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a Community programme to improve the operation of taxation systems in the internal market (Fiscalis 2003-2007 programme) (10612/2/2002 - C5-0383/2002 - 2002/0015(COD)).
The rapporteur, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, has the floor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Common Position we are discussing at the moment has a short but intense history.
In 1998, this Parliament and the Council approved a programme designed to improve the operation of taxation systems within the internal market.
Just one year ago, in 2001, an assessment was made of the three first years of operation of this system.
I am happy to say that the development was satisfactory, and also that this programme was, in itself, subject to that assessment.
This year we have been presented with a Commission proposal to extend the programme - which will expire on New Year's Eve of this year - for a further five years, in other words, until 2007.
I believe there are two innovative elements to the programme which is going to be in force for the next five years (Fiscalis 2007) in comparison with the previous one: it is being extended to include direct taxation - which is good news - and to include the needs of the candidate countries, which is even better news.
I believe that the Fiscalis 2007 programme which we are now studying has three broad objectives. Firstly, it is proposed that the taxation systems of the Member States should function properly; secondly, that better operation should be achieved by means of cooperation between the tax administrations responsible for applying it, and thirdly, that the better operation resulting from cooperation should serve to eradicate fraud.
With regard to the first idea, that is, that the taxation systems should function properly, with this programme it is not a question of taking a step further in terms of tax harmonisation - as the Commission and, explicitly, the Council have stated - although I would have liked to have seen a little more ambition, a more decisive step in the process of Community harmonisation.
Secondly, cooperation is an idea that is repeated in all the Commission's documents.
Administrative cooperation was mentioned in the 1987 proposals to move towards VAT at source and the 1996 programme, the new 2000 VAT strategy, the Monti code for reform of direct taxes etc all have the same objective.
'Cooperation' is a magic word, a mantra which is repeated, and I would like to see it become more of a reality than it is at the moment.
I could not agree more with these three objectives, but I must make a few comments on the specific objectives in relation to VAT and direct taxes.
At first reading we presented certain amendments that we have not wanted to reproduce at second reading, in honour of the Commissioner.
At the moment the urgent thing is that this programme be approved so that it is in force on 1 January 2003 - otherwise it would expire - and we have had to sacrifice certain legitimate aspirations that, nevertheless, I would like to mention now, since we will reproduce them at a later date.
The Fiscalis 2007 programme, in relation to VAT, states that it is good to know how VAT works, and this enthusiasm for knowledge, cooperation and coordination sits well with the four objectives set in the VAT strategy for 2003: to simplify, modernise and apply the tax in the most uniform possible way and to increase cooperation between the different administrations.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, I regret that this programme has not been used to take a further step forward in the process of transition towards VAT at source.
All the Commission's documents repeat ad nauseam that the internal market will only function well - or function better, if you prefer - with VAT at source.
We are told that if we are not making progress towards VAT at source it is because the Member States do not have faith in the compensation system and the system for reallocating resources, which was initially based on the declarations of taxpayers and then on statistical data, but which has never satisfied the Member States.
We should have moved forward with this programme in order to become aware of the information and the framework which, as well as making compensation possible, would also have made the desired transition to VAT at source possible.
Nor in the field of direct taxes has the opportunity been taken - as the amendment we have not wanted to repeat says - to strengthen the relationship between taxation policy and other Community policies.
It is well known that taxation policy is instrumental in terms of these other policies.
I will give just three examples: the Commissioner is well aware that, in the financial services action plan, it was said that there had to be parallel progress in the liberalisation of the sector, in the monitoring and control rules - which are so well known now following the Enron case - and in the harmonisation of indirect taxes, so that the liberalisation should not lead to a centralisation of financial activities in climates and countries which are most favourable from a tax point of view.
With regard to competition rules, there is a clear relationship - above all in relation to State aid - with taxation policy.
The code of good conduct, which forms part of the Monti package, referred to the fiscal distortions that could alter the functioning of the internal market.
Sustainable development - and we have held a debate on this issue - is closely linked to energy taxes.
Our amendment therefore recommended that this programme of exchange of information, knowledge and training be used to make better knowledge between taxation policy and other Union policies possible.
The Commission has not taken advantage of this journey to make progress on knowledge of the information which would have made the transition to VAT at source possible, which continues to be a paradise lost which we all want to reach, and has not taken the opportunity to promote knowledge and the interrelationship between taxation policy and other Community policies which it intends to serve.
I would insist, however, that the broad objectives of the programme seem to me to be good ones: to understand the operation of the taxation systems and to cooperate between administrations in order to eradicate fraud.
I think it is right that this programme should be implemented as soon as possible and therefore, Commissioner, we are giving you a vote of confidence by not reproducing the amendments we presented at first reading, in order to prevent a conciliation procedure and so that this programme - which I am sure the Commissioner will administrate very well - can be implemented as soon as possible.
I reserve the right to raise other objectives on other occasions, but I believe that at this time prudence and urgency are more important than the value and the improvement of the programme.
Commissioner, I wish you good luck in implementing it.
Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing the thanks of the Commission to the rapporteur, Mr GarcÃ­a?Margallo y Marfil, for his work and for his extremely forthcoming attitude.
I would also like to express our appreciation of the fact that Mr GarcÃ­a?Margallo y Marfil has decided not to retable the amendments which played a role in the first reading of this proposal.
I have listened with great interest to what Mr GarcÃ­a?Margallo y Marfil has just said.
Many of the matters that he discussed are important but, at the present time, the Fiscalis programme is more restricted than he would have liked.
However, it is important that the programme should be adopted before the expiry of the current Fiscalis programme, which ends on the 31 December of this year.
I am therefore very pleased that this proposal has secured the support of the European Parliament at second reading.
I would therefore like to welcome, in particular, the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr GarcÃ­a?Margallo y Marfil.
As you may be aware from the Commission's communication to Parliament on the Council's common position, the Commission has expressed its satisfaction that the Council endorsed the general approach adopted in its original proposal.
The Commission has noted that the Council has supported the continuation of the actions currently carried out under the existing Fiscalis programme.
In particular, the Commission has welcomed the Council's support for extending these actions to the area of direct taxation.
Nevertheless, the communication regretted the reduction in budget from the Commission's original proposal of EUR 56 million to EUR 44 million.
I am satisfied that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission has been possible, so that the new programme may be adopted shortly.
For that support, I would like to thank Members of Parliament and, in particular, as I said, Mr GarcÃ­a?Margallo y Marfil.
Mr President, I also welcome the progress made in this report on the Fiscalis programme for the next five years.
I would particularly like to welcome and draw attention to the statement in the common position.
As the rapporteur has already mentioned, it points out that this is not a political programme, but one designed to enhance administrative cooperation between Member States' tax officials.
It is important that we are clear about this objective.
We are talking here about improving administration, and not in any way about tax harmonisation.
When it was first proposed that the extension of the programme was going to be aimed at direct taxation, there was a lot of concern, particularly in the UK, that this might lead to measures to introduce harmonisation of direct taxes.
We therefore welcome the fact that the common position clearly states this will not happen.
If I may speak on behalf of the UK once again, we particularly welcome this because we have been among the most active users of the Fiscalis programme over the last few years.
We think it is very valuable, so I would certainly be concerned if anything happened to detract from the programme and make it more difficult for certain Member States to take part in it.
The programme has much to offer.
It has introduced exchanges of officials; it has introduced seminars on tax issues of common interest; it has provided multilateral control exercises, it has developed professional training, such as audit skills; it has improved language training and it has maintained and developed communication and information exchange systems.
That is all very good stuff and to be welcomed, continued and improved upon.
What we are always trying to do in these sort of situations is improve the way that the systems work and get things to work better.
Certainly, that has been one of the achievements of the Fiscalis programme.
Therefore, it is to be regretted, as the Commissioner said, that we are seeing a cut in the budget.
All we can hope is that the budget, as it now stands, will be adequate to take the programme forward.
So, on the whole, I welcome the common position and the fact that it looks as if we are going to be able to achieve an agreement and get the programme extended.
I also welcome the fact that we are very clear now that this is not about tax harmonisation in any way, but about administrative systems.
Mr President, the absence of an institutional agreement would lead to a delicate situation as the rapporteur has already acknowledged, given the urgency of adopting a new Fiscalis framework that is operational on 1 January 2003.
It is a shame, however, that the Council's agreement with the positions adopted by Parliament has been established only for a minimum period.
It is significant, incidentally, that whilst acknowledging that the aim of the Fiscalis programme is not to harmonise tax legislation, the Commission has welcomed the fact that a statement to this effect has been included in the minutes.
Even though it may be acceptable to classify the Fiscalis programme as a mere tool for strengthening administrative cooperation, the European Parliament will nevertheless have to concern itself with the political effects of implementing this type of programme.
Although it is true that tax evasion and fraud have a national dimension specific to each country, they also and increasingly have a supranational dimension rooted in the use of sophisticated techniques and schemes.
At a particularly delicate time for the Union's public finances, these factors cannot be ignored and much less can we fail to take advantage of the opportunities arising in order to change and improve the tax situation.
It should be added that the EU is on the threshold of an historic round of enlargement, which means that, with the entry of new countries and different tax policies, new and hitherto unseen problems will also arise.
In fact, the new programme extends the scope of the programme to cover not only direct taxation, but also the candidate countries.
Improving the functioning of tax systems in the internal market is, in itself, a praiseworthy objective, but combating tax fraud and evasion as well as launching bases with a minimum degree of harmonisation are also opportunities that should not be wasted.
I therefore regret the fact that the Commission has invoked Article 95 of the Treaty with regard to this matter, and has not dared to invoke Article 93.
With the reserves that have been created and bearing in mind the need for the new programme to get off the ground, I support the rapporteur's recommendation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Welcome
I would like, on behalf of the House to give a warm welcome to the delegation from New Zealand, who are led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Jonathan Hunt, and who are seated in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.
Mr Speaker, we welcome you!
The delegation from New Zealand consists of five members of the country's House of Representatives.
The Tenth Interparliamentary Conference between the European Parliament and New Zealand started yesterday and several meetings have already been held.
Further meetings are scheduled for today.
New Zealand and the European Union are closely joined together by common values, faith in democratic institutions and the decisive role played by parliamentary democracy.
We are glad that you are visiting our House here in Strasbourg and hope that you will have good dialogues during your stay here and that the bonds of friendship between Europe and New Zealand will continue to flourish.
(Applause)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0343/2002) by Mr Robert Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Council common position (9359/6/2002 - C5-0384/2002 - 2001/0118(COD)) for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on insider dealing and market manipulation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on market abuses is important for several reasons.
It is the first directive to be adopted under what is known as the Lamfalussy procedure.
This is a piece of framework legislation that will be supplemented by implementing regulations.
The Commission will pass this secondary legislation on the basis of proposals by the Committee of European Securities Regulators, known as CESR in English.
The CESR will draft its proposals on the basis of broad public consultation.
The Commission will also adopt the implementing regulations in a transparent way.
The Ecofin Council and the European Parliament will monitor the Commission.
Parliament will have a deadline of three months in which to deliver an opinion.
If, within that period, Parliament adopts a resolution, the Commission will have to re-examine its draft measures.
This, therefore, provides a guarantee that secondary legislation will be democratically monitored.
For the future, in order to provide the possibility both of giving secondary legislation more regulations of a technical nature and of providing colegislators with final decision-making rights, a 'call-back' procedure, amending Article 202 of the Treaty, absolutely must be provided for.
The aim of the directive is to lay down the same rules for all financial products throughout the Union, in order to combat all forms of insider dealing and market abuse.
At first reading, Parliament adopted 77 amendments.
The Council accepted 60 of these in full and 10 in part.
This is clearly a success for Parliament.
I wish to pay tribute to the Belgian, Spanish and Danish presidencies and to the Commission staff, who have always proved willing to reach workable compromises.
I also address my thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, especially Mr Thomas Mann.
Because the Commission and the Council have declared their agreement on the five amendments accepted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs following second reading, the directive could be implemented quite rapidly.
The new rules will certainly help to restore confidence in the integrity of the financial markets.
Since the bursting of the speculative bubble over the stock markets and the financial scandals that have hit both the United States and Europe, many investors are hesitant.
Since the beginning of 2000, more than USD 7 trillion of virtual stock exchange profits have also been wiped off the market.
In Europe, several thousand billion euros have also gone up in smoke.
This situation destabilises economies, penalises savers, weakens investment funds and lowers the value of pension funds.
In order to restore the confidence of investors and small savers in the financial markets, we must combat all forms of criminal connivance, forcing companies to be as transparent as possible.
In recent months, we have seen numerous revelations about the pally form of capitalism operating amongst company directors, accounting companies, investment banks and financial analysts.
This entire group, which on the surface, appears to be quite respectable, operated in such a way that it could milk stock market exuberance for their own profit.
As a result of the market's lack of transparency, there have been conflicts of interest within accounting firms.
Many financial analysts have been both judge and accused.
Auditors and analysts duped the market players that placed their trust in them.
The reason for this was the practice of stock options and other personal bonuses to be received in line with the financial results of their employers.
The sums in question sometimes defy belief.
One example is that the CEOs of the twenty-five largest American companies to have declared themselves bankrupt in the last 18 months had awarded themselves, in the three years preceding their company's bankruptcy, packages totalling around USD 3.3 billion.
Although we should not generalise, the golden years of the financial sector have nevertheless led to a sort of 'financial mad cow disease' - the 'mad finance syndrome'.
Just like the clean-up of the meat market, the need for and the establishment of a rigorous monitoring system and the clean-up of the financial markets will require precise rules to combat all insider dealing and all market manipulation.
The sole aim of the directive is to better regulate the financial markets.
It is not seeking to regulate the profession of journalism.
Unfortunately, some parts of the press, especially in the United Kingdom, have launched a sometimes incredible campaign against the Commission's proposals, suggesting that the very freedom of the press was at stake.
The freedom of the press has not been in any danger and nor will it be.
The first article clearly states that no journalist can be held responsible for disseminating false or misleading information, unless that journalist is gaining any advantage or profit from divulging such information.
I am starting from the premise that all journalists attempt to do their job correctly and that they check their sources.
If a journalist is wrong, they will not be held responsible, unless he has touched money in the manipulation that has occurred.
Some recent scandals, from the Daily Mirror to the Magazine des actionnaires, show that no profession is entirely honest.
Parliament wishes to encourage the establishment of codes of good conduct and self-regulation for journalists, not least with regard to potential conflicts of interest, but the best form of self-regulation in the world will never exempt legislators from having to remain vigilant and from intervening at regulatory level if, perchance, self-regulation should prove to be inadequate or unworkable.
This is why I ask you to reject the two strangely identical amendments tabled on this matter.
It is simply unacceptable that a profession, even one as respectable as journalism, should attempt to exempt itself definitively from a European regulation that concerns it.
Once again, it is not the CESR that will establish the rules but the Commission, under the democratic control of the Council and Parliament.
I can assure you, Mr President, that I shall be the first, and not the only one, to oppose any attack on the freedom of the press or against any unworkable over-regulation.
European law must, however, be the same for everyone.
Every democrat and, consequently, every journalist worthy of the name should welcome this crucial principle.
I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, for all his efforts.
As we all know, he has been working under heavy pressure.
This is a very complex and sensitive issue.
I applaud the fact that he has resolutely defended the aim of the directive, which is to enhance the integrity of European financial markets.
I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteur and Members of this Parliament and, in particular, of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their readiness to proceed as quickly as possible.
After all the discussions we have had on comitology in the past, let me highlight the successful cooperation between our institutions in drawing up this directive, the first to apply the Lamfalussy approach in full.
I believe that today's text will provide a good basis for effective cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament in the future.
As Mr Goebbels knows, the Commission is in favour of amending Articles 202 and 211 of the Treaty to bring the positions of Parliament and the Council into line.
I hope that will become even clearer in the contribution the Commission is preparing for the Convention, which, I hope, will be finalised by the end of November.
Mr Goebbels, his colleagues and the Commission think alike on that topic.
I assure this Parliament that the European Union has no truck with greedy financial cheats - certainly not with the equivalent of financial mad cows, as Mr Goebbels called them.
That is a very vivid phrase which the Commission finds very apt.
We want stable, transparent, integrated and efficient European markets for every consumer and investor.
The directive will indeed enhance investor protection and make European financial markets more secure and attractive in future.
It will dispel the international concerns expressed over the last few years about insider dealing and manipulation on European markets.
As we are all aware, recent events have shown how important these issues are.
Scandals like Enron and other household names show clearly the need for strong rules to make markets more transparent and safe, to ensure that they remain free of abuse and free of fraud.
The smooth functioning of financial markets and public confidence in them are essential to sustained economic growth and the creation of wealth.
Abuse of markets leads to companies paying more for the finance they need; investors will stay away and the economy will suffer as a result.
We must do everything to stamp this out and to restore public confidence in our markets.
The directive aims to do just that.
Since there has been an in-depth discussion about the application of the directive to journalists, which Mr Goebbels referred to, let me say a few words on that subject.
Firstly, may I make it clear that under no circumstances do we want to add to the burdens of journalists.
The directive does not do that.
Journalism is a difficult profession; the pressure of work is great and we do not want to add to that.
The directive guarantees freedom of expression and the liberty of the media.
That is clearly expressed in the recitals, and the text of the directive itself introduces several safeguards for journalists, including the possibility of self-regulation.
However, recent scandals in several Member States have shown how recommendations by journalists to buy or sell a specific share can influence its market price to their advantage.
What we do not want is to exempt from transparency obligations the small category of highly specialised financial journalists who recommend investment strategies.
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments 6 and 7.
It would not seem justified to exempt this rather small category of persons from basic market integrity standards which apply to all the other market participants.
In addition, completely or partially excluding journalists from the scope of the directive would mean harmonising the definition of 'journalist' at Community level, not a very easy task and something we do not wish to do.
Therefore, Amendment 5 is a compromise proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for today's plenary.
It is fair both to journalists and to the public interest, and therefore acceptable.
I strongly hope that Members of this Parliament share the view of Mr Goebbels and of the Commission on this point.
After all, financial journalists who specifically recommend a certain strategy to the investing public should declare any conflict of interests they may have.
I do not see why that should not be a useful aspect of this directive.
So the Commission can agree with Amendments 1 to 5, but we cannot agree, for the reasons which I have already explained, to Amendments 6 and 7.
Should Parliament adopt the common position together with Amendments 1 to 5 and reject Amendments 6 and 7, for which I am now making a plea, I hope the Council will be able finally to accept this text in the next few weeks.
Adoption of the directive before the end of the year would be a major step towards the integration of European financial markets by 2005 that we all aspire to.
I recommend adoption of this directive to Parliament and I hope that all who take part in the debate will agree with Mr Goebbels and myself.
Ladies and gentlemen, it now gives me great pleasure to call Mr Thomas Mann.
Before you speak, Mr Mann, let me most warmly congratulate you on having the Federal Cross of Merit conferred on you yesterday by the German Federal President.
Congratulations, Mr Mann!
Let me also take the opportunity, as he is present in the Chamber - and please allow me this - to also congratulate the leader of the group, who is sitting in front of me.
He was, indeed, invested yesterday, by the Federal President, with the Federal Grand Cross of Merit!
Warm congratulations to both Members!
(Applause)
Mr President, I feel especially honoured that it is you who are presiding when this important report is presented.
The American and European financial markets continue to be hit by successive scandals, which make it clear that the actors in them include many black sheep, who lack professional integrity.
Balance sheets are being falsified, funds embezzled, and false information deftly fed to the public.
Securities are first talked up in price, then offloaded at a profit, and shortly afterwards the price falls rapidly.
Many small investors have suffered as a result of market abuse and insider dealing.
This makes clear rules and confidence-building measures necessary.
As the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I had a hand in a number of the amendments.
At first reading, Parliament submitted 77 amendments, to the quality of which the Council paid tribute by adopting almost 60 in their entirety and giving partial approval to 10 more.
At the time, I congratulated Robert Goebbels, the rapporteur, and I would like to reiterate those congratulations now that we are at second reading stage.
We have come to agree on important matters.
The points at issue include 'frontrunning', in which, on the basis of a client's being of sufficient size to affect the market on its own, brokers trade on their own account even before they carry out the client's orders.
This is to exploit insider information and is already prohibited.
A ban should apply to all the markets within the scope of the directive.
The question of how financial journalists who recommend investments to the public should be obliged to disclose their conflicts of interest - to which Commissioner Bolkestein has just referred - provided substantial material for debate.
We are not dealing here with objective financial information, but exclusively with recommendations to the public.
There are journalists who succeed in using their own publications to manipulate the prices of securities for their own benefit.
Yet it should be in the interests of journalists themselves to make a distinction between their reputable and less reputable colleagues.
It is surely not acceptable that a small element in a single profession should get some sort of derogation.
I have proposed, by way of compromise, taking Mrs Kauppi's amendment as a basis for taking into account journalists' professional rules of conduct, including self-regulation, when arranging the technical details.
Mr Goebbels and I have jointly tabled an amendment providing for this idea to be incorporated in Article 6 (10), which covers this area.
This was supported by a broad majority on the committee.
I am of course acquainted with the criticisms of CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, and with the open letter from journalists' associations concerning its work, but I want now to point out that it has no legislative authority, and cannot, therefore, impose binding rules on the way journalists work.
The Commission called on it, as an independent institution, to play an advisory role.
The Commission will then elaborate the regulation, which will be submitted to the European Securities Committee - including representatives of the Member States' finance ministries - and also to us in Parliament.
I cannot imagine that the Commission will disregard the principles of press freedom and journalists' right to free expression of opinion.
After all, they are anchored in the recitals of this directive.
As the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur, then, I am seeking support for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee's resolutions dating back to early October, which, slightly altered, now form Amendments Nos 1 to 5.
Commissioner, on that you have my forthright support.
Under these circumstances, there is a good chance that the Commission and the Council will give their assent at an early stage.
The directive could enter into force at the beginning of 2003.
That would represent a decisive move towards greater integrity in Europe's financial markets, with greater confidence on the part of investors resulting in increased investments.
I believe we have a good chance of ensuring that we win broad support for this important piece of comitology.
The recommendation for second reading on a directive on market abuse, which we are considering today, is both timely and appropriate.
It is timely because confidence in the integrity of market participants has been seriously damaged over the last two years as a result of various cases of market abuse, chiefly in the United States.
It is appropriate because the common position addresses the need for regulatory authorities to have sufficient enforcement flexibility to be able to detect market abuse and sanction its practitioners on a consistent and effective basis.
Also covered is the right of market participants to enjoy reasonable legal certainty that their actions will be considered appropriate.
The key is to be able to deal with market abuse in a consistent manner.
Those who have intent and knowledge of market abuse - and knowledge includes journalists - or who act recklessly will be punished.
Those whose actions are innocent but have unintended effects will not, however, be penalised.
The fact that we now have a debate with so few amendments tabled nearly 18 months after the initial proposal, when the financial services industry initially questioned whether there was any need for such a proposal, owes much to the skill and patience of our rapporteur, Mr Goebbels.
I would like to congratulate him.
We have obtained an appropriate definition of market manipulation and of financial instruments whose use falls within the scope of the directive.
Nevertheless, Member States must increase the resources available to their regulators so that they can be effective in their investigation and pursuit of market manipulators.
Mr President, I will begin with the controversial issue in this directive.
It should clearly cover financial journalists, and Article 1 of the directive does just that.
If journalists profit from the dissemination of information, they will fall within the scope of the directive and they can and will be prosecuted.
The controversial question is different.
Should journalists be subject to new regulations that may be established by the Commission and financial regulators, as currently proposed under Article 6(10)?
Currently, Member States must ensure there is appropriate regulation so that persons who disseminate research or other information, i.e. news organisations, take reasonable care that such information is fairly presented.
Commissioner Bolkestein would have us believe that it only concerns journalists if they recommend shares.
That is not what the directive says.
It actually gives the Commission and financial regulators a role in determining whether information is fairly presented.
You do not need much imagination to see how this provision could undermine press freedom.
It is extraordinary to suggest that the financial regulators, the most criticised public institutions in most Member States - they always get the blame when banks fail - should help determine whether information has been fairly presented.
This is why the ELDR Group has retabled an amendment we tabled in committee seeking to exclude bona fide journalists from this regulatory provision, not from the whole scope of the directive, and to do so without opening up any loophole that would allow financial analysts to parade themselves as journalists.
Do we really want today to set such an extraordinary precedent?
Do we really want to introduce the first ever European regulation of the press?
Do we want to ignore the objections of news organisations like Handelsblatt, Reuters, Agence France Press and the Financial Times, all of which live by their high reputations?
Do we really want to take this terrible first step of regulating the press without a proper discussion of the potential consequences?
I urge you to back the ELDR Group amendment and reject this ill-thought-through attempt to introduce media regulation by the back door.
Mr President, I would say that our Parliament has worked extremely well and that we should congratulate our rapporteur, Robert Goebbels, on his excellent work.
We should, in particular, welcome the fact that the pressure to incorporate the concept of intent into the definition of offences, a concept which is usually impossible to prove, has been rejected, and also the fact that we have strengthened obligations of transparency in the field of insider information and in cooperation between market surveillance authorities.
We are therefore in the process of breaking in the Lamfalussy procedure which has got off to a good start, I believe, with fine cooperation between our three institutions.
Nevertheless, I feel that it is perhaps regrettable that the Commission asked, at 6 p.m., to begin its work on the regulation's implementation before it is even adopted by Parliament and the Council.
In any event, this was merely an excuse to redouble the pressure exerted by the lobbies of financial journalists who want, in fact, to create a general exception in their favour in the field of comitology; I am talking about self-regulation full stop.
In our view, financial journalists must indeed comply with all the provisions concerning transparency and the veracity of information and, with regard to the progress that can be made in the field of comitology, this will fall under a future revision of Article 202.
This is why we fully reject the two amendments tabled by the Liberal and PPE-DE groups and support Amendment No 5, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which further strengthens the guarantees concerning that profession.
To conclude, I wish to say that, in light of the extremely serious shortcomings revealed by current developments, we are simply trying to take the first step, particularly where insider dealing is concerned.
What is at stake is the entire production and consumption of the financial setup.
Consequently, with regard to the harmonisation of accounting procedures, government reform of businesses, the organisation and the supervision of audits, of financial analysis and credit rating, we call on the European Union and the Commission in particular to rapidly draw up new regulatory and legislative initiatives.
Mr President, the concept of trust is a key one to any discussion about the economy.
Our whole economic system is based on trust.
And as long as trust is not betrayed, the economic system functions as we expect it to.
Expectations of the financial markets are closely linked to the way in which legislative institutions, such as the Council, the Commission and Parliament, deal with unexpected circumstances.
The financial markets expect to have regulations, but these should be unambiguous regulations, which are not open to many different interpretations.
The concept of interpretation, in particular, plays an important role in the debate about prior knowledge.
After all, what is prior knowledge and when do we talk about prior knowledge which has an actual effect?
Article 1 of the directive mentions having 'a considerable influence on the prices of financial instruments' - a concept which ought to be explained, however, on the basis of the effect of the directive in practice.
It is not possible to draw up one unambiguous rule which would apply to all situations.
Events which have taken place in practice within Member States have led to regulations being drawn up in order to prevent or sanction fraud and insider dealing.
This practice shows that in many cases an assessment of the facts is required based on a given situation.
In my opinion, journalists are very much in a position to determine from specific cases in practice whether prior knowledge applies.
After all, in their day-to-day work they have to judge whether something is 'news' or prior knowledge.
The reason for which information is gathered or disseminated forms the basis for the assessment of whether prior knowledge applies or not.
It is for these reasons that I will not support Amendments Nos 6 and 7.
It is unsatisfactory to declare that technical modality does not apply to journalists in the exercise of their profession.
Considering that an assessment takes place on the basis of facts and situations, reference should be made to existing rules and self-regulation within this professional group.
It is also the case that an appeal to this professional group constitutes a question of trust.
Although I believe that a number of matters should be regulated at Member State level, the arguments for harmonising the rules at European level are convincing.
National legislation falls short within the international context of the financial markets.
I support, therefore, the recommendation for a second reading by Mr Goebbels.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Goebbels, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done an excellent job on this directive.
I do feel, however, that there are a number of things we need to bear in mind. We are all quite familiar with the Enron question and other financial scandals, but the important thing is not to be under the illusion that a new law, a new regulation, a new authority will resolve the problem of market abuse and insider dealing.
It may be that the situation is gradually improving, but we must be under no illusion - I reiterate - as to whether the new law, the new directive, the new authority will resolve once and for all the issue of transparency and the need to prevent abuse in the financial markets.
Then we have a number of particularly serious concerns where the regulation affects the mechanisms through which information reaches the market - principally the work of the media.
Here too, in the past, the most effective tool for preventing the exploitation and manipulation of confidential and other information has proved to be the market, which confirms the reliability and validity of methods of producing and disseminating information.
I agree with what Mr Huhne said and with the amendment tabled by Mr Huhne and Mrs Villiers, and I believe that we must avoid introducing specific, rigid legislation, which would, inevitably, ultimately lead to some sort of regulation of the freedom of the press and the freedom to exercise the profession of journalism.
We must therefore reject the illusion that we can use the law to regulate and guarantee the veracity of the information provided by economics and financial journalists.
Moreover, we would be running the risk of it having little or no effect because, if a person wants to put the information in their possession to an inappropriate use, they will find a way to do so whatever we do, whatever the law governing the matter.
Mr President, it is vital to have tough rules to prevent insider dealing and to punish those who abuse the market, including journalists and market practitioners.
It is vital to protect consumer investors from the misconduct of market insiders.
I would like to put on record my thanks to the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for taking on board a number of issues in relation to accepted market practices, commodity derivatives and Chinese walls at first reading.
But this draft directive leaves a number of very significant problems.
It is of very serious concern, as we have heard, to a whole range of journalists and media organisations across the European Union - media organisations that live or die by their reputation for integrity and a high standard of public conduct.
I agree that journalists should be subject to market abuse rules.
I agree that journalists should be subject to rules that prevent conflicts of interest.
I agree that we should have tough enforcement mechanisms to enforce those rules.
However, I do not agree with the rapporteur that the Committee of European Securities Regulators is the appropriate body to do this.
In the case of journalists, the rules should be enforced by specialist media regulators, who know how the media works and understand the issues that relate to journalists.
CESR does not have the expertise to regulate journalists.
It has already demonstrated that it does not understand how the media works.
The proposals in its consultation paper would have been impractical and unworkable.
Special constitutional issues apply to journalists because of the demands and importance of that vital constitutional issue, freedom of speech.
It is vital that we respect those constitutional issues.
It is at least arguable that, in some countries, giving CESR this role would be unconstitutional and contrary to the principle of freedom of speech.
The free flow of information to the markets is absolutely vital in preventing market abuse and protecting consumer investors.
If we disrupt that free flow of information to the market, we will be playing into the hands of market abusers.
That would be the consequence of allowing CESR to regulate journalists when it does not understand the media issues.
Throughout the first reading, MEPs believed that Article 6(5) was not targeted at journalists.
Despite this understanding, CESR has indicated it will regulate journalists.
This is a test case.
This is the first time we have used the Lamfalussy process.
We need to use our codecision power to send a clear message to CESR that we will stand up for the prerogatives and powers of the only elected EU institution and support Amendment 7.
Mr President, there are still too many obstacles in the way of smooth provision of financial services across national boundaries.
The draft directive on market abuse that we are discussing today is one step in the right direction.
Investor confidence is crucial for the successful development of our financial services markets.
The integrity of European markets has to be safeguarded.
Common and efficient standards to combat market abuse have to be established and thoroughly implemented.
Clearly, actions that intentionally manipulate financial markets, including those by financial journalists, have to be penalised.
Like some other colleagues, however, I am worried about some proposals whose basic intention might be good and respectable but whose effects would be devastating.
I believe that there must be tough rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest among financial journalists.
But these need to be rules that are sensitive to the media context.
Free speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy.
In many countries, for example in my country and in Scandinavia, it would be simply unconstitutional to subject journalists to the sort of heavy-handed regulation that the CESR put forward in July.
Under the draft guidelines, a report by a journalist that merely records accurately a recommendation made by an investment analyst - for example, Merrill Lynch has upgraded its rating on Nokia - would require a public disclosure of personal interest on the part of the journalist.
This would be impractical, unnecessary and disproportionate.
The European Parliament did not address the issues raised by Article 6(5) at first reading because it was widely believed that the Article was targeted at financial analysts employed by investment firms where well-publicised abuses have occurred.
The publication by the CESR of its draft guidelines in July revealed that it has another plan.
The aim is to cover an extensive range of routine financial journalism where standards have remained high and existing governance mechanisms have proved adequate.
As explained above, the recent amendment to Article 6(10) by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is insufficient, as the CESR would still be able to override or amend these mechanisms.
The feedback we have had from the European financial journalism community is clear.
The proposals would have an adverse impact on media freedom and on journalistic independence.
Financial journalism contributes to one of the key objectives of the directive, that is to ensure market transparency.
This is especially important for small retail investors.
They are the investors in the European Parliament should be trying to protect.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking those Members, from all the groups, but especially those belonging to my own, who worked on this report in our committee, and who demonstrated commitment, expertise and passion - which have also been apparent in this debate - in tackling this important topic.
This is an important and necessary directive, it is one that we want; we want an agreement with the Council, and we want the directive to enter into force at the beginning of 2003.
This directive is the first under the new comitology procedure.
I see it as being founded on seven points.
The first is that the insider-trading directive, which has provided the framework, is thirteen years old.
A lot has happened in the meantime.
It is based on the results of the Lisbon Council and on the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit.
It forms part of the action plan on financial services.
It is a response to 11 September, because the directive is what the Member States want in order to be better able to take counter-terrorist action.
It is a response to Enron, Microsoft, and the EM.TV trial; today's information society makes it easier to engage in insider trading by exploiting the many sources of information available.
We have to build up confidence in the financial services sector, in the financial markets and in the economy.
This directive helps to do that by safeguarding the integrity of the European financial markets, establishing rules for combating market abuse in Europe, and strengthening investors' confidence in the European financial market.
I would like to say, though, that we have not made it easier for ourselves, as this debate itself shows.
Between the Goebbels Report as it was at first reading, and what we have before us today, there are two more extreme standpoints.
Let me point out, though, that this is not a directive on journalists, but one on insider dealing and market manipulation.
This directive is not to exclude anyone, but it does have to deal with the differences in quality.
We should not expect this House to come to a decision that promotes censorship and infringes fundamental rights and freedoms.
That is the basis of our political work.
Because we want to get both sides together, combining the arguments of Mr Huhne, Mrs Villiers, Mrs Kauppi and those of the parties affected, the committee came up with a compromise motion, and I believe that it, and perceptiveness, have enabled us to find a very good and broad compromise on the basis of the special role of journalists and of the possibility of self-regulation.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many of those involved in this business used to wonder whether regulation is needed - they still do.
It is my belief that the answer to this question should be an unambiguous 'yes', even though many of the actors take the opposite view.
I am, in principle, opposed to the proliferation of rules.
I hope that the future will see politicians, policies, and even the Commission, judged on the basis of what rules and directives they have abolished or unified, rather than the opposite.
This situation, though, is rather different.
This is about honesty, about trust; this has to do with the prevention of theft, insecurity and, in the final analysis, fraud.
I am glad that there is to be an increase in controls and, it is to be hoped, that there will be more sanctions in future.
If I may turn to the subject of journalists and media freedom, I cannot but agree with what Mr Karas has said about the principle that we stand up for freedom of opinion and oppose any sort of censorship.
I do, however, see it as inadequate to take the view, as some in this House do, that the good name of certain media and media organisations that have been referred to guarantees that abuses will be prevented.
I was myself in that line of business and am, alas, all too well aware that publishers and journalists are human, but that there is a very, very narrow dividing line between honesty and respectability on the one hand and debatable conduct on the other.
It is for this reason that I believe a good reputation does not at present offer a sufficient guarantee, and that there is a need for regulation.
Arthur Andersen also had a good reputation until that business was struck by disaster.
I am in favour of these interests being disclosed.
I believe that we owe a duty to the public to address problems and find approaches towards a solution even in sensitive areas.
It will be for the future to show whether we have been able to do that properly in the first stage, with all the nuances involved.
We will then have to make any adjustments that turn out to be necessary.
(Applause)
Mr President, I have asked to speak again on this subject because of certain remarks made by Mrs Villiers, Mrs Kauppi and Mr Huhne.
Both Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi said that freedom of speech is under attack.
With all due respect to those Members of Parliament who have spoken and whom I have just mentioned, that is a caricature of the aims of this directive.
Financial journalists are free to write whatever they wish.
There is not the slightest doubt that they can write as they please.
The only thing the directive says is that, when they recommend to the public certain stocks in which they themselves have invested, they must state that fact.
In other words, if financial journalists advise the public to buy shares in a certain company and if they themselves own shares in that company, they must declare how many shares they own.
I do not understand why that should be an attack on the freedom of the press or, as Mr Huhne said, regulation of the press or of the media by the back door.
Why should the rule of transparency apply to all and sundry who engage in dealings on the stock market but not to financial journalists?
After all, we are simply asking them to be transparent about their investment in stocks they are recommending the public buy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0324/2002) by Mr Ward Beysen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision (COM(2001) 775 - C5-0111/2002 - 2001/0311(COD)) on amending Decision No 1254/96/EC laying down a series of guidelines for trans-European energy networks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission proposes a revision of the guidelines for Trans-European Energy Networks in order to update European policy in this field.
Since 1996, when the first guidelines were adopted, certain salient events have taken place on the European energy scene.
I shall limit myself to pointing out the most important, namely the first phase of the internal market, increasing use of natural gas - which also reflects our concern for improved environmental protection - the setting of more ambitious objectives with regard to the use of renewable energy sources and, lastly, the prospects that have now been confirmed with regard to the enlargement of the Union.
The Commission proposal reflects these events in the priorities of our energy network policy and in the other provisions of the guidelines.
The most important element of our proposal is the establishment of twelve priority axes for the development of the energy networks, in order to integrate them fully at European level.
These axes determine the broad lines that are essential to the operation of a competitive energy market and improved safety of the energy supply, specifically with regard to natural gas.
I am pleased to note that the Barcelona European Council gave its approval to the swift implementation of these projects and clearly recognised their political importance for the European Union as a whole.
I would like to remind you that, in addition to the proposals for a revision of the guidelines for transport and energy networks, the Commission has also proposed to adapt certain provisions of the Rules of Procedure with regard to financial aid for these networks.
In this context, the Commission has suggested the possibility of granting more financial aid, specifically up to 20% of the priority energy network projects.
It is clear that increased aid will only be granted to projects that really need it and in which there is a clear prospect of accelerated development, effective implementation and added value for the Union as a whole.
In the case of the energy networks, this concentration of financial means is taking place with a limited, low, constant budget and therefore there should in theory be no concerns with regard to the impact on competition or on spending, because, I repeat, the volume and quantity remain the same.
Lastly, with regard to all the consequences of enlargement, I would like to ask you to be patient.
A large number of projects of interest to the candidate countries already appear in this proposal.
The Commission considers, however, that these countries need to undergo an initial period of increased competition in the energy market before implementing the priority axes.
As far as possible, the Commission will present a proposal in this regard.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have briefly summed up the Commission's objectives in presenting this proposal and I eagerly await the debate on this matter.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the particular importance of this report is clearly apparent right from the Commissioner's introductory explanatory comments.
As a result of congestion and insufficient joint activity, certain Member States can now only profit to a limited extent from the advantages of the open markets, meaning that competitive advantages for consumers are becoming increasingly smaller.
The European Commission is therefore right to propose a reform of the guidelines for Trans-European Networks in the energy sector.
The revised proposal takes account of the liberalisation of the energy markets, the increasing external dependence on energy and the stricter requirements to get sustainable sources of energy accepted.
These are the objectives which have been emphasised by the political leaders on the European Councils of Stockholm and Barcelona.
Concentration on a new list of priority projects forms the core of this proposal.
Member States will give special support and attention to these projects.
The maximum percentage for co-financing will be increased from 10% to 20% and from now on the construction phase will take precedence.
The question which immediately comes to mind is whether this is the best solution.
In my opinion, a massive subsidy for the energy sector is not a good solution because I feel that it is at variance with the current trend towards liberalisation and the creation of a competitive internal market.
It must be emphasised that the main responsibility lies with the energy sector and with the industry itself.
Measures which are taken on the basis of this decision may in no way be allowed to cause disruption of competitive practices within the internal energy market.
I also feel that Community aid should only relate to the design phase.
Subsidies for the construction phase such as proposed by the Commission should then only be granted in exceptional cases.
In this context, the integration of renewable energy sources constitutes an important factor.
In my opinion, these will contribute in future to the diversification of energy sources and thus as such to the continuity of energy provision within the European Union.
Support of tangible projects such as off-shore wind parks should therefore be encouraged.
The way in which the Commission wants to implement all this does give rise to a number of questions.
I think it is not a good idea to give the European Parliament a droit de regard only when the issues concern strategically important changes to project specifications.
It is important to seek a balance between, on the one hand, a quick reaction by the Commission to new developments and, on the other hand, the need for effective control by Parliament.
To satisfy the need for transparency, the Commission needs to submit regular reports.
Finally I would like to emphasise that actual measures will be necessary if we want to reap the rewards of the internal market.
In fact, the new guidelines might significantly contribute towards coping with the problems of: the continuity of energy provision, the integration of renewable energy, the outermost regions as well as enlargement.
I would like to clearly point out that Community aid must be applied pragmatically and that, in the first instance, accountability must be given to the energy sector itself.
Mr President, my sincere thanks go to my colleague, Mr Beysen, for the work he has done.
He took the views of the shadow rapporteurs into consideration back in the formulation stage in an exemplary manner and the levels of cooperation we have seen have been fruitful.
We must take account of the fact that in rather more than a year's time there will be 10 new Member States in the European Union.
Their concerns are also our concerns.
The candidate countries must be included in programmes like the TEN-Energy programme as swiftly as possible.
All candidate countries have huge problems with regard to their electricity transmission networks.
In the Baltic countries there are no such networks as such.
If and when Ignalina is closed, and whatever decisions are made concerning bituminous shale, the Baltic countries' energy strategies cannot rely exclusively on Russia.
What sort of timetable does the Commission have for including the new Member States in the trans-European networks?
I have given emphasis to the question of whether the EU should support the private sector.
The basic philosophy here is that the energy sector must be one in which the market economy works unaided.
Only in exceptional cases can public sector aid be granted to the private sector.
The Commission's contribution, which in the end is the European taxpayer's money, must not be raised from 10% to 20%.
Previously, aid was available only for studies in the planning stage.
If the Commission's new proposal is accepted, aid would also be granted for project development.
There is always the risk that project coordinators will increase their costs just to obtain as much aid from the Commission as possible.
It is good that the Commission will provide support for building trans-European networks.
This programme and this amount of money, however, will have only a limited effect, and will not solve the problems of Europe's energy infrastructure.
The solution to the problem of bottlenecks is to be found in the Member States rather than in this EU programme.
There have been a lot of problems when constructing power lines as a result of the way in which decisions have been made at local and regional level.
Residents complain about electromagnetic radiation, the impact on the environment, blighted landscapes, and so on.
It is for this reason that no solution has been found for the largest bottleneck in the European electricity networks, which is on the border between Spain and France.
Matters relating to technology must not be linked to this programme.
We are now deciding on trans-European networks, without adopting a position on what technology is to be used in producing the energy transmitted through the network and what its source is.
The supplementary role renewable energy sources play in basic production is a part of the European energy palette.
In certain circumstances they serve as excellent local solutions.
This report is about infrastructure, not energy production.
The network and production must be kept separate.
As a separate issue I want to mention Amendment No 9.
If this is meant to suggest that renewable energy sources will result in lower charges for the consumer, that is not true.
All the research shows that nuclear power is the cheapest option for the consumer of all forms of energy.
The Commission is proposing an electricity interconnection capacity of at least 10% as a European minimum level.
The level of interconnection is already 20% in some countries, however.
The Commission should set its targets higher and insist on a level of 20% for all Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by making a point of thanking Mr Beysen.
It is unlike me to start a speech by congratulating the rapporteur, because I think that is what we are here for and we generally make a good job of it.
I think, however, that Mr Beysen deserves special praise for his hard work in contacting the other groups right from the start, in order to ensure the report was as unanimous as possible before it was tabled in plenary.
And he has succeeded admirably.
So thank you for involving us from the outset.
As a result, my group feels there is no need to table any amendments because, in my opinion, what Mr Beysen has done is fine as it is.
I would therefore like to just comment briefly on three political points that are important to me.
First, as the Commissioner made clear, this decision comes under the general heading of the liberalisation of the energy market; in other words, it contributes to what is already on the Council's agenda.
And when it comes to the overall package to open up the energy market, let there be no mistake, we have handed our homework in on time.
We adopted our first reading here in plenary on 13 March, after the Council urged us to get a move on.
The Commission did likewise; it too has done its homework, unlike the Council.
The Council is doing what it always does, what it does best - nothing at all.
It sits and talks and fails to come to any decision.
That amounts to institutionalised indecisiveness, and that is why we need to say at this juncture: this is an overall package and we want results so that we can move forward.
Secondly, I really do think the Commission was right in this context to suggest - and our resolution should reflect this - that strategically important projects in the trans-European energy network sector should be given top priority.
By which we mean projects which are vital for security of supply, strategically important projects which are important in opening up the market, especially those relating to one part of this package I referred to, namely the regulation on which Mr Mombaur acted as rapporteur.
It is a pity he is not here today; I think he too would have had a few comments to make here.
Thirdly, unlike traffic networks, the industry and companies involved in the energy networks generally make real money.
They make money!
And that means that it is primarily up to the industry to finance these projects.
It is our job as legislator to support this by putting framework conditions in place, which brings me back to the fact that the Council needs to wrap things up.
So that is how we want to go about this, by cofinancing support but with the companies in the front row when it comes to putting money in the kitty.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too first want to thank Mr Beysen for his excellent report.
He has raised some important points, and our group supports his approach.
The Commission is proposing that financial support for the trans-European networks must be stepped up.
This is to be supported in order to foster the internal market in electricity and gas.
As has been said here, it is also important to connect the new Member States to the internal market in energy.
This point of view is also contained in the report adopted by Parliament on cross-border exchanges in electricity.
It has also already been said here that the main responsibility for constructing and maintaining adequate energy networks lies with EU industry and business.
In this sense the energy networks differ from the trans-European networks, which receive large amounts of public money.
Network operators, however, have no interest in removing bottlenecks in the supply to their neighbours.
For that reason, state intervention and EU aid to promote competition is well justified.
Naturally we also have to see that aid does not distort competition and that it is used for the right purpose.
Concentrating EU aid on priority projects will encourage the removal of bottlenecks and boost competition, giving consumers greater choice.
In this way Europe's own energy resources will be put to more effective use and the European economy will be given a boost.
In developing the trans-European energy networks, account must also be taken of social and economic rapprochement.
We also have to ensure networks are developed in island, peripheral and remote regions.
If necessary we must provide support for connecting the networks in these regions to other networks.
Following on from Union decisions, we also have to encourage the diversification of forms of energy and increase the use of renewable energy sources.
We have to ensure that decentralised renewable energy can access the network at a reasonable cost.
The recent massive storm damage was a reminder that we must insist on companies and industry being sufficiently prepared to repair damage speedily and restore networks in all regions of the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to begin my speech on Trans-European Networks in the energy sector by reminding you once again and quite forcefully, that energy is not a product like any other and that the market cannot be the main force regulating it.
Security of supply is a prerequisite for the political independence of our countries and of Europe.
This security requires a diversification of energy sources and will involve major long term, not to say extremely long-term investment.
Energy is, furthermore, an important factor in land-use planning and falls entirely within the field of public services in the truest sense of the word.
I would add that we must always bear in mind that when we talk about energy and about transport networks that, whereas new infrastructures must be created, existing infrastructures must also be reorganised in order to make better use of them.
Lastly, there must be - and I wish to express this forcefully - an obsession with the environment in all its dimensions: the visual dimension, pollution, and the despoliation of resources, not forgetting the issue of waste.
Incidentally, with regard to the report by Mr Beysen, whom I congratulate on his work, I can state my broad agreement with the proposals that have been made.
We must in fact improve and extend the energy transport networks and, by means of studies and investment, support the implementation of the least profitable ones where they are needed.
The internal market in energy is necessary but what it needs more than deregulation is investment throughout the Union, especially in the least accessible and least densely populated regions.
No one would deny that the interlinking of networks is necessary.
Let us not forget, however, that we need energy to put into these networks and a number of conditions must be met if we are to achieve that.
Lastly, I wish to confirm the importance to us of renewable energies, of research in this field and of the public investment needed for its development.
I must also admit that I do not fully understand the connection that some people wish to make between this aim of developing renewable energies and a liberal approach that often leads to a quest for the lowest cost in the short term, without worrying about the consequences in the medium and long term.
To conclude, whilst remaining critical of the liberal principles that I believe are dangerous for Europe's energy independence and for small consumers, not forgetting the least-favoured regions, I believe that the Commission guidelines on the Trans-European Networks are a step in the right direction and, as they stand, I thank you for them, Commissioner.
Mr President, the European Commission claims that spending more public funds on building additional electricity lines in Europe will enhance competition.
There is no academic evidence for this.
What do we have to do if we want to reduce oligopolistic tendencies in the European market?
Firstly, we must reduce market dominance.
We need to bring in measures such as divestiture in those countries where there are dominant operators.
Secondly, we must increase centralised electricity production, because that is the only way to make the sector more competitive in the near future.
Independent research shows that there is no economic rationale for spending billions on a new electricity grid.
I have with me some summaries of these studies and I will hand them over to the Commissioner.
So what should we do with the public funds available to us?
We should spend them on gas pipelines, because that will bring more competition and security of supply.
We should spend money on offshore projects in the North Sea and the Baltic.
Historically, this market and the grid which exists in Europe were set up to promote centralised fossil fuel and nuclear power plants.
If we want fair competition, we have to use some public money to provide a level playing field for offshore projects.
We have enormous potential for this.
This should not be a Christmas gift shop.
If you look at the annexes to the report, this is a Christmas gift shop with all the electricity lines any operator ever wanted to build in Europe.
This is not a good use of European public funds.
Mr President, I have taken the floor to inform the Members who will listen to me of the significance of an amendment I have tabled, Amendment No 22 to be precise.
It raises a number of issues which relate to the region I represent, Sardinia, but which also concern all the islands in the Community and, therefore, around 15 million citizens dispersed throughout all the seas of Europe.
The general framework governing the trans-European networks described in this proposal includes, of course, the desire and the intention to help the underdeveloped regions.
The amendment I have tabled equates the situation of the islands to that of the less-developed regions, for energy is one of the sectors in which islands are at a greater disadvantage: there is not one island on our continent that does not have an energy problem in terms of cost, quantity, capacity for progress and economic development.
Some practical measures have been taken, for an important project has been included in the list of projects of common interest which concerns two islands in the Community - Sardinia and Corsica - specifically, the gas pipeline which will convey a considerable amount of methane gas from Algeria to Italy, France and southern Germany.
It has been included among the projects of common interest but not yet among the priority projects.
I therefore hope that, if the European Parliament adopts my amendment, a further boost will be given to this project whose implementation is awaited by a significant part of Europe, and, if possible, to other projects, which will then be practically implemented.
Mr President, Mr Beysen has tabled an excellent, forward-looking report which takes account of important basic documents such as the White Paper on renewable sources of energy, the directive on the internal market in electricity and the directive promoting electricity from renewable sources of energy.
We particularly welcome the proposed amendments calling for fair network access for electricity companies using renewable energy sources.
Of course, in the long term, we also expect the Commission to internalise external costs, which need to be broken down in the case of fossil and atomic energy production.
At present, we are probably all taking far too little account of future problems with security of supply and underestimating the expected cost increases in the primary energy sector in general.
In this sense, we welcome the proposed amendments tabled by Claude Turmes, while Mr Beysen is to be congratulated on having pushed so forcefully for the inclusion of wind energy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this report.
It is about a logistics system in the European Union that we are trying to build.
It appears that electricity consumption will continue to grow over the next 20 years but that the rate of growth will fall off or slow down.
At the same time the production of electricity and other forms of energy will go down in relation to consumption.
We in the Nordic countries have opened up our electricity markets.
For example, in my own country, Finland, households have been able to choose their electricity supplier for many years now.
This practice has worked well in the Nordic countries, and even Norway, a country outside the European Union, participates.
The importance of renewable sources is increasing in our logistics system and limiting carbon dioxide emissions has also become a key issue.
Natural gas is also growing in importance.
We must be on our guard against the emergence of monopolies and reliance on just one supplier, which would cause huge problems.
Let us just recall how things went for Enron or how things are still going for a certain large company in Great Britain.
Where are the largest and nearest energy resources from the Union's point of view?
They are in Russia.
Now while the relevant Commissioner is listening attentively over there I would propose that, at the next summit between the European Union and Russia, an attempt at some sort of concrete agreement is made on energy, both gas and electrical energy, because we are very interested in both and we will be dependent on Russia for gas within 20 years or so.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should congratulate ourselves on proposals and reports such as this, because it includes the ultraperipheral regions in setting energy guidelines.
The sparse energy supply in these regions is precisely one of their most significant disadvantages, which we are now attempting to remedy.
I shall use this speech to request a clarification in the annex providing for natural gas networks in the ultraperipheral regions.
There is an extremely serious error that I would like to point out, even though, logically, it should be up to the Spanish Government to communicate this.
Section 'E.07' includes two new terminals in the Canary Islands.
One, according to the text, in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and the other in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria.
We - and the sector - understand this to mean natural gas on the island, rather than in the capital, in other words, Tenerife on the one hand and Gran Canaria on the other.
Mr President, who could be against the construction and maintenance of infrastructures in the energy sector and the integration of energy networks of the countries that are soon to join the European Union?
No one would be, of course, if it were truly a matter of meeting the needs of the people.
The real issue, however - as the report makes quite clear - is to make the construction and the maintenance of infrastructures in the field of energy subject to the laws of the market.
In order to establish a more open and competitive internal market for energy, public funds supplementing private funds will rise from 10% to 20% of total investment.
Members from the Lutte ouvriÃšre are opposed to the use of public monies to increase private profits.
Besides which, the aim of increasing interconnection between gas and electricity networks is not to rationalise energy distribution at EU scale, but instead to open up the entire gas and electricity market to competition.
What this means, where France, for example, is concerned, is another step closer to the privatisation of ÃlectricitÃ© and Gaz de France, a process that we reject entirely.
We reject it, as do the tens of thousands of workers who demonstrated on 3 October in Paris for ÃlectricitÃ© and Gaz de France to remain public services.
We also oppose any attack on salaries or on the pensions of workers in this sector.
The various States or the European Community itself must be able to fund an energy transport network which is fit for the twenty-first century, whose management criteria are not profitability or the quest for profit for a few but which are to meet the energy needs of everyone and equal access for everyone.
We do not think, however, think that by allowing themselves to be guided by private interests, the current European institutions will achieve this.
Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 120, paragraph 5, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, now has the final word.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for the clarifications they have provided and the issues they have raised.
I would like to highlight the magnificent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Beysen, and say that I see in general that the Commission and Parliament share the same point of view with regard to trans-European networks as an essential factor in facilitating the construction of the internal gas and electricity network.
The Commission accepts the vast majority of the proposed amendments, with some changes to the wording in certain cases.
These amendments supplement or clarify the Commission's text.
I shall provide the exact list of all the amendments and also indicate those we cannot accept as they contain guidelines which fall outside the scope of the Commission's objectives.
I shall concentrate, however, on explaining Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 11, which concern Annex III and, specifically, the use of the comitology process.
In the interests of transparency and clarity, the Commission proposes that detailed descriptions of the projects should be included in the aforementioned Annex III to the guidelines.
In our opinion, with this level of detail, this Annex should be considered as a technical Annex and frequent and necessary decisions to update it should be taken in accordance with the comitology procedure.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to remind you that the use of the comitology procedure goes beyond trans-European networks and is currently the subject of an analysis of the interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions, and that the issues that Parliament might raise must be solved within this framework.
Mr President, I would also like to point out that, in any case, the Commission will present an annual report on the development of the trans-European networks and the progress made with regard to the projects and, if possible, the amendments made to these in Annex III.
Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for supporting this proposal, Mr Beysen for his work, and all the speakers, and I hope we will also achieve a swift solution in the Council.
The next item is the vote.
Draft general budget of the European Union - 2003 financial year
Draft amendments and proposed modifications to appropriations in Section III of the 2003 draft general budget concerning the Commission
Draft amendments to Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII of the 2003 draft general budget concerning the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman, and the European Data-Protection Supervisor
Mr President, before we begin the vote on the budget and the budgetary amendments, there are some statements I would like to make, some corrections and oral amendments that I would like put to the vote.
Firstly, I would like to inform colleagues in the Chamber that we have a very tight margin in category 3, for internal policies. It is only EUR 2.6 million.
If, as a result of the vote, we pass the ceiling, I would feel obliged to propose offsets and further reductions on other budget lines.
That is just a little warning.
Then there are some technical corrections.
First of all, amendment 662 on budget line B53004 (new) should not be subject to a separate vote because nobody has requested that.
It has been listed as a separate vote by mistake.
It should instead be voted on as part of block 4.
I will check this with all the political groups but, as I understand it, there is no problem.
We also have a technical adjustment in heading 5.
The amendments proposed reflect the announcement by Eurostat on 15 October.
We have new parameters for salaries in 2003.
The 2.6% increase has now been reduced to 2%.
The resulting adjustments to match the front loading in 2002 need to be made.
I will quickly read the figures for the record.
In Amendment 525, the final amount should be EUR 1 450 901 000 and nothing else.
In Amendment 556,the final amount is EUR 68 890 436.
In Amendment 650 on budget line A360, the final amount should read EUR 38 219 720.
Then we have two new amendments, because we had no amendments on pensions.
These are on budget line A1900, where the final amount should read EUR 412 887 000, and on budget line A6000, where the final amount should read EUR 124 456 000.
In Amendment 562 on budget line A7000, the final amount should read EUR 54 916 000.
Finally, in Amendment 527 on budget line A200, the final amount should be EUR 147 529 904.
We also have some technical corrections on agencies.
There is a separate remark for the agency enlargement costs.
They have now been slightly amended and should read as follows: for Amendment 583 on budget line B3-4201, the correct amount is EUR 7 150 000.
For Amendment 589, budget line B5-3111, the correct amount is EUR 300 000.
For Amendment 596, budget line B5-8301, the final amount is EUR 3 522 711.
Finally, we do not need a figure for Amendment 593, because it has been withdrawn.
There is no enlargement cost in that case.
There is one item which has to be voted on and that is budget line A-3014, one of the A-30 lines about European masters' courses in human rights and democratisation.
The reference here to the University of Padua is not correct.
It should be replaced by the European Inter-University Centre.
That is actually a new amendment to the draft budget and should be voted on at the beginning.
I would also like to tell the House that, in order to be consistent with the resolution, I will ask the sessional services to replace the second part of the first paragraph of the grounds for Amendment 644 on Afghanistan by paragraph 26 in the resolution, so that there is no difference between the wording of the resolution and the amendment.
I do not think that requires a vote, but I just wanted to point it out to the House.
Finally, a politically more important point, because it concerns North Korea and the discussions we have had on KEDO and nuclear issues.
Following the recent information on the declaration by the North Korean Government on the possible production of nuclear weapons, the Committee on Budgets, at its meeting this Monday, authorised me to table an oral amendment in plenary.
This proposes that the EU's total contribution to KEDO, which is EUR 20 million, be entered in the reserve, on the grounds that the North Korean Government has admitted it is working on the research and production of nuclear weapons.
This is clearly at odds with the general objectives of EU participation in the Euratom-Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation KEDO, which are 'to contribute to reinforcing and maintaining the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and to help achieve appropriate cooperation with both North Korea and South Korea to ensure the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy'.
The appropriations will be released from this reserve on the condition that, firstly, North Korea proves itself willing to respect the international non-proliferation regime and, secondly, that North Korea proves it has discontinued its nuclear weapons production programme.
This is also a new amendment to the draft budget and must, preferably, be voted on at the beginning.
Finally, when we come to category 4, I shall comment on two specific aspects of that category, but that is all I wish to say at this point.
Mr President, before proceeding with the vote let me draw Members' attention to the following oral amendments to heading 5.
Firstly, as the Council is now making a contribution to the frontloading operation, and given that Parliament will contribute almost EUR 43 million instead of EUR 40 million, which is what the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets decided on Monday evening, I propose that an amount of EUR 35 million should be taken back in 2003.
Thus Parliament's net contribution will amount to EUR 8 million.
Secondly, following Eurostat's new figure on salary adjustments, which is now reduced from 2.6% to 2%, the amounts entered in the different sections on staff expenditure also need to be adjusted accordingly.
I therefore suggest the following adjustments to the following amendments to reflect these changes.
Amendment 493, section - Parliament: a reduction of EUR 1.9 million on item 1100.
Amendment 715, section - Parliament: a reduction of EUR 3.1 million on item 209.
Amendment 514, concerning the Court of Justice: a reduction of EUR 500 000 on item 1100.
Amendment 516, concerning the Court of Auditors: a reduction of EUR 36 000 on item 1100.
Amendment 520, on the Economic and Social Committee: a reduction of EUR 236 000 on item 1100.
Amendment 522, on the Committee of the Regions: a reduction of EUR 102 000 on item 1100.
Finally, Amendment 523, concerning the Ombudsman: a reduction of EUR 11 000.
I will have to make further remarks on the resolution.
Mr President, I would just like to say that we are now going into category 4 - External Actions - and here we have a special situation because we have created a so-called 'asterisk' amendment.
We are above the ceiling of EUR 72 million.
This 'asterisk' amendment means that if we make any more increases after this block 5, credits for Afghanistan will be reduced.
I just wanted to warn everybody about this.
Of course, this is a first reading position, but still I wanted to inform you of the situation.
Mr President, this should, I hope, be the last time I speak in this vote.
Last Monday, we discussed East Timor in the Committee on Budgets, and I just want to explain what we are doing here.
To maintain a separate budget line for East Timor - which is very politically important for the Timorese Government and for many others - a split vote has been requested on Amendment 674.
In order to clarify the vote, I should like to explain that the split vote means that the first part will include the amounts.
If we vote in favour of the first part, we vote in favour of the increased amount, which is EUR 25.5 million.
As far as I know, that is acceptable to everybody.
The second part of the vote concerns the nomenclature.
If you want a separate line for East Timor - which is the rapporteur's recommendation, authorised by the Committee on Budgets - you should reject the second part of the amendment by the Committee on Budgets.
Thank you for those clarifications.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing the regret of Mrs Schreyer, my colleague, who cannot be here.
She has to be in Brussels this morning for discussions with the President, obviously on issues concerning the financing of enlargement and - equally obviously - before the Brussels European Council takes place.
Very briefly, on behalf of the Commission, I note with thanks Parliament's adoption of its negotiating position at this first reading on the 2003 draft budget.
The rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, have supported a position that gives a reasonable prospect for a constructive and prudent 2003 budget at second reading.
The Commission will respond rapidly and fully to Parliament's various requests and queries in order to encourage early resolution of the outstanding points before second reading.
We still have to finalise preparations for enlargement, but we are grateful to Parliament for its offers for 2002.
That will obviously ease the problems in 2003.
I shall make three other very brief points.
Firstly, we must, and will, pursue the administrative reforms vigorously.
A comprehensive progress report on reforms will be produced in January for Parliament to inspect.
Secondly, we shall update the Union's agricultural budget and fisheries agreement needs for 2003.
The Amending Letter will be put before the House next week.
Thirdly, the Commission notes Parliament's concern that neither of our institutions is sufficiently involved in preparations for possible Common Foreign and Security Policy joint actions or in estimating the funding required for such actions.
Clearly, the budget for external actions has yet to find a reasonable overall balance.
The Commission will, consequently, propose realistic solutions in the coming weeks to help the budgetary authority reach satisfactory conclusions.
Mr President, this is just a clarification, for the amendment should be in your voting list anyway.
I would just like to say that, at the very beginning of Amendment No 5, my group proposes that the word 'condemns' should be replaced with the word 'regrets'.
The European Parliament has passed the EU budget, voting down an EDD amendment calling for the reimbursement of MEPs' expenses at actual cost.
Amendments to this effect have been put down at successive budgets as long as I have been a member here, and have been rejected on every occasion.
At a time when the EU is celebrating enlargement, it is critical that the European Parliament demonstrate a commitment to financial probity and open accounting.
Once again, it has failed to do so.
In the vote on the budget, we have in general voted against the committee's proposals to increase the agricultural expenditure in category 1.
That is because we think that the EU's money can better be used in other areas where it is really needed.
It is unreasonable for approximately half of the EU's total budget to be spent each year on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products.
As it stands, the common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the EU but also contributes to higher consumer prices.
The export subsidies mean that the EU's food surpluses are dumped on the world market at low prices so that the food industry is placed at serious competitive disadvantages in many developing countries, for example.
The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly worth noting.
The EU's activities and budget should instead be directed at cross-border problems that the Member States cannot solve themselves.
The EU's agricultural policy in the form of export and production subsidies should therefore be phased out and replaced in part by subsidies promoting biological diversity and environmental measures.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of the first reading of the draft Union budget for 2003 because I felt it was a balanced and rigorous document, and pursues the guidelines laid down in Berlin, specifically with regard to the Financial Perspective for the use of the Structural Funds.
I wish to highlight two points from the proposal: the first is the refusal by the majority of Members of this House to reduce appropriations for supporting the running of European parties and parliamentary groups, a move which I supported; the second is the maintenance of the specific budget line for financial assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of East Timor, and the significant increase in this sum compared to the previous year, a decision that the European Parliament passed with an extremely large majority, fleshing out the proposal for an amendment tabled in the Committee on Budgets, to which I also subscribed.
We welcome the fact that the appropriation for combating HIV/AIDS is up by approximately EUR 200 million, or 60%, on the Council's proposal.
This shows that Parliament really does want to comply with the commitments we made when the Global Health Fund was set up.
In general, we Swedish Christian Democrats share Parliament's negotiating position on the issue of the budget.
There are nonetheless a number of points of widely differing character that we should particularly like to comment on.
We believe that, before we can approve the whole of the proposed amount, it is important for the Commission to be able to clarify how the aid for Israel and Palestine is to be used.
By approving, therefore, only half of the appropriation in the present situation, we are exerting pressure in the right direction.
It is encouraging that a start is being made on phasing out the subsidies for the transport of live animals, even though we should have preferred to have seen them removed completely.
We are sorry, however, that the aid for East Timor is being reduced, since the country is still in a phase of consolidation in the immediate aftermath of its declaration of independence.
We believe it is wrong to provide subsidies, to the tune of EUR 7 million, to European parties until such time as there is a legal basis for doing so, and we regret that the proposal to remove the appropriation was voted down by 393 votes to 76.
We were also in favour of a feasibility study for a civil peace corps, something which was, however, rejected.
- (SV) For quite a few years, the common sector in the Member States has been the victim of major cutbacks.
In that context, it is depressing to see that the EU's budget contains an incredibly large amount of unused resources and that there is a complete waste of money in certain cases.
There is a great deal of the EU's expenditure budget that we wish wholly or partially to abolish, such as agricultural subsidies, subsidies for the export of live animals to third countries, the greater part of regional aid, subsidies for tobacco cultivation and the running of the Economic and Social Committee and subsidies for European political parties, federalist EU organisations and the dissemination of EU/EMU propaganda.
This list of what we think are downright objectionable items of expenditure in the EU can be extended still further.
Another detail we have insisted on every year is that travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament should only be reimbursed in the case of actual costs that have arisen in connection with travel on EU business.
It is quite incredible that this issue can never be resolved, in spite of the fact that so many people purport to stand up for this principle.
The public funds spent by the EU can be better used in the Member States.
We believe that the Member States' contributions to the European Union can be reduced.
I voted against budget lines B7-6312, Arndt 605 and Arndt 361.
This funding for population and reproductive health care will be accessed to provide abortion in developing countries, according to the upcoming SandbÃŠk report.
The European Union has no legal right to provide or promote abortion and it is unacceptable to use public funding for this purpose within the Member States, candidate countries or developing countries where it is unacceptable to communities.
We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted against the amendments aimed at increasing the subsidies for agriculture.
We believe that the agricultural subsidies must be reduced.
A first step in the task of reforming agriculture would be to transfer resources to rural development.
On a slightly longer term view, it is not however enough merely to redistribute resources within the agricultural sector. Instead, the agricultural subsidies must also be considerably reduced.
That applies in particular to the tobacco subsidies.
The EU must not provide subsidies for the production of crops that endanger our lives as human beings.
. (FR) My colleagues and I from the Mouvement pour la France Group have signed the amendment removing the EUR 7 million appropriation for 'European parties' from the 2003 draft budget.
In effect, the Treaty of Nice, which provides for public financing for political parties 'at European level', has not yet come into force, and still less its essential implementing regulation.
We are well aware that the existing 'parties' are in need of money, for the Court of Auditors has declared their funding by certain Parliamentary groups of this House to be illegal.
We do not feel, however, that this is sufficient reason to disregard the fundamental provisions of the law.
Moreover, the implementing regulation drawn up last year in anticipation did not comply with the conditions of respect for national constitutional rules on neutrality in the funding of national politics and equal treatment of all the political groupings represented at the European Parliament, as they were defined by Declaration No 11 of the Treaty of Nice.
Basically, we can only reaffirm our rejection of this kind of funding, which will cost the taxpayer a lot of money and only provide minimal resources for European parties which have no real substance.
For quite a few years, the common sector in the Member States has been the victim of major cutbacks.
In that context, it is depressing to see that the EU's budget contains an incredibly large amount of unused resources and that there is a complete waste of money in certain cases.
There is a great deal of the EU's expenditure budget that we wish wholly or partially to abolish, such as agricultural subsidies, subsidies for the export of live animals to third countries, the greater part of regional aid, subsidies for tobacco cultivation and the running of the Economic and Social Committee and subsidies for European political parties, federalist EU organisations and the dissemination of EU/EMU propaganda.
This list of what we think are downright objectionable items of expenditure in the EU can be extended still further.
Another detail we have insisted on every year is that travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament should only be reimbursed in the case of actual costs that have arisen in connection with travel on EU business.
It is quite incredible that this issue can never be resolved, in spite of the fact that so many people purport to stand up for this principle.
The public funds spent by the EU can be better used in the Member States.
We believe that the Member States' contributions to the European Union can be reduced.
.
(FR) Of course, our group endorses the European Parliament's refusal to allow the Council of Ministers to cut agricultural market expenditure across the board and the reestablishment of this expenditure at the level laid down by the 2003 preliminary draft budget. Our group also welcomes the adoption of its amendment by the Committee on Budgets, an amendment seeking to increase by EUR 20 million the appropriations facilitating the establishing of young farmers in rural areas, an initiative which is proving very successful in France.
At the start of the Brussels European Council, however, we must not lose sight of the serious threats to the CAP posed by a new, historic enlargement of the European Union.
Indeed, the agreement on Europe's Financial Perspective, which will be valid until 2006 and which was obtained at such high cost to France at the 1999 Berlin Summit, must not be jeopardised in the name of enlargement, considering that the last year of implementation of the current Financial Perspective will also be the year when the CAP is reformed and that France will henceforth be a net contributor to the European Union Budget.
The burden of the automatic increase in enlargement-related agricultural expenditure must not be borne by French farmers, and if farm subsidies were to be revised in 2006, this revision would, of course, have to include the Structural Funds and each country's contribution to the European budget.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) I roundly welcome the decision, in the framework of the general budget of the European Union, to maintain both a specific line for aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of East Timor, and for an appropriate level of funding.
The vote on the special function of the two parts of Amendment No 674, in terms that the roll-call vote makes quite clear, merely continues the spirit of intense cooperation and solidarity that the European Union has demonstrated towards the world's most recent nation.
Let us remember the award of the 1999 Sakharov Prize, by the European Parliament, to the current President of East Timor, Xanana GusmÃ£o, and the promise of assistance in consolidating the new nation, marvellously expressed in the European Parliament's resolution of 4/10/2001.
The processing of this specific budget line in Parliament rewards the attention, the tenacity and the excellent coordination between the Members who are best informed and best disposed towards East Timor, specifically the Portuguese Members from the various benches in this House.
Given the extremely broad majority achieved in plenary, however, it is also a sign that Parliament remains equal to its political and moral responsibilities and is not breaking the commitments it has given to the Timorese people.
This is indeed extremely gratifying.
.
(PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Asensio on the report he has drawn up on the Parliament and Council proposal aiming to lay down common standards for the compiling of Community statistics on the rail transport of goods and passengers, including information on safety, which I fully support.
Since this proposal has achieved the broad consensus of the various actors involved, I simply wish to emphasise that adopting this legislative instrument will facilitate, in the framework of common transport policy, the evaluation of the common rail sector, thereby making informed decision-making possible, specifically on providing a greater incentive in the future for rapid, comfortable and safe rail traffic within and between Member States and between Member States and third countries, as an alternative to today's excessive surface and air congestion, to the benefit of users and, doubtless, of the environment itself.
. (PT) The promotion of rail transport - in the same way as short-sea shipping or cabotage - as a safer and more ecological alternative to the congestion on road links has, for a long time, been an extremely important basic guideline.
In order to ensure, however, that this proposal is based on a fruitful and objective debate, it is crucial that we have a rigorous and reliable understanding of the realities of the sector, both in terms of determining the urgency of the strategic decisions to be taken - especially priority destinations and journeys - and in terms of measures to achieve a desirable reduction in road transport.
This is the importance of this proposal for a regulation, which is intended to update and adapt rail transport statistics in order to be able to provide better monitoring and a more accurate analysis of developments in the sector, bearing in mind the measures that are to be adopted under the rail package.
Now that we have reached this phase, I welcome the fact that a common position has been achieved in Council - with some amendments tabled by Parliament also being adopted - demonstrating that this is a subject that unites more than it divides and which could have an enormously positive impact on the quality of life of future European citizens.
These are the reasons why I have fully supported this report.
I am chairman of the C.N. Group, which owns several newspapers.
For that reason, in order to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest, I shall not participate in the vote on this report.
In Sweden, freedom of expression has been protected by the constitution since 1766.
The Directive on Insider Trading and Market Manipulation has given rise to debate and to some degree of unease, since there is a continued wish to protect journalists' right to freedom of expression, even once the directive has come into force.
We believe however that we have received both sufficient explanations of why the directive is of great importance in terms of the desire, for example, to prevent financial speculation harmful to the private individual, and sufficient assurances that the directive will not have any effect upon the Swedish constitution.
The directive as a whole has an important role to play in creating a free and more efficient financial market demanding sound consumer and investment protection.
The amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party would bring financial journalism within the scope of the directive, but responsibility for implementation would be left to existing self-regulating bodies.
That is why we have today voted in favour of the Directive on Insider Trading and Market Manipulation.
. (PT) The proposal we are now voting on, concerning insider dealing and the manipulation of the market (market abuse) is, as has been mentioned by our fellow Member and rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, crucial in terms of principles.
The importance of this directive, together with the urgent need for its adoption, justify my use of the right to submit an explanation of vote in writing, despite the fact that I am not a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and, consequently, this is not an issue with which I have been particularly closely involved.
I am, therefore, using this device to reaffirm the need for a vote in favour of the recommendation in question.
Behaviour of the type that has led to the succession of scandals in the American financial markets, as well as some forms of market manipulation covered by the directive, must be penalised effectively and efficiently.
This is crucial not only as a matter of principle, as I said at the beginning of my intervention, but also as a means of helping to restore confidence in the financial markets.
This explains the spirit of consensus achieved at first reading, which I welcome.
. (PT) The series of scandals affecting US financial markets has highlighted the lack of professional integrity among certain financial intermediaries, as the rapporteur states, thereby compromising, in fact, the very trust of public and private investors and at the same time, casting doubts, suspicions and uncertainties over all economic actors and creating widespread unease in the world economy.
I have voted in favour of this report's amendments because they make a more effective contribution to the fight that must be pursued tenaciously against the darker side of a globalisation that has also promoted a new form of economic crime, along with distortions, cover-ups and manipulations.
I think that this must be the approach to adopt if confidence is to be restored in economic actors and this is a prerequisite for our being able to achieve a genuine area of freedom, security and justice and move towards the much hoped-for 'most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, based on knowledge and able to guarantee sustainable growth, with more and better employment and greater social cohesion' as defined in the Lisbon Strategy.
I believe that the amendment tabled by the rapporteur calling for statements of transactions made by persons discharging managerial responsibilities within an issuer of financial instruments to be made rapidly accessible to investors is particularly relevant.
. (FR) It is disgraceful that the rapporteur is proposing to reduce the compensation amounts proposed by the Commission, with more concern for the financial well-being of the airlines than the interests of the passengers who are the victims of their commercial practices.
In the same way, he extols the merits of deregulation of the air transport sector, presenting it, against all evidence, as of benefit to travellers, whereas its sole purpose is to allow airlines to increase their profits. It has also served to increase the chaos in the sector, the primary victims of which are those working in the sector and air transport users.
If we have not voted against this report, abstaining instead, it is only because, despite its limitations, it might lead to air transport passengers receiving a little more compensation in the event of overbooking, cancellation or long delays of flights.
We believe, for reasons of justice, that two levels of compensation for passengers would be the best solution, in practice one within the EU and one outside the EU.
In the absence of alternatives, we are, however, voting with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that is to say for three levels of compensation.
. (PT) I wish to express my support for the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Giorgio Lisi, to the initiative of the European Commission, establishing rules for the compensation and assistance of airline passengers in the event of 'overbooking', cancellation or delayed flights.
We are all familiar with or have been victims of such practices, which throw travel arrangements into disarray.
Under this initiative, air operators will appeal for 'volunteers' who, by giving up their seat, shall be offered a choice between having the cost of their ticket reimbursed, or being re-routed to their final destination.
Customers who are denied boarding without having agreed to this shall be awarded financial compensation in proportion to the distance of the flight.
These rules shall apply both to cases of 'overbooking', and the cancellation or delay of flights operated by regular and charter airlines.
. (PT) The liberalisation of air transport has brought clear advantages for airline passengers.
One need only think of the significant reduction in air ticket prices and, consequently, the impressive increase in passenger numbers.
In a broadly positive climate for the consumer, there are still, regardless of security problems, aspects that require some attention and which have often led to justifiable complaints by these very users, especially with regard to disruptions caused by the delay or cancellation of flights.
I have, therefore, voted in favour of the entire range of proposals aimed at establishing appropriate compensation tariffs for disruption suffered by passengers as a result of overbooking practised by airlines, as part of a policy that imposes clearly-defined responsibilities on these carriers.
. (PT) The liberalisation of air transport has brought clear advantages for airline passengers.
One need only think of the significant reduction in air ticket prices and, consequently, the impressive increase in passenger numbers.
To this we can add that the internal market itself is underpinned by the freedom of movement.
There are, however, from the point of view of the passenger/consumer, certain aspects that need to be looked at once again, specifically with regard to the all too common practice of what is known as 'overbooking' by airlines and to those cases (not covered in the previous set of regulations) in which passengers are re-routed onto other flights which take them on to their final destination, albeit with some delay.
The current situation has resulted in justifiable complaints from passengers, especially with regard to the disruption and trouble caused by delayed or cancelled flights.
Many airlines have committed themselves to responding better to passenger expectations, but what is really needed is a new regulatory framework to protect passengers' rights.
This is the aim of the Commission proposal and also of the Lisi Report.
I have voted in favour of this report, all the more because it has weighed up the various interests in this field and contains a set of reasonable compromises which, for this very reason, received the broad consensus of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
.
The ELDR Group supported the Lisi report.
However, we maintain serious reservations with regard to the Commission's proposal on air passenger compensation for the following reasons:
1) The Commission's proposal has not undergone a proper economic impact assessment, to determine the potential effect on ticket prices and consumer choice.
Such an assessment is fundamental to ensuring that the proposed system is sustainable in practice.
2) Both the proposal and Parliament's compromise fail to recognise the fundamental difference between the usual circumstances leading to denied boarding and those leading to cancellations.
Whilst denied boarding usually results from deliberate overbooking, cancellation is very often due to circumstances beyond the airline's control - for example, air traffic control.
Parliament's definition of 'force majeure' is an inadequate safeguard in this respect.
