In the case of many of the proposals, such as those concerning economic migration and increased opportunities to combine gainful employment and family, we have been a driving force in national policy.
However, the Swedish Conservatives have chosen to vote against the report because several of the proposals cross the boundaries of the principle of subsidiarity.
We do not, for example, consider that the European Parliament should concern itself with treatment programmes at correctional institutions or the treatment of gambling addiction.
Nor should the European Parliament have opinions on the regime under which Member States choose to operate their health care, and we do not accept the assertion that deregulation would damage the quality of care.
Labour market policy measures, such as the introduction of minimum wages, should also be left to be decided at the national level.
in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of the report because it records important data on the social situation: 78 million European citizens continue to live in poverty, 8% of the European Union suffers from in-work poverty and the gap between rich and poor in many Member States is increasing.
It also includes some positive recommendations, such as the need to fix a decent minimum wage, protect unemployment benefit and support people with disabilities, although it does not tackle the root causes of the social situation and does not call for an end to neoliberal policies, which we are proposing.
Consequently, few demands are made as regards the policy changes required.
Unfortunately, it only partly includes the proposals in my opinion adopted in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, among which I would highlight the appeal to the Community institutions and the Member States to give maximum priority to women's social integration and women's rights, by altering their respective policies accordingly, including that on income distribution policy.
in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues believe that social policy should be for Member States to decide.
We are anxious that European competences should not be extended in this sphere and that countries should not be pressured to adopt policies that could be unhelpful to their well-being in economic and social terms.
We also believe that the 'European social model' is a barrier to economic and social development.
There are issues in this report which we support, such as helping people out of poverty, assisting people back into work, support for disabled people and care for the elderly.
Policies in these and other social matters are best delivered by Member States, taking account of national circumstances.
We believe fundamentally that strong economies are the best route to obtaining social progress in societies.
in writing. - (FR) This report on social reality stocktaking in Europe sets out its true economic and social condition from the start.
It is an admission of powerlessness within an ocean of Europeanist absurdities churned out by the ultraliberal, globalist thought police.
Since 2000, none of the measures to combat unemployment, poverty and exclusion have achieved anything.
Worse still, while the European Union calls for greater economic immigration and the protection of its so-called social model, the report reminds us that 78 million Europeans are living in poverty.
It forgets to mention what accompanies the hell of poverty, which is not just economic.
It is psychological for millions of Europeans who feel culturally and socially adrift on their own soil as they watch their work disappearing abroad in relocations.
It is also physical, when violence and insecurity largely generated by immigrant populations frustrated by the difficulties they have in integrating aggravate the whole situation.
The solution is therefore not to recognise the hybrid ultraliberal schizophrenic European system, but to challenge it in order to put forward a Europe of recovered identities, which applies protection and Community preference to Europeans first of all!
I agree that social integration and social security are among the European Union's fundamental values and are a fundamental right of all citizens.
The report correctly stresses the need to take ethnic and faith-based heterogeneity into account in EU legislation in order to protect all people from violence and discrimination.
I also agree with the formula that access to goods and services should be the right of every EU citizen.
Social policy falls to a large extent under the competence of the Member States which is why I am in favour of promoting the open method of coordination as well as the exchange of best practices aimed at combating social exclusion.
Social security systems must be based on principles which motivate the recipients to seek employment opportunities and not act as a perverse incentive for inactivity.
The low level of education of the population and the high school dropout rate should make us stop and think, since it is the least qualified individuals who are the most vulnerable to social exclusion.
This situation is particularly worrying in my country, Portugal, where in 2005 more than 39% of young people (aged between 18 and 24) had completed only lower secondary school education.
That trend must be reversed and citizens must be given the necessary skills for a successful entry into the labour market.
Since this proposal goes along those lines, I voted in favour of it.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of Mrs Lynne's report on social reality stocktaking.
She has quite rightly commented that the revived Lisbon Strategy focuses not only on economic results and competitiveness, but also on a drive for greater social cohesion and the social dimension of sustainable growth.
Social integration and social security are fundamental EU values. They are the fundamental right of everyone, regardless of their ethnic origin, age, gender, level of disability, sexual orientation or faith.
Unfortunately, part of EU society continues to live in poverty.
Member States are proposing various forms of protection from poverty and social exclusion. I therefore believe that there should be a deepening of cooperation and an exchange of best practice models between Member States in this area.
Attention should also be given to the problem of youth unemployment and to the fight against child poverty, as children from poor families have less opportunity to access future employment.
There are many praiseworthy statements about anti-discrimination and the importance of equal treatment in this report which deserve attention.
Unfortunately, it also contains extremely far-reaching statements concerning, among other things, the introduction of minimum wages.
Sweden is opposed to politically determined minimum wages.
Quite regardless of what people think is reasonable social policy, the EU must accept that Member States choose different solutions.
This must not become yet another example of where the EU goes in and regulates in detail in an area which must lie entirely and completely at the Member State level.
The EU countries are also at very different levels of development. Introducing minimum wages will prevent the poorest countries from competing.

Christian communities in the Middle East (debate)
The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Christian communities in the Middle East.
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, religious freedom is an objective factor in recognising respect for human rights.
The violence suffered by Christians around the world is both an affront and a challenge to human dignity.
I intended to table this draft resolution at the last plenary in October, but the coordinator of the political groups asked me to postpone the resolution until the November plenary, to give us time to prepare a more detailed text backed by a broader consensus.
In the text that we will be voting on this afternoon, which is the result of a compromise between socialists, liberals, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and the Independence and Democracy Group, the salient features of the initial draft resolution have remained.
We have also been able to insert concrete references to acts of violence and abuses committed this year not only in the Middle East, but in other parts of the world against Christian communities.
These events mainly concern Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, China and Vietnam, and in fact the intense coordination carried out in the last few days and the consequent unearthing of numerous episodes that have occurred outside the Middle East has led us to find a new, more fitting title, which is 'serious events which compromise Christian communities' existence and those of other religious communities'.
Obviously the text does not include all violence perpetrated against Christians, such as in Eritrea and North Korea.
However, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to recognise the political message of this text, which is also aimed at those countries and incidents that have not been mentioned.
From the outset, having to liaise with other groups has allowed me to clarify that this resolution in no way intends to rekindle conflict between civilisations.
Europe has always been first in line when it comes to protecting minority rights and cannot continue to ignore the increasing harm being inflicted on so many Christians.
Today, ladies and gentlemen, our Parliament can express itself on an urgent and important subject, for the protection of life and religious freedom, not only of Christians, but of millions of people of all faiths.
I would therefore ask...
(The President cut off the speaker)
author. - Madam President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group to give our total support to this joint motion for a resolution on religious persecution.
In one minute I can only touch on some elements of that resolution, and want to focus on the plight of the indigenous Christian community in Iraq, which at one time represented almost 10 % of the population.
As someone who supports and is supported by the Save the Assyrians campaign, I have to say that this Parliament is wont to rest on compromising consensus, which sometimes results in a levelling and a loss of meaning.
That is true of this resolution.
Recital K deplores the situation of Assyrian villages in Turkish border areas.
Why?
Because the Turkish Government is actually shelling Assyrian villages, claiming that they contain PKK militants, which seems to be an unlikely situation.
In recital S it also refers to the situation in Syria, to where tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of refugees have fled from Jordan and Iraq, but the border is now being closed.
What is needed is help and assistance.
Madam President, may I begin by expressing my satisfaction and by thanking the other co-authors of the resolution dealing with such an important problem as the events surrounding Christian communities in certain Middle Eastern states, as well as on a world scale.
At the same time, as one of the signatories to this resolution, I would like to emphasise that a guarantee of religious freedom is the first step towards assuring fundamental human rights, and the instances of persecution of Christians that occur around the world are a basic example of violation of these rights.
Furthermore, while mindful of the fact that we are seeing a lack of any reaction on this matter from authorities, institutions and political movements around the world, I would like once again to stress the significance of the resolution under discussion for defence of the rights of Christians and to emphasise that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully supports it.
author. - (FR) Madam President, I dare not think what the expressions on the faces of my PPE fellow Members would be if they found out that a resolution on Muslim communities in Europe had been adopted by the Gulf States or by ASEAN.
It would be felt as a nasty shock, a sign of aggression, an unacceptable intrusion by a religious authority in a non-EU country into relations between our Member States and religious minorities.
Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you is also a Christian precept.
Seriously, would such a resolution be perceived as a call for tolerance and intercultural and religious dialogue?
Certainly not!
The European Union, so proud of its values, would be well advised to demonstrate on these ultra-sensitive issues a modicum of discernment and respect for international conventions.
To tackle violations of the rights of people from religious minorities, to condemn the murder of Christians or restrictions on freedom to worship, we have a choice between two equally well-founded approaches.
The first is to talk to a country, on the basis of its international commitments and the agreements between us, and ask it to investigate, try those responsible, and ensure the rights of religious minorities are respected, and that is what we do here regularly.
The second approach is that taken by the United Nations, through a resolution tabled by 12 countries and by all the EU states, concerning the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion, beliefs, and freedom of thought and conscience because, in international law - and this is very valuable - they are linked.
An individual's rights to belief, to religion, to thought and to conscience are interdependent.
What will we be doing today if we adopt this unacceptable text you are proposing?
We will be ignoring the work being done by our Member States at the United Nations and taking a different approach which is likely to encourage certain countries to exploit religious issues in their international relations.
We will be going against the balanced approach recommended, for example, by Mrs Jahangir, United Nations Special Rapporteur, currently under house arrest in Pakistan, and at the end of the day we will also be making the situation of religious minorities throughout the world, including Christians, more fragile.
Once again, together with experts working on religious freedom, such as Christian Solidarity Worldwide, I say that this resolution simply increases the danger for those we want to protect.
author. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we really have fundamental rights at heart, we cannot fail to be concerned by the precarious position of Christian communities in the Middle East.
The present motion for a resolution spurs all the European institutions on in this regard.
A recent delegation visit by our Parliament gave us more insight into the daily life of Lebanese Christians. They fear ending up in a kind of second-class position like their co-religionists in almost all the countries of the region.
They are faced with a direct choice between personal safety and personal dignity, their religious convictions.
Today's Lebanese Christians want to retain both.
The actual political violence of recent years is now directly affecting Christians in the land of the cedar.
An informant in Lebanon said just this week that, even though Christians are not the primary targets, the majority of politicians assassinated are from Christian backgrounds, as are the journalists who have become the target of attacks, and this intimidates the Christian population in Lebanon.
author. - Madam President, for thousands of years man's presence on earth has been subjected to the perils of lethal forces outwith his powers of defence or understanding.
Such forces range from disastrous natural phenomena to incomprehensible somatic and mental illnesses.
Man's powerless status has been made easier to cope with through his belief in a superpower entity he called 'God'.
Different human groups developed a different understanding and a different approach to God.
The result has been the creation of a large number of religions.
Such religions are, of course, man-made and not God-made and therefore suffer from several weaknesses.
Such weaknesses include fanaticism, dogmatism and failure to accept other people's right to believe differently.
These weaknesses differ in number and in intensity amongst different religions and unfortunately they have often been exploited by extremist religious leaders and unscrupulous politicians.
This has led to religious wars and to the committing of despicable crimes against human beings in the name of religion.
Both Christianity and Islam, two of mankind's main religions, have not been exempt from these sad inflictions and history is full of shameful examples to illustrate the point.
Of course, with the passage of time, most religions became more mature and more humanistic and this is certainly true with Christianity.
But this change has not happened with some other religions, unfortunately.
This is why in some countries, mainly Islamic countries, Christians are being persecuted, sometimes with extreme criminal vigour and sometimes with the consent of political groups and even governments.
This is indeed a very sad state of affairs, which involves a range of countries or regions worldwide - some of them have already been mentioned in this Chamber today - but it is more specific in the Middle East.
With this resolution we hope to bring attention to the persecution of Christians in these countries and hopefully to help in making sure that the authorities, both political and religious, in such countries fully understand that such aggressive behaviour is neither compatible with the principles of respect for human rights nor with the true teachings of a caring religion.
Thank you Madam President, as you can see I still have 20 seconds to spare!
author. - (NL) Madam President, the Christian communities in the Middle East date back to the early years of Christianity. They predate both Christianity in Europe and Islam in the Middle East.
Yet these days they are often seen as an alien element in what is now a predominantly Islamic area.
This is not merely the result of religious intolerance from certain quarters within Islam; the blame also lies with Europe.
Three times in history, Europe and Christianity have aroused aversion and hatred in that region.
The first time was the crusades in the late Middle Ages, when occupying European armies took control of sites holy not only to Christians but also to Jews and Muslims.
The second time followed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of last century, when Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Iraq came under British colonial control and Syria and Lebanon under French colonial control.
We are currently in the third phase.
Europe's positions on Israel, Palestine and Iraq arouse great opposition in the Middle East, where Europe is suspected of focusing primarily on its own energy supplies, on safeguarding its own transport routes and on giving preferential treatment to those ethnic or religious minorities best disposed towards it.
One possible consequence is that Christian minorities may be unable to hold their own in the Middle East in the long term and be doomed to flee to Europe.
Giving Christians and Jews in the Middle East leeway is a better solution, as indeed Europe must do to its Islamic minority.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, if you will pardon my saying so, Mrs Flautre is talking nonsense.
Muslims do a huge amount for Muslim minorities.
We support Muslim and other religious minorities.
However, it is unfortunately true that if we do not do anything for Christians, nobody will.
The Islamic or Arab League has never championed the rights of Christians as we have the rights of Muslims.
It is therefore high time that we put this matter on the agenda.
It is an act of justice, whereby I must say emphatically that the problem is not Islam.
Christians in the Middle East have survived 1 200 years under Islamic rule.
It is in our supposedly so advanced age that they are seriously endangered, especially in Iraq, which is occupied by the West.
We must acknowledge our own responsibility to make it possible for them to survive and live in freedom and dignity.
Most religious persecution takes place in communist China, in pseudo-Christian nationalist Russia, in communist dictatorships - and also under Islamic regimes.
For me, Islamism is simply a perverse dictatorship and ideology of the twentieth century.
We Europeans have a duty in this regard, and we shall perform it.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President, congratulations to the authors of this joint motion.
I should like to mention that it is appropriate to remember that before the persecution of Christians we had the persecution, for example, of the Jews, and we had and still have persecution of the Yazidis, the Mandians and the Muslims themselves, whether Shiite or Sunni, in Iraq.
It would not be fair or proportionate to compare what is happening in Iraq to what is happening in Europe.
In fact it must be remembered that those who are persecuted in Iraq unfortunately do not have, in Europe, the protection to which they are entitled, whether Christian or non-Christian.
There are absolutely incredible cases of a total lack of sensitivity on the part of our European Union as regards persecuted Iraqis.
May I end by reminding you, not to detract from all others, of Father Ragheed Ganni and the entire congregation of the Church of the Holy Spirit in Mosul, perhaps the most monstrous crime committed this year.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, we are talking here today about the brutal persecution of Christians, particularly in the Middle East. We should not lose sight of the fact that Christians are persecuted throughout the world, however, and I do not agree with what Mr Casaca said about there being very many religious minorities who are persecuted.
Please could he provide examples of where these minorities are being persecuted on any major scale; I am not talking about the chance killing, however reprehensible, of an infidel, but of cases where another religion is persecuted in the way that Christians are persecuted.
I fully agree with Mr Posselt, and I agree with much else that has been said, where dozens of examples of persecution of Christians have been mentioned, but not, as Mr Casaca claims, of many other religions.
It is not true.
Christians are the main objects of persecution, and it is mainly Christians who are persecuted.
Yesterday in Parliament we heard a speech from President Sarkozy, who spoke of the need to defend Europe's identity.
What is this identity?
Who will defend us if we do not defend ourselves and the roots of our identity?
Christians in the Middle East bear witness to our European identity.
They have been there for 2 000 years and we must defend them if they are to remain there.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today, with this motion for a resolution, we are taking an important step, because this Parliament must always condemn acts and events that endanger the lives of men and women on the grounds of their faith, religious beliefs or political opinion.
Religious freedom is a value that we must bring to the fore.
Although it is true that in some cases Christians risk persecution and criminalisation, it is for this reason that Parliament must protect and defend them, just as this Parliament has always protected and defended Muslim citizens who have been the victims of discrimination in the West.
We believe that all religions can play a positive role, a peacekeeping role, to encourage respect for diversity.
For this reason we must strongly condemn any form of religious fundamentalism, which is so often a factor in conflict.
I believe that this Parliament must always endeavour to listen and promote interreligious dialogue.
There are some notable examples that show how it is possible to construct a solution in which religions can listen to each other and build on common ground.
I am also anxious to recall the sacrifice of some Catholics, some Christians, who have fought to free the poor, for peoples and for social liberation.
This is why our group is voting in favour of this resolution, in memory of priests such as Peppino Diana and Pino Puglisi, who died because of their stance against the mafia and organised crime in general.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I welcome this joint motion for a resolution, since I regard it as vital that we protect Christian minorities in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
It is important that we protect all religious communities from persecution.
I regard it as appalling that people have to face constraints in their daily routine, in what they can do and where they can go, in their ability to own property and to get an education or a job, as well as threats on their life, because of their Christian affiliation.
The freedom of religious observance is a fundamental human right and thus it is essential that governments ensure that even the religious minorities in their countries can practise their beliefs free from any restraint, that is to say without there being a threat to their life or anything else.
Muslims must realise that they must promote the principle of religious freedom and tolerance, the same freedom and tolerance for their adherence that they enjoy and expect to enjoy in our countries, many of which have large Christian populations.
(FI) Madam President, I set great store by Mr Mauro's initiative.
Every day peace-loving Christians are under threat of systematic oppression and are used as scapegoats in crises they are not involved in.
This is totally reprehensible and an issue it is necessary to highlight.
Actually to improve the position of Christians, however, it is important to understand the problem as part of a wider whole.
It is not only Christians who are having difficulties, but in many countries Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Sikhs and Ahmadis also have problems. The list is long.
Freedom of religion is essential for a society which respects human rights and civil liberties.
It is, as it were, a meta-right, in practice a prerequisite for the existence of other human rights, which reflects the condition of society as a whole.
If a society starts to get ill, it is visible first in the shape of restrictions on freedom of religion and in the status of religious minorities.
For this reason we have to show our firm support for the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on freedom of religion.
It is worth noting that in many countries, like Pakistan and Indonesia, religious communities are striving jointly to establish freedom of religion and the protection of minorities.
Religion itself might therefore also be a solution.
A pluralist dialogue always leads to less tension and benefits freedom of religion and society as a whole.
(PT) The persecution of religious minorities in many countries should make us reflect upon the fragility of the aspects of civilisation which we think we have achieved.
Religious freedom is an essential and inalienable pillar of universal human rights.
Despite the laudable intentions, this resolution is incomplete.
The EP must speak up about the persecution of Christian minorities in particular, but first on all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on faith or religion which, in fact, affect all religious communities.
We should also be worried about Islamophobia and anti-Semitism which are on the increase in Europe and elsewhere.
If we focus almost exclusively on discrimination against Christians, we might give the wrong impression.
It therefore needs to be stressed that the EP fully supports the resolution on the eradication of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief presented by the EU Member States to the UN General Assembly.
- (PL) Madam President, the Middle East also has its Christian roots.
Regardless of the differences between them, the Christians there have managed on many occasions to demonstrate that they are able to live alongside Muslims, Jews or followers of other religions in peace and mutual respect.
Lately, however, we have seen actions by adherents of the Islamic faith that have come down to a practical implementation of the false notion that being anti-Christian shows what a good Muslim you are.
The Lebanese journalist Hazem Saghieh made this point recently.
Numerous and often drastic instances of violations of the rights of people who, solely because of their Christian faith, are treated as second-class citizens are evidence of the violation of the fundamental principle of human freedom: the freedom to practise a faith.
The question needs to be asked: What can we in the European Union, which is open to and respects the rights of Muslim co-citizens, do for Christians who do not even have a modest fraction of such rights in those countries?
Where is there the slightest reciprocity?
There is none to be found in religiously motivated murders, nor in widespread discrimination, nor in the failure to give consent to the building of Christian churches, nor in the ruination of memorials to Christian culture.
The whole world wants peace, and people want freedom, including religious freedom.
- (PL) Madam President, the current political situation in the Middle East means that Christians who live in that region are feeling increasingly threatened.
One reason for this is the rise in the influence of Islamic fundamentalists, who heap blame on them for every failure suffered by the people of the region.
Because of their religious ties with people in the West, they are also accused of westernising the traditional social structures, about which people in the Middle East are very unwilling to speak.
One way in which the fundamentalists express their dissatisfaction is by organising anti-Western demonstrations, during which they destroy symbols associated with Christianity and shops run by Christians.
In extreme cases even murders are committed.
The passiveness of governments means that increasing numbers of Christian families are deciding to emigrate.
The resolution outlines a number of problems encountered by Christians in the Middle East.
These are not all the examples, however, so in my view the European Parliament should prepare a full-scale report on the situation of Christians in the Middle East, or the situation of religious faiths generally.
We should also give some thought to how to conduct a dialogue between civilisations that enables Christian society and Muslim regions to be involved effectively.
- (PL) Madam President, I congratulate Mr Mauro. I have no doubts whatsoever about this resolution.
I support it wholeheartedly. The only problem is whether we are effective, whether we will be effective and whether we will change anything.
There are three ways in which we can act.
The first way is through diplomatic pressure.
That is what we are currently doing.
European governments need to be mobilised too, however.
Every diplomat should bear this in mind.
We must push for such actions in bilateral and multilateral talks.
The only way to get a good result here is through large-scale diplomatic pressure.
The second way is through economic sanctions.
I know from my own country's experience 20 or 30 years ago what economic sanctions meant for the Communist government in Warsaw - well selected sanctions, so as not to cause harm to citizens.
We must use this method too.
The final way is through thorough analysis of our actions, because countries in the Middle East and other parts of the world have their ups and downs.
This also depends on our actions, which are not always very coherent or prudent.
This means intervention, cultural events, and also speeches from diplomats.
We do not want to hide our convictions.
Quite the contrary - we want to show them clearly.
However, we must act not only firmly but also judiciously.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is aware of and strongly condemns discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief.
Our policy is to fight all types of discrimination, and we do it in bilateral relations and multilateral forums such as the UN.
At the UN General Assembly, the EU has taken the approach of tabling its customary resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief.
Last year, the consensus on the text of the resolution gathered a record 99 co-sponsors.
Together with the Member States, we are paying very close attention to the human rights and democracy situation in partner countries.
We raise those issues in political dialogue meetings via demarches and public statements, reminding partners of their commitments under international law prohibiting discrimination on any grounds.
The EU is actively seeking to advance the cause of human rights protection under the Neighbourhood Policy.
The European Neighbourhood Policy action plans cover a wide range of issues in this regard.
The individual meetings of the Subcommittee on Human Rights with Jordan, Israel, Morocco, Lebanon and Tunisia have already reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the ENP action plans' commitments on human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The first meeting of the Human Rights Subcommittee with Egypt is scheduled for later this month.
In parallel with bilateral contacts with governments and support for political reforms, we are supporting non-governmental organisations worldwide that are active in protecting and promoting human rights.
We believe that human rights defenders play an indispensable role in society.
We find it equally important to maintain and further increase freedom of religion in Europe.
The EU can show and share good practices.
Mr Casaca has asked to make a personal statement, in accordance with Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure.
(PT) Madam President, I am sorry if I did not make myself sufficiently clear.
I stand in total and unreserved solidarity with the Christian communities persecuted throughout the Middle East, especially in Iraq.
I merely pointed out, and I intend to provide my fellow member with everything he regards as necessary, that such persecution was unfortunately not confined to the Christian community and that the Yazidi community, the Mandian community, the Shiites and Sunnis themselves, who are outside the majority communities, have also been subject to terrible persecution in that country; that is a fact that no one can ignore.
I just wanted to stress that and say that I am willing to provide all the documentation required.
Mr Casaca, you have exceeded the time limit for making a personal statement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.

Uzbekistan (debate)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uzbekistan.
(ET) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to recall what the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said in this very Chamber a couple of days ago: all those who have failed to respect our values, preferring instead to win contracts, have lost out on all fronts as a result.
Where Uzbekistan and more broadly the whole of Central Asia are concerned, there is a danger that in assessing the region's energy resources the interests of individual countries will begin to prevail over our common values.
Unfortunately, this is also apparent in the inability to agree on a motion for a resolution in support of the EPP and the UEN on the Council Decision suspending the visa ban on Uzbek officials for six months without a genuine change in the human rights situation.
The motion for a resolution also refers to the very critical human rights situation in Uzbekistan.
To date, however, there has been an understanding in Uzbekistan, and I heard this with my own ears, that human rights are an internal matter for that country.
We cannot agree to this approach and I urge you to support the first, more critical version of the motion for a resolution.
author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a democratic institution, we cannot allow human rights to be trampled on anywhere in the world.
However, we find it equally unacceptable if, within this very House, diplomatic relationships and interparliamentary cooperation between the EU and Uzbekistan are risked without giving it a thought.
When I look at the motions for resolutions presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the left-wing groups, it is tantamount to a diplomatic demolition derby.
In Parliament's last resolution, dated October 2006, we committed ourselves to a constructive, dialogue-oriented solution.
Today, however, we are not seeking dialogue but slamming a door shut.
My group cannot answer for this, so I ask you to reject the motions for resolutions by the PSE Group, the ALDE Group and the left.
The motion for a resolution presented by our group together with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has the following in its favour. The political situation in Uzbekistan is by no means satisfactory.
The human rights situation continues to be alarming in many respects. Yet some progress is being made in spite of everything.
For example, the first round of the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Uzbekistan took place in Tashkent on 8 and 9 May of this year. Any resolution by the European Parliament must illuminate the current situation, and the present resolution can only be based on this.
author. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the co-authors of the resolution.
At the same time, bearing in mind the Community guidelines on the protection of human rights adopted in 2004, I would like to emphasise the need to improve relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan.
I would like to stress, however, that these relations should be based on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, with particular emphasis on the latter.
Furthermore, with regard to the decision to suspend for a six-month period certain sanctions imposed on Uzbekistan, I support the initiative to monitor progress in respect for human rights in that country.
The negative decision of the Uzbek Ministry of Justice regarding recognition of the office monitoring these rights is evidence that we should bring further efforts to bear in this area.
As Vice-Chairman of this Parliament with responsibility for the Neighbourhood Policy inter alia in Uzbekistan, I appeal to international institutions, and particularly to the Uzbek authorities, to take supporting action that leads to the development of a civil society.
author. - (FR) Madam President, the aim of this resolution is simple: it is to tell the truth.
That is what the Uzbek people and human rights activists are asking us to do.
The urgency derives from the assassinations of journalists and dissidents that have occurred over the last few months, and from the conclusions of the Council on 15 October, which were wrongly presented as a diplomatic victory by President Karimov.
The important fact is that the sanctions have been extended for 12 months because no investigation has been carried out into the Andijan massacre and the meetings of experts on the matter have not produced any result.
As regards the lifting of visa bans for six months, we agree that the visa bans should automatically be renewed if the excellent criteria introduced - the visits by United Nations special rapporteurs, for example - are not met within six months.
On the other hand, we are not happy with the conclusions on the alleged progress made on human rights.
For example, the abolition of the death penalty has still not actually come about, and the EU-Uzbekistan dialogue on human rights is suspended.
Finally, in this resolution, we condemn the assassination of several independent journalists and dissidents, and demand that serious and impartial investigations are conducted.
I am concerned about the intentions of the PPE and the UEN.
They are proposing to go further than all the Member States by interpreting the Council's conclusions not only as a suspension of the visa bans but actually as removal of the visas altogether.
Their paragraph 3 states that the ineffectiveness of the sanctions is an encouragement to the Uzbek regime, which makes no sense either intellectually or politically.
The text does not even mention the 13 human rights activists whose immediate release President PÃ¶ttering demanded by letter.
Finally, my last point is that paragraph 9 mentions the difficult situation of Human Rights Watch.
That is fine, but the organisation made it known clearly that it did not want to be mentioned in a resolution that was technically incorrect and as harmful for human rights activists as for the Uzbek people and that in the end, as everyone realises, would be used as a propaganda tool by the dictator, President Karimov.
Consequently, I am asking the MEPs from the PPE and UEN to subscribe to the serious attitude we need to adopt on this matter and with regard to the Uzbek people, and support our motion for a resolution, which says nothing more than the truth about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan.
author. - Madam President, the persistence since 1989 of the tyrannical governing regime of Uzbekistan under Mr Karimov is a cancerous infliction on democracy.
Mr Karimov's regime is responsible for the implementation of a policy of terror and corruption in his country, with the victims being, of course, mainly the people of Uzbekistan.
These people are subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, to torture and ill-treatment and, while there have been numerous demands for democratic reform, both by the international community and the EU, Mr Karimov carries on taking no notice whatsoever.
This reminds me of another individual who is governing his country in a similarly totalitarian manner and takes no notice of those who call for democratic reforms to be implemented.
I am talking about King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, a country where women have no right to vote, and even no right to drive a car, and where serious human rights abuses are part of everyday life.
In this respect, sadly, some EU governments are guilty of double standards: they attack Mr Karimov ferociously - and quite rightly so - but are very gentle indeed with King Abdullah.
In fact, recently King Abdullah was given an extravagant welcome on state visits to Britain and Italy.
The main difference between Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia is money - lots of it - and as long as King Abdullah spends his billions in Britain and Italy, his involvement in gross violations of human rights and democratic institutions in his country can be conveniently overlooked.
That, I suppose, is why, when I suggested that the situation in Saudi Arabia be discussed here today, it was turned down ceremoniously by almost all the groups.
Perhaps more sensitivity might be shown next time, I hope.
author. - (NL) Madam President, Uzbekistan is in need of radical change.
The initial impetus in this direction was nipped in the bud on 13 May 2005, with brute force that claimed the lives of hundreds of demonstrators.
Since then, the outside world has remained silent for a conspicuously long time. Little happened initially following our earlier topical and urgent debate on 27 October 2005.
Yet it was not only in better-known states such as Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus that authoritarian regimes took power following the collapse of the Soviet Union; this was particularly also the case in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
There, it was not democracy that had triumphed, but a small group of people who had gained experience in the old state apparatus and the security forces.
Having no objective other than to stay in power, these people turned state enterprises into their own private property, manipulated electoral results, gave the opposition as little leeway as possible, hampered free organisations, restricted the press and, if need be, used violence against their own people.
Sadly, this state of affairs persists in Uzbekistan.
To date, Europe's attitude towards Uzbekistan is influenced far too much by economic and military interests.
It appears that the dictatorship in Uzbekistan has been allowed to stay on because it proved itself useful in the military intervention in Afghanistan.
Such an attitude would completely destroy the credibility of Europe's pretensions with regard to human rights and democracy.
Europe must not make the rights and freedoms of the Uzbeks secondary to other considerations.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, under the German Council Presidency, after explicit influence from the German Federal Government, the sanctions against Uzbekistan were relaxed under the condition that Karimov's government would improve the human rights situation in the country.
However, torture is still used in Uzbek prisons; the human rights situation in Uzbekistan has not improved at all.
We hear this from international organisations, which are observing serious attacks on civil society.
Not only human rights organisations, but also women's organisations, information centres and many other organisations are being affected.
Human rights activists are being condemned to long-term sentences and numerous activists, including journalists, have had to flee.
We must not soften the sanctions; we must not lift them.
We are seeing once again that, even in this Parliament, there are different discourses on human rights when it comes to access to raw materials compared to when raw materials are not at stake.
We must send a clear signal that we do not accept this.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would also like to use the opportunity of this debate to alert the House and draw its attention to a group of people that is particularly persecuted in Uzbekistan, and not only in Uzbekistan, but also in Turkmenistan.
This is, basically, the LGBT population.
Gays and lesbians are usually doubly persecuted, because they are activists, in many cases, but also because they are gays and lesbians.
Between two and five years in prison await many of those who publicly acknowledge that they are part of this group, or are denounced as members of it.
I think that within this context perhaps, when we are talking about human rights in general, we normally take into account all human rights, but often we forget about this particular group, which has specific needs and which also tried at the last meeting of the OSCE, held in Madrid, to present these claims in the face of incomprehensible opposition from many governments.
I think that this is something that we should remember, and which, in any case. we should go return to in the debate on relations between the European Union and Central Asia.
Madam President, first of all, I am really worried about the PPE-DE Group's attitude concerning the human rights situation in Uzbekistan.
We should not be taken in by the hypocritical efforts to achieve respectability undertaken by the Uzbek Government with the aim of giving the impression of democratic progress and improving relations with the European Union.
No, Uzbekistan has not progressed in the last two years.
The government has still not authorised an independent investigation into the killings in Andijan.
Human rights are still mocked and torture is still used, according to the UN report.
Political opponents still do not have the right to express themselves freely.
The press is still at the command of the government.
We denounce that, and we also question the government on two murders, those of a theatre director and a journalist, both known to have criticised the Uzbek Government.
We must not support the subterfuge of the self-re-election of President Karimov on 23 December and we must remain very cautious and attentive regarding the Uzbek political situation, even if some national interests within the European Union suffer because of it.
Human rights must never give way to economic relations in the European Union.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the recently adopted new strategy for Central Asia reflects the commitment of the European Union to enhanced long-term engagement and cooperation with the region.
The EU and Central Asian countries, including Uzbekistan, have agreed to make human rights, the rule of law, good governance and democratisation key elements of the strategy.
We intend to step up support for the protection of human rights and the creation and development of an independent judiciary, thus making a sustainable contribution to the consolidation of the rule of law and respect for international human rights standards in Central Asia.
EU-Uzbekistan relations have to be put in this context, where encouragement to take positive steps to improve human rights and democratisation are the basis of dialogue and cooperation.
Our relations with Uzbekistan have gone through a difficult phase over the last few years, notably since the events in Andijan in May 2005, and we remain seriously concerned about the human rights situation.
It is our firm belief that we stand a better chance of encouraging progress in the human rights situation in Uzbekistan by engagement rather than isolation.
Isolation has not worked.
We welcome the gradual re-engagement that has taken place over the past year, since the EU-Uzbekistan Cooperation Council agreed to establish a regular human rights dialogue, the first round of which was in May this year.
Two rounds of expert-level talks have also taken place on the Andijan events.
We are also planning a dialogue with Uzbek civil society on freedom of the media, which should take place in Tashkent early next year.
We also welcome Uzbekistan's introduction of habeas corpus and the abolition of the death penalty, which should come into effect in January 2008.
At the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, the EU Member States agreed on the renewal of restrictive measures but, at the same time, agreed on the conditional suspension of the visa ban.
The Council urged Uzbekistan to fully implement its international obligations relating to human rights and, in particular, to allow unimpeded access by relevant international bodies to prisoners, to engage effectively with UN special rapporteurs, to let all NGOs operate without constraint in Uzbekistan and to release human rights defenders from detention and cease harassing them.
The Council stated that the lifting of the visa restrictions would be reviewed after six months, to assess whether Uzbekistan had made progress in meeting these conditions.
The Uzbek authorities agreed to continue the discussion on human rights issues in the context of the EU-Uzbekistan Cooperation Committee early next year.
Uzbekistan has also shown itself open to discussing with the Commission ways to further enhance Community assistance in supporting the reform of its political institutions, such as the parliament, and the reform of the judiciary, all of which we will discuss further in the Cooperation Committee.
The fact that the EU's restrictive measures remain in place clearly signals both to the Uzbeks and the broader public our concerns about the situation in Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan has a long way to go in the area of human rights and we will continue to stress to the Uzbek side, in line with the Council conclusions, that we expect to see concrete progress in the human rights situation on the ground.
Human rights will continue to be an important and difficult issue in our relations with Uzbekistan, but the Commission believes that engagement is the best way to promote positive developments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (FR) When Europe speaks, freedoms improve.
The European Union absolutely must pursue the policy begun in 2005 after the blind and totally unpunished repression at Andijan, which according to the OSCE and Human Rights Watch left between 500 and 1000 people dead.
The many challenges ahead (energy, terrorism, freedoms) mean that Europe must mobilise more than ever on its periphery.
Its most pressing mission is to act to promote human rights and to make calm relations with Uzbekistan dependent on progress with fundamental freedoms.
The EU cannot ignore the reality of a chimerical rule of law and the hateful assassination last September of the director Mark Weil, known for his opposition to the regime in Tashkent.
The Uzbek parliament has recently made several steps towards the abolition of the death penalty and civil justice.
Although these decisions are still very inadequate, the European Union's firmness has not been in vain and runs counter to the principles of an unacceptable and dangerous realpolitik.
We need to go even further to achieve democracy and political stability, but we have finally begun to hope.
It is up to the vast country of Uzbekistan not to ruin this hope, by building a genuine partnership with Europe.
3.
Somalia (debate)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Somalia.
author. - Madam President, for many generations people from Somaliland and Somalia have been coming to my constituency of London.
They have a long tradition of working in the British Merchant Navy and sending monies back home.
During my time in the British Parliament, I was Co-Chairman of the British-Somali All-Party Group.
Sometimes we took up problems and sometimes we took up personal issues and so forth. There were many of these.
The Somalis were wonderful people but were not served by particularly wonderful leaders.
Now things have gone from bad to worse.
We now have a failed state.
We have a situation where the country has some of the worst health statistics in the world.
Its people face violence every day and continually rising child and maternal mortality rates.
They are being caught in the crossfire between Ethiopian and government troops and the court militias.
That is why this issue is on the agenda today.
We can see how awful it is to live in Somalia today.
We can see the glaring necessity to get humanitarian aid there, and yet we cannot get it there.
We can see the need for peacekeeping forces, and we welcome what the African Union has promised, but we do not welcome what it is actually providing.
It is nothing like what has been promised.
At the moment all we have there is Ugandan troops.
Until the promised figure of 8 000 troops is reached, the Ethiopians will not leave.
We have to see how we can get people talking - talking across borders, talking across some of our traditional prejudices - because, if people do not talk, there will be no stability, and if there is no stability then there is no future for that country.
If there is no future, then more people will die.
We will not be responsible, but we will have played no part in preventing that happening.
author. - (ES) Madam President, I also obviously want to stress the importance of this resolution, especially in the context of the debate that we had this morning.
We are talking precisely about how to deal with the situation of fragile states.
Somalia is not only a fragile state, it is actually a failed state.
However, on this point we must not forget, as Mr Bowis was saying, that the enormous level of violence that exists in the country at the moment is primarily fuelled by the continuous entry of arms, mainly light weapons and ammunition, which come from other countries in the region, and in many cases directly from Western countries, which include the European Union.
We therefore must not forget that, as well as reacting to the current immediate consequences of what is happening in Somalia, we also have a responsibility for this situation, and when we talk about the obligation and responsibility to protect, which is what we are used to doing in this type of debate, we also need to take our own responsibility for prevention, for example by controlling arms exports.
author. - (PT) Yesterday in Mogadishu there were incitements to attack African Union forces - such is the scale of the tragedy and loss of control that are destroying Somalia and inflaming the entire Horn of Africa.
The EU must, as a matter of urgency, bring pressure to bear on all parties to the conflict to commit themselves to an inclusive process of national reconciliation, capable of tackling the political issues at the root of the crisis.
The 'transitional government' will remain a fiction if it continues to take no action to protect the civilian population and facilitate humanitarian aid.
Somalia is more awash with arms than ever, according to a recent UN report.
It is essential for countries and dealers who breach the arms embargo imposed in 1992 to be stopped and held accountable.
Finally the African Union peacekeeping force urgently needs to be strengthened and the occupying Ethiopian troops need to leave.
It should be acknowledged that the Ethiopian intervention, instigated by the Bush administration with the passive complicity of the European Union, did not bring peace or government or even help to combat terrorism in Somalia.
It only brought more suffering, poverty and death to the people of the whole region.
author. - (PL) Madam President, we are talking here today about the tragedy that has taken place in Somalia.
It is generally said that there are three intervention measures that can be taken in such a case: diplomatic pressure, an economic embargo and, if necessary, armed intervention.
There is, however, a fourth possibility that we do not mention, and that is that EU countries should start by removing the potential for their own pseudo-business to corrupt bureaucrats in various post-colonial countries, who then set about starting civil wars, often in the basic interests that the pseudo-business is pursuing.
Let me say something else on the same subject that Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Gomes: surely the weapons used in these countries, including Somalia, are produced in and exported from so-called democratic countries, countries that are economically developed.
States in this part of the world should specifically put pressure on their own arms producers and pseudo-businessmen to ensure that they do not provoke or play a role in the worst disasters unfolding on the planet today.
author. - Madam President, Somalia has been the subject of European Parliament and UN resolutions in the past.
Unfortunately, the situation there has not improved and the prolonged destructive civil war has carried on unabated.
The resulting tragic human suffering continues, with hundreds of thousands of poverty-stricken refugees, thousands of malnourished and dying children, and the reported emergence in the region of contagious diseases like cholera and hepatitis.
That country is in a desperate situation, where anarchy and the law of the jungle prevail.
In this joint motion for a resolution, as in previous ones, we make a series of useful suggestions, such as the cessation of all foreign military intervention in Somalia - mainly from Ethiopia and Eritrea - and full implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia, which, although imposed 15 years ago, is sadly still to become truly effective.
We also make a call for protection of freedom of the press by strongly condemning the Somali Government's systematic harassment of the media and its shameful failure to investigate the killing of journalists whose reporting was deemed to be critical of the government.
We make these calls conscious of the fact that the chances of them being listened to are very slim indeed.
Still, we must persevere in the hope that perhaps common sense and a humanistic attitude will at last prevail and that the Somali people eventually will see more peaceful and prosperous days.
author. - (NL) Madam President, since 1991, Somalia has no longer existed in practice as a country, at least in the sense of the territory of the former Italian colony.
Only in the north, in the former British colony of Somaliland, does a kind of state exist, but this state is not recognised internationally.
The place of the state has been taken by a number of warlords, who alternate between fighting and cooperating with each other.
The army of neighbouring Ethiopia has appointed itself their joint protector.
The Union of Islamic Courts, on the other hand, is their joint adversary and wants to reunite Somalia on the basis of traditional Islamic rules, without the warlords.
All attempts so far to establish a generally accepted unity government and to help Somalia function again as a state have failed.
The Commission's financial support for the Transitional Federal Institutions that were created in 2004 appeared justified at the time but led to the accusation that the European Union was taking sides in an armed conflict and thus cooperating with Ethiopia against the forces that would prefer to see a strict Islamic regime in power.
Such a European policy, however well meaning, cannot succeed without the support of the inhabitants of Somalia.
For this reason, it is good that the motion for a resolution on which we are soon to vote calls for the cessation of foreign military intervention and for dialogue and reconciliation at domestic level.
Madam President, since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, Somalia has not had a properly functioning government.
The internal situation is one of chaos and anarchy.
As a result of the conflict between the rebels of the Islamic Courts Union and provisional government troops, 850 000 people were made homeless and there were many deaths.
The situation in Somalia is dramatic.
Cholera is spreading throughout the region, more than 1.5 million people require urgent medical aid and tens of thousands of children are suffering from malnutrition.
There is a real risk that this conflict could lead to destabilisation throughout the region.
Of even more concern is the fact that of the promised 8 000 African Union soldiers, only 1 600 have so far been deployed in mediatory action.
Because of this, the African Union, the United States, the European Union and the UN should increase humanitarian and logistical aid for the Somalians as well as step up diplomatic efforts aimed at accelerating the peace process and establishing a stable government through free elections in 2009.
Madam President, Somalia lies on the Somalian Peninsula, known as the Horn of Africa, and is an ethnically and religiously homogeneous state. Somalians constitute 97% of the population, with almost 100% professing Islam.
With its natural resources it had the conditions necessary to achieve economic development and a decent life for citizens in the Republic of Somalia, which came into being in 1960.
Sadly, a coup d'Ã©tat, a civil war, changes in political orientation, tribal divisions and the involvement of the Islamic Courts Union with its links to the Taleban in the struggle for power have combined to create hell on earth for the people of Somalia.
How can we help these people?
The solution to the Somalia issue lies with the UN and the African Union.
In the interests of Africa, the African Union should step up its political and military activities to protect people and create the conditions necessary for the absolutely essential humanitarian aid to be provided by the UN and the European Union.
In Somalia's situation a debate on human rights violations, which are occurring on a massive scale in that country, will not change anything.
What are needed is action that would be supported by the European Union.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I fully agree with Mr Bowis that, as long as people talk, there is always hope.
We consider it very timely to have this wake-up call on Somalia today, since the situation currently poses a significant threat to peace and security, not only in the region but also beyond.
It also causes immense suffering for the people of Somalia.
As you know, the Union has taken a lead role in the Somali peace process and the establishment of the transitional federal institutions.
We have always strived for a political solution involving all Somali parties, and Commissioner Louis Michel carried out a last-ditch peace mission to rescue the peace process prior to the Ethiopian intervention in December 2006 and has been instrumental in linking EU support to the African Union peace mission to Somalia and to the launch of a genuine National Reconciliation Congress.
We have an unfolding humanitarian disaster and a diminishing humanitarian space in Somalia, including a crackdown on the independent media and journalists, who are dying in targeted killings.
The current levels of humanitarian distress in south and central Somalia have reached alarming proportions.
An estimated 1.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 730 000 internally displaced persons, of whom one-third are estimated to be at extreme risk.
An estimated 173 000 Mogadishu residents fled the violence in the past two weeks alone.
I also wish to inform you that, in response to the current humanitarian crisis, the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office, ECHO, is working with implementing partners to support 1.5 million people, providing the local population, internally displaced people and host communities with access to water, sanitation, nutrition, drugs and support for livestock and livelihoods.
This year, it has allocated the highest ever budget for assistance to Somalia, amounting to EUR 20 million.
We are also very concerned about the evolving security situation in Mogadishu and other regions in south-central Somalia.
Insurgency operations appear to be expanding and all parties have significantly increased their military capabilities in the past weeks.
The EU is committed to following a multi-pronged approach that entails supporting a comprehensive security strategy, including a ceasefire process and a full deployment of the African Union Mission in Somalia that would facilitate Ethiopian withdrawal, and encouraging the nomination of a representative and effective Prime Minister and government while engaging and providing reassurances to the opposition, to facilitate their involvement during the remainder of the transitional period leading up to elections in 2009.The EU will also urge all parties to respect basic human rights and international humanitarian law.

Finally, we need to take into account the regional dimensions of the crisis and engage with Ethiopia and Eritrea, which are fighting a proxy war in Somalia, which risks provoking their own border conflict.
The Commission has nominated an EC Special Envoy for Somalia and is driving forward proposals for EU action at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
It remains committed to working closely with the European Parliament to stem violence and to find a political solution to this crisis.
Mr Matsakis will speak on a procedural matter.
Madam President, on a point of order before we proceed with the vote, I note once again that there is no Council representation in this Chamber.
This is now becoming almost a permanent situation, and perhaps something needs to be done about it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
The situation in Somalia is a reflection of a collapsed state and failed economy.
There has been no functioning government since the overthrow of the Said Barre regime in 1991 which led to anarchy, inter-clan fighting and banditry.
The recent fighting between the Union of Islamic Courts and allied Ethiopian and Transitional Federal Government troops has displaced at least 100 000 people and famine threatens.
Yet the worsening security situation in Mogadishu has prevented international NGOs from coping with this unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.
I welcome the efforts by the African Union to assemble a peacekeeping force to help with national reconciliation, but only 20% of the promised 8 000 have actually been deployed.
The African Union must honour its commitments.
However, the European Union must in parallel increase its efforts to provide political, financial and logistic support.
The international community, including the EU, must step up the provision of humanitarian aid to the displaced people.
The ultimate solution, however, to restoring Somalia to a functioning state requires the International Somalia Contact Group, including the African Union, the UN, the EU and the US, to engage with actors inside Somalia to support the implementation of the Transitional Federal Charter and Institutions.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, on our agenda today we have the Commission statement on the partnership agreements with the ACP countries and a resolution is planned for this debate.
Our Group, this morning and in recent days, has held very intensive debates on this resolution.
We have also tried very hard to work out a compromise resolution with other groups, with a view to reaching such a compromise.
Unfortunately, that has proved impossible.
Nonetheless, we do not want to give up on this task and we are still attempting to reach a compromise before we have to resort to contested votes.
On behalf of my Group, I therefore propose that the resolution on this Commission statement and the vote on that resolution be postponed until the December part-session.
I would be grateful to the Members of this House if they could support this course of action, which would offer some scope for negotiations on a compromise.
Mr Schulz, we shall refer to this topic in due course, according to the order of business.
Wednesday:
The joint debate on Community railways will be held before Mrs Hieronymi's report on television broadcasting.
The Ortuondo Larrea report on the interoperability of the Community rail system will be put to the vote during the next part-session in Strasbourg.
Thursday:
I would like to inform you that at voting time:
The report by Mr Leinen on the amendment of the regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities is approved pursuant to Rule 43(1) and is registered for voting.
The Blokland report on hazardous chemicals is deferred to the January part-session, so that conciliation can be achieved at first reading.
Now, about the topic you raised, Mr Schulz:
I have received from the Socialist Group a request that voting on the motions for a resolution on economic partnership agreements should be postponed until the December session, with new deadlines for submitting the texts as a result.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Madam President, I note the spirit of compromise shown by the Socialist benches and, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I must say that we are also open to compromise and will not therefore oppose this suggestion.
However, following the referendum in Venezuela, we should also like to have a resolution, during the December part-session, on the situation in that country.
In this spirit of compromise and also in the Christmas spirit, I feel that we can accommodate these proposals.
Mr Pinheiro, this topic does not concern Venezuela, but the proposal by the Socialist Group concerning postponement of the motions for a resolution on economic partnership agreements to the December session.
Does any Member wish to speak in favour of this proposal?
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Madam President, you probably did not hear what I said.
I started by saying that, in a spirit of compromise, we would be prepared to accept this suggestion.
However, in that spirit of Christmas compromise, we should like our Socialist friends in turn to accept our proposal for a resolution on the issue of Venezuela following the referendum there.
Does any Member wish to speak against this proposal?
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am rather surprised at this proposal from the Socialist Group.
The joint motion for a resolution by the Socialists, the Greens and my Group incorporated the resolution adopted in Kigali.
In Kigali, the members of the PPE-DE Group also agreed to this compromise, so I simply cannot understand why everything should now be postponed for further debate when, together, Members of this House had already reached an agreement.
The fact is that everyone agreed to this compromise in Kigali!
I am therefore opposed to this postponement because the document in question has been endorsed by a large number of Members already and could be voted on today.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, just so that there are no misunderstandings: the problem is not the substance; the problem is that they want to ensure that they get a majority.
I think that is legitimate.
You are absolutely right, Mr Markov; the proposal implies that the debate should start again, which is hard to understand, but the Socialists' idea - let's see - is about securing a majority to endorse what everyone wants to achieve anyway.
That is the issue and that is the reason why they want a postponement.
That is all.
(Parliament approved the request)
The vote on the motions on economic partnership agreements is postponed until December and the deadlines proposed are as follows:
for tabling motions for a resolution, Wednesday, 5 December at 12 noon;
for amendments and joint motions for a resolution, Monday, 10 December at 7 p.m.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 12 December.
I have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats for the debate on the statement by the Commission concerning the referendum in Venezuela to be concluded, with the submission of motions for a resolution.
Does any Member wish to speak against this request?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr de Deus Pinheiro has just mentioned the Christmas spirit.
I am also in favour of the Christmas spirit, but we should not overdo it.
After all, in that spirit, we were quite willing to have a compromise coming from Kigali.
As to Venezuela, there are always going to be differences of opinion, indeed controversy, in any debate about Mr ChÃ¡vez.
We believe the debate is useful - indeed, it is now being held - but we are not convinced that we can get a sensible resolution in the short time available today or tomorrow.
If we take this resolution forward to the December part-session, it will be three weeks old by then.
It is very useful to have the debate now, but we do not want a resolution because it will either be cobbled together or will come far too late.
I think we should have the debate today, and that will be enough.
Does any Member wish to speak in support of this request?
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Madam President, thank you for this opportunity.
There will be a new situation following the referendum which is about to take place in Venezuela.
This is a very important referendum and I felt that it was also important that this House should be able to have a rational debate on this issue now, bearing in mind the possible results of the referendum.
We can then try to adopt a resolution in December.
I believe that this is possible and that we should make this effort.
It is in the spirit of Christmas and cooperation that I making this suggestion.
(Parliament rejected the request)
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Welcome
Today we have great pleasure in welcoming to our Parliament a delegation from the parliament of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
This delegation visited our Parliament last December in Strasbourg, and we are delighted to welcome them in Brussels too.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express our deep and sincere condolences to your Assembly and to the Afghan people for the terrorist attack of 6 November 2007 in which six members of your parliament and about 100 Afghan citizens lost their lives.
Among the victims was Sayed Mustafa Kazemi, who had been a member of the Afghan delegation on its visit to Strasbourg last year.
The purpose of your visit is to start a regular dialogue which will enable us to arrive more quickly at a better understanding of the political and social situation in Afghanistan, and which will give us the opportunity to discuss the assistance your country needs.
I am confident that you all regard this visit as a symbol of our joint efforts to promote democratic values and full respect for human rights throughout the world.
I would like to express our satisfaction at your visit, and our commitment to strengthening the cooperation between our governments.
From what I know, you already have fruitful contacts with the European Parliament, and I wish you a constructive continuation of your mission, an enjoyable stay, and a good journey back to your country.
Madam President, my point of order is under Rule 9(2), concerning the smooth conduct of parliamentary business.
We have been informed about the presence of asbestos in the Winston Churchill and SDM buildings in Strasbourg.
The latest report 'has confirmed a more widespread presence of asbestos' than was initially believed in our places of work there.
Asbestos is one of the most dangerous carcinogens, and can endanger human life.
We should therefore request proper information on the risk assessment and detailed information on the removal of asbestos from Parliament's buildings, including the schedule and safety measures for this.
The health and safety of MEPs, employees and visitors to Parliament should be an absolute priority.
Mr Hegyi, this is essentially not a procedural matter, but since you have raised such a vital issue, I would like to say that an announcement has already been made by the Secretary-General regarding the possible presence of asbestos in our buildings.
Approval by the European Parliament of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (debate)
The next item is the report by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval by the European Parliament of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union (2007/2218(ÎCI)).
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on 12 December in Strasbourg by the Presidents of the Council, Portuguese Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates, the European Parliament and the European Commission will undoubtedly be one of the most significant moments in the recent history of the Union and the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union.
We will be taking a step forward that will have important and concrete implications for the consolidation of the universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity.
Thanks to the new Lisbon Treaty, the Charter will have the same value as the Treaties; in other words it will be legally binding.
This fact, given its importance, must be duly underlined and is something of which this Parliament, the national governments and the Commission should all be proud.
It marks the end of a long road.
The impact of the decision to give the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal value goes beyond the usual political and diplomatic circles as it directly affects the legal affairs of our citizens.
It is a concrete result of Europe.
Clearly, the institutional reforms of the Lisbon Treaty are important and it is also true that the changes made to EU policies, to the common foreign and security policy, to the justice and home affairs policy and in other areas are vital so that the Union can tackle the future and meet the challenges facing us.
However, the existence of a catalogue of rights, which is binding on the European institutions and on the Member States when they apply European law, has a meaning far beyond all this.
From now on we are putting our citizens at the centre of the European project.
As we are talking about fundamental rights, I also want, on behalf of the Presidency and also on behalf of my own country, to express my delight at the Protocol of the Lisbon Treaty which provides for the accession of the Union to the European Convention on Human Rights.
That is because this Protocol represents the achievement of a long-held ambition.
With regard to all of this, I must congratulate this Parliament and Mr Leinen on the adoption of this draft report on 12 November by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
This has once again shown the commitment of this House to the Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
It only remains for me to express my sincere desire that the House will also find itself able to vote in favour of this report, thus allowing the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be solemnly proclaimed by the three institutions on 12 December.
(Applause)
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be a key instrument in our Union based on the rule of law.
It contains a real catalogue of rights that all citizens of the Union should enjoy, from the individual rights related to dignity, freedoms, equality and solidarity to the rights linked to citizenship status and justice.
The Charter will not alter the Union's competences, but it will offer strengthened rights and greater freedom for citizens.
The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union will be bound by the rights written into the Charter, and the same obligations will be incumbent upon the Member States when they implement the Union's legislation.
Citizens will be able to claim before the courts the rights enshrined in the Charter, and the legal scrutiny of the Court of Justice will ensure that the Charter is applied correctly.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the legally binding force of the Charter has been preserved through the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference.
Like Parliament, we would have preferred to see the Charter apply to all 27 Member States, with no exceptions to its full justiciability, but we should not underestimate the results achieved.
Legal force is a major step forward in building a legitimate and accountable Union, where citizens' interests are the focus of attention.
This was not obvious at the outset and it has been a long road to achieving this goal fully.
The Charter proclaimed in 2000 was not legally binding.
During the European Convention in 2002-2003 and in the IGC that followed in 2003-2004, the Charter was adapted in order to make it legally binding, but that process was stopped due to the failure to ratify the Constitutional Treaty.
At the European Council in June 2007, it was agreed that the future new Treaty would contain a cross-reference to the Charter, as adapted and finally approved in 2004, and that it would have the same legal value as the Treaties, and this is now reflected in the new Treaty.
The rapporteur is proposing that Parliament should approve the Charter, which is a necessary step before its solemn proclamation, and, of course, the Commission fully supports this recommendation.
The Commission will also approve the Charter next week and authorise the President to proclaim it on 12 December, together with the Presidents of Parliament and the Council.
The proclamation of the revised Charter will provide the basis for a cross-reference in the new Treaty that will be signed the following day in Lisbon, extending the legal value and justiciability to the rights enshrined in it.
With the new Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Union will undeniably enhance its protection of human rights.
The European Union is not only a marketplace but also a common space based on values and common rights.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a core element of the Lisbon Treaty; indeed, we could even call it the soul of the new Reform Treaty.
I am pleased that all three institutions agree that the Lisbon Treaty is not just about institutions or about policies; it is about people, namely the 500 million people in the European Union.
This Charter is a visible expression of the fact that the European Union is concerned about protecting our citizens in respect of all acts emanating from the European Union.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is thus a milestone.
We are moving from a Europe of the states to a Europe of the citizens, and we in the European Parliament have always welcomed this development.
With this Charter and the 50 rights and freedoms contained within it, the European Union will have the most modern and comprehensive catalogue of fundamental rights in the world.
Nothing of the sort exists anywhere else in the world, so we should be proud of this achievement.
Starting with Article 1, which talks about protecting human dignity, all the way through the Charter to the final Article, which deals with the right not to be punished twice for the same criminal offence, the Charter provides enhanced protection of rights and also mentions rights which are not necessarily found in all the constitutions of the 27 Member States.
I would simply draw your attention to the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings through modern genetic technology, the right to protection of personal data, the right to freedom of information and the right of access to documents, but also the right to good administration, 'good governance', which is what we preach to the rest of the world, but which must naturally apply to ourselves as well.
For the first time, a catalogue of fundamental rights puts economic and social rights on an equal footing with political rights and civil liberties.
In an age of globalisation, I am confident that this provides people with adequate protection.
As Parliament has repeatedly pointed out, it is regrettable that the new Treaty does not reproduce the text of the Charter in full, so it will not be as visible as it might have been.
However, I think we should note, with satisfaction, Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty which states: 'The Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties.'
That removes any doubts for citizens of the European Union by confirming that, with this Treaty, they do have the opportunity to assert their rights before the national courts and, ultimately, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
We still have to adopt this Charter again in plenary because it has been amended, and it could be said that it is not as good as the Charter from 2000, unfortunately.
I am referring especially to the watering down of Article 52, and there may be problems interpreting the very vague clauses you will find in that Article.
Nonetheless, the Charter has been rescued and is going to be part of the Treaties.
I believe that the Charter is a symbol.
As has been said in this House, the EU is not just a large market with an associated currency union; the EU is a community of values, and its task is to defend these values in its internal policies and in Europe's external policies as well.
It is all the more regrettable that there is an opt-out for two Member States, namely the United Kingdom and Poland.
We find this regrettable and I would like to appeal to the governments and parliaments of those two countries to spare no effort to revoke this opt-out as quickly as possible so that all 27 Member States are operating on the same basis when it comes to defending the fundamental rights and values of the European Union.
I therefore support the adoption of the Greens' amendment here, which will be voted on tomorrow as an addendum to our report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of this important report.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, this morning my Group celebrated and commemorated the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Today the members of my Group are wearing a badge which says 'Yes to the Europe of values'.
In this respect I agree with what previous speakers have said, particularly Madam WallstrÃ¶m, about the European Union not being just a market.
The European Union is a political project, but one based on principles and values which unite all European people.
As a result, Madam President, today is a good day, with a resolution that will allow us to celebrate and solemnly proclaim this Charter of Fundamental Rights during the next Strasbourg part-session.
In fact, I will not be revealing any secrets by saying that those of us who had the good fortune to participate in the drafting of this Charter in the first Convention were left with a bitter aftertaste.
This was for two reasons, the first being that, although we drafted the Charter as if it were to be legally binding, in the end this was not possible in Nice because six governments rejected this.
However, time has proven us right and now the Charter, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, will be legally binding.
That bitter aftertaste has now been converted into satisfaction.
The second reason, Madam President, is that I remember how in Nice there was no solemn proclamation of the Charter.
A great opportunity was lost to explain to the European people that the rights and freedoms proclaimed in the Charter are our identifying marks, for it was signed in secret.
However, thanks to the determination of the President of the European Parliament and our three representatives in this Intergovernmental Conference, on 12 December during the Strasbourg part-session we will achieve what they failed to achieve in Nice.
We will solemnly proclaim this Charter and will reaffirm, as the members of the PPE-DE Group have done, our commitment to these rights and freedoms set out in this Charter.
We will vote, Madam President, in favour of Mr Leinen's report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the PSE Group supports the readoption of the Charter in its new form so that it can, through the Reform Treaty, be made binding on the European institutions.
In so doing, we will be plugging a major gap.
The European institutions as such are not bound as yet in a watertight way to respect the same rights that all our Member States respect by virtue of their own constitutions or by virtue of their membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments.
This Charter will be binding on the European institutions, and the whole field of Community law must respect those rights, failing which European legislation can be struck down in the courts.
It is surprising that some Euro-sceptics who, one would think, would be pleased that the European institutions are obliged - are constrained - to act in this way, are opposing this Charter - yet some of them are!
It is perhaps unfortunate that, as a result of that, some Member States have felt it necessary to clarify, in a protocol, how the Charter interacts with their domestic law.
That has, in turn, given rise to confusion.
A colleague just now referred to that as an 'opt-out'; it is, of course, not an opt-out.
The Charter remains binding on the European institutions and on the full field of Community law, irrespective of how it affects domestic law in certain countries.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the solemn proclamation of the Charter is the climax of our work, stretching back to 1999, aimed at creating a superior form of rights regime for the Union.
Since the principal purpose of the Charter is to protect citizens from abuse of the large powers now vested in the Union, it is bizarre and regrettable that a Member State should seek to escape its binding effect.
It is my belief that the British protocol will be found to be juridically flawed, as well as a serious political mistake.
The courts are bound to develop jurisprudence for the entire Union system that is blind to nationality and faithful to the key principle of Union law, which is that we draw our fundamental rights from the traditions that are common to all our Member States, as opposed to being exclusive to one.
In my view, and that of my Group, the British opt-out is shameful and should fade to oblivion as quickly as possible.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, in 2000 the Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up as a declaration of the values that were to guide the Union's policy.
The Union itself was to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.
At that juncture, the European Court of Justice was to cease ruling on the basis of general legal principles derived from the constitutions of Member States.
It is now 2007 and the Union is to accede to the European Convention, but not, however, so that it becomes the only European system for protecting human rights.
We are creating an alternative system based on a legally binding charter of rights.
In many respects this is a first.
General legal principles will remain the third set of grounds for rulings in matters concerning fundamental rights.
All this is complicating the system for protecting fundamental rights in Europe, and making it even less comprehensible to the citizens.
Many Europeans are concerned about the situation.
Essentially, these are the reasons why two Member States opted for protocols protecting against the unexpected consequences of the effects of the Charter.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, today, I am proud to be a Member of this House which from the very first day has been a stalwart champion of fundamental and civil rights in general and this Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular.
It is now nine years since the Cologne Summit took the initiative to start working towards a legally binding Charter, and this process is not yet complete.
As somebody who has been privileged to follow this constitutional process all the way through, I would like to share two experiences with you.
One is very ironic: it is odd that, over these nine years, nothing has proved to be so laborious and controversial, or as difficult to achieve, as those documents which embody the principles which form the very basis of the European Union and which we should be able to take for granted: democracy, parliamentary rights, social rights, the market economy, transparency of legislation and fundamental freedoms and rights.
It is a very odd situation and must surely have to do with the root causes of the crisis of confidence besetting the European Union.
The second experience which I would like to share with you is this: it is important not to become exhausted or disenchanted, and it is important not to lose heart.
I have long believed that Sisyphus is the patron saint of Europe, and this whole experience bears this out.
That is why I think that, today of all days, we should try again and appeal to the United Kingdom and Poland, in the name of the indivisibility of fundamental rights, in the name of the indivisibility of human rights and fundamental rights and liberties, to join in this great European consensus!
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during our next sitting we will again approve the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Before we do this, let me ask a question which is perhaps not as simple as it appears.
Will this be the initial Charter proclaimed in the year 2000 or, as the Leinen report suggests, will it be the adapted rehash integrated within the former draft Constitutional Treaty?
The two texts are not, of course, identical and I feel it is unfortunate that their differences are not clearly set out, although that would have raised some legitimate controversy.
For example, the French human rights commission expressed, and I quote, its grave concern about the amendments made to the articles on social rights - I am still quoting - that threaten to remove the social content of the Charter.
One of the main authors of the original Charter, the lawyer Guy Braibant, explained in the press - and I quote - that the conditions for applying the text have changed.
First of all, the word 'may' is occasionally replaced by 'must'.
Moreover - and I am still quoting - there is an official reference to 'explanations' by the Presidium.
Although they ought to be pedagogical and completely neutral, the explanations interpret laws in a rather minimal sense.
Fundamental rights have been undermined, unquote.
Which text will we be approving in the next sitting?
I also have a subsidiary question: will this approval be valid in all EU countries?
This kind of action cannot entertain any ambiguity.
Thus I would appreciate a precise reply to these two questions.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Madam President, I have been involved in the preparation of the Charter, and in both conventions I have proposed a very simple solution: allow the EU to become a member of the European Convention on Human Rights.
In this way, the institutions would be bound in the same way as the countries.
We would close a gap.
When we make the Charter legally binding, we are not closing any gaps.
On the contrary, we are creating a number of gaps in the protection that we enjoy as citizens under our national constitutions and as part of our common European human rights.
The Luxembourg Court's activist interpretation will always take precedence over both Strasbourg and our own Supreme Court.
The Charter is unsuitable as an independent source of law.
It is much too imprecise.
Does the right to life begin at birth?
If not, then how many months before?
Does the right to take industrial action also apply to public sector employees?
Freedom of speech for public servants is much better under the Strasbourg Court than under the Luxembourg Court.
In addition, yesterday we saw a textbook example of possible conflicts.
The German journalist Hans-Martin Tillack obtained the support of the Strasbourg Court, which stated that OLAF had acted unlawfully when it arrested him and confiscated 16 boxes of documents, computers and telephones.
Luxembourg supported the theft of the journalist's sources.
Strasbourg condemned the theft and arrest because it prioritised freedom of the press.
The Charter will be presented as a victory for human rights.
Possibly.
It is more reminiscent of a fake lottery ticket.
In a sense we are taking a great risk with regard to hard-earned human rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
The drawing of the lottery numbers is decided by judges in Luxembourg outside parliamentary control, and only when they are condemned will there be a unanimous amendment of the treaties to correct any backlash.
It is very impractical, and it is more like an imprisonment of our rights than a charter.
Madam President, we all support human rights, and I am growing a little tired of some people - particularly those from states where, historically speaking, human rights are something of a novelty - attacking the UK as some sort of pariah because of its 'gesture' opt-out under Protocol 7.
Let me remind them that, as long ago as 1688, a bill of rights lay at the heart of the Glorious Revolution in the United Kingdom.
Since then, the UK has been a beacon of liberty.
So we need no finger-pointing lessons in human rights.
People might be irked that we have spoilt the party by withholding, for now, from some of the trappings of EU super-statehood, but I would point out that it is our national and political right to do so.
Sadly, though, the opt-out will fade out as the European Court of Justice sets about its centralising agenda.
Ultimately, though, those people will get their way - should the UK be so foolish as to ratify this Treaty despite the opposition of its people.
(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, it is also one of the fundamental rights of citizens not to be overlooked.
This Charter of Fundamental Rights does indeed provide protection for citizens akin to that afforded by the classic constitutional state.
However, the European Union is not a state.
It is not a state, but it does have legislative competence, and it is only this legislative competence of the European Union's institutions which falls under the protection and control of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on a binding basis.
Associated with this is the fact that European legislation and the actions of the European institutions are bound by values and value-based decisions, along with the first sentence of this Charter, which is also the most noble: human dignity is inviolable.
I derive this principle from a Christian image of humanity.
However, it can be derived from other sources as well.
Our binding commitment to this principle, and the binding commitment of our three institutions to adhere to this principle, represents a massive step forward.
This applies to the European Union as a whole.
Poland and the United Kingdom are rule-of-law states; there is no doubt about that.
The fact is, however, that by not signing and by opting out of the Charter, they are not protecting themselves; they are shielding something that is already protected.
The fact is that this Charter is not applicable to national legislation and national institutions at all.
In other words, they are protecting something that can already be taken as a given.
In Poland in particular - where a majority in Parliament and a majority of the people take a different view, but where the President is making use of his prerogatives - I hope that change will come about in time.
The legally binding nature of the Charter can be further reinforced if we pursue a harmonised strategy.
Mr President-in-Office, I am grateful to you for the fact that we are utilising the opportunity afforded by single legal personality and are acceding to the Strasbourg Convention.
If this is successful, the European area of justice will achieve coherence, bringing together the protection of fundamental rights at both national and European level.
I hope the outcome will be a value-oriented Europe of citizens of which we can be proud!
(PL) Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the early 21st century counterpart to the great statements on human rights and citizens' rights made in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.
Those were famous declarations on freedom and the rule of law that forged contemporary democracy.
Our Charter has its roots in events that contributed to the development of democracy and the contemporary system of liberal democracy during the last 200 years.
I see no reason why certain European countries should not adopt this Charter.
I put it to Mr SzymaÅski, how can one seriously argue against the Charter in a country that was the birthplace of SolidarnoÅÄ, thanks to whose leadership the whole of Europe gained its current understanding of the right to freedom, the rule of law and democracy?
I appeal to the Polish Government in Warsaw, and in particular to Mr Tusk, the Prime Minister. Mr Tusk, your parliamentary group won the elections a month ago thanks to the votes of those Poles who wish the Charter to be included in the European Reform Treaty.
I trust you will not disappoint the voters who supported you just over a month ago.
I call on the Polish Government to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Reform Treaty, so that it will be binding in my homeland too.
The Poland of SolidarnoÅÄ, European Poland, the Poland of tolerance and openness believes that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a key element of the Reform Treaty.
We should not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by the conservative right wing, which would like us to agree not to implement this Charter in our homeland.
(PL) Mr President, I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a sine qua non for any community wishing to operate pursuant to the value system derived from respecting human dignity.
This gives rise to the principles of freedom, equality and solidarity.
I see no reason why countries such as the United Kingdom or Poland that wish to be part of the Community should refuse to be involved in something that constitutes the foundation of our common action.
This Charter advocates reference to social values, to the European social model.
It also states unambiguously that, where local customs and practices are concerned, internal national law applies.
This means that there are no grounds for any type of opt-out to apply in this area.
I trust that both Poland and the United Kingdom will choose to opt in instead.
(PL) Mr President, the debate on this report touches on many issues, and indirectly on the basis for creating a new legal framework.
In August 2007 the President of this Parliament made a statement in that regard at a gathering of displaced persons.
He stated that the source of the right to a homeland should be sought in the right to dignity, and that the right to a homeland is therefore a fundamental human right.
The right to dignity is enshrined in the first article of the Charter.
The President's opinion was criticised in the Polish Parliament.
The German association of displaced persons laments the fate of people resettled from Poland.
What would happen if the German lament and specific interpretation of human dignity were applied to Alsace and Lorraine?
Might a centre for the resettled be set up in this case too, or will there be reconciliation?
Attempting to derive the right to a homeland from the right to dignity is a misinterpretation of the axiology of human rights, as stated by Mr Karski, a Member of the Polish Parliament.
An interpretation clarifying primary legislation is acceptable, but not its extension.
The President of the European Parliament referred to Pope John Paul II.
I should like to remind this House and its President that in 1965 Archbishop Karol WojtyÅa published a written declaration according to which German bishops had stated clearly that Germans resettled from the East wished, and indeed had, to understand that a whole new generation of Poles was growing up there, and that these Poles considered the land assigned to their parents to be their own homeland.
No legal or moral disquisition or sentimental spokespersons are called for on this subject.
I do believe that we can achieve unanimity on the Charter in this House, however, despite President Sarkozy's recent suggestion that unanimity contradicts democracy.
Vain hopes, Mr Sarkozy, since you are unable to convince even the Paris metro workers.
(NL) Mr President, no one can dispute that the citizens of Europe must be armed with fundamental rights and freedoms, vis-Ã -vis their own countries as well as the European Union.
A Europe without rights and freedoms would cease to be Europe.
However, that is not the problem nowadays because the citizens are already sufficiently protected against their national governments both by their own national constitutions and by the European Convention on Human Rights.
As regards the European institutions, European citizens can also assert their fundamental freedoms and rights in accordance with the fixed jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
The real point here is that, with the proclamation of this Charter, another step is taken towards a federal Europe.
People want a European Bill of Rights just like in the federal United States.
The difference between them, though, is that this Charter goes much further than an enumeration of the traditional rights and freedoms.
Sometimes, however, it does seem like an enumeration of all kinds of socio-economic promises.
The manifest does not tally in the slightest with the cargo.
(SV) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office, Members and - not least - citizens of Europe, today is a festive occasion, a great day, a day of joy, an immensely important day, much more important than many realise right now.
It is important both to those who believe in fundamental rights as a principle and to those who believe in the development and integration of Europe.
It should have been completely self-evident a very long time ago that the EU's institutions had to be bound by the values we all endorse, but it was not so.
In fact British people also believe in the principles of law, irrespective of how they come into being.
Few parliamentarians would say that they are happy to assist in the suppression of human rights; indeed the great majority take entirely the opposite view.
It has been a joy and an honour to be involved in the development of these values, which I am convinced mean so much to us.
Now we all know what this Union stands for, even if we could not manage to read the whole Treaty.
They are fine values, they are good values, they are values we must all contribute to, and we must ensure that the Union helps to apply them correctly.
Heartfelt thanks to Jo Leinen and to all who have assisted in the work, and - not least - heartfelt congratulations to the people of Europe!
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, on 12 December, the President of Parliament, together with the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, will solemnly proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
I am convinced that, in tomorrow's vote, the overwhelming majority of Members will voice their agreement with this historic document and this historic step.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights reflects the moral and spiritual heritage of the peoples of Europe in the European Union.
It reflects values such as human dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
It places the focus of attention on the individual because, among other things, the Charter establishes citizenship of the Union.
I am glad that the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is taking place after the enlargement of the European Union to include the new Member States.
This means that the Charter, in its own way, is a moral, legal and political reflection of the unity of the European Union: West and East, North and South.
I also believe that both the governments and the parliaments of Poland and the UK will come to understand this fact, and that in the near future they will enable their citizens to join in this historic moment.
(SK) I welcome the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as it makes those rights that already exist for citizens of the European Union more visible.
However, I would also like to call for clarification of possible conflicts of interest between the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, a European Union document, and the European Convention on Human Rights, a Council of Europe document, which the European Union has also declared it will observe.
From this it also follows that there may be a conflict of interests between the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Where will the Strasbourg Court stand in relation to the Luxembourg Court?
As a supreme court, a constitutional court?
Is this outcome actually acceptable for the European Court of Justice?
Will the European Union, which possesses a legal personality, have a separate judge in the European Court of Human Rights?
I want to stress the need to resolve this legal issue so that we can avoid a problem, because with the Charter of Fundamental Rights becoming legally binding, I expect an increase in legal disputes in the area of human rights.
(DE) Mr President, like almost all the previous speakers - only almost all, unfortunately - I am pleased that today, or tomorrow, we will give a mandate to the President of this House to sign the Charter.
Human rights are our European trade mark both within and outside Europe.
Nonetheless, may I advise caution and that we do not get carried away by our emotions and bite off more than we can chew.
With the Charter and the necessary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, we are establishing the important and classic basic rights and the important social rights on a legally binding basis, which means that they will be binding for the European institutions and the application of Community law.
We are also making it possible to have recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in respect of these basic rights, albeit under certain very narrowly defined conditions.
However, this does not mean that every citizen will be able to petition the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg immediately, or indeed at all, as some people - swept away by their emotions - have occasionally claimed.
That kind of claim does not serve our interests.
Let us stop making these assertions, which overshoot the mark, and let us feel a sense of gratification at the result that we have achieved.
In the European Union, we have now set an important course - not only in relation to the classic rights but for our social policy too - of which we can in all conscience be proud.
It includes the work/life balance, the prohibition of child labour, health protection for everyone and a high level of environmental and consumer protection.
We should be pleased about that; it is the truth, and there is no need to embellish it.
(ES) Mr President, I believe we are discussing an extraordinarily important subject for the people.
Clearly, trying to explain the reform of the European Union can be very complicated, but it is certainly easy to underline the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Will it be legally binding?
This will not be explicitly stated in the Treaty, but it is our duty to make this known.
I therefore feel that the decision we have taken to sign the Charter before the Lisbon Treaty is signed is very positive.
From now on we must also say that no further exceptions will be allowed in the future as these are bad for the citizens of the countries concerned and for the citizens of the European Union as a whole.
I therefore believe it is vital that we make an effort, as proposed by Mr Leinen in his report, to clearly support the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its legally binding nature.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) The citizens of European countries have fought both separately and together for each of the rights contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
For this very reason, it is a joyful thing that, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights being made legally binding, fundamental rights can finally be realised more effectively, not only at Member State level but also at the level of European legislation and application.
European citizens will enjoy its benefits if they can have recourse to legal remedy in the event of a breach of their fundamental rights at European level.
Such guarantees will make the European Union and its institutions more democratic, and more directly accessible and more verifiable for half a billion European citizens.
Making the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding will close a chapter in the history of the fight for fundamental rights.
At the same time, I think that, with regard to the future, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must become the ars poetica of Europe.
Alongside the common economic interest, Europe must show the way in fundamental rights, and forge those living there as one, and not only through the classic rights of freedom, but also in guaranteeing social and cultural rights, equal treatment and the rights of minorities.
Horace said in his ars poetica, 'Examine well, ye writers, weigh with care, what suits your genius; what your strength can bear'.
I hope that the institutions of the European Union will be strong and brave enough to be able to guarantee the same fundamental rights to all European citizens in every corner of Europe.
in writing. - (FI) On 19 October in Lisbon a Treaty was signed which was to make the European Union more viable and more democratic.
It would also strengthen civil rights.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be made legally binding, and the EU should accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights formed the second part of the unratified Constitution.
In an intergovernmental conference Members of this Parliament passed an initiative whereby the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council would sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights in a ceremony in Parliament's plenary on 12 December and it would be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This accords excellently with the values that the Charter of Fundamental Rights represents.
A ceremonial signing will also increase the document's visibility.
It therefore goes without saying that we wish to give our President, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, a mandate to sign.
Common principles on flexicurity (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Christensen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on common principles of flexicurity.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I thought you were asking me to make a final speech on the Charter debate, a speech which I do not have prepared, hence the reason for my confusion.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of flexicurity is now a key item on the European agenda and is essential for the future of Europe's economic and social models.
It is a complex issue involving the capacity to manage change and promote employment and social security reform in a rapidly changing global context which requires responses to the challenges of global competition, technological innovation and population ageing.
We need more flexible markets, but this also means that we must ensure better conditions, better instruments and more security for our citizens so that they can handle this change positively.
That is the challenge facing us.
For our part, the Portuguese Presidency has tried to contribute actively to the search for integrated and balanced solutions in this area.
Following the Commission communication presented in June, we were responsible for conducting a process aimed at carrying out the European Council mandate and achieving consensus on the common principles of flexicurity.
The Commission communication naturally formed an excellent starting point for this work as it helped us to develop the concept and increase discussion of the solutions that could serve as a common platform for the various lines which each Member State will have to follow.
Bearing in mind that the starting points and situations are different, the solutions will also have to differ.
In order to create the conditions for progress in this area, we developed various initiatives with the main actors at European level, including a Conference on the challenges of flexicurity.
This was politically well-attended and discussed the developments in this respect and also future prospects.
We also sought to analyse the experience gained in countries where models have been applied with good results and to identify which elements of these models can be used in other contexts.
We also obtained the opinions of expert committees on employment and social welfare and also the Committee of the Regions.
In addition we tried to encourage the social partners in this area to become involved as we are aware that this new model requires firm commitment from all the stakeholders, yet it also requires that everyone's interests be taken into account.
In this context, the understanding that we reached with the social partners at the Tripartite Social Summit held on 18 October in Lisbon gave important impetus to this debate.
Social dialogue at various levels and the involvement of the social partners are decisive in ensuring the success of any strategy to reform the labour markets.
The involvement of everyone in this process is key to finding successful solutions and we need a climate of trust between social partners and with the institutions.
We all have to be prepared to accept and take responsibility for the change.
I want to highlight the quality of the debate and interventions at all stages, both in technical and academic terms and also in terms of the discussion on the political content and on the process.
As a result of all this work that I have mentioned, during which we were always able to count on the assistance of the Commission, the Council is now able to endorse a set of common principles on flexicurity which we hope to formally adopt at the meeting on 5 and 6 December.
These common principles on which we are all agreed include, in particular, taking account of the diversity of national situations which will require different approaches and solutions, the need to overcome labour market segmentation, the various dimensions of flexicurity - labour legislation, education, training, social welfare - recognising the relevance of social dialogue in this context, promoting social inclusion, non-discrimination, equality and reconciliation of work and family life, and also defending the need to ensure the compatibility of policies with the solidity and sustainability of public finances.
I want to stress that, in essence, there is broad agreement with this House.
I must underline the excellent work that we have done and that this House has done in this area.
Once adopted, the common principles shall form an essential instrument for implementing the next cycle of the Lisbon Strategy.
The Member States will be invited to take account of these principles when defining and implementing their national policies, by developing their own mechanisms and approaches depending on their specific situations which will be monitored in the framework of national reform programmes.
Social partners at all levels will also be encouraged to help define and implement the flexicurity measures and also to use the common principles as a reference.
We feel it is essential to invest in the social mobilisation of our citizens within this strategy and, in this context, I must mention the vital importance of this House's involvement.
Given who it represents politically and its proximity to the people, this House can make an excellent contribution to ensuring better understanding of the flexicurity concept.
The key principle is that flexibility and security must be seen as mutually supporting and reinforcing elements, rather than as opposing elements, and this must be fully understood by our citizens.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, the Commission's communication on flexicurity has triggered an important and useful discussion throughout the Union.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Christensen, and the other Members who have taken an active part in discussing flexicurity.
Thanks to your efforts and cooperation with the other parliamentary committees, the European Parliament will be able to adopt a resolution that will significantly support the approach that the Commission has proposed.
In our society, security depends on change.
Now we must coordinate ways to seek new forms of security: better skills, the ability to find new jobs, modern protective measures adapted to the new labour market.
In recent years, for every job that has been lost in Europe in the industrial sector, four new jobs have been created in other sectors.
The most important question is how to gain control over these shifts and how to manage this change successfully.
We must also pose the question of the reasons for labour market segregation in a number of Member States.
I very much welcome the report that you are considering today.
This report recognises that flexicurity can be a strategy for labour market reform.
The text also supports the four-part policy structure formulated for flexicurity by the Commission.
I can also fully support the proposal relating to common principles mentioned in paragraph 15 of this report.
Your proposals take approximately the same direction as the proposals made by the Commission in its own communication.
I understand your desire for some issues, such as measures to combat insecurity, to be explained more precisely.
However, I believe that the principles must be concise and that they must be viewed from the standpoint of the whole communication.
I would also like to welcome the European social partners' agreement with the analysis of labour market problems; their analysis was presented at the recent Tripartite Social Summit in Lisbon on 18 October 2007 and, among other things, also looked at flexicurity.
This agreement indicates that social dialogue can bring concrete results.
Indeed, you have referred to this joint analysis in your motion for a resolution.
Now I would like to reply to some of the critical views expressed in your report.
I know you go on to say that discussion about flexicurity should be more balanced.
First of all I would like to remind you that the Commission's communication is the result of intensive dialogue between all the stakeholders and careful consultation with leading specialists in this field.
I am convinced that the Commission's approach is balanced, since the objective is to support flexibility and security simultaneously and, as has already been said, as two elements that are synergetic and in no way inconsistent.
It is obvious that discussion of flexicurity must not be misused to move towards labour market deregulation.
On the contrary, flexibility and mobility must aim higher: that is, towards better jobs, towards a better balance between work and family and private life, a more efficient economy as a whole.
As you know, in the next few weeks the Council will make a decision on common principles of flexicurity.
After that, national discussions scheduled by all the stakeholders will continue, making it possible to pursue flexicurity strategies at the national level with regard to the specific features of individual states.
I am confident that the individual stakeholders will ensure that a balanced approach can be achieved in the area of flexicurity.
As far as costs are concerned, it should be appreciated that the costs connected with a flexicurity policy are much lower than the concrete benefits in terms of a more dynamic labour market and reduced unemployment.
Moreover, in a number of instances, it will mean no increase in financial costs, but more efficient use of available resources instead.
I would also like to react to the paragraph of the report in which it is stated that the open-ended contract should form the basis of a social security system.
The Commission's intention is in no way to reduce the importance of the open-ended contract.
However, I believe that we should adopt more general systems of social security, which would apply both to open-ended contracts and to part-time employment: in short, the intention is that these forms of employment should also be provided with adequate social security cover, not that open-ended contracts should be weakened.
Mr President, I believe that, with the exception of these few reservations, the report is a useful, relevant contribution to the discussion about flexicurity, and once again I would like to thank the European Parliament for it.
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to stand here today as rapporteur.
The negotiations in Parliament have been completed, and we can present a balanced report that reflects attitudes across the entire political spectrum.
The whole concept behind these guidelines on flexicurity is to tackle the challenges faced by the labour markets of Europe.
Note that I use the plural, 'labour markets', because the report recognises that there is no 'one size fits all' as far as flexicurity is concerned.
Although there is no common model for flexicurity, we must recognise that Europe faces many common challenges in its labour markets that require a joint response.
The demographic challenges mean that in 2050 there will be 1.5 employees for every pensioner. Currently, the figure is 3 employees per pensioner.
Around 100 million Europeans are living in or on the threshold of poverty.
The effects of inequality can be seen all too easily when you compare countries where there are major differences, such as those in Eastern and Western Europe.
However, they can also be seen internally in countries where we are witnessing increasing inequality.
Six percent of employees in Europe can be characterised as 'working poor' and a growing number are experiencing poorer working conditions with uncertain employment circumstances and very poor working conditions.
Short-term contracts and temporary work are on the increase, and the ordinary open-ended employment contract is under threat.
Such precarious employment amounts to 12% in Europe.
In addition, undeclared and unlawful employment is increasing.
In some countries, unlawful employment accounts for almost 15% of all employment.
This development is something that we must turn around, partly because it is expensive for Europe and partly because these uncertain and unstable employment circumstances often affect the weaker groups in society.
Education is Europe's most important raw material in the competitive global market, but it is not being given enough attention.
In fact, 15% of our young people are leaving the education system too soon, at a time when the labour market is placing major demands upon knowledge.
Those who do not jump on the education bandwagon will experience difficulties in the long term, and we therefore have an obligation to help such people.
Thus, the challenges are clear to Europe.
Our responsibility is to deliver a message and a vision of how we will tackle these challenges.
In this connection I would like to thank the Commission for its excellent contribution.
We have enjoyed good cooperation in connection with the report, in which my role has naturally been to gather up the loose ends here in this House.
My perception as rapporteur is that there is a need for a stronger focus on the social Europe, to ensure that workers' rights are respected throughout the EU and for us to have more and better jobs.
Greater flexibility within organisations must not come about at the expense of employees' working conditions.
How can we ensure this?
The report specifically emphasises the need for the open-ended employment contract to become the standard contract type in Europe.
Secondly, we must ensure that social partners are involved to a greater extent.
That decisions cannot be taken above the heads of employees lies at the heart of a flexible and secure labour market.
The inclusion of employees is absolutely essential, and this cannot be emphasised enough in the implementation of flexicurity strategies.
Finally, the report is concerned with what we might call the framework for flexicurity. In other words, the national terms and conditions for implementing flexibility and security.
Flexibility and flexicurity cost money.
However, it is not wasted money; it is by contrast money that is invested and produces a bonus.
For example, if you invest in your workforce, it might perhaps be an expense in the short term, but experience has shown that it will pay dividends in the longer term.
Therefore, flexicurity as we understand the concept in Northern Europe requires a welfare state of a certain calibre and size.
In this connection we must be honest and say that the developments that we are witnessing in some countries, where there is competition for lower and lower taxes, will make it very difficult to finance the security aspect of flexicurity.
Therefore, I will attempt once and for all to silence all the voices that claim that flexicurity is a neo-liberal concept aimed at undermining the rights of employees.
This is not the case; on the contrary.
In conclusion, I hope that, through this debate here in this House and around Europe, we will be able to dispel some of the myths that abound in connection with flexicurity.
As rapporteur, I have, with considerable help from my colleagues, been able to draw up some balanced guidelines for flexicurity, guidelines that show how Europe should develop its labour market in the future in order to make it both competitive and social.
With such a strategy, we will also discover how to tackle the uncertainty that exists amongst employees in Europe.
Many are currently afraid that their jobs will be relocated and that their place in the labour market will become superfluous.
Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur, the rapporteurs from the other committees and everyone else who has otherwise contributed to this report.
I will conclude by expressing the hope that the Heads of State or Government will incorporate Parliament's recommendations in their further work towards achieving the common guidelines for flexicurity when they meet in Portugal in December.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for a job well done.
The changes which globalisation engenders offer new and better opportunities for all the world's countries but, of course, they also pose challenges.
Europe stands at a crossroads.
We can choose to welcome the new and flexible economy and its possibilities or retreat into protectionism in various forms.
Flexicurity is one of the most important tools for the creation of a labour market which, as the rapporteur says, fully utilises the potential of the labour force.
Training, mobility and employability are keywords.
Clearly no single model is universally applicable, but we can and should learn from one another.
We make the point in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that protection systems which are too rigid may indeed protect those who are on the inside, but they can make it difficult for others to enter the labour market.
Population growth in Europe is a problem too, which the rapporteur also pointed out.
More people will need jobs.
Flexicurity, when used correctly, is a good model for Europe to continue to develop positively in a global economy.
The example of Denmark, which the rapporteur did not mention, I think shows this.
Mr President, there is one thing at least that we should agree on in this House, namely that too many are without jobs today.
Europe must continue to grow so that new jobs can be created.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Christensen's report has been crucial in taking forward the initial document.
These principles are potentially very valuable, but only if at the same time there are safeguards for all at-risk groups - immigrants, women, the elderly and the disabled - as well as for adults who have a low level of education and are more vulnerable and less well protected.
Furthermore, the inequalities in our society are becoming ever more widespread, such as the lack of a minimum wage - which must be adopted in all countries - and the need to recognise workers' rights.
The knowledge base of workers must likewise be raised.
Allocating economic funding for the implementation of these principles and identifying genuine resources is also a matter of urgency.
Lastly, it seems to me that in recent years there have been many new sources of imbalance in the relations between capital and labour: profits and financial speculation have gained the upper hand while wages have fallen.
Addressing this imbalance is one of the tasks we must take on together in carrying these issues forward.
Mr President, the so-called flexicurity model is unlikely to be effective in the European labour market unless it is accompanied by other actions and proposals aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and making it easier to set up businesses.
I have in mind, for example, the work on drawing up a statute for the European private company.
Regarding the common principles for implementing flexicurity, I should like to emphasise that the introduction of complex legislative solutions at European level in this area runs counter to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Social and employment policy falls within the competences of the Member States, and any European Union action in the area of flexicurity must comply with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the EU Treaty.
In addition, the internal complexity of the model is not favourable to the introduction of Community legislative standards and to a so-called one size fits all approach to the matter.
The outcome of the impact assessment indicates that open coordination may be the most appropriate method.
This is particularly important for the new Member States which may be confronted with different structural problems in the area of employment in view of the legacy of their past.
The high short-term costs associated with the introduction of paths towards implementation of the flexicurity model must also be borne in mind, together with the significant burden on budgets.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reforms that the European Union must carry out in order to secure a competitive position in the world economy cannot be seen purely as limited public sector initiatives but as also requiring changes in behaviour and attitudes on the part of both workers and companies.
These changes can only be successfully achieved if there is a climate of trust between social partners, and this can only be developed by promoting social dialogue.
As regards managing the labour market, we must switch from a mindset dominated by the culture of conflict to a new approach based on the culture of cooperation.
Personally I do not like the term 'flexicurity'.
I would prefer to talk about 'change with security' because any change involves risks.
The important point is to minimise those risks.
People cannot be asked to be flexible when they have no confidence either in themselves or in the world around them.
We therefore constantly stress in this report the need for active employment policies and lifelong learning systems.
The PPE-DE Group tabled 120 amendments to the initial report and, following a process of negotiation, we have arrived at a final version which I believe is balanced and comprehensive.
A good balance has been achieved between the concepts of flexibility and security and also between the interests of all the stakeholders in the process, in particular social partners and public authorities.
The report clearly refers to the need to apply principles of subsidiarity and proportionality when implementing and managing flexicurity.
I therefore recommend that this report be adopted by the House.
