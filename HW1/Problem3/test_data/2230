If we cannot accept the fact that the fundamental rights of our fellow citizens are being jeopardised by terrorists, then we cannot accept the fact that fundamental rights are being denied at Guantanamo on the pretext that terrorists probably number among the prisoners being held.
The only way in which we can fight against terrorism effectively is by means of justice.
We must therefore demand a fair trial on United States soil for each person being held at Guantanamo.
This is a question of the survival of a peaceful world.
Â Â  . The British Conservative delegation has abstained on the motion on the situation of prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo because it suggests in paragraphs 2 and 3 that torture is commonplace in this facility, which our American allies totally reject.
Furthermore paragraph 8 explicitly asserts that the detainees are protected by the Geneva Convention, which in the case of illegal combatants not wearing uniforms, concealing their weapons and not subject to a military hierarchy, is disputed internationally by legal experts.
We do support the eventual closure of GuantÃ¡namo, which has become a serious international issue for the United States, but this can only occur when alternative facilities are found to detain some of the most dangerous individuals threatening Western free societies.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, allow me on my behalf, and on behalf of you all, to welcome the members of the Chilean delegation of Senators and MPs headed by MrÂ JorgeTarudÂ Daccarett, who are present in the diplomatic gallery and who will be participating in the 4th Meeting of the EU-Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee which takes place today in Strasbourg.
In the name of our institution I would like to extend a most cordial welcome to them.
As you must be aware, the EU and Chile have concluded an Association Agreement which envisages relations based on three footings: trade, cooperation and political dialogue.
It is thanks to this Agreement coming into force that we were able to set up the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
I firmly believe that the commencement of the 4th Meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee will signal a new and important period of ever closer cooperation between the two sides, which recognise the same democratic values and share a common approach to the principles of the rule of law.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0176/2006) by MrÂ Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning in the European Community (2006/2062 (INI)).
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are to vote on concerns pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning in the European Community, an issue on the topical nature and importance of which the majority of us are in agreement.
I think this was also the main reason why no amendments were tabled in plenary.
Having said which, I should like first of all to thank all the rapporteurs of all the political groups for their important comments and valuable help and all my honourable friends for the amendments which they tabled during discussions of my report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Having said which, I have tried to bring this report to a conclusion in close cooperation with the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European office of the World Health Organisation and various other national health departments, including the health department in my country, Cyprus.
At the same time, I have received in this endeavour suggestions from non-governmental organisations, from specialists in pandemics and even from the vaccine industry.
I should like to make a point of thanking them all for their help.
I shall try to be as brief and succinct as possible.
There are five important points which I would like to expound: efforts to intensify coordination, the existence of 'flu vaccines and anti-viral drugs, information, transparency and public awareness, financing and financial aid for countries that need it.
The fact cannot be overlooked that there is a strong need to tighten and intensify coordination between the Member States and the Commission and this is also the reason why coordination plays such an important role in the report.
The Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are already doing an extremely important job by testing existing national pandemic prevention plans and carrying out exercises.
Nonetheless, these exercises also need to take place in regional areas, while at the same time emphasising cross-border cooperation.
As far as anti-viral drugs are concerned, plans to acquire them and the way in which they are used does not appear to be satisfactory enough.
However, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, more action needs to be taken in order to strengthen such programming.
Furthermore, research and development need to be promoted, so that the vaccines in question can be supplied as quickly as possible and, once that happens, so that their equal and fair distribution can be safeguarded.
Information, transparency and public awareness are fundamental and will facilitate the work of the Member States and the Commission in warding off a possible pandemic.
With regard to the African and Asia countries, which are also considered to be the countries with the greatest need, we must ensure that they are provided with technical, economic and financial help.
At this point I should perhaps stress that the Commission has already managed to achieve a great deal in this direction and I trust that it will continue in the same vein.
Satisfactory appropriations must also be made available so as to maximize public awareness, so that European citizens can obtain more information, so that research and development can be developed in the ultimate aim of creating anti-viral drugs, of giving the Commission the opportunity to create a Community stock of anti-virals and, of course, of giving third countries the economic and technical assistance they need.
Of equal importance with these points is the protection of small and medium-sized poultry units, which have sustained a serious blow from avian influenza, and the proper application of the provisions of Community law relating to safety in the workplace, especially for high-risk groups consisting of workers in close and constant contact with birds.
Finally, I should like to point out that I supported most of the amendments tabled by my honourable friends following discussion of my report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
In particular, I must stress that the amendment on the prevention of panic among the public, on combating any trafficking which could arise if there were genuinely serious risks and on ensuring the fair distribution of products for use in combating the epidemic, the amendment on the constant upgrading of the Member States' preparedness plans and the amendments relating to the acquisition of adequate protective equipment and the Commission's preparedness to adopt crisis measures such as quarantine and disinfection measures in aeroplanes are amendments which help to make the report an integral report.
I should like once again to thank the committee secretariat for its valuable help with my report and all my associates.
Thank you once again.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur for the very good and constructive work which he has done on this report and, of course, the members of the committee who worked with him.
I address this report with satisfaction and joy, because I can see that the European Parliament and the European Commission are addressing such a serious issue in the same manner, with the same perception and the same approach.
Of course, I must stress from the beginning that we are talking about the possibility of a pandemic, about a possible pandemic.
It is not a certainty. It may happen as a result of the bird 'flu virus, it may happen as a result of some other virus, it may not happen at all.
However, the fact that it is a possibility, despite the fact that our scientists indicate to us that it is a very slight possibility, does not give us any justification for not preparing ourselves satisfactorily, adequately, suitably and as much as possible.
This is perhaps the first time in human history that we have forewarning, that we have certain messages that such a pandemic may occur.
This preparation needs to be carried out not only at national level but also at Community level.
As regards the report, I feel particularly satisfied, because most of what the report asks us to do we have either already achieved or we are in the process of covering and achieving.
Of course, I always consider the contribution and cooperation of the European Parliament particularly important in our endeavour.
I refer to the example of the Solidarity Fund, which will help in the event of a pandemic to cover pharmaceutical requirements in terms of vaccines and anti-virals.
It is about just over a year since the first time we debated this issue in plenary and I must say that we have achieved a great deal since then.
We now have national preparedness and response plans in all the Member States, we have the Community preparedness plan, the one we are debating today, we tested all the plans in a simulation exercise last November and now we are in the process of improving these plans on the basis of the weaknesses identified during that exercise.
There is very close cooperation with the World Health Organisation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, has taken on a leading role in this sector and will soon take charge of the early warning system.
I agree with the need for communication and information as regards the citizens and we have already started working on this sector; we have organised meetings of the competent representatives of the Ministries of Health in the Member States and with all the competent organisations on how we shall handle messages to the public in the event of a crisis and now we are proceeding with seminars and workshops with media, so that we can inform them, so that we can update them and develop cooperation which will be applied in the event of a crisis.
We are making progress on the question of creating a pandemic vaccine.
The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is cooperating in this sector, we are cooperating with industry, we are investing in research and we are trying to speed up the procedures and, of course, to increase the production capacity of the pharmaceutical industry.
As regards anti-virals, we have already achieved double the production capacity of anti-viral drugs compared with the previous year and now the challenge is for the Member States to make use of this capacity.
It is within their competence to place the necessary orders.
Today, especially in this sector, we are in a much better position than we were last year.
By the end of the year, we shall be able to say that in total 16.5% of the European population will be covered. However, this is slightly misleading, because it is not the same level in each Member State.
Some Member States have over 25% coverage and others have almost nothing.
It is, therefore, extremely important that we set the necessary targets and cover these states with anti-viral drugs.
As regards the stockpile strategy, I agree with the committee's view, but I would remind you that this subject was initially raised by two Member States, Belgium and France; it was not the Commission's proposal, it is a matter which comes within the competence of the Member States.
The Commission has made no effort to extend or increase its competences and powers, but we did accept this suggestion, because we see the usefulness of there being a European stockpile strategy to the same standards as the World Health Organisation stockpile.
It will cover the Member States until such time as they acquire their national stockpile and could also cover neighbouring countries and be used strategically as a fire-fighting measure with the first cases of a pandemic, in order to give the Member States the facility to address a prolonged pandemic.
There is no legal basis for this at Community level.
It would need to be with the unanimous agreement of the Member States, who would have to finance such an endeavour.
Unfortunately, in the debate held last September it appeared that a very small number of Member States opposed in principle the creation of this strategic stockpile. The overwhelming majority supported the matter in principle, but a very large number of Member States were not prepared to cover these requirements from national funds.
I believe that, in light of these positions by the Member States, there is no margin for continuing this debate or for continuing work on this issue.
What is important now is for every Member State to accept its responsibilities and to set and cover its national targets.
To continue an already prolonged debate without there being any prospect on the horizon of agreement merely sends out the wrong message and raises false hopes, especially for both the citizens and the Member States that need this stockpile today, which is why it is better for everyone to know where they stand and, consequently, each Member State will take its own responsibilities.
As I said at the beginning, most of the measures which will be taken to prepare for a pandemic come mainly within the competence of the Member States.
However, the European Commission will continue to coordinate and to have the initiative, to have a decisive role in this preparation with exercises, with laboratories and with working parties, even at ministerial level, but of course we consider Parliament's contribution to be particularly important in this endeavour.
As far as we as the European Commission are concerned, we shall exhaust all our practical, technical and legal potential in order to achieve the highest possible level of preparedness in the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, influenza is a disease with grave health, social and economic implications; it also has ramifications in the defence sector and politics.
H5N1 could mutate and give rise to aÂ new flu virus subtype that would be transmissible from humans to humans and gradually spread, causing an epidemic or pandemic.
The avian flu virus is seldom transmitted from birds to humans; however, the WHO has reported 185 cases of this infection and 104 deaths in the period from 2003 to March 2006.
This number of human fatalities should be seen as a reminder that we cannot afford to ignore.
Public debate in this area has highlighted new issues, and the Member States have set about establishing pandemic commissions and drawing up pandemic plans coordinated on the European level.
The Member States are talking to one another now, because if a flu pandemic breaks out, no single country will be able to cope with it on its own.
Interest has increased in antiviral drugs as the first line of defence and intervention.
Vaccine manufacturing procedures have been upgraded, and there has been greater interest in speeding up the development, production and deployment of new vaccines.
Ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report is based on two communications from the European Commission on this issue.
Emphasis has been placed on essential measures and crisis management within 24 hours, including quarantine and travel restrictions.
There have been calls to improve coordination between the Commission, Member States and the relevant European agencies.
I believe that the key is to stockpile antivirotic drugs and, to the extent possible, speed up the production and distribution of vaccines. The use of these vaccines should be financed from the Solidarity Fund.
Awareness is an absolute prerequisite for responsible decision-making.
It is essential that the Members of the European Parliament be regularly informed of scientific developments relevant to medicinal products and vaccines, and of the level of Member State preparedness.
We should also not overlook the need for prompt communication with the public and media about the situation and the measures that need to be taken.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating MrÂ Adamou, the rapporteur, on an excellent report.
It is well balanced and rational, and draws sensible conclusions on how to deal with an event which we all very much hope will not happen.
We have managed to avoid the bird flu pandemic so far.
However, it is absolutely right to be prepared and to be prepared to work together and to ensure that we have the mechanisms in place to deal with a pandemic, should it occur.
The fact that we have gone into this in a spirit of cooperation, that the Commission has talked about cooperation, and that we have encouraged discussion and debate in the Member States to ensure that all the basic things are in place â such as having enough vaccine should the worst happen â is a very good example of the European Union, this Parliament, the Commission and the Member States working together for the benefit of all the citizens of Europe.
One of the most important things that we, as elected representatives, are here to do is to ensure the safety of our constituents, the people whom we represent.
This report, and the thought that has gone into what we should do if the worst happens and we have a pandemic, is a really good example of that.
I should like to finish by highlighting an example of what has been going on in my own region, in London.
I should like to offer particular thanks to the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which has carried out work in this area and helped with the development of antivirals and vaccines against this and other infectious diseases.
I think we should hold this up as an example of what we have done here and of what institutions are doing in the Member States, and of how we can handle pandemics such as this one, which we hope will not actually take place.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ Adamou has compiled an excellent report.
It demonstrates that we take the threat of a bird flu pandemic seriously and that there is no time to sit back and take a waitâand-see approach in case one does break out, for then it will be too late.
I am also pleased that, along with the parliamentary committee, he has taken on board a few of my suggestions, such as urging the Council to empower the Commission to take crisis measures within 24 hours in the event of a pandemic breaking out.
I should like to add three comments.
In the first place, the Commissioner was right to say that we have been warned.
We can therefore expect a possible pandemic at some point.
We will then need a strategy for the European institutions, because in the case of a pandemic, travel restrictions may also affect major international meetings.
It will therefore become more difficult to meet in Brussels or Strasbourg, never mind in both.
We have not really given this enough consideration yet.
I have written to PresidentÂ Borrell on this matter, and he has replied to assure me that the services will be looking into this, and this was followed by a deafening silence.
The second point concerns the promotion of better cooperation between the Member States.
I am glad that the Commissioner insisted on this so passionately, because according to a report that was recently published in the medical journal , even if Member States are properly prepared for an outbreak of a flu pandemic to start with, they are completely oblivious to the plans of the neighbouring countries and do not, therefore, benefit from mutual harmonisation and cooperation.
If in the case of a crisis, Germany, for example, were to decide as part of its strategy to close its border with the Netherlands, then the Netherlands might want to know about this.
This is just one example.
It is really beyond me why the public health ministers recently decided against creating an emergency supply of antiviral drugs.
We already know that we will face a shortage of those drugs in the event of an outbreak, and a European supply could then prove the answer.
I congratulate the Commissioner on responding to this in a way that was sharp, tough and public.
I am right behind him on that.
Finally, such measures as, for example, the placing of disinfecting mats at airports are, of course, useful if they are taken the world over, but the biggest problem during a pandemic will be travel.
One of the aspects that must be considered is that, for example, the media will want to travel to crisis areas and back and can, as such, also be a source of infection.
It might not be a bad idea if we, looking at our own situation, were to give this some thought and explored ways in which this could be resolved, without, obviously, putting the freedom of the press at risk.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb according to which âforewarned is forearmedâ.
I think that todayâs debate should be seen in that light.
At the risk of sounding defeatist or spreading panic, it is a good thing that the EU and the Member States are preparing for the possibility of a bird flu pandemic among humans.
MrÂ Adamouâs report does a good job of summarising what is at stake and the calm, yet bold, ways in which the authorities must tackle this problem.
In my view, what is crucial in this respect is paragraphÂ 23, which calls for structured and multidisciplinary cooperation between experts, experts in human and animal health, specialists in the areas of virology, epidemiology, pathology and agriculture.
The input of communication experts cannot be underestimated either, though. These are people who can translate complex scientific findings in a simple but correct manner intended for the public at large.
All this expertise should, in my view, and also according to MrÂ Adamouâs report, be pooled in a European influenza working party that should also team up with the manufacturers.
We will need to invest in overcoming national chauvinism.
There is no justification for certain Member States, often the most cash-rich ones, buying up, at this stage, the production capacity of antiviral drugs with certain manufacturers and refusing to display the slightest solidarity with those countries that are not capable of doing the same.
That is why we certainly endorse paragraph 30, in which the Commission is expressly asked to guarantee that there are sufficient antiviral drugs and vaccines for those who are exposed to the virus.
Commissioner Kyprianou, your introduction addresses this issue in detail.
You said that there is no legal justification for this.
You also said that in principle, a number of Member States are in agreement, but when the chips are down, refuse to make the funds available.
I would like to ask you, when you respond, to make known in full transparency the names of the Member States that refuse to act in solidarity.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Adamou on his excellent report.
Bird flu remains a huge threat to human and animal health in Europe and outside, and it is clear that coordination at European level is required.
If somewhere, anywhere in the EU, a loophole appears in the measures against bird flu, the implications for all of us can be devastating.
It would, however, be foolish not to look beyond our Union, because the virus will not be careful to stay within our outside borders.
That is why it is vital that we work together with all countries in an extensive and intense effort.
The EUR 80Â million which the EU has currently made available for aid to third countries is, in my view, somewhat paltry.
It is not an area on which we should economise.
It might be an idea, for safety reasons, in order to stop the virus from spreading, to abandon Parliamentâs monthly moves and to invest the EUR 200Â million that we would save into combating the virus.
For the rest, since prevention is better than cure, it is important to provide adequate responses in the event of an outbreak.
It is important to ensure that the public is properly informed, but prevention is an area on which we will need to focus most.
I happen to take the view that inoculating poultry in Europe is still the best method of prevention.
Not only does this reduce the risk of the virus spreading, but it can also prevent the needless slaughter of millions of animals, and thus also psychological damage among the farmers and aid workers involved.
Â Â  . Mr President, the problem of avian flu has once again appeared on the European Parliamentâs agenda.
This is a good thing as we cannot afford to ignore any threats.
We have to be prepared for crisis situations, we have to be prepared to prevent them and we have to be prepared for the outbreak of an epidemic.
We also have to prevent the mass media from spreading panic, as well as preventing various illegal lobbying activities on the part of antiviral drug and vaccine manufacturers, especially as we currently know little about the effectiveness of these drugs and almost nothing about their side effects.
That is why I think it is necessary to develop an international system to fight avian flu and to create, within the framework of this system, a network of scientific and research institutes and early detection laboratories.
Secondly, we need to prepare national administrations and society for a crisis situation.
Thirdly, we need to secure the legal and economic basis for providing aid to poultry producers in regions threatened by a pandemic.
The European Commission should play a key role in all these actions on European Union territory.
The Commission should also work closely together with European partners and with partners from other continents, especially those affected by avian flu.
Here I am thinking of Asia and Africa in particular.
To sum up, we must draw up a complete and specific crisis management plan at an international, regional, local and national level.
Only such a plan will give us any chance of putting in place adequate protection and prevention measures.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, we are spending hundreds of millions on the Tamiflu antiviral, without heeding the warning of Hanoi University Hospital.
That hospital has probably dealt with more human victims of avian flu than anywhere else in the world, and the staff there tell us that Tamiflu is useless, that it does nothing.
As we learn about this flu, we move from a feeling of initial helplessness.
We now know that the principal danger is not posed by migrating wild birds which we cannot control, but by domestic or, should I say, industrial fowl, and our handling of them and of their waste products.
We can do something about that and I would refer you for a model to the example of Irelandâs actions in successfully containing the foot-and-mouth outbreak a few years ago.
Farms had disinfectant baths and carpets at all entrances.
Animal markets were closed and any movement of farm animals was closely monitored and largely stopped.
We even cancelled our St Patrickâs Day parades, but the strategy of containment was successful and it can be successful again.
We can hope to contain avian flu before it reaches a human-to-human transmission stage.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to begin by warmly welcoming MrÂ Adamou's report, which we wholeheartedly support.
I welcome what the Commissioner has said about the steps being taken as, indeed, I welcome the report that has been referred to by Mr Koker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
I want to highlight three aspects.
The first is vaccine research.
What is clear is that if we rely on the egg-based vaccine, even once we know the strain of the flu, it will take six to eight months for that to come on stream.
And if the flu pandemic has come as a result of bird flu or hen flu, we are likely to have slaughtered all the hens, which means there will be no eggs for vaccines.
So, there is an urgent need to research alternatives and in particular the DNA vaccine and I look forward to hearing what is happening on that.
Secondly, on preparedness: this excellent report covers a wide range of matters which need to be put into operation.
There is one missing, I think, which concerns the devices to deliver the vaccines.
I hope that will be included in the work being done in the Commission.
Thirdly, on the stockpile: Mr Staes asked for the names of the countries which are blocking the stockpile.
I will give them to him: it is the Netherlands, it is Sweden and it is Slovakia.
In addition, we had Britain, Germany and Portugal giving conditional support, depending on who was going to pay for it.
I think that is based on a misunderstanding of what the stockpile is supposed to be.
It is not meant to replace the work of the Member States, it is not meant to save them from having to build their own stockpiles; it is an insurance policy against the possibility that we will have an urgent situation within or perhaps outside our borders â for instance, in Moldova or Belarus, in which case it would be in all our interests to smother that outbreak as quickly as possible, before it spreads to the European Union.
For that reason, I beg the Commissioner to go back to the Council, explain what it is all about, knock heads together and make sure that those countries that have been blocking it to date remove that block so that we have this stockpile ready to protect ourselves.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Adamou on his report.
Many Members have supported the idea of a strategic stockpile of antivirals, and I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety should have accepted my proposal to implement a compulsory licensing system that should enable us to produce these antivirals more quickly and in far greater numbers so that at least 25% to 30% of the population is covered in each Member State.
The stockpile of antivirals is not enough, however.
It is crucial that we increase the rate at which the vaccines are produced, because this will obviously be a deciding factor when it comes to limiting the pandemic.
I regret that, from this perspective, the Union has not agreed to finance â or, at any rate, my fellow Members have not accepted its financing â a strategic public-private partnership on the subject of speeding up the production of vaccines against avian influenza.
My second point relates to antibiotics, which are in danger of running out once the influenza takes hold, because a whole series of complications will occur for which large stocks of antibiotics may prove necessary, mortality being due not only to the influenza, but also to the associated complications.
Thirdly, the danger of shortages: if we had to shift to producing extremely large amounts of antivirals in the European Union, the raw materials needed to make the antivirals and the masks could start to run out if the provision of supplies is not guaranteed and diversified.
Finally, since avian influenza is merely the first warning sign that major pandemics and epidemics, and particularly viral diseases, are developing on the planet, at a faster rate because of trade, it is altogether crucial that the Union takes the lead when it comes to producing new generation vaccines.
My fellow Member, MrÂ Bowis, just spoke about this.
The fact is, the very nature of our vaccines makes it difficult to produce them if we do not have any new strategies available to us.
Finally, the WHO needs increased powers of surveillance and control because, from now on, we must be united.
The surveillance and control network must be efficient and must operate on a worldwide scale.
Â Â  Mr President, I am afraid I will bring heresy to this debate.
As a medical scientist, I am convinced that the issue of an impending avian flu pandemic is a myth.
Although the high-pathogenicity strain H5N1 was first reported about ten years ago, and although precautionary measures in the most affected areas of the world have been almost non-existent, we only had about 100 fatalities worldwide, i.e. ten deaths per year!
Even the number of people dying from a simple cold is much larger that that!
The argument that a mutational change would make the avian flu virus a much greater threat is seriously flawed.
Mutations in human viruses occur all the time and we humans can do very little to stop them from occurring.
But in any event, why do we not worry about the possibility of so many other theoretically possible mutational viral changes?
Indeed, why do we not panic about the mutation causing the flu virus acquiring a cancer-causing capability?
The scientific evidence is that the risk to humans of avian flu is almost zero.
The paranoia of an avian flu pandemic has drawn vital resources from other health areas and has largely benefited the pharmaceutical industry and the media.
As a sign of protest against this state of affairs and although I have the greatest respect for the rapporteur, I am reluctant to vote in favour of this report in substance; this is only a paper exercise.
Early detection and the early warning and response system are vital components of the EU strategy to deal with any possible flu pandemic.
I am glad to hear the Commissioner say that the European Centre for Disease Control will shortly address this issue.
I congratulate Mr Adamou on this excellent report.
I join my colleagues in stressing the importance of adequate financial and technical support to developing countries, particularly the least developed, and in urging the Commission to work for a more coherent international framework following the Beijing Pledging Conference.
Â Â  Mr President, avian flu, like other viral infections, can be very dangerous.
The document on preparedness and response planning in the event of a flu pandemic is certainly necessary and will undoubtedly be helpful.
I would, however, like to draw your attention today to another problem. This is a problem that is rarely mentioned when discussing broad prophylactic measures.
We ought to consider plans to decentralise poultry farming and return to using natural feeding methods.
Poultry living in such conditions and fed in a natural manner will be more resistant to disease, and the meat produced will be healthier for humans than that obtained from mass-produced poultry, or in other words crowded flocks of birds that are fed an unvarying and unnatural diet and sometimes kept in very stressful conditions.
Furthermore, profit-driven production achieved in such a deceitful manner is harmful, and the profits made are then in any case destroyed when billions of birds that are sick and have weak immune systems need to be culled.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, there are fewer incidences of avian influenza at present, but that does not mean that the virus has disappeared, and the danger of its mutating into a form of human influenza still exists.
It would therefore be very serious to lose sight of the danger, just as it would be wrong to say that we are prepared.
Let us therefore take advantage of this brief respite in order to fully contemplate the measures to be provided for.
The European Union must take a firm stance.
I would even say that, on behalf of the general interest, it must go beyond some of its prerogatives so as to perfectly coordinate its emergency plans, provided that such plans exist.
They have to exist first.
We need to overcome this schizophrenia, which consists in saying that the Member States' prerogatives must not be infringed.
What will we say when a pandemic occurs?
Will we say that it is not our fault, that we are not responsible?
We are obliged to adapt our decisions to the context.
In addition, it is important that the European Union provides its logistical and financial support to help develop vaccines.
The laboratories are ready, but we must support their work, because, if they are to develop vaccines, they must see orders coming in, which are required for strategic stocks to be built up.
It is only on this condition that we will prevent trafficking, which would be liable to develop in the event of a crisis, and that we will ensure that products designed to combat all types of epidemic are distributed fairly: vaccines, antiviral medications, masks and so on. Thus, we will prevent any kind of panic, which would only create problems.
Finally, Commissioner, what we need is an inventory from each Member State.
Let each government commit to showing solidarity!
I can see from your reaction, Commissioner, that we cannot count on that happening.
A selfish attitude faced with a worldwide epidemic would be completely at odds with the European spirit.
What I fear, Commissioner, is that, in reality â and we know that this is the case â no one will be prepared in this affair, and that is well and truly the most serious aspect of all of this.
Â Â  â Mr President, the greatest threat that is repeatedly brought up in connection with bird flu is the appearance of a new virus sub-type that can be transferred from one human to another.
Fortunately, we have not yet reached that stage, but even without this worst case scenario bird flu is a major threat to human health.
The WHO uses a six-phase system of pandemic alerts in order to inform the world of the level of danger. We are currently in alert phase 3.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.
His measures show what coordination and networking measures are and will be necessary in order to be better prepared for the situation.
Bird flu is a global infectious disease, and I would therefore point out that this topic will also have a role to play at the ACP meeting taking place in Vienna next week and that we are going to adopt a resolution in this regard.
Commissioner, both you and I have been addressed at many events and development policy discussions, and asked not only for the European Union to provide technical and financial aid to the developing countries to help deal with this problem, but also that we do not lay the burden of the fall in the poultry sector on the economic back of the developing countries by granting massive export subsidies and thereby once again destroying and damaging markets in these areas.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Adamou for his substantial report.
I very much support what he has said today.
I would like to emphasise the importance of improved cooperation and information-sharing between the Commission, European States and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Each country has to take the measures best suited to fighting the influenza pandemic.
However, no country can face the consequences of the pandemic alone.
International cooperation is an absolute necessity if its impact is to be reduced.
I therefore fully endorse the idea of creating a European taskforce which would be coordinated by the Commission and in which Parliament would be represented.
This taskforce, which would bring together experts from the relevant fields, such as human and animal health, neurology and epidemiology, should work with representatives of the European vaccine and antiviral drugs industries.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to MrÂ Adamou on his excellent and detailed report, which is very good in terms of content.
We have founded the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, in Stockholm in good time to ensure that we are equipped for our coming tasks.
When it comes to the possibility of an influenza pandemic, the European added value of which we are all so fond is clear to see: joint planning, joint crisis management, joint coordination, joint logistics and joint travel restrictions are being implemented, and joint virostatics, joint vaccines and joint stockpiling are needed.
We have solidarity in cases of disaster: Europe is called upon in cases of disaster, and joint action and cooperation have priority over subsidiarity.
In this connection, we urgently require an open, honest and rapid exchange of information within the Member States, and the ECDC and the Commission need to collect and monitor this data.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission.
I am very sparing with my words of thanks, which makes them all the more significant.
Many thanks for so quickly agreeing to make EURÂ 100Â 000 million available for aid both here and in the developing world.
I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their willingness to include the pandemic as part of the Solidarity Fund.
We all hope that the pandemic will remain a fictional, theoretical exercise, and will never occur, but I am optimistic that we are well prepared for the possibility of an outbreak.
Â Â  Mr President, I come from the DÃ©l-AlfÃ¶ld region of Hungary, which has been severely affected by disaster.
In my native village, Szank, and in the surrounding area, 350Â 000 domestic poultry had to be destroyed in one week.
All regulations of the European Commission have been complied with, and the Veterinary Authority designated the affected areas.
The destruction of domestic poultry had actually started before the presence of bird flu was detected in laboratories.
This was the right thing to do, because rapid action prevented the spread of the virus.
It has been confirmed that the earlier strict anti-epidemic measures of the European Union had been correct.
We are not asking the European Commission for more money, but for a more flexible attitude in the course of the reconciliation of the 2007-2013 rural development programmes, so that appropriate funds can be ensured for the poultry sector, farm reconstruction and new animal stock.
Â Â  Mr President, epidemics have swept over the world several times, leaving behind devastation and pain.
I do not know whether our healthcare system will ever reach a point where we will be completely free of epidemics; in any case, it is certain that today we are still very far from such a situation.
However, among all the uncertainties, we can be very certain of one thing: that we have never been as prepared to face the danger as we are now.
I am glad that Parliament is debating this issue now, because we can see exactly where we stand, and what else we need to do in order to be truly as prepared as we can possibly be.
Our preparedness for a potential flu epidemic is based on the national anti-pandemic plans coordinated by the European Commission.
It is important to make sure that the plans also include technical actions, such as the determination of the areas that need to be isolated, the procurement of the appropriate virus-killing kits, the preparation of the list of those who should be vaccinated as a priority, the fair distribution of instruments to be used against the epidemic or the regulation of traffic and attitude at the workplace.
It is essential that alongside the technical measures we also pay attention to communication tasks.
In the event of a pandemic, the prevention of panic among the population of a Member State is at least as important as ensuring an accurate, rapid and reliable flow of information between Member States.
Communication must involve all social groups and strata, and this can only be achieved by employing all available instruments in a concentrated manner.
They say that problems always start at the top.
Therefore it is essential that the coordinating organisations on all continents and at global level can cooperate harmoniously.
In Europe, WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Commission must work together as closely as possible even now, in the preparation phase.
I congratulate MrÂ Adamou for his own-initiative report.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish first to thank all my honourable friends for their opinions and then to make two comments on what I have heard.
Commissioner, I am sorry about the position of certain Member States who are reacting to the creation of a stockpile of anti-viral drugs.
It would appear that they are forgetting the basic principle that prevention of disease is better than cure.
I would repeat here what I said in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when we met, namely that the Member States should bear in mind that, if a pandemic breaks out, their entire budget will not be enough.
That is why it is better that we prevent than that we cure.
My second comment concerns the position taken by MrÂ Matsakis, who has the inalienable right to vote against the report, but who does not have the right to mislead the European Parliament by saying that the possible pandemic is a myth, given that all the scientific bodies and all the specialist scientists around the world are sounding the alarm bell and talking about millions of dead.
The examples of the influenza in Spain and elsewhere, where we had millions of dead, are not far back.
That is why what I would like to say to MrÂ Matsakis is that he has the right not to vote for the report, but he does not have the right to mislead the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate.
Once again it has been confirmed that we have the same approach and that we see eye to eye on this issue.
Almost all aspects of the preparedness plans are generic in nature.
That means that, when we prepare for a possible flu pandemic, we are preparing not just for the possibility of avian flu, but for any flu pandemic and, when it comes to it, for any health threat.
Since they are mostly generic in nature, they can be used in any kind of health threat and they are therefore a good investment on the part of the Member States and the Community that will not go to waste.
We should all pray that they do go to waste, that we do not have a health crisis and will never actually need to use them, but nevertheless it is a good investment in preparedness, both for natural pandemics and for bioterrorism.
We are much better prepared than we were last year or the year before.
We have not yet reached the target and we can never actually say that we have.
It is a continuous effort and there is always room for improvement, always a need to do more.
Nevertheless, we have really come a long way, but we still have much to do.
We still do not know a great deal about the specific virus.
That is why we have invested so much in research into the specific avian flu virus and how it behaves.
We have certain statistics, but given the areas where the virus usually occurs and is endemic, the reporting and monitoring is not as effective as in some other areas.
We still lack data and will therefore be investing in this.
I will not go into the animal health side, since we had an opportunity to discuss that recently in this House.
However, the basic policy of the European Union, as well as the world community, is to make sure that avian flu remains an animal disease.
In order to do that, we have to eradicate and deal with it effectively at the animal level.
Cooperation is very important.
We had the post-Beijing Conference in Vienna last week, where practical steps were discussed for implementing and fulfilling the pledges already made in Beijing.
It is true that progress was slow.
I am optimistic that things will speed up now.
All the European Commission decisions required for the EURÂ 100Â million pledged are in place now and it will start being spent on the various initiatives.
The next meeting will be in Africa and will cover the problems of the region.
I must remind you that the European Community has pledged money specifically for the African continent.
I agree that it is very important to have the involvement of all services.
That is what we have done in our specific plan and that is what we encourage Member States to do in their own national plans.
There should be a lead preparedness and response authority, but all services in each Member State and at Community level as well should be involved.
The interoperability of national plans is also very important and we have been working on that.
I totally agree with those of you who raised the issue, for example, of borders closing.
In the reality of the European Union, one Member State cannot close its borders or cancel flights from a specific place when we have the internal market and freedom of movement.
We need cooperation and coordination.
We have already set up the structures and mechanisms to achieve that at Community level.
We have raised this issue at G8 level â international level â as well, proposing the âno first useâ principle, so that no G8 partner would close its borders and cancel flights without at least consulting the others in the group.
I take your point on the issue of the institutions.
As you know, we have been working on continuity of Commission services.
We have also asked Parliament to look into this matter, and will be working closely with Parliamentâs services to ensure continuity within Parliament and its meetings and services.
Antivirals are certainly a debated issue.
Antivirals are not a panacea, they are not a cure, they are the first line of defence and we have always said that.
But as long as we do not have the pandemic virus, we will not have the pandemic vaccine which would be the basic defence.
We are trying to shorten the period required to develop an approved licence and produce the vaccine, but we will need something in the meantime and antivirals are one solution.
As regards the issue of stockpiles, it is not just that some Member States object to the principle, but there is also reluctance by many Member States on the funding of the stockpile.
We explained that it will not be a substitute for national stockpiles.
On the contrary, in our options paper we have introduced a condition that, in order to be able to benefit, a Member State will have to prove that it has actually begun creating its own national stockpile.
That would be a great relief, not only for the Member States that are still in the process of developing stockpiles, but for the neighbouring countries as well, and for the WHO.
The WHO would not then have to worry about the European region, because we would take care of ourselves and our neighbours and the WHO could concentrate on other regions in greater need than us.
I totally agree with Mrs GrossetÃªte, but I am afraid that was not the response we received.
I was disappointed, but at the same time we have to be realistic.
I do not want this debate to continue and then be used as an excuse for some Member States not to develop national stockpiles.
Unless the Council changes the position, the Austrian Presidency, âchallengesâ â if I can use the expression â the Member States to say they will be willing to review the position.
It is important to emphasise that Member States will have to create their own national stockpiles.
I totally agree that this is a question of solidarity.
To be realistic, if we cannot agree on the solidarity principle now, what is going to happen if there is a crisis and one Member State has to share its medicine with other Member States, with all the citizens feeling threatened?
One of the weaknesses detected at the exercise last November was the unwillingness on the part of Member States to share medicine.
We therefore need to establish solidarity now, when we can be more realistic in our approach than in a time of crisis.
Then it can work in the way we would all wish.
Nevertheless, we will try to coordinate the Member States and at least make sure that they take all the necessary steps for the sake of their individual citizens and European citizens in general.
I will, as always, keep Parliament informed of every step we take.
Â Â  Mr President, I can see MrÂ Kyprianou leaving the Chamber, but he has not answered the question as to which countries will ultimately be withholding their solidarity.
MrÂ Bowis was right to list a few names, but I should like to find out from the Commissioner if he can confirm them.
It is of huge importance to me that we as MEPs do our jobs, but also that we can pass this expertise on to our colleagues in the national parliaments so that they can reprimand their governments when they fail to come up to the mark, and draw attention to the total lack of solidarity in this area.
I believe that that is also what European democracy is all about, namely to pass on what we do in Europe to the national and regional parliaments.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am afraid that, as you know, the practice is that we do not release the individual positions taken in the Council.
The Council takes decisions as a body and there was no such decision in that respect, which we regret.
It is up to each Member State to disclose its position.
We have to present the picture as a whole, which is why it would not be productive at this point to start naming individual Member States.
It is a complicated issue and the position taken by each Member State would have to be explained in detail.
I regret that it would not be useful to present specific names at this stage.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on human rights in Tunisia.
Â Â  . () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, human rights is one of the issues addressed â and very intensively and on a very long-term basis â by the European Unionâs network of treaties with third states, comprising association agreements, cooperation agreements, European Neighbourhood Policy action plans, and human rights, the common values of the European Union, are indeed an essential component part of them, not merely for legal reasons, but because this European Union defends certain values and takes care to see that third states do likewise.
Among them, of course, is Tunisia, and the Council has indeed had good reason recently to be concerned about the human rights situation there.
I would like to take this opportunity to say how regrettable I think it is that MrsÂ Flautre should herself have come to be on the receiving end of threats from the Tunisian security forces.
On 5Â June, the European Union lodged a very strong protest concerning these occurrences with the Tunisian foreign ministry.
The upholding of human rights is a quite essential element in our dealings with Tunisia, just as much as it is in our relations with those third states with which we have agreements, and is set out as such in very clear terms in the association agreement with Tunisia and in the European Neighbourhood Policy action plan in respect of that country.
As part of the action plan, which has been effective since 4Â July 2005, Tunisia entered into a number of very specific obligations concerning democracy, responsible governance and human rights, and there is no doubt about the fact that practical compliance with these obligations is of major importance in terms of the further development of the European Unionâs relations with Tunisia.
One thing to which the country committed itself was the establishment of a sub-committee on human rights.
We strongly invite our Tunisian partners to make it possible for this sub-committee to hold its first meeting in the coming months.
The European Union wants to deepen dialogue on these important issues before this year is out.
It is obvious that the European Union would like to see Tunisia â like every other third state â becoming stronger and more prosperous, while at the same time making progress in those areas where there may be deficits, as is the case, in many instances, where human rights are concerned.
It has to be said that international reports, statistics and rankings point to Tunisia enjoying good, and indeed impressive, economic rights and social advances.
The EU very much welcomes Tunisiaâs efforts, particularly as regards the position of women, the right to education and other issues.
That an Arab country should make very definite progress in these areas is important for the Arab world as a whole, and so are the positive steps that have been taken in recent months, and we do â as we should â acknowledge them, such as, for example, the opening up of the prisons to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the appointment of a mediator and the amnesty for political prisoners.
Since Tunisia is one of the most important countries with the capacity for serving as an example to the Arab world, we also hope that we will be able to work together with it within the new UN Human Rights Council in a constructive manner.
None of this, however, can conceal the fact that the human rights situation in Tunisia does, in many respects, give cause for concern, particularly as regards the right of expression of opinion, freedom of association and freedom of assembly, not to mention the independence of the judiciary.
In particular, the events before and during last Novemberâs world summit on the information society in Tunis still cast a shadow over Tunisia.
Following these occurrences, we gave Tunisia a public and clear reminder of the European Unionâs expectations of it as regards the discharge of its obligations and responsibilities in matters of human rights.
On the occasion of a human rights dÃ©marche by the EU in November 2005, we underlined our regret at the occurrences at the World Summit and reiterated our core concerns, which were, firstly, that an end should be put to the blocking of EU-funded civil society projects; secondly, that progress should be made in the implementation of the programme of judicial reform; and, thirdly, that a sub-committee for human rights should be set up.
There is no doubt that these dÃ©marches were a first step, and the Commission and the Council have closely monitored developments since November.
As the Austrian Presidency of the Council began at the start of this year, a number of accommodating gestures were in fact seen to be made, including the signature, in December 2005, of the financial agreement for the MEDA programme for the modernisation of the justice system, and the release of EU funds for two NGOs.
However, the funds for the oldest and most respected human rights organisation on the African continent, the existence of which the Tunisian authorities themselves describe as an remained blocked, which, indeed, they still are.
The organisation to which I refer is the whose complaints about the policeâs attempts at intimidating its members and at interfering with its proper functioning have not since then been resolved.
As long ago as September 2005, the organisation was prevented from holding its General Meeting pending a court ruling that is still awaited.
The EU troikaâs response to this was to embark on a dÃ©marche in Geneva in order to back up the EUâs desire that the League might be allowed to continue its work without hindrance.
I am sure that the Commission, too, would like to say something about the blocking of the funds it has allocated to the League, but I do not myself propose to say anything further on the subject.
Despite a further dÃ©marche by the European Union on 22Â May this year, the League was again prevented from holding its General Meeting on 27 and 28Â May, when police were deployed in a disproportionate manner against peaceful activists, and, regrettably, the chairwoman of your Houseâs Human Rights Committee, MrsÂ Flautre, was not only a witness to this but also a victim of it.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that repeated occurrences of this kind do damage to a country's image in the eyes of the world at large.
Following our exchange of views with the Tunisian foreign minister on 5Â June, the Presidency has taken further steps by way of response to these occurrences.
The meeting of the association committee in Tunis, scheduled for July 2006, will offer us an appropriate context for a debate in which these events can be addressed, and we are also willing to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with you, in this House, on that subject.
I would like, by way of conclusion, to make a number of further observations on other developments in the human rights sphere, to which this resolution of your House makes reference, and which are also a cause for concern to the Council.
Freedom of association â albeit within certain limits â is enshrined in the Tunisian constitution; as is so often the case with human rights issues, the law or the constitution is very much up to standard, but what matters is the way these are implemented and enforced.
The Tunisian constitution also guarantees the independence of the judiciary, but, on the other hand, there are numerous reports of the authorities interfering in court cases.
The case brought against the lawyer MohammadÂ Abou, which, as you know, was brought against him after he published a critical article online, would appear to back up these accusations.
Let me now conclude by stressing that European Union is very interested in cooperating with Tunisia in modernising its justice system, for which purpose it has allocated funds as part of the MEDA programme, and it takes a great interest in the progress achieved in putting this project into effect.
Speaking on behalf of the Council, I can assure you that the European Union will continue to be firm in raising human rights issues and concerns with Tunisia and will be demanding of the Tunisian authorities that they apply the principles of human rights and democracy across the board.
In so doing, our first priority has to do with the discharge of the obligations concerning democracy, responsible governance and human rights, given by Tunisia to the European Union in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
We have left Tunisia in no doubt that it is on compliance with these obligations that the further development of our relationship will depend.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the Commission is closely following the human rights situation in Tunisia. It is using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Tunisian authorities to make progress in this crucial area.
It is particularly concerned over breaches of fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of expression, association and assembly.
My colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in her bilateral contacts with the Tunisian authorities, including her latest visit to Tunisia in October 2005, has systematically pointed to the importance of respecting human rights and developing a free, open and participative civil society.
The Commission has also closely followed the events and incidents that occurred during the congress of the on 27Â May.
On that day, despite a warning note from the Tunisian authorities, a representative of the delegation of the European Commission attended the congress of that league.
He therefore witnessed what happened and was able to provide support to the representative of the European Parliament, Mrs Flautre, who also participated in the event.
I very much regret that she was threatened by the security services and find this totally unacceptable.
Hence, on 5Â June 2006, a meeting took place between the Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Abdallah, and the EU Ambassadors in Tunisia.
The head of the Commission delegation underlined on that occasion that the presence of the Commission observers and parliamentary observers at the congress of the was quite legitimate.
Unfortunately, the Tunisian authorities remain reticent over the issue of this league.
In more general terms, I wish to remind you that the Commission is committed to providing support for the promotion of human rights and the development of civil society in Tunisia, including this human rights league.
In that context, the Commission deeply regrets the continued blockage by the Tunisian authorities of EU efforts in support of civil society, particularly under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
We shall continue to press the Tunisian authorities to rapidly unblock these.
With regard to the future, it is our firm intention â shared with the Council â to use neighbourhood instruments as a lever in the field of human rights.
The EU-Tunisia Neighbourhood Action Plan includes sweeping commitments in the field of human rights, democracy and better governance.
Moreover, it provides for the creation of a human rights subcommittee where the implementation of such commitments will be jointly assessed and monitored.
On 2 June 2006 â just two weeks ago â the Commission submitted to the Tunisian authorities the draft internal regulation of the abovementioned subcommittee and is awaiting a reply from the Tunisian side.
I therefore want to firmly reassure you that the Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that the provisions of the association agreement and of the EU-Tunisia action plan with regard to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are being duly implemented.
Â Â  . Mr President, Tunisia is one of our partner countries in the Barcelona Process, and thus there should be interest, from both sides and not only from ours, in order to ensure that the commitments made in this process are observed, including those regarding the respect for human rights.
Yet, Mr President, we also need to be cautious, without jumping to any hurried conclusions.
This is the third time in around six months that this Parliament is discussing the resolution on human rights in Tunisia.
This is out of tune with what we say and also with what we do not say about other countries, including some of our partner countries in the Mediterranean where the human rights situation is certainly no better than that of Tunisia.
To be clear, I consider that Tunisia has a great deal more to be done in this field.
On our part, however, we also need to send a message to Tunisia which is just, balanced, coherent, and treat all countries in the same way.
After all, we are speaking of a country which has already made a degree of progress, as Minister Winkler mentioned in his intervention.
We are talking about a country which has just been elected into the Human Rights Council of the United Nations. This is a country which has also just took over the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
Mr President, I do not know how coherent we are being by insisting on maintaining the Congress of the Tunisian League for Human Rights when we know that there is an order from the Tunisian Court for this Congress not to take place.
What are we expecting: that the order of the Court be challenged or ignored?
Would it then not be better, rather than condemning, to solicit dialogue between all parties involved?
Would it not also be better to ask the Tunisian authorities to participate as well in order for a solution to be found?
Undoubtedly, it is important for this Congress to be held, yet we know that there is a blockage due to this Court order, and we need the commitment of all parties in order for this impasse to be unblocked.
Even with regards to the law on the superior institute of lawyers which has just been passed, what exactly are we saying?
Are we saying that there has been a breach of human rights because no consultation was made on this law before it was passed?
Because if this is what we are saying, then we should admit that there is a large number of Member States of the European Union itself which are also breaching human rights due to lack of consultation.
To conclude, Mr President, I repeat that I wish to see a Tunisia which safeguards human rights a lot, lot more, but I also want to see that we send this message in a constructive manner.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we are concerned here with the third resolution that we are proposing that the European Parliament adopt on human rights in Tunisia.
With the Commission and the Council having followed the same line as our Assembly last September and December, we had a right to hope that Tunisia would respect its European commitments.
Nothing of the sort happened, as the ban on holding the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League and the recent forceful interventions against human rights activists and legal professionals demonstrate.
Just as serious is the way in which the agreement with the European Union on the reform of the judiciary is being misused.
This agreement, which was signed in December 2005, was intended to mark real progress in terms of respect for human rights in that country and, above all, to guarantee a genuinely independent status for the judiciary.
The only measure taken in connection with the association agreement has therefore been harmed by the fact that the law establishing the lawyersâ training institute was imposed without the opinion of the Bar and placed under the exclusive authority of the executive.
Not only have the commitments made by Tunisia not been fulfilled but, furthermore, the expected progress has not been observed.
Quite the contrary, the latest events reflect a worsening of the situation and amount to a form of provocation towards the European Union, given that respect for human rights underpins the EU-Tunisia partnership.
There is therefore no use in confining oneself to words and hopes.
What we expect from the Commission and from the Council are acts, since the pedagogy of dialogue does not seem to be enough.
We therefore call for an Association Council to be convened quickly, for the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League to be held without any restrictions, for the funds earmarked for civil society to be released and for the acts of intimidation and harassment to stop.
Furthermore, we are calling for all of those measures that will be considered appropriate where adopting our resolution is concerned to be accompanied by a precise and fixed timeframe, so that no one can be unaware of the reciprocal commitments that link the European Union and Tunisia.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, todayâs debate is a repeat of the one that we held exactly six months ago, on 13Â December 2005.
The Presidency concluded its speech back then in the same manner as todayâs speech.
I quote: âIt is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali.
Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations'.
Since then, steps have indeed been taken by the European Union, but those steps have clearly shown their limits.
The deployment of Tunisian police officers and their violent behaviour â which I have witnessed first-hand â prevented the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League from being held at the end of May, but not, MrÂ Busuttil, as a result of a court ruling, given that 32 court actions have been taken against the LTDH.
This is well and truly a case of legal harassment.
The funds allocated to the associations are still frozen.
A great many independent NGOs and political parties are still being denied the right to exist.
The judiciary is still being repressed.
MrÂ Abou is still in prison, and the harassment directed towards not only him, but also towards his wife, takes place on a daily basis.
You have announced to us, MrÂ Winkler, that an Association Committee will meet in July.
Is that the response to the formal request made by the European Parliament, in December, for an urgent meeting of the Association Committee aimed at looking into the priority issue of human rights in Tunisia?
That being the case, it is quite logical that the Tunisian authorities are acting with a growing sense of impunity.
I will turn once again to you, MrÂ Winkler: how might one justify the fact that the Austrian representative did not even think it useful to travel to the Congress, and that he clearly did everything in his power to hamper the action taken by the European Union on the ground?
Only two Member States were present at the Congress of the LTDH.
Finally, I must emphasise the so-called âreform and justice' project.
The Tunisian authorities have just succeeded in passing a project establishing a lawyersâ training institute against the unanimous opinion of the Bar Council.
The Tunisian authorities still refuse, to this day, to authorise the visit of a United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, while the magistratesâ association has simply been disbanded and replaced.
How can we believe, under these circumstances, that the Tunisian authorities have the slightest intention of safeguarding the independence of the judicial system?
Commissioner, I believe that we must suspend this entire project in order to review it and that we must make the completion of the project and the payment of EU funds subject to certain conditions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the violation of human rights in Tunisia has now taken a shocking turn.
The Tunisian Government has prevented the Tunisian League for Human Rights from holding its congress by deploying police and secret services.
That is unacceptable.
I must point out that the Tunisian league is an integral part of the International League for Human Rights, which is a key partner in discussions with EU institutions.
Not only did the police physically prevent the meeting from taking place, but they also mistreated our fellow Member MrsÂ Flautre, to whom I offer my full personal solidarity and that of our parliamentary group as a whole.
I should also like to extend our solidarity to MrÂ Mokhtar Trifi, the president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights, and all his colleagues.
I must also point out that the funds that the Commission has allocated for projects to promote human rights remain blocked.
The whole European Union is politically being held hostage by a government that has decided to trample on human rights.
The time has come, therefore, to react.
The European Commission must stop hiding behind the divisions within the Council of the European Union and behind the vetoes imposed by France in particular.
I formally call for the Commission to start the procedures for calling an extraordinary meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council, in order to evaluate the state of political and civil liberties in the country.
We must not be afraid to raise the additional possibility of suspending the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement on the basis of ArticleÂ 2 thereof.
I say this also in my capacity as rapporteur on the democratic clause, which was unanimously approved by the European Parliament and gives us full political legitimacy to call for suspension of the agreement and to ask for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to be urgently convened.
The Commission and the Council, on the other hand, tell us that they intend to continue cowering to a despotic government that, from Tunis, thinks it can tell them what to do in Brussels.
In that case, however, I do not think that Parliament will be on your side.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, sadly, I have little time, but some of my predecessors have seen themselves granted certain favours, and I request the same treatment.
My group should like to point out that, contrary to what people are so fond of believing in this House, there is no unanimous desire to pick a fight, in the field of human rights, with the government of Tunisia, a friendly country if ever there was one.
That was, moreover, the tone of the speech made by my excellent fellow Member, MrÂ Busuttil, which I support.
Firstly, many believe that the internal disputes within the Human Rights League - which, I might add, are obscure Tunisian disputes - should not be resolved by the European Parliament.
That is not our role.
Secondly, many of us are delighted to see that a country of the South is progressing so well on the path to development, and has been doing so for many years now, and that it might eventually become a genuine developed country and, as such, serve as an example to the whole of the Arab world, and perhaps even to the whole of Africa.
Our admiration for Tunisia is all the more profound because its government is able to keep what are, as we know, ever-recurring and ever-threatening waves of fundamentalism and religious fanaticism at bay.
Many of us are surprised, too, that some people should be obsessed with this country to the point where they devote the bulk of their term in office to trying by all possible means to heap opprobrium on it.
That is strange to say the least.
Finally, many wonder about the constant recourse to this âdouble standardsâ principle.
We are very fussy about human rights with some countries, especially when they escape the influence of the United States and the English-speaking world, but we are much less so with others, including the Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrÂ Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said in this debate, with some conflicting points made at times.
I should therefore like to say to you straightaway that I do not wish to go back over the unacceptable events that have taken place and that are, moreover, taking place every day in Tunisia.
I believe - and this is undoubtedly what a number of Members of this Parliament are waiting for - that we must go beyond the stage of condemning this kind of event, otherwise we will never stop having to do so.
What we want now â and several of us have said so â is action, that is to say practical decisions by the Council and the Commission regarding Tunisia on account of the incessant human rights violations of which the country is guilty.
We have the means to put pressure on the Tunisian Government, let us use them!
In this regard, I am delighted by what I heard from the Councilâs representative, namely that the sub-committee on human rights is being convened.
This response is overdue, but, if it were able to be implemented, it would be a good thing.
It has become urgent, as others have said, to convene the Association Council provided for by the agreement between the Union and Tunisia and to impose on the latter a binding schedule in which respect for human rights must be the central issue to be settled.
For fear of losing credibility on the international stage, the Union must, in my opinion, have the courage to make strong political decisions, and I join MrsÂ Flautre in calling for the suspension of all cooperation with Tunisia.
I will conclude, MrÂ President, by saying this: the resolution that we are going to vote on is targeted at the other European institutions, but it must also attract the attention of Europeans, many of whom sunbathe each year on the beaches of Djerba and of Tunisia in general, and remind them that, just a stone's throw from their beaches, are prisons in which democrats are rotting away.
Â Â  Mr President, Tunisia is a key country in the Euro-Mediterranean process. This is demonstrated by the fact that it has had an Association Agreement since 1998 and an action plan since 2005 and that its Parliament has presided over the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly for the last couple of months.
That is precisely what makes the things happening in that country in terms of human rights violations even more serious.
In reply to MrÂ Busuttil, when he says that we spend too much time on Tunisia, I would say that what we cannot do is abandon a friend as an impossible case and we will therefore have to produce as many resolutions as are needed.
We must not allow the Tunisian authorities to believe that, however much we talk about human rights violations, we will get tired of it and shut up.
That would be unfair to the Euro-Mediterranean process, it would be unfair to the Tunisian people and it would be unfair to ourselves.
The fact that Tunisia acts badly cannot be allowed to justify others also acting badly.
That is the political problem we are facing, Mr President.
The Euro-Mediterranean process is a success, but there is at least one issue in relation to which we have not yet achieved our objective, and that is that respect for human rights should be the norm in the politics of all the countries involved in this process.
What has happened in Tunisia is the latest example, but it will not be the last, unfortunately.
I would therefore call upon the Tunisian authorities to think in terms of becoming a model of a secular and democratic State, that respects human rights, and to stop being a model of a secular State that does not respect human rights, and they understand perfectly well what I mean by that.
Â Â  . () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as several speakers have pointed out, Tunisia is a partner of ours, and I believe that it is important that we should treat it as one, without ignoring all the difficulties involved.
You have also pointed out that this is a country that serves as an example to others, that it plays an important part in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and that our striving for a dialogue between religions and civilisations makes it important that we should keep on talking to a secular and moderate Islamic country.
It is for that reason that I believe that the political and diplomatic measures for which we opt in addressing violations of human rights â and nobody will deny that the human rights situation in Tunisia is unsatisfactory â must be proportionate, and what that means is that we should try to take the sort of action that brings results, while also â and this is where I can do no other than agree with MrÂ Busuttil â maintaining our own credibility by means of a consistent, coherent and clear human rights policy.
MrsÂ Trautmann laid particular emphasis on cooperation in the judicial sphere, and this is something that strikes me as particularly important.
Being a lawyer myself, and having practised as one for many years, I cannot do other than endorse that view, for an independent and operational justice system is crucial to the functioning of a democracy.
I therefore believe that we and the Commission must support and foster those projects and work with Tunisia towards an independent and functioning justice system.
Several speakers also said that nothing has been done about the demand for an urgent meeting of the Association Council.
Perhaps I might remind you that the calling of an Association Council meeting requires the consent of both parties, but this Association Council will now convene in July, when it is not a matter of doubt that we will use this opportunity to express to Tunisia our disquiet, our concern and our expectations.
I do believe, then, that we should press on with our policy, which is a very coherent one aimed at improving the human rights situation in Tunisia, and I do think we are on the right track here.
As I indeed said in my introductory remarks, some progress has been made, and I trust that it will be possible for more to be achieved.
You may be assured that the Council and, I am sure, the Commission, too, will maintain a consistent line on this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is clear that the situation in Tunisia as regards human rights continues to be very serious, not least where freedom of expression is concerned.
Both international and local human rights organisations, unfortunately, report an increasing number of cases of concern.
This must be the starting point for our assessment and our policy, where human rights are taken as the key priority.
The Commission will continue closely to monitor developments and will use all the means at its disposal to improve the situation.
For instance, I hope that the EU-Tunisia sub-committee on human rights and democracy will soon be up and running.
Tunisia has already informally stated that individual cases will be raised, notably in the framework of its political dialogue meetings with the European Union.
It is evident that a dialogue on human rights must also include individual cases.
I have some experience on this as regards the candidate countries, where it is linked to our rigorous conditionality.
The application of conditionality is essential for the use of the âsoftâ power that the European Union has at its disposal.
I hope that conditions can be established for a fair and smooth implementation of the MEDA project on modernisation of the judiciary, to which there was a reference, a project for which we have a budget of EURÂ 22Â million.
That would be an important step forward in enhancing reform and modernisation of the judiciary through the MEDA programme.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the 17th EU-Russia Summit (26 May 2006).
Â Â  . () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as both the Federal Chancellor himself, the Foreign Minister, and I myself have already told you, relations with Russia are of particular strategic significance, and it is therefore obvious that the Austrian Presidency treated this 17th EU-Russia summit in Sochi on the Black Sea on 25Â May as a special priority.
In essence, the summit considered important issues in our relations with Russia, including the implementation of the common roadmap, the situation in the EU and in the Russian Federation, and future treaty relationships, but also international issues.
At the heart of discussions, though, and for reasons that will be obvious to you, was the important topic of energy.
As you are all aware, only a few hours into the presidency, something occurred that the Federal Chancellor has termed a âwake up callâ, and that has resulted in the European Union developing a deeper interest in this topic.
I would also like to remind your House of the conclusions from the March European Council.
The issue of relations in matters concerning energy, particularly with Russia, has also been the subject of in-depth internal debate within the European Union, and so the summit offered a good initial opportunity for talks with PresidentÂ Putin about the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which triggered the January crisis.
Although PresidentÂ Putin strongly defended Russia's actions and tried to explain them, he was very struck by the strength of the European Unionâs reaction in this matter.
Not only did the March European Council, for the first time, lay the foundations of a European energy policy, but it also had an impact on discussions in Russia.
The European Council at the end of this week will be taking a paper by the High Representative and the Commission as the basis for deliberations on the external dimension of the European Unionâs energy policy, which will also take account of the positions expressed by Russia at the summit.
The deliberations of the G8, which are to meet in St Petersburg in July, will also take account of the discussion on energy at the summit.
You will be aware that, under the Russian presidency, the main topic of the G8 is the security of energy supply.
We have seized this opportunity for a thorough, honest and frank dialogue on energy matters.
The European Union has made it clear that Russia must be â as it indeed was and is â a reliable partner in the energy sphere, but we have, nonetheless, expressed our concern at the effects on the EU of the January gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine and emphatically pointed out that our relationship in this area must be founded on mutuality, not only as regards access to markets, but also as regards infrastructure and investments.
We also emphasised the significance, where competition is concerned, of the principles of transparency and openness, and strongly urged Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty.
President Putin, by way of response to this, gave an assurance that Russia would continue to be a reliable energy supplier, while, at the same time, not excluding the possibility of Russia ratifying the Energy Charter Treaty in the long term.
Until that happened, though, he said that cooperation should be on a case-by-case basis, and pointed out that there was already substantial foreign investment in the Russian energy sector, to a considerably greater extent than in many other energy-producing countries.
He took the view that the mutual approach would make sense only if the European Union were itself prepared to allow Russia access to resources that it saw as being as significant for it as energy resources were to Russia.
It became evident that the European Union and Russia had decidedly different views as to the shape that future cooperation should take, but it should be noted on the positive side that the EU-Russia summit saw the subject being handled in a frank, positive and productive fashion, with both sides agreeing that the energy dialogue, having already been begun, should be continued with to a greater extent and in greater depth.
In particular, President Putin clarified his desire to build bridges despite the differences and work towards an agreement with the EU.
At the summit, both sides stressed their mutual dependency where energy was concerned and emphasised that the EU and Russia had to define their relations in this crucial area by mutual agreement.
The summit did, of course, include discussion of other issues. One of these was the possibility of Russia joining the WTO.
Russia has decided to conclude negotiations before the end of this year in order to be able to join in 2007.
We reassured them of our support and reiterated our willingness to then draft a âfree trade agreement plusâ with Russia within the framework of a future comprehensive treaty that would be intended to replace the partnership and cooperation agreement that is, albeit due to expire, already in place.
Russia reiterated its desire that the work on a new treaty of this kind between it and the EU should be brought forward with all speed.
It was agreed that this treaty should be as comprehensive and durable as possible in line with the needs and dynamics of the relations between us, and that, in order to avoid a vacuum, the existing agreement should continue to apply until such time as the new treaty entered into force.
We were particularly pleased that it was possible, at the summit, to sign visa facilitation and readmission agreements on the basis of the agreement reached at the end of the previous year under the UKâs presidency.
These agreements will make both business traffic and interpersonal contact considerably easier.
The European Union regards the conclusion of a readmission agreement with Russia as a major success and as being of great significance.
This agreement is also a demonstration of the productivity of the relations between the EU and Russia and of the real benefit that our people derive from them.
Further to it, we have again urged Russia to take steps to ensure that the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia can be ratified.
It goes without saying that human rights issues, too, were raised at this summit.
In discussing the situation in Chechnya, we welcomed the agreement with the Commission on the modalities for the implementation of a EURÂ 20Â million programme in support of socio-economic recovery in the Northern Caucasus.
We also made reference to the consultations on human rights, the third round of which was held in Vienna in March, and which has become an essential element in relations between us.
Finally, I would also like to mention the fact that the deliberations also focused on international issues and, in particular, on the situation in Iran.
We also addressed the situation in Belarus and reiterated our willingness to work together with Russia towards a resolution of the so-called âfrozen conflictsâ in Moldova and Georgia.
It finally proved possible, at the summit, to reach agreement on an Institute for European Studies in Moscow, to be funded jointly by the EU and Russia.
All things considered, this was a good summit with free and frank discussions in a friendly atmosphere, with both sides being willing, despite their differences, to build bridges and find solutions for the problems they both face.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for this opportunity to report, on behalf of the Commission, President Barroso and my colleague Ms Ferrero-Waldner, on the EU-Russia Summit which took place in Sochi on 25Â May.
The summit took place one year after the adoption of the four roadmaps for the Common Spaces and thus provided a good opportunity to review the progress made since then.
The summit was the occasion for the signature of the visa facilitation and readmission agreements.
The visa facilitation agreement will help encourage contacts between the peoples of the EU and Russia.
The readmission agreement will help tackle illegal immigration, an issue of growing concern to both the EU and Russia.
At the summit, there was a very open, frank and substantive discussion with President Putin on energy.
It was never our expectation that we would find complete agreement in Sochi, but the Summit did clarify our respective positions. That was extremely helpful as we prepare for the European Council discussions on the external aspects of EU energy policy on the basis of the joint paper by the Commission and the High Representative.
The EU and Russia are and certainly will remain interdependent in the energy sector and there is a genuine opportunity to integrate EU and Russian energy markets in a mutually beneficial, reciprocal, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.
In that regard, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with Russia both bilaterally and multilaterally at next monthâs G8 Summit.
As for the future framework for EU-Russia relations, the Summit agreed that our aim should be to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with a new, durable, comprehensive and legally-binding agreement which should be capable of promoting the further development of EU-Russia relations.
The PCA would remain in place until a new agreement comes into force.
The Commission is currently preparing draft negotiating directives to that effect.
If the Council is in a position to adopt them by the next EU-Russia Summit, negotiations could begin by the end of this year.
For both the EU and Russia, Russiaâs WTO accession remains a key priority.
This will lay the foundations for bringing EU-Russia trade and economic relations to a qualitatively new level in the context of the PCA successor agreement, taking into account the existing PCA objective of a free trade area.
In that context, let me report to Parliament that we are making good progress on agreeing a new framework document for the renovated Northern Dimension policy.
The Commission is negotiating the text with Russia, Norway and Iceland.
I am pleased to say that Russia shows every interest in confirming its joint ownership of the Northern Dimension policy.
We hope to have an agreement in time for the senior officialsâ meeting in Finland in September.
We will keep Parliament informed and seek to ensure that the parliamentary dimension is included in the new policy.
International issues were discussed in depth at the summit.
The dialogue which has developed with Russia over recent months, in particular on Iran and the Middle East, is a sound example of the EU and Russia working to put the concept of effective multilateralism into practice.
The EU also emphasised the need to work together with Russia on issues in our common neighbourhood.
We remain firmly of the view that the resolution of the frozen conflicts and the development of democracy and market economy in the countries of the region represent the best route to ensuring a stable, peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood for both the EU and Russia.
A number of other sensitive issues were discussed in a constructive spirit at the summit.
The EU stressed the importance of Russia ratifying the border agreement with Estonia and signing and ratifying the border agreement with Latvia.
In that context, let me welcome the recent meeting between Prime Ministers Kalvitis and Fradkov and hope that this represents the start of an intensified bilateral dialogue.
The EU also raised its continuing concerns with regard to the situation in Chechnya, notably in the light of the most recent visit by the UN High Representative for Human Rights, Louise Arbour.
The regular EU-Russia human rights consultations continue to provide a useful forum for addressing these issues.
In conclusion, the summit demonstrated the breadth and depth of our common policy agenda with Russia.
As the EU-Russia strategic partnership develops, the need for EU coherence becomes all the more essential.
The dialogue the Commission has with the European Parliament on Russia is therefore a very important element in this regard in enhancing coherence, coexistence and the effectiveness of EU policy vis-Ã -vis the Russian Federation.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is no doubt as to the importance of cooperation between the European Union and Russia.
While we must, more than ever, try to enjoy the benefits of that relationship, we must also have the courage to address the difficult areas with each other.
That is why it is necessary for Europe, more than ever, to speak with one voice.
So, then, let us hear no more of German Chancellors who claim that Russia is a fantastic democracy, while other countries try to improve the human rights situation in that country.
There is now hope of a new beginning in that respect.
Although our cooperation is based on four common areas, we cannot but conclude that this cooperation is not sufficiently strategic or pragmatic.
Economically, barriers have been lowered and we have gained benefits, but with regard to the other three common areas, there has been too little in the way of real progress.
It is important, though, to get this balance right.
We must avoid creating the impression that human rights are temporarily secondary to economic interests or gas interests.
We must strike the right balance whilst keeping the channels of communication open.
With regard to energy, as was said a moment ago, we must pursue not only a sustainable relationship between supplier and customer, but also prevent Russia from using gas as a political lever in future.
Human rights should also be expressly laid down in the new partnership and cooperation agreement after 2007, such agreement not just involving consultation among politicians, but from now on also permanent contributions from international and national independent NGOs.
Finally, if Russia does actually want to join the World Trade Organisation, it will have to abide by WTO standards from now on.
We should, accordingly, heap criticism on Russia, not only for the economic sanctions against Georgia and Moldova, but also for the on-going trade conflict with Poland.
Commissioner, this has been going on for months, and is now also a European responsibility.
Can you indicate how we can resolve this on-going conflict as soon as possible?
Whatever happens, the common approach is paramount and that is what we must focus on now more than ever.
I think that the common resolution as it is now before us is a good starting point for Parliament and I, as delegation chairman, should like to pass it on to our counterparts in Russia next week.
Â Â  Mr President, I would concur with MrÂ Eurlingsâ final remarks.
We have drafted an excellent joint resolution covering many aspects which I cannot repeat in the two minutes allotted to me.
I also share MrÂ Eurlings' criticism of the somewhat pragmatic way in which cooperation with the Russian Federation is fleshed out by working in those four areas.
Taking practical steps is, in principle, to be welcomed, as was demonstrated recently with visa facilitation between the EU and Russia, although this gets a little in the way of the balance that should be struck between the different areas we regard as important.
Policy should not become fragmented, which is exactly what is at risk of happening with the system of the four areas and the steps that are taken within each of those.
We must continue to look for a common denominator in respect of this cooperation.
Three elements are important in this.
Energy has already been mentioned.
We need a more transparent way of working together, which should indeed involve us refraining from exerting political pressures, as is occasionally done in the area of energy.
Secondly, we must enter into a critical human rights dialogue with Russia about the situation within Russia itself, about the Chechens, about the NGOs, about the authoritarian tendencies which the government is increasingly adopting, but also about democracy in its immediate neighbourhood, such as Belarus, in particular.
Thirdly, we must look for solutions for a number of security problems in the region in which respect Russia has not, as yet, made any really constructive contribution â Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan spring to mind.
It is important, in our view, that justice should be done to all three elements.
We should not give preferential treatment to one element to the detriment of the others.
Accordingly, gas should not take priority over democracy, or vice versa.
All three elements I mentioned must be central on the common agenda.
This year is a good time for this.
We can talk to Russia because it is chairing the G8 and because it occupies the presidency, no less, of the Council of Europe.
There is a certain tension if you want to play on all three fields at once, but that tension is normal when foreign policy is involved, when Russia is involved, and in that sense we must try to be clear in our policy by emphasising all three elements and not backing away from a critical dialogue about the things in Russia that we do not find agreeable.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall deal only with the visa agreement.
We say that we want to simplify visa procedures, but on closer inspection of the bilateral agreement between the EU and Russia, it becomes apparent that there are, in fact, very few simplifications associated with the agreement.
The agreement will affect only a small percentage of travellers.
Although the groups involved are important ones, such as students, participants in organised programmes and business travellers, the question must be asked as to what the situation is for other groups, in other words for the great majority who really would benefit from seeing something of the world.
Is it desirable to be categorising people in the modern world?
For the average traveller, that is to say for more than 90% of those wanting to travel, the agreement will provide no simplifications at all.
It will still, for example, be impossible to make a private car journey to Russia.
This is because the jungle-like mess of requirements relating to invitations and mandatory registrations is not going to be overhauled.
It will also remain unclear how the introduction of what are known as biometric data is to be linked to the visa procedure.
For me, it is a mystery why this agreement has not been linked to the international Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
Every year, for example, a number of children are abducted to Russia from my home country, Finland, in each case by the Russian half of the parental couple. There is no legal recourse for bringing the children back home to the other parent.
All this is obvious.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe hope for a sympathetic hearing for these concerns from the other groups.
A chimera of an agreement will always be just that â this needs to be said loud and clear.
The agreement makes a difference to too few people and does not sufficiently simplify the actual visa process.
This problem applies both to those people wanting to travel to Russia and to those wanting to enter the Schengen area.
To simply blame the weak result on the Russians is not the job of this Parliament.
We must be able to assess the whole picture and set goals for social intercourse with our neighbours.
That is the task for which we were elected.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the relaxed visa regime for students and sportsmen is a first step, the return of illegal immigrants is highly questionable, and there are many other questions to which the May summit produced no answers.
There can be no successful modernisation of the state apparatus, of the economy and of the armed forces if there is a lack of will on the part of the government and of interest on the part of the predatory capitalists who are only after profit with dirty money.
The rule of law and the democratisation of the country are being hamstrung; the violations of human rights in Chechnya are a tragedy.
The new law on non-governmental organisations is curtailing the rights of civil society and the freedom of expression.
Critics of the regime are treated in ways that run counter to the standards of the Council of Europe, with political prisoners such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev â the latter of whom is seriously ill â being subject to physical assault and psychological intimidation.
The legal system being under the thumb of politicians, it is an open question as to whether Russia is a reliable source of energy.
Europe would be playing with danger if it were to make itself too dependent.
What the gas supply dispute with Ukraine at the beginning of the year showed us was that Europe, too, could see its supply turned off in the event of a dispute.
Transparency and good governance are mentioned, but there is not enough evidence of them.
The Yukos case exemplifies the need for the government to disclose the ways in which the state and the energy companies are interconnected and mutually dependent.
At the time of the elections in Belarus, the EU charged Lukashenko with electoral fraud, authoritarianism and corruption.
Putin, on the other hand, congratulated his ally on his victory.
It is because we regard democracy, human rights and the rule of law as fundamental that they must not be allowed to decay in a strategic partner such as Russia.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the representative of the country holding the presidency said in his speech that at the start of the presidency there was an awakening.
What did we awake to?
We have been aware of the fact of energy dependence for a long time.
The entire growth in the EUâs energy needs will be covered in the future by increased imports of gas.
In this connection, we hopefully awoke to the problems of the free passage of energy, which have become evident from the events in Ukraine and Russia.
What happened before the first cold spell of the year?
Before that Ukraine had insisted on switching to market prices for transit facilities.
That suited Russia, as long as Russia would receive market prices for the gas and not just for transit.
It consequently emerged that Ukraine had been stealing gas from the reserves stored in Ukraine by the Russian organisation Gazprom.
At the start of the year it became evident that Ukraine was stealing gas from stocks bound for Europe to supply its own needs.
In this connection, then, we hopefully awoke to the fact that these problems of transit are serious and stability is also needed in transit countries, and not just in Russia, when it comes to gas supplies.
Deliveries of gas are obviously made more reliable by the Baltic Sea gas pipeline, which is understandable in that it obviates the need for transit countries that can turn off the taps and steal gas from the pipe.
With regard to MrÂ Rehnâs speech, I would say that the Northern Dimension would be worth involving in the EUâs future problems.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is interested in developing good relations with Russia, and there are some areas where this has already been successfully achieved. This was demonstrated by some of the results of the May summit.
One example of successful cooperation is the conclusion of the Readmission Agreement.
The situation prevailing until now, where illegal immigrants from Russia could not be returned to that country, was unacceptable.
The European Union should also facilitate the conclusion of an appropriate Readmission Agreement between Russia and Ukraine, otherwise illegal immigrants from Russia who enter the European Union through this country will be returned to and remain in Ukraine.
The establishment of good relations is a two-way process.
It is paradoxical that the European Union and Russia have at this time concluded the Agreement on visa facilitation.
As we all know, visas are documents that grant the right to cross national borders; however, Russia refuses to conclude agreements on borders with Latvia and Estonia, and therefore also with the European Union.
In order to continue to establish constructive relations, Russia must sign and ratify these agreements with Latvia and Estonia, without any pressure on the legally elected parliaments and governments of these Member States.
The Agreement on visa facilitation between the European Union and Russia cannot come into force until Russia concludes agreements on borders with all Member States of the European Union.
With regard to visas, it is also important to ensure that the residents of the European Unionâs frontier regions are granted relief arrangements for entering Russia.
This would facilitate both the economic development of these regions and contacts between people.
It is very much appreciated that energy security issues of general interest were solved during the summit.
Nevertheless, we hope that in the future greater attention will also be paid to the restriction of democratic freedom and human rights in Russia, where over the last few years there has been noticeable regression in the freedom of the mass media, in the activities of non-governmental organisations and in other fields.
The strengthening of democracy in Russia is in the interest of the European Union, but most of all in the interest of Russia itself.
Â Â  Mr President, since May 2004, the European Union and Russia have found common ground in their relationship with each other.
Last night, I read in a column by a Dutch analyst, who also happens to be a Russian expert, that according to the Russians, most of these areas or areas of cooperation can, by and large, be described as voids.
This self-mockery is something the European institutions should take very seriously.
After all, big joint pronouncements are of more use to Moscow than Brussels at the moment.
A pragmatic approach to address real common problems has more chance of success.
Access to Kaliningrad or visa arrangements bear witness to this.
I would urge you, though, not to think twice about abandoning the illusion of a common neighbourhood policy with the Kremlin.
Take Belarus, for example, where the idea of a common approach is simply absurd.
I had to do a double-take when I saw that in a motion for a resolution.
I have two concrete pragmatic questions for the Commission and Council.
Has the security of the gas supply from Russia to European customers now been laid down in law and been made transparent?
Secondly, as the Austrian Presidency already touched upon this, what is the latest on the final border regulation between the Russian Federation and the two EU Member States Estonia and Latvia?
In the final analysis, this is about one of the Unionâs common external borders.
Positive responses to those two questions would certainly show the relationship with Russia in a more appealing light.
Â Â  Mr President, the 17th EU-Russia summit took place in Sochi on 25Â May. The most important event was the signing of the agreement, which had been on the cards for a few months, on readmission and on simplifying visa procedures for European Union and Russian Federation citizens.
No other documents were signed. Neither was any joint statement made.
The summit in Sochi showed that the list of differences between Russia and the European Union grows ever longer.
Controversial issues include policies on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, the situation in Russia itself, especially with regard to respect for human rights, and above all energy policy.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to find areas where definite agreements which produce tangible results can be negotiated.
At the same time, however, both sides are clearly trying to present their cooperation as friendly and constructive.
They therefore avoid sensitive subjects in public and instead play up, sometimes out of proportion to their actual importance, the fields where agreements have been reached.
I think this is the right direction to follow and I hope it is one that will allow us to avoid mistakes such as those made by Poland in its dealings with our Eastern neighbour.
Â Â  â Mr President, the last high-level meeting between the EU and Russia revealed certain aspects of EU-Russian relations, which were obvious before, but which had not been discussed openly.
On Thursday, the European Parliament will vote on a resolution, in which it will indicate in its assessment of the results of the last high-level meeting between the EU and Russia that (and I quote), âthe current EU partnership with Russia is more pragmatic than strategic as common economic interests have taken first place, while it is not possible to achieve fundamental changes in the areas of human rights and the rule of lawâ.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is a qualitatively new evaluation as until now it was asserted that Russia and the EU are strategic partners, whose partnership is based on common values, respect for human rights and freedoms, democratic principles, etc. Until now almost all resolutions, which I have had an opportunity to vote on in this Parliament, were based on this very viewpoint â strategic partnership.
On the other hand, it was obvious that these statements would remain as simply declarations, the hopes of the EU as post-Yeltsin Russia can hardly boast of victories in the areas of human rights or press freedom, rather the contrary.
I believe that when the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement currently in force ends and a new agreement is being prepared, these aspects must be taken into account.
I feel that the EU's priorities should be formulated differently.
The second aspect, to which I would like to draw your attention, is the dialogue with Russia in the area of energy.
Unfortunately, at the Sochi summit, which devoted a lot of time to energy, a breakthrough failed to materialise, and Russian representatives continue to maintain that they act according to market economy principles.
Only Russia somehow applies those principles above all as a punishment for the pro-Western, pro-European orientation of some neighbouring states.
Meanwhile, the EU's proposals for Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, proposals on transparency and the participation of EU companies in the management of Russian energy sector companies continue to remain a problem for which we must find a solution.
Â Â  Mr President, the hottest topic in EU-Russia relations at the moment is energy.
Energy is a barometer of EU and Russian policy and the EU and Russian economies. Energy is also a possible cause of conflict between the European Union and Russia.
Power cuts and interruptions in the flow of gas and oil immediately result in internal crises in many Member States. The interruptions in January left Europe in a partial state of emergency.
What then could be done about this?
The problem could initially be solved with supply contracts.
Russia wants long-term supply contracts so that it can focus on investing in equipment to guarantee its own energy supply.
Many in the Union believe that long-term contracts harm competition.
In this situation, however, in which there is always a shortage of energy, long-term contracts are hardly the biggest problem; rather, they could offer both parties a common goal.
Contracts guarantee the position of both buyer and seller, and they create stability in the energy supply.
At the same time, the Union could have an influence on increased investment in the Russian energy sector, which in turn would have an impact on reliability of operations.
The aim is obviously at some stage to open up the two energy markets to competition, both the Unionâs and Russiaâs.
Action could be taken during the Finnish Presidency, as we in Finland have had a long energy partnership with Russia with very long-term agreements, and there have been no worries about reliability of operations, even though Russia has had a couple of revolutions in the last 15 years.
All the while, the electric power, the oil and the gas have been arriving in the volumes agreed.
It therefore makes life easier for both parties and creates predictability, which should be the correct starting point between neighbours.
Â Â  Mr President, it is, of course, excellent that we have regular fora and mechanisms to develop and deepen our partnership with Russia.
However, this type of summit, like the one held in Sochi, is perhaps not the best way of doing things.
Such summits tend to be excessively hyped up â they produce high levels of expectation but furnish quite meagre results.
At this particular meeting, for example, there was not that much by way of results.
On the other hand, it is better that we do make slow progress and attempt to achieve quality in the relations that we do have.
We do, of course, have a lot in common with Russia: trade, the environment and energy.
This is clear, now of all times, in connection with the scandalous and disgraceful blackmail on Russiaâs part using its control of energy as a negotiating tool.
As regards the fight against terrorism, organised crime and a number of conflicts, there is a need for increased cooperation between Russia and Europe.
It is gratifying that Russia is on the same side as the USA and ourselves in respect of the negotiations with Iran, but it is less pleasing that Russia is playing solo when it comes to Belarus, Hamas and other matters.
As many of my fellow Members have already pointed out, we must be extremely clear when it comes to any evaluations we make of our relations with Russia.
The trend that we have witnessed in recent times in terms of human rights and democracy is very worrying.
Things are moving backwards, not forwards.
Foreign Minister Lavrov visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs a month ago.
He said that Europe and the European Parliament have a very emotional view of human rights. He expressed the opinion that we are a little too fixated and that we focused only on this issue.
In my view, his comments were an excellent compliment, but they were not meant as one.
It is incredibly important that we are clear when we bring up the situation of voluntary organisations, the increasingly dwindling freedom of the media and the concentration of power in the hands of MrÂ Putin.
All this is very serious indeed, and it must be pointed out constantly.
In our resolution on Russia, which we voted on almost exactly one year ago, we highlighted the need for a very clear, well thought-out and values-based strategy towards Russia.
Unfortunately, the hope that we expressed at that juncture is still just hope today.
Â Â  Mr President, it is self-evident that the relationship between the European Union and the Russian Federation is of huge importance.
Attention was drawn a moment ago to the energy aspects, to the need for further democratisation in Russia and also to the aspects of international politics.
We have also noticed that the European Union, Russia and the United States increasingly join forces on the international stage.
Even following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is still a major world player.
That also applies at regional level, but we notice that there is still considerable tension between Russia on the one hand and, on the other, the states that have freed themselves from the shackles of the Soviet Union.
As examples of this, I would cite the continued difficult relationship with the Baltic Sea countries, or the situation in Chechnya, and there have also been the interventions in Ukraine that were designed to nip the Orange Revolution in the bud.
Democracy in Russia itself is precarious to say the least; one need only look at the problems that NGOs are experiencing.
In the dialogue between the European Union and Russia, we should therefore constantly draw attention to the need for better compliance with human rights, transparency in energy policy, the fight against corruption and the need for less centralism in general.
Another problem that deserves much more attention is that of the decommissioned nuclear power stations, which are under hardly any surveillance these days, and from which terrorist groups could well derive benefit.
That is a point that should always be on the agenda when we talk about relations between the European Union and Russia.
Â Â  Mr President, Russia remains, geographically of course, the largest country in the world and enjoys a strategic partnership with the EU through the âfour common spacesâ.
Russia, for all its faults, remains a democracy, albeit an increasingly authoritarian one.
It still enjoys vigorous debate in its many media outlets, even if the control by the Kremlin through self-censorship is becoming more apparent in recent years.
The judiciary, like in many former Soviet countries, still lacks the degree of independence seen in the EU and tends to bend to political pressure.
But it is not always so.
I remain an enormous admirer of the contribution to European culture made by Russia, and believe strongly that we must not destabilise this massive Eurasian country, whose confidence is now on the rise again with the recent massive inflow of petrodollars.
Undoubtedly, Russia has seen violations of human rights by its military in the north Caucasus.
But we must also recognise the threat posed by Chechen militant Islamic groups eager to capture Muslim population in Russia, which now accounts for around 17% of the population and is rising rapidly.
Al-Qaâida is eager to put down roots in the region.
Clearly also Gazprom the âgas weaponâ â used as an extended arm of Russian foreign policy â always seems to upset my friend, and understandably so, particularly in Ukraine, Moldova and the Caucasus.
Russia must be seen as a reliable energy trading partner and not as a trade bully towards its neighbours and those countries nearby, as we saw recently over the ban against Georgia and Moldova in the importation of their wines and mineral waters, or, even more bizarrely, on the âbilateral issueâ with Polish farm products, which I always thought was the Commissionâs prerogative, covered by the monopoly on external trade.
I would also call on Russia now to follow Ukraineâs lead in allowing visa-free travel to all EU citizens in order to boost tourism and facilitate a better public knowledge of this giant eastern neighbour of ours.
Lastly, I call on Russia to support the EU and the US in preventing nuclear proliferation by Iran.
Â Â  â Mr President, according to the President-in-Office of the Council, President Putin has said that the possibility of the energy charter being ratified cannot be excluded in the long term; what that means to me is that it is not going to happen, and that, in fact, was also what the Russian foreign minister told the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Russian ambassador has just said the same thing to us when we discussed energy with him.
If that is indeed the case, then we must, of course â for is there any alternative? â accept that we will have to shape the relationship established by the treaty between Russia and the EU accordingly, insisting, for a start, on symmetry in the opening-up of the markets.
It is the very opposite of clear why we should open up our markets while the other party does not.
We are not, in fact, opening them up completely, so both sides probably need to do more as regards more joint projects, not only for the extraction of crude oil and natural gas, but also as regards putting in place the routes whereby they are to be transported, in the shape of pipelines and so on.
Secondly, we can be sure that Russia also raised the subject of nuclear technologies and of the trade in them; this is another area where an agreement will probably be needed in order to sort matters out.
Thirdly, we must of course tell the Russians that we want to diversify, and it is quite clear that we also have to tell them that we want to build other new pipelines in order to make ourselves less dependent, to choose who to depend on, and to create alternatives.
I believe that energy policy is certainly one area in which we have to say, loud and clear, âyesâ to cooperation with Russia, but ânoâ to dependence on it.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wish to address the issue of human rights.
I see that note was taken of the human rights consultations at the summit on 25Â May 2006.
On 27 May 2006 I had the dubious pleasure of being present at the event organised by Gay Pride, which has been banned, and saw with my own eyes how the Russians feel about freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and protection of the human rights of gay people.
Frankly, I am not impressed and I would call on our EU leaders to show much stronger leadership when it comes to human rights.
I have specific questions for the Commissioner.
Did you raise the issue of the Gay Pride march with MrÂ Putin two days before the event, when it was already known there would be problems?
Did you put pressure on the Russians?
Why was the issue not raised at the meeting between President Barroso, Mr SchÃŒssel and religious leaders two days later?
Will you raise the issue at the next opportunity, which I believe is the G8 meeting?
Will you reply to the chair of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who responded to the events in Moscow by saying that rather than reminding the Russians that human rights are universal we should not impose our western, liberal values on Russia?
In fact, we should be promoting human rights in all our external relations.
I should like to hear how you intend to do that, Commissioner.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
We should welcome the progress made at the latest EU-Russia summit and the willingness shown by both sides to talk.
It is important to strictly maintain that line during the negotiations on the future partnership agreement.
While energy policy is a priority for Europe, it is equally vital that we be careful to ensure that a fully democratic space is created, based on respect for human rights and for ethnic and religious minorities.
Effective cooperation in the fight against terrorism and in the many other conflicts still smouldering on our borders, in the southern Caucasus in particular, cannot in fact work without a basis of common, shared values.
We therefore call on Russia to become more open in that regard.
On more than one occasion, the European Union has expressly called for greater synergy in promoting transparency in the exercise of authority and in combating civil and human rights abuses, particularly in difficult regions such as Chechnya, which today still complains of insufficient access to international aid and inadequate development in the region.
Â Â  Madam President, I think the essence of todayâs debate is that our approach to Russia has been too pragmatic.
As we observe a clear trend away from civil society and democratic freedoms, it is of paramount importance to strike a convincing balance between economic and strategic interests as the core values on which our partnership with Russia are officially based.
The resolution drafted by the European Parliament points to several key issues which need to be resolved: the problem of Transnistria, the conflict in the Caucasus, and the need to achieve progress on three other common spaces, besides a common economic space.
We welcome the Commissionâs assistance for recovery in the Northern Caucasus.
However, it is important to make sure that this assistance has really been reaching the people in need.
I think it is the view of this Parliament that the human rights dialogue should have the status of a central element of partnership in the future.
It is not enough to raise human rights issues while still believing or pretending to believe that, in spite of all the alarming facts, Russia is continuing on its way to democracy, Russia is fulfilling its commitments to the Council of Europe signed ten years ago, demonstrating real progress in building a rule of law society and implementing the verdicts of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights â verdicts which the Russian Government has so far ignored.
That should be a precondition for a new PCA, which will be signed next year.
Commissioner Rehn has raised the question of interdependence.
I fully agree, but we are not more dependent on Russian gas than Russia will be dependent on the revenues it receives from its gas.
Â Â  â Madam President, international and regional developments confirm the need to formulate new integrated strategic relations between the European Union and Russia.
No one disputes that the conventional framework of relations dates back to 1994 and cannot respond to the new geo-strategic and geo-economic circumstances.
From this point of view, the European Union and the European Commission in particular must take specific initiatives, so that we do not wait for the 1994 agreement to expire in December 2007, but take initiatives from today in the direction of strengthening strategic relations with Russia.
Madam President, the European Union needs its own independent strategy towards Russia.
On the basis of this assumption, it must repel any attempt to create conditions for a new cold war of confrontation, as being sought by certain powers in the US Administration.
The recent statements by the US Vice-President Nick Cheney may serve the interests of the United States, but they should have no bearing on the interests of the European Union and its Member States.
From this point of view, the construction of relations of mutual trust and mutual dependence between the two European strategic partners is a and will also help the new Central and Eastern European countries to overcome the fear and insecurity of the historic past.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to describe Russia as an important and significant partner is not merely formulaic, for it currently holds the presidency of the Council of Europe and of the G8, and it is also very much in our own interest that we should develop a strategic partnership with it commensurate with its own mass and of the energy and other raw materials that it possesses, not to mention its geographical position.
Even though Russia is no longer the Soviet Union, so it is not without its problems as regards the process of transformation and some models of conduct.
We do see, though, just how important Russia can be where Iran is concerned, where the prospect of having it in the same boat with us and being able to drag Iran to the table for negotiations that might well prevent it from building an atom bomb is a powerful argument in favour of maintaining good relations with such a country.
I believe that that summit also affords us a good opportunity to make headway on the issues of visa relaxations and the arrangements for the return of immigrants, and will enable further progress to be achieved over the coming year as regards the partnership and cooperation agreement, which is needed in order to put our partnership on a firm footing, to develop the four-area-strategy, and achieve results in energy security in particular, for Russia too must know that the partnership is possible only if it recognises not only the freedom of all nations in its immediate neighbourhood and beyond, but also that they may not be allowed to become victims on other grounds.
We do, of course, regard what is going on within Russia â where the freedom of the press is concerned, for example â with some concern; is it well-advised to go back to having such a concentration of big businesses in state ownership, even though the present high energy prices mean that they are currently bringing in plenty of money?
Can that result in self-sustaining economic development?
I have my doubts, just as I do when it comes to human rights â another issue that has to be addressed.
There are critical questions, but we should resolve them through dialogue, and thus be in a position to breathe life into this partnership.
Â Â  Madam President, those who are familiar with Russian politics and style are well aware of the fact that we can achieve more results using a more realistic, pragmatic policy that is more ready to compromise, than by exerting pressure.
Hungary has managed to achieve a complete turnaround in this respect over the past four years, with mutual apologies and concrete, pragmatic steps.
Russia was wrong to penalise Ukraine by shutting off gas taps, even though WesternÂ European consumers were not affected.
It is important that Russia does not employ such double-edged measures in the future, and the European Union should not allow itself to become hysterical.
The fear that the Russians may obtain too large a share in the final phase of the European Union energy sector is exaggerated, because at this moment their share does not even reach 10%.
Joint venture companies in Germany are working extremely well.
It is not sufficient to hold Russia back, to persuade it not to exert pressure by withholding energy supplies or by restricting imports of Moldavian and Georgian wine and Polish meat; the European Union must help by acting as a mediator, to ensure that Russiaâs neighbours take into account the geopolitical realities and the geographical closeness of Russia.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see that time has almost caught up with us, but I can keep it brief.
I am in fact in the very fortunate position of being able to say, at the end of this very interesting debate, that, although I do not of course agree with everything that has been said, I do agree with a very great deal of it, and that is very much the position of the Council too.
I am grateful to MrÂ Eurlings and MrÂ Wiersma, and MrÂ Brok, too, said many things that struck me as quite essential and important, particularly in relation to the issue of partnership in international affairs.
Reference was made to the issue of Iran, and it is also important that we should recall, as MrÂ Kelam and MrÂ Andrejevs reminded us, the self-evident fact that Russia must discharge its obligations to the Council of Europe, the presidency of which it holds.
We are all familiar with the IlaÅcu case, and expect further progress to be made on it in the Council of Europe, particularly while Russia holds the presidency.
I can do no other than agree with the last speaker when he says that what is needed in the final analysis is a pragmatic approach characterised by partnership, but one that does not involve us abandoning our principles.
It goes without saying that human rights issues have to be addressed and must be addressed in plain language, but this must be done with one end in view; not that of bringing about a breakdown in relations, but that of achieving something definite and positive in terms of a better mutual understanding of what human rights are.
That is what the Council is working towards; that is what the Commission is aiming for.
I am glad to be able to say, at the end of this debate, that it is also an objective that your House shares, and so I do believe that, if we work together, we will, not least to our own benefit, be able to make this partnership with Russia into something very positive.
Â Â  . Madam President, thank you for a very serious and substantive debate.
I fully agree with Mr Winkler in that regard.
MrÂ Eurlings and various Members pointed out that we must not trade human rights for energy; I fully agree.
We want both human rights and energy.
How can we do that?
We need principles, pragmatism and partnership.
Let me point out that in the field of human rights we have established a set of formal consultations and we have had three meetings since the launch of these consultations in 2005.
By way of example, the latest meeting focused on four issues: firstly, on the Russian law on non-governmental organizations; secondly, human rights in the military; thirdly, issues relating to the north Caucasus; and fourthly, racism and xenophobia.
We also held a preparatory meeting with human rights non-governmental organisations, which we deemed particularly useful.
I want to inform you that we will be holding the next meeting of these consultations in November in Moscow and will be pursuing the idea of closer involvement of NGOs.
We want to make these consultations more results-oriented in the future.
I can assure you that the Commission will keep human rights at centre-stage in our relations with Russia, not least as we are talking about the country which currently holds the Presidency of the Council of Europe.
On energy, Mr Kelam referred to the interdependence between the EU and Russia.
We can also say that we not only have interdependence but also import dependence, since by 2020 the EU will have to import around 70% of the gas it consumes.
According to current forecasts, Russian production and export capacity will fall short of EU needs unless massive investment takes place in Russia.
We are therefore working to ensure that sufficient additional quantities of gas can come into the EU and we will have to look at all possible sources and routes, including Turkey, incidentally.
This requires strengthened cooperation and increased imports from Russia, as well as from other countries.
At the same time, let us keep the big picture in mind.
One of Europeâs greatest challenges will be to reduce dependence on energy imports and on fossil fuels.
Therefore, it is very important that our energy policy and the external aspects of Europeâs common energy policy are very high on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency and, I trust, of all the future presidencies.
Reference was made to Gazprom and its ambitions to purchase EU assets.
In this regard the main concern within the EU is the apparent lack of a level playing field.
EU companies which may invest in upstream assets in Russia do not have the right to independently access the Russian gas transportation infrastructure.
Within the EU, the right to access gas transportation infrastructure is enshrined in EU legislation.
In this context, the rules applicable to Gazprom, notably EU competition rules, would be no different to those applied to any other company.
The fact that Gazprom is the exclusive supplier of gas from Russia to the EU would have to be taken into account in any objective analysis.
Reference was also made to free trade and the PCA.
I want to finish with this, because this is a very important strategic issue in EU-Russia relations.
The objective of a free trade agreement was already included in the PCA when it was concluded in 1994.
For a free trade agreement, Russian accession to the WTO is a prerequisite.
In this regard, it is important to note that the WTO accession process is now coming to its final phase and we expect that this condition will soon be met by Russia.
Reference to a free trade agreement was made at the Sochi Summit for further exploration.
Our point of departure is that trade and economic integration will be core elements for the post-PCA agreement and our intention is to set up a broader and deeper free trade agreement, some kind of âFTA-plusâ achieving deeper free trade than normal, simple free trade agreements.
Let me conclude now, because I know that many colleagues have more important things to do.
Â Â  Six motions for resolutions(1) to wind up the debate have been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
I see that MrsÂ inâtÂ Veld has a point of order.
To which of the Rules of Procedure do you wish to refer?
Â Â  Madam President, there was not sufficient time for both gentlemen to reply to my very precise questions and I would like them to provide this House with a written reply if possible.
Â Â  What we will do, then, is forward your question and request in the hope that you will then get an answer to them.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0224/2006).
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the environmental policy of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which was approved in April 2003, is aimed at ensuring that the projects funded by the Bank respect the environment and the applicable legislative requirements.
To this end, the EBRD reserves the right to reject any project presented to the Board of Directors if it believes that it does not conform to that policy.
It is a publicly recognised fact â as you know â that the EBRDâs policy with regard to environmental standards and the precautionary principle is extremely rigorous.
Since 2002, the EBRD has been paying particular attention to Sakhalin 2, in close cooperation with the company Sakhalin Energy, in order to assess all of the aspects of the project, in particular its environmental and social impact, and to draw up the appropriate monitoring and attenuation measures in accordance with the Bankâs environmental policy.
Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that there have been, and still are, significant causes for concern in relation to the Sakhalin 2 project, particularly in terms of the protection of the population of western grey whales living in the area.
The Bank has responded to that concern by contributing to the creation of a group of recognised scientists, with the participation of representatives of non-governmental organisations, in order to monitor the situation of the whales and to propose measures to reduce the possible negative impact of the project.
The company has applied these measures, and the latest comments from the group have largely been positive.
With regard to another difficult issue, the river crossing, the Bank has also been firm, calling for improvements to the companyâs actions and, in particular, the drawing up of a river crossing strategy that imposes restrictions and ensures that there will be no net loss of salmon spawning areas.
In short, the EBRD has put considerable pressure on Sakhalin Energy to improve the environmental quality of the project.
We will soon have new data on the assessments and public consultations under way that will allow the European Commission's representative in the EBRD to take a position on the project's conformity to the Bank's environmental policy.
Â Â  Madam President, if I understand the Commissioner correctly, he is defending continued expenditure on Sakhalin II, despite the fact that it fails to meet most of the bankâs own criteria.
The first criterion is that funding is only supposed to be given to projects that cannot otherwise be funded in a simple way.
Shell, the owner of the company in question, last year recorded earnings of USDÂ 23Â billion.
They have enough money to find the cash they need somewhere.
The EBRD states that sustainable development is the highest priority.
Yet, if this is so, what we have here is a case of building first and worrying about monitoring things afterwards.
No heed was paid to the advice provided by the group of experts you mention until it was too late.
No measures at all were taken in respect of the environmental problems; I have a long list of environmental problems that were not dealt with.
Nor was the âstakeholder dialogueâ implemented as set out in the programmes.
Seventeen organisations were against what was proposed.
That is a monologue, not a dialogue.
Â Â  . Madam President, MrÂ Schlyter, I have not said that the Bank has decided to fund it.
I have said that the Bank is analysing the conclusions of the groups of experts which are to give their opinion on whether or not the situation corresponds to the criteria of the Bank's environmental policy.
If the Bank is involved in the overall funding of the project, even if its contribution represents a small percentage, the Bank, as a result of a series of circumstances which I do not have time to explain, has a great capacity to apply pressure on the company to improve the environmental and social conditions of the project.
If the company cannot ultimately conform to these conditions, however, the representative of the European Commission will act accordingly, and I am confident that the Bank will also do so, applying the criteria of its environmental policy which, as I said at the beginning, are generally acknowledged to be rigorous and transparent, since everybody has been aware of them since their approval in 2003.
Â Â  Commissioner, what about the indigenous peoples?
On paper, they were taken into consideration, but when it comes to discussing matters with them, their rights are seemingly not taken into account.
Can you say a word or two about this in the context of this project?
Â Â  . Madam President, MrsÂ IslerÂ BÃ©guin, I am also aware of the situation affecting the indigenous people of the area.
Amongst other issues, the Secretary-General of the Bank, MrÂ Reichenbach, analysed and considered this situation on his visit to the area in January.
I also believed that the question related exclusively to environmental aspects, but the social aspects and the impact on the population â which, on the one hand, is positive because employment is being created, but, on the other, may have consequences that are undoubtedly worrying â is of course being considered by the Bank.
The question your colleague put to me related strictly to environmental conditions, and those are what I referred to in my first reply, but I can assure you that the Commission's representative in the Bank, MrÂ Lelakis, is perfectly aware of, and is monitoring the impact of, the project on the situation of the indigenous people of the area.
Â Â  . In its vote of 6Â July 2005, Parliament rejected the Council common position on the directive on computer-implemented inventions, which implies rejection of the proposed directive.
As a result, there are no Community legal texts which will regulate this issue.
The vote and the far-reaching debate which preceded it demonstrated that the time was not ripe for a meaningful piece of legislation to be adopted on this issue.
Therefore, a new proposal dealing specifically with the patentability of computer-implemented inventions would not be desirable.
As a consequence, the legal framework applicable to computer-implemented inventions in Europe remains ArticleÂ 52 of the European Patent Convention, which excludes computer programs as such from patentability.
Earlier this year, the Commissionâs Directorate-General for the Internal Market and Services launched a broad consultation of all interested parties on the future patent policy in Europe, with a particular focus on the structure of the European patent system.
The deadline for the consultation was 12Â April 2006, and preliminary findings will be discussed with stakeholders at the hearing in Brussels on 12Â July 2006.
Consultation is intended to ensure that any further possible action in the area of EU patents policy takes account of all stakeholdersâ needs without discrimination.
Parliament will be duly informed of the results of this consultation.
One of the options presented to stakeholders refers to the Commissionâs proposal for Community patent regulation.
The Commission would like to point out that its possible adoption will not alter the substantive rules governing patentability which are set out in the EPC and would not extend patentability to software as such.
Moreover, the new jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would improve the safeguards against the grant of patents in error to a computer program.
Therefore, the Commission does not intend to present a new proposal along the lines of the rejected common position on CII.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Commissionerâs answer was brief, but comprehensible and clear, and for that I am obliged to him.
I am very positively struck by the breadth of his concept of information collection and also of transparency.
There is another matter, Commissioner, concerning which I would like further information from you.
You said that this House would be kept informed.
I believe that it should also be involved in this decision-making process, and for that reason I should like to know how you think it might be.
Â Â  . The European Parliament will also participate in this consultation.
As I said in my reply, we asked for a consultation on the whole area of patents policy.
The closing date for submissions was 12Â April 2006.
There will be a hearing in Brussels on 12Â July 2006.
That will be a consultation about the whole area of patent policy and does not specifically refer to computer-implemented inventions.
I said in the debate leading up to the European Parliament vote that if the European Parliament were to reject the proposal at that stage I would not bring forward a further proposal in the area, so I shall not be bringing forward a further proposal.
Â Â  I am very pleased to hear that, Commissioner.
We made our position clear last year when we blocked the common position, which would have codified the EPOâs disputable software patent practice.
That was the right decision, and your decision not to table a new proposal is also the right one.
I should like to ask a question regarding the more general work regarding patent policy.
We now have a lot of proposals on the table, such as the Community patent, a European patent litigation agreement and maybe even some suggestions for finally changing the EPC.
What do you think the procedure should be for this?
Should Parliament have codecision?
Â Â  . As the honourable Member is aware, the proposal on the Community patent has been stuck at a certain stage and we have been unable to make progress.
Therefore, at the end of last year I thought that, rather than waiting for things to evolve, it was important to have a general consultation as to how stakeholders felt we should move forward.
As I have said at committee meetings, it is still my intention to give the Community patent one last try during my term of office.
I will decide when I think is the best time to get that done and give it my best efforts at that time.
I thought it was not good to leave things in abeyance and that it would be better to have this consultation about general patent policy, and that is what these consultations are about.
The question the honourable Member asked regarding codecision is a matter for the Treaties.
However, I personally favour codecision.
Â Â  Please, Commissioner, when we discuss this in the future, can we make sure that the small enterprises are more involved than the first time around.
One of the reasons it was rejected was that many small developers felt threatened by this legislation and the big lobby organisations followed the big companiesâ lines, which in most cases are contrary to the good healthy development of alternatives because they will be strangled by the patents of the big companies.
So please make sure they have their voices heard from the beginning next time. If not, the next issue will be blocked the second time round.
Â Â  The Commission did in fact consult SMEs on the last occasion, but I will pass on your remarks to the next Commissioner.
As I have repeatedly said, I will not be going into this area in my time as Commissioner. However, I will gladly leave it on file and it will be available for the next Commissioner who takes over this responsibility.
Â Â  . In response to the honourable Memberâs question on an alleged infringement of industrial property rights, the Commission stresses that it cannot intervene in a legal dispute between private parties pending before the court of a Member State.
If a party believes that its industrial property rights have been infringed and sues in a national court, it is for the national judge to ascertain whether an infringement has taken place.
It is also for the national judge to consider whether the relevant national legislation is in line with European Community law and with international treaties to which the relevant country is a party.
European Community law governing the enforcement of intellectual property rights applies to trade names only insofar as these are protected as exclusive property rights in the national law concerned.
In any event, the European Community is not a contracting party to the Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property.
The honourable Member should also note that ArticleÂ 15.1 of the Electronic Commerce Directive prohibits the application of a general filtering obligation to Internet hosting services.
According to ArticleÂ 14.3 of that directive, it is only a court or an administrative authority that can require a given service provider to terminate or prevent a specific infringing activity.
In addition, the Commission does not consider that the points raised by the honourable Member relate to the market power or the potential monopoly that the company in question may have.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your response.
I still think that there is an important European dimension to this issue.
You know as well as I do that research has shown that the average consumer uses search engines to find the right websites, much more than by directly inputting addresses, because it is easier, but also because the consumer has faith in those search engines.
It now transpires that this faith is not always justified, and it worries me that private firms are not, apparently, required to adhere to the rules.
I therefore think that the Commission should take steps in order to ensure that consumers and enterprises, including small enterprises, can make use of those services in a safe manner.
Â Â  Of course I hope that small companies, and every other company, can use these services safely.
However, the question put to me related to the Commissionâs role in this matter.
As I pointed out in my reply, this is in fact a matter for a national court, and is not a matter for the European Commission.
That is the situation under existing law.
Â Â  On 12Â April 2006 we published a preliminary report on the findings of the inquiry into competition conditions in the payment card sector in the EU.
That report confirms that businesses and consumers do not yet benefit from a fully competitive internal market in payment cards.
The large price differentials which exist within the single market are a clear sign of this.
In the Commissionâs view these price differentials, and the high levels of fees that are currently charged, indicate that there is scope for significantly reducing prices at least in some Member States.
The Commission is now holding a public consultation on the interim report.
We will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties, including the industry and consumers before we draw any conclusions on the way forward.
If the preliminary findings on payment cards are borne out by this consultation, the Commission will consider action under EC Treaty anti-trust rules in individual cases.
However, the Commission would also like to emphasise that it is important that market participants themselves help to tackle the problems identified in the inquiry.
So it is now also up to them.
There is a considerable lack of transparency in the current market.
The preliminary result of the enquiry into the sector provides all stakeholders with substantial information on how the market functions, and the Commission sincerely hopes that this will help players in the industry to correct some of the problems themselves.
The more the payment card industry does on its own initiative, the less it is likely to face action under anti-trust rules and, as we are aware, prevention is better than cure.
The honourable Member refers in particular to the situation in Greece compared with other Member States.
