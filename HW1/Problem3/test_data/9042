The proposal before us today seems to tend broadly in that direction, yet the measures it advocates are very limited in terms of achieving the objectives involved in implementing a genuine common European asylum system.
It is time Europe considered establishing a legal status of temporary protection for people who flee their country because of war or other crises. It must be a status that does not bar them from access to an asylum procedure and a status that maintains due regard for the principle of non-refoulement enshrined in the Geneva Convention, under which refugees may not be sent back to their country of origin.
It is time for the European Union to genuinely overhaul the right of asylum without further delay, for the situations in which the displaced people find themselves are too urgent and serious to allow time for institutional discussions.
- (SV) A common policy on temporary protection for displaced persons is to be welcomed, especially so as to ensure that all Member States are involved in taking care of people forced to flee from regions affected by war.
However, it is important that such temporary protection, which applies for two years at the most, should not constitute a threat to the right to seek asylum.
The right to asylum under the Geneva Convention and to a permanent residence permit must always be safeguarded.
Temporary protection in the EU' s Member States must not prevent people from seeking asylum as soon as they arrive in the Member State responsible or during the period that the temporary protection applies.
Deprez report (A5-0066/2001)
Mr President, I too voted against the Republic of Finland' s and the Republic of Portugal's request for a directive regulating visa applications and border controls because, in effect, it is not within the remit of these States to table such documents in this way.
However, it pained me to do so, Mr President, for the issue raised by these States is right and proper, and I wonder why we are waiting to regulate the border control procedures at Europe's frontiers with a directive which would be immediately applicable throughout the European territory.
The document stresses the importance of a European regulation too, since Europe is a single entity within its borders.
Frahm Report (A5-0075/2001)
Mr President, the Frahm report - I am saying this for the benefit of those who are listening to me now and did not take part in the vote - concerns the requirement to obtain a visa for those who come to Europe and who move around within our territory but are not citizens of our Member States.
I voted against this initiative of the Portuguese Republic as well, because, in effect, it was not acceptable.
However, I do wonder why the relevant committee did not amend the proposal to make it acceptable to Parliament.
It is, in fact, important to regulate well and uniformly the movements within the European territory of citizens who enter Europe on temporary visas.
Nassauer Report (A5-0065/2001)
Mr President, this is my third vote against the request of a European Union State for a directive: this time, the subject is the mutual recognition of decisions to expel third-country citizens.
I have to say that the French Republic did well to present this initiative, even though it was rejected.
Why is this?
Because clearly, Mr President - as I am sure you agree - it is vital to have uniform standards in all 15 States on who is to be expelled from European Union territory and who is to be accepted.
Once again, therefore, I am taking the opportunity afforded by this proposal for a directive to call strongly for a European regulation on the procedures, conditions and rules for expelling undesirable immigrants from Europe.
The initiative before us today concerns the enforcement of national, administrative expulsion measures against foreigners, even where they have since moved to another Member State.
The purpose of this proposal is, quite patently, to make it easier to take measures to expel third-country nationals.
To that end, it introduces an instrument for the mutual recognition of these decisions.
Accordingly, an expulsion decision taken in one Member State can be enforced in another.
At first sight it may seem quite laudable to try to regulate and control the movement of foreigners whom our Member States have decided to expel.
This would be in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, aimed at better migration management.
Careful examination, however, soon shows up the total ambiguity and imprecise nature of this initiative and the legal loopholes it contains.
Now that it is high time the European Union countries adopted a genuine immigration policy, what are we to think of a document that not only does not regulate expulsion issues at all, but which also seems to show complete disregard for the real situations faced by people?
To address the immigration problem also means this: to dare to look at these non-Community citizens threatened with expulsion or being expelled who, having entered the closely-guarded Schengen area, find themselves battling against recalcitrant administrations.
If the European Union wishes to be and remain an area of freedom, justice and security, it will have to adopt legal instruments that are not only effective but also take the human factor into account.
Not measures which, like this initiative, are basically aimed only at establishing a security policy under which foreigners, perceived as a threat, can no longer enjoy their rights and freedoms and the word justice has become meaningless.
Moreover, it is difficult to accept the legal basis chosen for this proposal, namely Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty.
That article is concerned only with immigration measures taken in specific circumstances, and in particular the conditions under which a third-country national can be sent back or expelled, against his will, to his country of origin.
The present proposal for a directive does not address these matters.
It is confined simply to the mutual recognition of decisions already taken.
The proposal does not, therefore, set out to lay down Community rules on expulsion.
It would therefore be dangerous to adopt an initiative of this kind to tackle an issue as sensitive as immigration.
Any rules adopted in this regard must respect the humanitarian and universalist values that underpin Europe.
Otherwise, our Community policies would become meaningless.
Hatzidakis Report (A5-0040/2001)
Mr President, a policeman stops an articulated lorry in Germany because it is going too fast.
The official checks the cargo: it is radioactive material, all in order with all the necessary permits.
When the official, who works in the centre of DÃŒsseldorf, a densely populated German city, realises the risk posed by the consignment of radioactive material, he asks the driver, "But why did you go right through DÃŒsseldorf, where there are so many people?
Couldn't you have taken a longer, more isolated route?
These goods are highly dangerous" .
"Well Sir," replies the driver, "do you not know that, this very day, the European Parliament has adopted the report tabled by Mr Hatzidakis - who is a very great, extremely important, very good MEP - Paragraph 2 (page 8) of which calls upon the Member States to apply the shortest possible distance principle to shipments of nuclear material.
Therefore, I took the shortest route for my consignment of radioactive material."
And this leads me to state that something needs changing: it is better to take a long, safer route than a short, dangerous one.
The recent very alarming incident in which a train carrying radioactive nuclear fuels flasks, owned by BNFL, derailed at Torness power station near Dunbar, East Lothian, UK, shows the constant risk that transporting nuclear material involves.
Radioactivity poses grave dangers to health and the environment.
Ionising radiation transfers energy at levels that can induce changes in any matter it penetrates and even cause irreversible damage to human cells.
The danger is linked to duration of exposure and intensity and type of radiation with a dose equal to or exceeding 10 000mSv (millisieverts) death occurs almost instantaneously (such high doses have only been reached in nuclear weapons explosions or serious accidents in nuclear power stations).
Radiation can also have delayed effects, as determined in particular after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the form of cancers or hereditary damage.
Persons exposed to radiation levels of 200mSv or more are subject to an increased risk of cancer.
This means that inhaling a few micrograms of plutonium can cause lung or tongue cancer.
Similarly, dispersal of 1200g of powdered plutonium would deliver lethal doses of radiation by inhalation with a radius of more than 2 km.
The risk of nuclear proliferation is greater during transportation than at any other stage in the fuel cycle.
Convoys are not immune to terrorist attack aimed at stealing the packages containing highly radioactive substances.
Only a few kilograms of separated plutonium are needed to build a crude nuclear explosive device.
As we know, any debate even remotely connected with nuclear matters tends to become emotional and to turn into a debate of principle.
That was not what the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism intended.
The debate on the pros and cons of nuclear energy takes place first and foremost in each of the Member States, where it follows its own course.
This report concentrates on the question of transport as such, and its different aspects: rationalisation, compliance with legislative provisions concerning transport, information on the transport of radioactive material, etc.
Radioactive material is regularly transported over long distances, not only within the European Union but also to and from the European Union and other continents.
Although a number of European Union Member States have decided to stop reprocessing or gradually to 'go non-nuclear', it will still be necessary to send consignments to those countries which have signed reprocessing contracts, in order to return to them their nuclear waste currently stored at reprocessing facilities.
The increase in consignments generally and the frequency of the use of road, rail, waterway and air transport increase both the likelihood of accidents and the need for safety standards in the transportation of radioactive material.
Safety must have absolute priority over profitability and supply, which is why the nuclear industry must strictly abide by international transport regulations.
In view of these observations, I support the committee's call on the Commission to draw up a detailed list of consignments of radioactive material within the European Union and at its borders and to assess their economic and social justification, particularly in terms of public health. This should be done in order to propose means of rationalising such consignments and curtailing their number and volume, in the light of the risks identified, in compliance with the principle of prevention, if the risks are proven to outweigh the benefits.
Moreover, the Member States concerned must apply the shortest possible distance principle to all shipments of nuclear material and, as far as possible, avoid transit through densely populated areas.
Let me conclude by emphasising the importance of transparency in this field.
Full information on the risks involved needs to be very widely disseminated on a continuous basis.
I am opposed to nuclear reprocessing and I believe that all reprocessing plants in the UK and elsewhere should be closed.
I have voted for this report although I have reservations about some aspects of it.
In particular, I believe that safety has to override all other considerations.
Nuclear waste should never be transported through densely populated areas.
The 'shortest route principal' should be secondary to the 'safest route principle' .
Irish People, along with all Europeans live with the constant concern that an accident in the UK or France or a collision in the Irish Sea, could have devastating and immediate effects on us all.
It is not so very unusual for a report to be changed so much through amendments that the rapporteur finds it is no longer true to his basic intentions and accordingly stands down.
However, what is hard to grasp politically in this case is the way this has happened.
If groups abandon jointly negotiated compromise proposals literally overnight and suddenly put in writing the opposite of their original statements, then that casts some doubt on the very seriousness of this procedure.
My group is, of course, aware that a report on the transportation of radioactive materials is not a report on nuclear power as such, but the best way to maximise safety would be if there were nothing to transport.
So in this context we are bound to mention keeping output and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel rods to a minimum.
The fact that only 5% or around 75 000 consignments are involved in the nuclear fuel cycle says something not only about the scale of the potential risk, but also about the nature of it.
We regard it as incomprehensible that a proposal for a legislative initiative on uniform standards for transporting radioactive materials within the European Union and at its borders, whilst observing the principle of subsidiarity, should be rejected.
Nor can we understand why stricter checks on compliance with legislation on the transportation of dangerous goods should be unacceptable.
Likewise, we believe that too little attention has been devoted to the issue of exposure thresholds.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the report in the form we have before us.
I can remember the 1950s, when most people believed that nuclear fission would yield unlimited resources of clean and safe energy in future.
A number of countries subsequently built nuclear power stations as if there were no tomorrow, and the electricity supply was made largely dependent on nuclear fission.
The 1960s saw the beginning of mounting criticism, especially when it transpired that nuclear power stations can explode and that the waste product continues to threaten the environment for a very long period of time.
The disasters in Harrisburg and Chernobyl had a decelerating effect on the further development of nuclear energy, and some countries have either abandoned it completely by now or are in the process of doing so.
But even after that, we will be facing dangerous radioactive waste for many thousands of years.
Given the risks involved in transporting this kind of waste, the best solution is to bury it in the nuclear power stations which are condemned for closure and not to transport it to another location.
There are many campaigns to stop these transports, and rightly so.
The rapporteur is showing some degree of understanding for those campaigns and wants to curb the risks, but continues to allow and justify further transport of this kind.
I do not subscribe to this point of view.
Schwaiger Report (A5-0076/2001)
Mr President, the European Parliament had to make a statement on this issue, especially given the sense of uncertainty that prevails on the eve of another WTO round.
The European Parliament is sending out a clear message, which offers a coherent vision of the future of the WTO.
I therefore voted for Mr Schwaiger's report, which calls for greater transparency within the WTO and in the way its meetings are conducted.
I am satisfied with the clear and precise mandate given to the European Commission on the use of the precautionary principle in the WTO with regard to agriculture.
I deplore the fact, however, that the European Parliament did not call on the WTO to take account of the multifunctional role of agriculture; this must not give way to intensive and mass farming, which in any case, European consumers plainly no longer want.
Mr President, this explanation of vote has fallen at exactly the right moment, lunch time. I voted for the motion.
And why is that? Because I like gorgonzola, Mr President: gorgonzola cheese, taleggio cheese from the valleys around Bergamo.
I know you will be wondering what that has to do with the Schwaiger report, but there is a connection, Mr President.
The connection is that, on page 9 of the report, Paragraph 31, which we have adopted, states that it would be desirable "to extend protection of geographical indications from wine and spirits to other agricultural products" produced in our territory as well.
Now then, I like gorgonzola and I am glad that gorgonzola is going to be included in this protection, and so I voted for the Schwaiger report.
Bon appÃ©tit!
.
(EL) The World Trade Organization talks in Seattle were marked by huge popular uprisings, demonstrating that the very principles of the WTO are anathema.
The demonstrations, which were attended by demonstrators from all over the world, were a decisive factor in bringing down the talks.
At the same time, the opposing positions and antagonisms within this world imperialist system cause difficulties and delays which the popular movement can turn to its advantage.
The WTO, which was set up in order to speed up the full liberalisation of trade, is one of the mainstays of the new world order.
Not only does it support globalisation, it endeavours to give it the form and substance of law, which is why we do not believe that the governments of the European Union will defend the interests of their people during the new round of talks.
On the contrary, they will endeavour to claim an even bigger stake for the European monopolies, in competition with the two other imperialist centres, the USA and Japan.
The much-aired European agriculture model defended in the Schwaiger report is born of a compromise which prejudices small and medium-sized European farms and Mediterranean farm produce.
Its direct outcome will be lower farmers' incomes, less farming and higher unemployment.
Agricultural production in Greece and other countries is being sacrificed in order to protect industrial produce from central and northern Europe and ensure that it gains a stronger foothold on the international markets.
The rules which govern international economic relations and trade should serve the interests of the workers, leave fundamental social rights be, help less-developed countries to develop, respect the environment and serve the right of every nation to exercise its own controls and decide on its own future.
Contrary to what is maintained in the Schwaiger report, the WTO will not be democratised by having elected national delegates attend.
Democratisation presupposes respect for and the protection of the rights of the workers.
The WTO, by its very nature, cannot operate in this way because it is an imperialist structure and it is concerned solely with maximum profits for big business and the safest and most flexible ways of moving money around, especially money from trade and the stock exchange, without hindrance.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Schwaiger report because most of it goes along with the plans of big business on unbridled neo-liberalisation, with its attack on the achievements of workers and the rights of nations throughout the world.
The movement against 'globalisation' and the WTO, its disparate and multi-faceted nature notwithstanding, is an initial counterattack on the dictatorship of the monopolies and their financial interests.
It sends out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers, unemployed and small and medium-sized farms and to all the victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO wishes to impose.
With the European agriculture model, we have a common agricultural policy in mind.
That does not, however, mean that we accept the shape of current agricultural policy, which is producer-driven, large-scale and based upon heavy subsidies.
Nor can we support duties affording protection against the developing world.
On the other hand, we should like to see a common agricultural policy. However, we think there would be risks in each nation' s devising its own agricultural subsidies.
A new common agricultural policy must be small-scale and be based upon rural development and environmentally-minded agriculture.
It is an area which must be characterised and permeated by long-term sustainable development, for example when it comes to the environment and the economy.
In the end I voted against the Schwaiger report despite its good qualities, because the debate we held yesterday, and in particular Commissioner Lamy's replies to my three questions, left me very dissatisfied.
In reply to my first question - and is it not dangerous to negotiate the Built-In Agenda separately? - Commissioner Lamy said that the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on agricultural trade and trade in services are not really negotiations but just preparatory talks.
Perhaps that distinction is valid from an abstract point of view, but in practice I do not think it holds water.
The Commission's reply to my second question - should we not redefine the negotiating mandate in the light of the trend of events and public opinion? - was negative: it stated that the Commission would stick to the mandate defined at the time of Agenda 2000.
In any case, the European Parliament has just underpinned that position by explicitly rejecting two amendments calling for the Blair House Agreement to be renegotiated.
In his reply to my third question - before opening new negotiations, should we not first define more clearly how the negotiators are to be monitored? - Commissioner Lamy referred mainly to the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
That is certainly a matter of some significance, but basically my question concerned scrutiny by the Council, which sets the Commission's negotiating objectives, and by the national parliaments, which in my view have the final say.
Confusion continues to prevail with regard to these aspects.
I very much regret that the Protocol, which was still part of the preliminary draft for Nice in November, was not incorporated, at least the part concerning scrutiny of the way negotiations are conducted at the WTO.
It stated that the Presidency and the Member States may accompany the Commission to WTO meetings, that the Commission must forward all the documents at its disposal without delay, that it has a binding obligation to respond to the wishes of a Member State to open a consultation procedure, that the common position upheld by the Commission is established by the Council, and that the Council may at all times address negotiating directives to the Commission.
I believe it is essential to observe these rules, in one form or another, in order to ensure proper scrutiny of the WTO negotiations.
. (NL) Free trade is about more than removing borders or doing away with old-style protectionism.
More than anything, it implies that the price of a product outweighs all other considerations.
Whoever can deliver at the cheapest price, gains that segment of the market and drives away the more expensive producers.
With ever lower transport costs, it is possible to haul any cheap raw material and any cheap end product from anywhere.
The competition is forced to choose between cheaper deliveries or going under.
Those in favour of this mechanism claim that it makes producers more ingenious and effective and that the consumer benefits.
That is why there should be unlimited competition, ultimately at world level, if possible.
Despite this, there are sound reasons for raising production costs and for protecting production from cheaper competitors.
The reasons are: safety at work, proper pay for employees, ruling out child labour, effective distribution of employment across the region, care for the environment, preventing animal suffering, discouraging unnecessary traffic, and providing facilities and services which may not be money-spinners logistically speaking, but are useful and desirable nevertheless.
That is a task for the democratically elected government, but WTO agreements render this task secondary to blind market forces.
Although the rapporteur' s proposal is inadequate in my view, I will not vote against something which can help curb this trend.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Final agreement on the reform of the system for international transfers of footballers
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.
There are not many of you in the Chamber yet, in fact only just enough to make up a football team, which brings me to the subject of this debate.
The next item is the communication from the Commission on the final agreement on the reform of the system for international transfers of footballers.
Madam President, you will recall that on 7 September 2000 I informed Parliament of the Commission' s position concerning the reform of FIFA rules governing international transfers.
On that occasion, I announced the Commission' s intention to enter into discussions with FIFA and other interested parties, led by my fellow Commissioner, Mario Monti, and with the collaboration of Anna Diamantopoulou, in order to bring FIFA regulations into line with Community law with due regard for, firstly, the specific characteristics of sport and, secondly, the autonomy of sporting organisations.
Indeed, the Declaration on the specific characteristics of sport, adopted by the European Council in Nice in December 2000, fully supported this approach.
Today, following intense discussions between the Commission departments, FIFA and the other interested parties, I am pleased to be able to announce the result we have obtained.
This outcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, respects the principles which I have just outlined and to which we are all committed.
In this entire business, the Commission has frequently been accused of failing to understand sport or, worse still, of wishing to destabilise football.
Yet the outcome of the discussions proves that such accusations are unfounded. Indeed, I believe that these discussions have provided a further opportunity to demonstrate that Community law and the specific characteristics of sport are perfectly compatible.
I therefore see no need to amend Community law.
In this instance, the Commission has shown itself to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate the specific characteristics of sport within existing texts.
The discussions have led to clear progress in at least three key areas.
Firstly, a goal which the European Parliament has always sought, protecting young players moving within the European Union, guaranteeing them an appropriate general and sporting education.
These principles will be included in a code of conduct drawn up by the football federations, and I attach special importance to this point since in my opinion it is far more effective to support the work of these young players rather than to impose restrictions on their movement, which would, in any case, not be compatible with the principle of freedom of movement.
Let us not forget that, in football, many are called but few are chosen, and not every player is destined to be a football star.
We must therefore ensure that they are given vocational training as well as sports training.
With these provisions the Commission hopes to send a clear message to all those young players who put a lot of effort into football: although they will not all make it at the professional level, they will all be treated with due consideration in human terms and in terms of their individual development.
The second component involves encouraging and compensating the effort made by clubs to train young people, thereby giving their sports activities a social dimension, which, moreover, is a characteristic of the European dimension of sport.
In order to achieve this, FIFA has undertaken to introduce rules dealing with: firstly, compensation for training costs incurred up to the age of 23, on the basis of real costs, in line with the Court' s judgment in the Bosman case, and secondly, the creation of a solidarity fund which will be sustained by a 5% levy on each compensation payment for transfer. This fund is intended for the training clubs, who will thereby receive a share of the player' s added value.
It is now up to FIFA to apply these principles in detail. The Commission will, within its sphere of responsibility, ensure that the incorporation of these principles into FIFA' s rules is effectively achieved, and I am sure, Madam President, that the Commission will not be alone, but will be supported in this monitoring work by both the Sports Ministers and the Members of Parliaments who have made commitments at national level.
We are convinced, then, that it is possible to find a balance between a player' s mobility and the necessary compensation of the training club within the limits laid down by the Court in the Bosman case.
The third point is the introduction of elements of stability into sporting competitions in order to ensure their equity and regularity.
These are the mechanisms intended to achieve this.
Firstly, unilateral termination of a contract will be authorised only at the end of a season.
This means that a club' s fans have some guarantee of seeing the same team play throughout the season, because this is the team that they have bought their season tickets to see, not another team, which may perhaps have lost its best players.
Secondly, the imposition of disciplinary measures on players and clubs who terminate their contracts during its first two seasons without just cause or valid reasons.
These principles are supported by other important points, such as fixed periods for transfers or the duration of contracts of between one and five years.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of our discussions, we met with FIFPRO, which represent the players.
Some of their requests were met.
For instance, FIFA rules will no longer prohibit players from going to court, but also a special Court of Arbitration will be set up, based on equal representation, which will be able to settle disputes concerning training fees, transfers and disciplinary measures.
I attach particular importance to arbitration being independent and based on equal representation.
The creation of an arbitration body of this kind to which matters can be referred by both players and clubs should resolve disputes fairly, quickly and efficiently.
I should like to point out, too, that throughout this affair, the Commission has emphasised that the discussions between it, FIFA and the other interested parties in no way affect the compatibility of FIFA' s revised rules with national laws in force, and in particular with employment law.
It is FIFA' s responsibility to ensure that the rules are applied in accordance with national legislation from which they cannot, of course, depart.
FIFA has announced that the principles thus agreed will be implemented by a revision of FIFA rules at its world congress in Buenos Aires in July.
The Commission has urged FIFA to seek close dialogue with the other interested parties with a view to such implementation, most particularly, of course, the players.
In the Commission' s opinion, the discussions on transfers have clearly shown that dialogue at all levels is becoming a necessity and that all possible avenues for organising dialogue should be explored, including collective agreements at the European level.
Indeed, Mrs Diamantopoulou offered her assistance in supporting ongoing dialogue at European level.
To conclude this statement I would remind you that, after the first two years, FIFA will draw up a report on the application of this system.
We will then have quantitative and qualitative information from which we can learn.
In the meantime, I believe we must be very pleased with the outcome of these discussions, not, Madam President, that it was always very easy to arrive at an outcome.
On more than one occasion, concluding a discussion was delayed due to the pressure brought to bear by some Heads of State and Government, which was considerable pressure, but pointless and, above all, harmful.
Be that as it may, the Commission held its ground and was ultimately able to demonstrate that it is not necessary to amend the terms of the Treaty in order to respect the specific characteristics of sport; it therefore stood firm while keeping strictly to its own sphere of responsibility.
As a result of this outcome, my fellow Commissioner, Mario Monti, will not need to propose that the Commission adopt a negative decision concerning FIFA transfer rules.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, for being here today.
We are, of course, all pleased that a compromise has finally been reached, and I have, in fact, always agreed with you that the Commission clearly does not want to destroy football.
I got a few bloody noses at home for supporting you to such an extent, but by now I think that even the rather rude Mr Beckenbauer will have recognised that you are not trying to destroy his beloved football. That is why I am pleased about the compromise, but I would like to ask you one thing now.
Putting to one side for the time being those who for a wide variety of reasons will gain from this compromise - young sportsmen and women, small sports clubs, large sports clubs - are you not worried that this compromise, which treats sportsmen and women up to the age of 28 differently from those older than that, could lead to a violation of the principle of equality? Are you not worried that in the end there will be even more Bosman judgments, by which I mean that courts exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction may take a different view to that represented by this compromise?
Are you not concerned that this could lead to us being buried in a veritable avalanche of court cases?
Mrs Pack, we cannot prevent any citizen taking a case to the Court of Justice.
If any citizen, whether or not they are a footballer, whether or not they are a club member, decides to take a case to the Court, then he is perfectly free so to do.
We even insisted that this freedom be explicitly stated in the compromise because the Court of Arbitration, which is to be specific to the world of football, will, of course, be used to settle any disputes that arise, but we would like to see these disputes settled within the footballing family, and not necessarily in the public arena.
Nonetheless, citizens' freedoms require that if a person does not find any solution within the footballing family, he can then refer the case to either national or European Court.
Madam President, I feel much happier after Mrs Reding' s speech, because it seems the Commission has made an effort to bring together those three principles, namely the principle of recognition of Community law, the principle of the autonomy of professional organisations and the principle of the specificity of sport.
I was also relieved to hear the last statement to the effect that access to national jurisdiction - or, if appropriate, to Community jurisdiction - remains open.
I should just like to ask the Commissioner for further clarification. Is there not a risk that transferring the competence for applying the rules to FIFA and to other professional organisations might lead to the possible transfer of legislative powers from the European institutions to non-governmental organisations such as FIFA, FIFPRO or UEFA?
A Declaration was added to the Treaty of Amsterdam, stipulating that sports federations have a certain autonomy.
The Commission' s action was fully compliant with this Declaration.
On the basis of the Treaty provisions and also taking into consideration the views of the Heads of State and Government as expressed in Nice in the Declaration on the specific characteristics of sport, the Commission has established a framework together with FIFA, while acknowledging an element of autonomy for sporting bodies and the procedure they are now going to use to settle details.
In that context, the agreement proposed by FIFA has not been signed by the Commission, yet the Commission in the letter which Mr Monti, as lead Commissioner in this matter, sent to Mr Blatter stated that if the fine principles contained in the FIFA proposal are put into practice then the Commission may not have to issue a ban.
Madam President, Commissioner, from an Irish point of view I welcome the compensation clause and the solidarity fund because Irish football clubs are the cradle for many young footballers who go on to play in the English premiership and beyond.
I would like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions about that.
First of all, I assume the solidarity fund is a general fund.
Is there any chance that a portion of the transfer fee for under-23s might go directly to the amateur club which nurtured their skills?
You also need to look at the footballing academies in England to which young footballers are taken from Ireland at a very young age. Will there be some compensation for them?
The scandalous exploitation of young African footballers is a problem which I would ask you to look at again, because it does not seem to me to be addressed by the ban on inter-club transfers.
Agents will still find a way of getting round that.
I recognise that this was a difficult compromise which does address the problem - the potentially disastrous consequences of absolute freedom of movement - while at the same time recognising the need to respect the new law.
Madam President, let me thank Mr Cushnahan for his support. We have indeed succeeded in providing more than a solution to the problem of Community law pure and simple; we have also guaranteed stability for young people and also solidarity and protection.
Regarding the solidarity fund, there are two solidarity systems in place to compensate the training clubs.
Firstly, at the time of a transfer, training costs are reimbursed for the club responsible for training the young player, and that is applicable up to the age of 12.
There are two reasons, however, why these allocations cannot be too high.
Firstly we must adhere to the Bosman judgment.
Secondly if training fees were too high, then it would be too difficult for young footballers to be transferred from one club to another, all but the very best players.
However, we have to also protect footballers and young teenagers, so training fees must not be too high.
The second component is the solidarity fund.
This solidarity fund will be sustained by a 5% levy on each compensation payment for transfer.
In this respect it is the player' s value and not the money invested in training him which will count.
There will therefore be a duplicate transfer system for clubs offering training.
My hope - and this has been my objective in negotiating - is that the money will get back to the clubs at grass roots level which are so necessary in giving European sport a social dimension.
Such clubs play a prime social role in our villages and small towns and they must be given the opportunity to continue this work.
We preferred not to prevent the free movement of young African players or, as you said, youths from third countries so as not to hinder the free movement of European youth, but we did seek to impose some conditions on the way that third-country nationals were treated by clubs offering training.
The problem arises not in their travelling but in the way they are treated in the host country.
The code of conduct is intended to ensure that the clubs offering training actually take proper charge of these young people and do not train them simply as sportsmen but offer them an all-round education and preparation for life, for of course not everyone who has received sports training will become football stars or even have a professional career in the game.
Of course, the young people that are accepted into the European Union, even if they come from third countries, will benefit from equal treatment.
According to this code of conduct, not only will no distinction be made between young people from European countries and those from candidate countries, but young third-country nationals that have entered the European Union legally will also have the opportunity to be treated on the same terms.
You may rest assured that the Commission will carefully monitor the framing and implementation of this code of conduct.
I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that you too, as Members of the European Parliament, in your work at grassroots level, will note the way in which the code of conduct has been implemented.
On the subject of the free movement of young people from third countries, FIFA has stated that this was not within our remit since we had power to regulate only within the European Union. Outside the European Union and associated countries they intended to purely and simply ban the transfer of youths of less than 18 years of age.
This is a unilateral decision by FIFA which must therefore apply to citizens from third countries.
Thank you, Madam President, and congratulations to Commissioner Reding on the result of this protracted football match.
This is something we can certainly all be satisfied with.
I can think of just one moot point which I should like to ask the Commission to explain.
Do the new rules result in the same legal status for players under 23 years of age, as was applicable before the Bosman verdict, should a dispute arise between clubs about an amount by way of compensation?
Might players be in danger of not being able to change clubs, even if the contract has expired?
What legal protection do players have in such a situation?
Are they in danger of being tied for a period during such a legal dispute?
. (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, the age limit of 23 years only applies to training, because we had to set age limits and FIFA suggested these to us.
Players undergo training between 12 and 23 years of age and training costs are paid in the event of a player under the age of 23 transferring clubs.
It is considered that training is completed by the age of 23.
With regard to the length of contracts and the possibility of terminating a contract, from the outset we always said that pacta sunt servanda; in other words, if an adult signs a contract, the contract is binding. A contract is not there to be terminated, it is there to be observed, not forgetting that the rules of the sport also apply.
If, during a championship, clubs start to buy players left, right and centre, they are upsetting the balance of the championship.
Furthermore, if, during a championship, players rightly or wrongly leave their team, this is not simply a personal matter for them - it also destabilises the team.
All these considerations, which are specific to the sport, led us to put in place measures to ensure the stability of contracts.
So, whatever a player' s age, a contract cannot be terminated during the championship, nor can it be terminated outside of the championship if the contract extends beyond it, except for very specific reasons, such as a player being injured or a change in the team' s system.
It will be a matter for the court, the Court of Arbitration, to judge who is right.
If a player terminates his contract in the first two years and does not have a specific reason, disciplinary measures will be imposed.
As far as possible, we have tried to limit these disciplinary measures, because, at the beginning, sports authorities were considering measures lasting one or even two years, which would have totally destroyed the career of a professional player.
That is why we agreed to have disciplinary measures lasting four months, which could be extended to six months for repeat offenders or for someone who has already tried this trick several times before.
In order to ensure the stability of teams and the championship, therefore, we agreed on these measures, which are to be put in place not by the Commission, but by the national, European and international federations.
I must inform you that we did not want disciplinary measures to be taken solely against players, because clubs often sell their players for purely commercial reasons rather than reasons related to sport.
So disciplinary measures will also be taken against clubs and against agents who encourage players to leave their clubs, thereby affecting the stability of their contracts.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
I would like to quickly reiterate that the rules of the game are to keep the questions and answers as short as possible.
Madam President, I was a huge fan of the Commission' s attempt to put a check on the present transfer system which has, in my view, resulted in absurd situations.
That is also why, unlike my fellow MEPs, I am disappointed about the outcome of the negotiations which is now before us.
Of course, the proposal contains some sound points, such as compensation for training costs.
I am still left wondering about this, because the Commissioner' s response to my previous question was, in my opinion, not satisfactory.
If the cost of training is paid, even at the end of a contract, even at the time when a club wants to be rid of its player, this will be at odds with the Bosman judgment.
After all, either the compensation will be too low, in which case it is not a true reflection of the actual cost of training, or it will be very high and will clash with the Bosman judgment which stipulates that, at the end of a contract, no remuneration of any kind may be paid to the club.
However, Commissioner, my biggest disappointment concerns the very essence of the present transfer system, namely the existence of transfer fees.
You have to admit that the Commission has not been able to change this aspect.
It will be possible, in future too, for the club and player to agree in their joint contracts on transfer fees which are unlimited and which can rise to the same absurd heights as they do at the moment.
I think that you should be generous enough to admit that the Commission has suffered a huge defeat in this respect, and that the essence of the present system remains intact.
In my opinion, FIFA' s proposal is nothing but a cosmetic change to, and, in some respects, an improvement on, the current system, but the essence of that system, the existence of transfer fees, remains in place.
Madam President, Mr Lagendijk is correct.
We did not change the transfer fee levels, because this matter was not referred to us.
We did not receive any complaints about this, only complaints regarding the international transfer system, which is why we intervened.
The current situation is that no compensation is paid at the end of a contract - the Bosman judgment stipulates that training compensation should be paid on the condition that the compensation is in line with real costs.
These are the terms of the Bosman judgment and this is what the agreement with FIFA seeks to put into practice.
Madam President, can I welcome the forbearance and patience shown by the Commissioner's staff during the last seven months.
Many of us do not understand why this could not have been done in seven minutes, because it is clear that we have principles.
Like many of my colleagues I am interested in the impact on clubs in the north-west of England, which is, after all, the home of football.
We still have no answer on the issue of training compensation.
Clubs in my region are concerned that the money they invest in buying players will not give them a return on their investment and, as Mr Cushnahan said, they will not be interested in running football academies and in investing in the local community if they cannot see a return on their investment.
So far I cannot see how training compensation is going to deliver that.
In today's Times newspaper UEFA and FIFA are clearly indicating that this will lead to lower transfer fees, which has a knock-on impact, particularly for smaller clubs in my area.
Commissioner, you have a review clause, which will be tried for two seasons - do you then intend to act to ensure that there is a free and good flow of transfer of money between clubs or will it be left to governing bodies to act in this area?
Now that we have closed this chapter, Commissioner, can I also extend an invitation to you to visit the north-west to see one of the premier teams play football.
They would be very happy for you to visit us in the north-west.
.
(FR) I shall gladly accept your invitation, as, believe me, before I made any decisions with regard to this matter, I visited some small clubs and training centres.
What is one thing in theory is completely different in reality.
I saw this on Monday, just after the agreement had been reached.
On Tuesday, I met the English Football League and representatives from clubs in the second division.
They were concerned and asked me to explain the terms of the agreement.
In response, they told me that they felt completely reassured.
Of course, we must see how things turn out in practice in the clubs.
Rest assured, we shall be monitoring this very closely.
I must also inform you that the criticism made by the Football League was not directed at the Commission, but rather at the UEFA management and those running European football in general, who said that they had never been consulted.
The Football League never discussed the matter with UEFA and yet I believe that, in a democracy, which is also called upon to play a role within our sporting federations, discussions between the main parties should be the order of the day.
On this point, I must also inform you that my colleague, Anna Diamantopoulou, who is responsible for the free movement of workers, has been taken aback by the lack of talks between clubs and players, for example.
She suggested that she might assist, so that discussions on collective European negotiations may be held in the future.
Transparency must also play a part in the world of sport.
Commissioner, you mentioned the ongoing evaluation that you will be making over the next two years.
I wonder whether it would not have been wiser to have carried out an assessment of the economic impact on small clubs before you travelled down this road.
Many of the smaller clubs in my region, who cradle players for the obvious talents of the north-west clubs in the UK, are particularly worried about this.
There has been a lot of talk about football here today, but you mentioned sport and this is specifically a sports remit.
Other sports have transfer fees and I wonder which other sports you have discussed this with.
I find it very interesting that players now have different rights depending on their age - 23 being the case in point here.
I was wondering for Commissioner Diamantopoulou whether this sets a precedent for other European employment legislation.
Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the changes to FIFA rules and regulations.
The calculation behind the effective training costs was recently posted on the FIFA website.
FIFA state it would be impossible to do this for individual players so they want to do this by league and type of club.
This recommendation means that the smaller the club, the smaller the amount of money the club will receive in compensation for training costs.
The categories are a category-one club of a top level, with a high quality training centre; category two: still professional but on a lower level - second division clubs in the UK; category three: all types of third-division clubs, as in the UK; category four: amateur players - Vauxhall Conference and other amateur footballers.
Are we not building another type of discrimination into football, which we really did not need in the first place?
. (FR) Mr Heaton-Harris, I do not wish to interfere in the affairs of the UK.
I think that because the UK football authorities are autonomous and because this autonomy has been fully acknowledged, they should deal with this matter.
The Commission' s opinion is that this should be dealt with in a transparent fashion and that all parties such as rich clubs, less wealthy clubs, prominent, young and average players, should all be involved in the discussions.
I certainly hope that transparency and democracy come into play.
To come to the issue of training costs, we consider this issue to be quite straightforward.
These costs cannot be excessive otherwise they would constitute a barrier to free movement and they would clearly be in total contradiction of the Bosman judgment.
That is why a ceiling will be imposed on the costs.
My second point, which reiterates what I said in my introductory speech, is we believe that solidarity is an extremely important factor.
Training costs and the solidarity funds, therefore, must be cascaded downwards, precisely in order to protect the smaller clubs.
I made this point very clear and it is also part of the Nice Declaration.
With sport, we have a social responsibility, particularly towards the majority at the bottom of the hierarchy.
Madam President, I believe that this agreement has enabled us to do two things.
We have been able to support the majority at the bottom of the hierarchy, as well as those at the top.
We took a gamble, which was not easy, but we hope that this great achievement will work out just as well in practice, which will be the next test.
Commissioner, you concluded your first speech by commenting that this agreement demonstrates that it will not be necessary to change the Treaty to take account of the special features of sport and of football.
In order words, you said that the Commission too recognises the special character of sport.
Now, my question is this: that being so, why was it that before Nice the Commission did not press for the special character of sport to be included in the Treaty alongside culture, and in fact seemed to be opposed to including this in the Treaty? The fact is that they are not the same, because there may still be some uncertainty here.
The ruling by the Court of Justice on some of the points that were settled and on others that still have to be resolved is still vulnerable and, in fact, the specific character of sport in general and of football in particular will not be safeguarded until they are clearly and specifically recognised in the Treaties.
So I would like to ask you if the Commission still maintains that it is neither necessary nor helpful to have a clear reference in the Treaty to the special character of sport.
. (FR) I first worked on this matter in the summer of 1999, when I was European Commissioner for Sport.
Since that time, the Commission' s entire policy has taken the specific characteristics of sport into consideration.
Furthermore, only in December 1999, a Commission statement on the social dimension of sport was submitted to the Heads of State and Government at the Helsinki Summit.
And nothing has changed since then.
We have done more about the specific characteristics of sport than merely make a statement we have put words into practice.
We should, nonetheless, be well aware that any future Treaty will include an article on the specific characteristics of sport.
However, ladies and gentlemen, this will not mean an end of the right to competition, free movement, or any of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Treaty, because people in the sporting world are not above the Treaty.
So, I hope this is perfectly clear.
It would be very useful for me, as Commissioner for Sport, to have the specific characteristics of sport included, because I could at last! create a programme specific to sport, which I alone am currently unable to do.
I always have to consider aspects such as education, health and culture as well; in other words, all the other components that are included in the Treaty.
We have, then, always respected the specific characteristics of sport.
To make an exception for sport, which is what some people would like to see, and which would mean that the rules of the Treaty do not apply to sport, is something to which I am firmly opposed.
Madam President, I too am pleased that the negotiations have culminated in an agreement, and I believe that it is indeed positive that another evaluation is planned in two years' time to check whether we have actually promoted what we set out to promote.
I am particularly pleased with the compensation for training, the code of conduct for young players and the solidarity fund.
I have a question regarding the latter.
The Commissioner says in that connection that she hopes that this will benefit the smaller clubs.
I would like to find out what guarantees are being built in so that the solidarity fund will actually benefit the smaller clubs and the training clubs, and can actually contribute to the social function of the sport.
I am thinking of the composition and criteria for allocating funding, for example.
Is anything known about this yet?
. (FR) We have FIFA' s clear and distinct commitment that this will happen.
We have their assurance that the money will be cascaded down, right down to the club who nurtured the player from the age of 12, and we have their assurance that 5% of the transfer fees will be put back into the fund.
Naturally, we shall be checking that, in practice, everything is carried out in accordance with these assurances, and if there is a problem, we shall certainly make our views known.
Madam President, I would like, if I may, to extend this line of thinking a little further because there are two very important decisions to mention. The first is solidarity between the richest clubs and the less wealthy clubs and the second is the protection of young people through a code of conduct.
In my view - and, furthermore, I intend, during the Belgian Presidency, to present a proposal on this issue to the Ministers for Sport - these measures could be extended to cover other sports, because the protection of young people concerns all other sports as well as football, and the same goes for solidarity between the clubs in the premier division and the small clubs who put in the initial work.
We can use these arguments to lobby other sporting authorities and disciplines so that they take steps in the same direction.
Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Commissioners Reding, Monti and Diamantopoulou.
We have all come a very long way since last August.
The partnership has been invaluable in proving that we can come to some agreement on this issue.
The principles that have been established, especially around the specificity of sport, are extremely important.
However, my worry remains with the players' associations.
I know that the Commissioner may say that this is a matter for the sporting families, but ultimately we will have to sort it out, because if the players' associations either refuse to come on board or the players take action, then ultimately the agreement may be in tatters.
First, what will Mrs Reding be doing to bring the players' associations on board and, secondly, are there any particular problems that she thinks we could resolve as far as the players are concerned?
. (FR) As I have already explained, we would prefer clubs and players, which are the two sides involved in this matter, to sit around the table and begin negotiations.
Mrs Dimantopoulou has also recently written to the clubs and the players to ensure that, finally, this social dialogue can get off the ground.
Secondly, the Commissioners responsible for this issue met the players' associations on a regular basis because we thought that it made sense for the great footballing family to come together.
Unfortunately, this has not always been how it works in practice.
That is why we talked with both parties throughout the developments in this matter.
I would also like to inform you that our constant concern was to protect the rights conferred on employees by the Treaties, even if sport does have specific characteristics. Furthermore, in order to ensure that sport operates properly, a professional football player cannot be treated in the same way as a steelworker.
Everyone understands this.
Furthermore, some aspects of the agreement are obvious; for example, the protection of young people refers specifically to young players.
The disciplinary measures were toned down considerably compared to what had been asked and was expected at the beginning.
That is a benefit for sportsmen and women.
Who then benefits from the stability of the championships and teams?
Sport is the prime beneficiary, then the fans and spectators, but professional players benefit as well.
Indeed, would they still benefit from playing if sport were destroyed?
With regard to the Court of Arbitration, we insisted that the court be made up of equal numbers of players and club representatives.
I believe that this is a major step forward for players, and I hope that the offer made by my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, will be accepted so that, in this area as well, we see the beginnings of a genuine social dialogue.
Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for all the effort she has put into these negotiations.
I have two short questions. The first is, over what period is the training compensation system going to be worked out and the code of conduct developed?
I ask because I believe it is very important to have a set schedule and a set time frame here.
My other question is about the transfer fee level, which is still unlimited.
So the question arises of how the solidarity fund will work, if it is really going to benefit the very smallest clubs.
You mentioned 5% of the transfer fee, which would then be shared out.
However, the key question is how this amount will be distributed and if it will then really benefit the clubs on the bottom rung of the ladder.
. (FR) You are asking when all this will be put into practice.
The FIFA world congress takes place in Buenos Aires at the beginning of July, and FIFA will then be aiming to incorporate into its rules all the broad principles that were collectively agreed.
These broad principles must be put into practice when applying the new rules of world football.
To deal specifically with the question of transfer fees, I have already answered a question on this subject.
We did not receive any complaints about the levels of transfer fees.
I have my own view on this, and, no doubt, you do as well.
The autonomy of federations should, however, enable this to be settled fairly easily, for example, by setting minimum and maximum levels.
There could be rules, for example, to specify that only clubs that do not have a huge deficit would be allowed to make transfers against payment, but it is not up to the Commission to regulate everything, everywhere.
There are very distinct responsibilities and national and European federations have a fair share of responsibilities to shoulder in the system.
Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that what we have just decided is not a substitute for national law.
The rules in national law, and particularly the rules in employment law, could be changed in Member States to take account of the specific characteristics of sport.
We noticed that some Heads of State and Governments were extremely committed to football!
Therefore, if this commitment is put into practice on the ground, in the Member States, this will apply to football and to sport as a whole.
Madam President, Commissioners, I welcomed the conclusion of the agreement on the transfer of footballers with great satisfaction.
The terms of the agreement appear to be positive.
It was certainly a matter that needed regulating.
In particular, I welcome the fact that the Commission has succeeded in emphasising the aspects related to solidarity towards small sports clubs as well in an agreement which is economic and legislative in nature, valuing their enormous dedication to training young people.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Reding and Commissioner Monti, who, this very morning, together with the Italian sports writers' association and the supporters' association, allowed me to put forward the idea of establishing a European sports committee and maybe subsequently a European sports agency, which would have the task of promoting healthy sporting activity and dealing at European level with different issues related to culture, education, the free movement of persons, non-discrimination and the fight against violence, racism and doping.
To sum up, we have set off along the right road but we must tread the path resolutely, as, I am sure, Commissioner Reding will do.
So what will the next the stage be?
. (FR) Yes, Madam President, Mr Mantovani is perfectly correct in saying that we must not only solve the problems posed by Community law but we must also consider the bigger picture and understand that sport is an extremely important social activity, and symbolises the cultural activity of a whole society.
With this in mind, then, I propose we take advantage of the opportunity provided by the Olympic Games to be held in Athens, because these games will revisit the original Olympic ideals of fair competition and fair play.
In a statement on sport that I will be sending firstly to the Commission and then to Parliament, I will therefore propose that 2004 be declared the European Year of Sport and that, in this way, school children be introduced to this other aspect of sport, which is distinct from the business side of things, in other words, the sport of fair play, the true values of our society.
As part of the Youth Programme for example, young voluntary workers could also be asked to become involved in the Olympic Games.
I can inform you now that I had a meeting with the Chairman of the Athens 2004 Organising Committee, to ask if the torch, which is symbolic of the Olympics and their values, could travel through Europe before finishing its journey in Athens so that the torch could become a catalyst in every European country for discussions on the true values of sport, which might enable these values to be put into practice almost everywhere.
Madam President, I am pleased that there has been an agreement.
Obviously everybody is looking into the detail now and although we were very excited when we first got the agreement, I think a lot of people would agree that it is going to be quite difficult to find out whether it is going to benefit some of the smaller clubs - in particular, academy clubs - as much as we hoped.
I know this has been touched on, but Stoke City in my constituency has an academy club as good as Manchester United and my fear is that it will get less money because it is not in the premier league.
I would like the Commissioner to say whether she is going to look again at whether all clubs could be treated on the same level.
I know FIFA has recommended it.
I understand that a Hungarian player who has had his transfer put on hold is probably going to mount a legal challenge.
What would happen if that legal challenge is successful?
Would we then have to go back to the drawing-board?
. (FR) Madam President, the agreement that has been reached does not, to any extent, prejudge legal challenges before the Court of Justice.
It is, of course, obvious that neither the Commission nor this House would ever allow themselves to interfere in the judges' work.
It is fortunate that democracy is founded on the division of powers.
It is therefore up to the judges in the Court in Luxembourg to decide on their course of action.
I would however like to mention that, last year, the judges issued a ruling in two cases that had important implications for sport.
The rulings that were issued show that the Court in Luxembourg takes into account the independence of federations as well as the social dimension of sport.
I am referring to the Lehtonen and the LiÃšge rulings.
With regard to the Balog ruling, we have to respect the judgment of the Court.
With regard to the omnipresent fear that the system of the richest clubs transferring money to less wealthy clubs will not work properly, I, unfortunately, can say no more about this.
There was a demand for this system.
It has been decided how the system will work and we will only know if it works when it is implemented.
Madam President, I also expect the Members of Parliament who are involved in this issue to inform the Commission when, in their constituency, they notice that the system is not working as it should under the terms of the agreement between the Commission and FIFA.
I believe that we should work together more closely on this, because what we all want is to protect the social dimension of sport, to protect smaller clubs and to protect young players.
So let us all keep an eye on how this works out in practice.
Madam President, this has been a very hard and long process, and it is not over yet.
This can now be regarded as a precedent, and this obviously leads to the question as to how then all the other ball games and individual sports will be treated in the future, and how the rules that apply to them might possibly change, as each sport is obviously different and limits on age and training vary greatly between them.
Can this now be regarded as setting a precedent for all of them?
Similarly, I would like to ask how training is evaluated and its cash value determined; what is the definition of voluntary work, and what sort of cash value could be worked out for it?
And thirdly, can we in future also apply our own rules to sports events that are purely national and are not played or enjoyed anywhere else except in just the one Member State, or are we to await this precedent?
. (FR) Mrs Matikainen knows a great deal about sport, since she competed at a very high level and she is quite right in saying that this could be regarded as a precedent.
I certainly hope that this is the case.
That is why I will, of course, be asking for other sporting disciplines to participate in the tenth European Sports Forum, which will be given as much impetus as required, and to which Members of Parliament will also be invited, and where all sporting disciplines will be represented.
It is true that we have not discussed voluntary work as much as we should.
We have discussed huge transfer sums, but not the hundreds of thousands of people who give their private lives and free time to work with young people and their sports clubs.
That is what constitutes the social dimension of sport.
How could sport in Europe exist without these people?
You are quite right, Mrs Matikainen.
I think that when we discuss information for young people in schools and clubs, we will also discuss the subject of voluntary work, because these activities are an integral part of the social dimension of sport in Europe.
Mrs Matikainen, with regard to the calculations, the sporting federations must agree on realistic sums.
We shall never be in a position to evaluate voluntary work, because it would have to be paid, then sport would be out of the reach of villages and small towns and only professional sport would remain.
That is not what we want.
On my own behalf, therefore, and, I believe, on behalf of everyone here, I would like to say a big thank you to all voluntary workers.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
I would like to thank all the Members who spoke, as well as the Commissioner for her detailed and thorough answers.
Evidence in civil and commercial matters
The next item is the report (A5-0073/2001) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters [11808/2000 - C5Â­0519/2000 - 2000/0823(CNS)].
Madam President, it was not by chance that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved - with only one vote against - this report on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters.
It approved it not because of any bias against the use of government or State initiatives when it comes to creating a European area of justice, as anyone not quite paying attention might imagine given what happened this morning.
Quite the contrary - I believe that apart from the areas of immigration and asylum, that is, ultimately, apart from the area of the free movement of persons, initiatives like this one are, of course, welcome.
What such initiatives cannot do, and this is what concerns Parliament, is to make up for the inconsistencies between the Member States which lead to such a legislative mire, with each Member State doing its own thing with initiatives to suit its own taste, without a genuine Community vision and ignoring their joint responsibility. They are also overlooking the need for a serious and coherent body of legislation, which the Commission is proving it is possible to achieve - and I am looking at Commissioner Vitorino now - in one of the most sensitive areas.
That area is a model for coexistence in Europe and the fundamental freedoms associated with it, in this case freedom of the individual.
Having said that, with particular reference to the area covered by this report, in which the proper functioning of the single market implies a strengthening of the European social area, anything new - even in the Member States - which helps to eliminate and reduce cross-border disputes and litigation is, of course, to be welcomed, and I believe that tomorrow's vote will reflect that.
What is the ultimate aim of this German initiative?
It involves giving a court in any Member State the ability, during any legal proceedings concerning certain civil and commercial matters that have taken place in another Member State, to use its best endeavours to obtain evidence essential for progressing the main proceedings in the court of the requesting country.
Up to now, international cooperation on the taking of evidence has been governed by the Hague Convention of 1970, the scope of which is limited since it only applies to those Member States that have ratified the Convention. As far as I know, only eleven Member States have done so.
This means that without a legal instrument covering the Union's 15 Member States and those that may join subsequently, not all members of the public taking legal action through the courts will have the same legal remedies; it will depend on whether or not their country or the requested country has ratified the Convention.
Under this new regulation, all courts will be covered by the same law, and all EU citizens will benefit from the same protection given that this Community instrument will facilitate direct contact between courts in different countries.
Ultimately, this will remove obstacles to the creation of a European legal area, either by creating a standard European form to be used by the courts in the requesting States in the language of the requested courts, so as to facilitate communication between the two, or by creating a central authority in each country which will receive and forward requests originating from another State for the taking of evidence from a national court, or by establishing the principle that the entire request must be responded to, and obliging requested European courts to execute this request within six months, at the end of which, if they have not complied, they will have to provide an explanation to the requesting court.
The amendments that I have made to this initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany include imposing a duty on the central authorities to produce legal guidance on the official languages recognised by each court in each of the Member States and a duty to provide information on accredited legal translation agencies.
Lastly, in view of these innovative arrangements, which will greatly speed up the proceedings of courts in all the Member States, which seems to me to be one of the key aims of the German initiative, I have proposed that only in exceptional circumstances should the direct contact between courts envisaged in the regulation be superseded by traditional consular channels, which I believe are inevitably cumbersome, bureaucratic, somewhat remote from events and in many ways responsible for the delays in litigation in cross-border disputes or proceedings.
Some Members from other groups did not fully grasp this last point and therefore voted against this amendment. The objective, as I saw it, was merely to emphasise a certain concept of Europe which I espouse: a Community with its own law, but more than just a diplomatic Community or one based on international law.
I have therefore tabled this amendment again in the hope that the majority of Members will now understand this point of detail, which is, in fact, more than just a detail.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Marinho, I am very pleased that this report is before us today.
I would like to thank you very much for preparing a subject which at first seems very technical, but which, as you quite rightly stressed, has a very substantial part to play in creating a citizens' Europe, because cross-border business is on the increase.
We have a European single market, we have a single European currency, and we will soon have the coins and notes of that currency in our pockets.
Because of e-commerce, we will see exponential growth in cross-border contracts, and it is a sad fact that problems sometimes arise with contracts, resulting in legal disputes.
The taking of evidence is generally at the heart of any legal dispute, as matters of law are often easy to settle, but there are often widely varying interpretations when it comes to the facts.
If it is necessary to determine the facts of a case which took place in another Member State, then the present situation as regards mutual legal assistance is simply anachronistic, and involves using the Hague Convention through diplomatic channels, making matters very complicated and time-consuming, and also unreliable.
A court case often comes to a standstill quite simply because the facts of the case cannot be established, and quite simply because the resources for mutual legal assistance are not available.
That is why it is so important that the Federal Republic of Germany has brought forward this proposal, and that is why my group is so firmly supporting this initiative, because it provides for greater certainty, swifter administration of the law and, last but not least, greater justice for the citizens of the European Union.
This legal instrument will also help to counter a trend which I view with increasing scepticism.
By that I mean the tendency to resort to extrajudicial dispute resolution, that is to say bringing in a neutral arbitrator instead of going to court, or letting some kind of board of arbitration make a ruling.
This is actually a trend that runs counter to the idea of the constitutional state.
This is a trend, and I am happy to say so in this Chamber, which also runs counter to parliamentary democracy, because our system is, in fact, designed on the assumption that parliaments make laws and an independent judiciary apply those laws.
Anything that represents a deviation from these procedures is at odds with the original concept of the constitutional state which all of us here have in our sight.
If we can make cross-border legal relations easier, then we also make it easier for companies and individual citizens to operate within systems guaranteed by the State.
The single market needs an efficient legal system, failing which all our efforts to create competition and increasing prosperity in the European Union will come to nothing.
By way of conclusion, I must confess that it makes me feel somewhat uneasy that we keep having to consider initiatives from Member States here.
I can be particularly forthright in saying that in this particular case, because this initiative emanates from my own country.
I find it embarrassing that we in the European Parliament are not in a position to present such initiatives, and this report should also make us think once again about whether the European Parliament should not have a right of initiative, particularly in this area, which is such a sensitive one in the public's eyes.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report.
The regulation with which we are dealing applies solely to civil and commercial matters where a court in one Member State can request evidence on the performance of judicial acts from another competent court in another Member State of the European Union.
The regulation provides for the establishment of central authorities which are not responsible for the actual transmission of documents but which will respond to requests for supplying information from requested agencies.
We must recall that the Treaties of the European Union incorporated judicial cooperation in civil matters in 1993.
This is certainly a matter of common interest for Member States and it does indeed complement the workings of the internal market.
The establishment of an area of freedom, justice and security confers on members of the judiciary an essential role to play in the effective workings of the Union.
This matter may be highlighted to an even greater extent with the advent and introduction of the single currency next year.
While I certainly support judicial cooperation within the EU, I do not support the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor. I do not support the establishment of such a body because I believe that the rights of our citizens should be fully protected.
In Britain and in Ireland we have a different legal system - the old common law system - to that which pertains in the majority of other Member States.
The problem for a European Public Prosecutor is simply what is the legal basis for such a prosecution.
Do you apply the rule that a person is innocent until proven guilty - which exists in the common law system - or do you apply another legal basis which exists in other Member States of the Union?
I do not believe that this square can be circled.
Judicial cooperation is important because it complements the workings of the internal market and the single currency, as already stated.
Europol is effective and Europol must be supported in ensuring that crimes such as trafficking in human beings, cyber-crime and so on can be dealt with within the European territories. However, I believe that the establishment of the Public Prosecutor's Office is a step too far.
It is unworkable and it would be an unwelcome move which would not command support among the citizens of the European Union.
However, I support the regulation which is before us today.
I believe the implementation of this regulation concerning the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters will certainly improve and accelerate cross-border proceedings.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation in the taking of evidence is a specific example of judicial cooperation in civil matters referred to in Article 65 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
By virtue of this specific reference in the Treaty, this question was included by the Council in the Vienna Action Plan, in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, and it was subsequently covered in the Commission's scoreboard for the establishment of a common area of freedom, security and justice.
As mentioned by the rapporteur, whom I would like to congratulate on his excellent report, this question was addressed in the 1970 Hague Convention on the taking of evidence abroad in civil or commercial matters, which has to date only been ratified by 11 of the Member States of the European Union.
The increase in the mobility of persons within the common area of the European Union is one of the factors that has made an important contribution to the growth in the number of law cases with cross-border implications.
For example, when it comes to taking evidence, legal proceedings taking place under the jurisdiction of one Member State increasingly involve taking evidence from witnesses resident in another Member State.
This is why it has become necessary to adopt clear and effective rules on cooperation between courts in the Member States with a view to facilitating the taking of evidence in such situations.
These rules will no doubt represent a significant step forward in the work currently being done to improve access to justice, either on the part of individuals or of companies, and also in pursuing the wider objective of creating a European legal area in civil matters.
Accordingly, this regulation will enhance the value of European citizenship and of protecting and guaranteeing our citizens' individual rights, and it is also of not insignificant economic importance, in that by facilitating the taking of evidence, it will make swifter and more effective administration of justice more economically viable, and in particular administration of justice more in line with the necessities of a new economic reality, of the single market, the single currency and electronic democracy.
In view of these considerations, the Commission welcomes the German initiative for a regulation in this field.
Furthermore, the Commission does not have any bias against initiatives by Member States, especially when such initiatives are in line with the priorities defined by the Tampere European Council.
The German initiative also gives us an opportunity to move forward and modernise the rules of the 1970 Hague Convention, with the added value of adopting a Community instrument that can be uniformly and directly applied to the legal system of each of the 15 Member States.
This is an initial phase, the central objective of which is to create the mechanisms needed to strengthen mutual confidence between the legal and judicial systems of the 15 Member States.
This initial phase should, once the effects of implementing the regulation have been assessed, open up the way for more ambitious objectives, and in particular those which would make it possible for the requesting court to ask for a special procedure to be employed by the requested court in performing a judicial act, together with the option of the requesting court being associated with the performing of the judicial act by the requested court.
We therefore welcome the support the rapporteur has given to this initiative.
Furthermore, the Commission is in sympathy with the general points he has raised, and with the general approach of the amendments he has proposed.
I can assure you that for our part we will closely monitor and assist the discussions on this initiative in the relevant Council committee, with a view to producing a text which precisely reflects the concerns expressed by Parliament in the Marinho report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Fight against fraud
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0078/2001) by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the European Commission' s 1999 Annual Report on protecting the Communities' financial interests - the fight against fraud. [COM(2000) 718 - C5-0066/2001 - 2001/2036(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 1999 was a year of great progress in fighting fraud.
After the old Commission resigned, it was only a few weeks before agreement was reached on the legal texts establishing the new European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.
Parliament, the Council and the Commission had to and were therefore able to demonstrate that the EU was capable of taking action in the fight against fraud, corruption and mismanagement.
Full implementation of what was agreed over two years ago has, however, proved to be somewhat more difficult than originally assumed.
The first annual report by the OLAF Supervisory Committee accordingly quite rightly sounded the alarm.
Although the new Director, Mr BrÃŒner, has been in his post for over a year now, he has so far not been able to put together a new management team for OLAF, and this is chiefly because the Commission has involved him in an administrative trench war over the procedures for recruiting the new management.
Of course, one of the questions here is the independence of OLAF and its Director.
The Commission's position on this is inconsistent.
When it comes to appointing new members of the management team, the Commission wants to precisely supervise and be involved in every single step.
But when it comes to taking back staff that do not meet the new job specification for OLAF, then the Commission behaves as if this were not its concern at all.
And yet it was the Commission that simply transferred the entire staff of the previous UCLAF task force to OLAF en bloc, thus creating the majority of the problems which the Director of OLAF is now having to tackle.
Mrs Schreyer, this transfer took place despite explicit warnings from this House.
Parliament then slammed on the emergency brakes and held back the additional posts earmarked for the current year.
It is now the responsibility of the Commission to eliminate the obstacles I have described.
It only makes sense to remove the present reserve if this condition is met.
Mrs Schreyer, you personally and the Commission as a whole have come to the conclusion that without a European Public Prosecutor the fight against fraud will remain a half measure.
The detection and clearing-up of fraud and other offences adversely affecting the Union's interests must be followed by prosecution and punishment.
We will really have egg on our face if it turns out in one or two years' time that what I hope will be a very efficiently operating Anti-Fraud Office has exposed significantly more cases of fraud and irregularities than in the past, but that there is a problem with punishing those responsible.
It is significant that the Commission's annual report is full of statistics, but it does not contain any information on the number of people actually convicted following cases of fraud.
I am sure that if this statistic were available it would tell a sorry tale.
However, these people will not be punished unless there is a prosecutor representing the interests of Europe's taxpayers, and that applies above all to the institutions of the European Union itself.
And they can only be credible if it is visibly demonstrated that the much-vaunted zero-tolerance policy is more than just empty words and is being put into practice.
This requires a public prosecutor, and, as Parliament has already demanded on various occasions, one that is exclusively responsible for the Union's institutions.
This was proposed by the five independent experts in their second report on the reform of the Commission in September 1999.
Furthermore, the OLAF Supervisory Committee has since then on several occasions, and in the clearest possible terms, called for what might be called for the appointment of an internal public prosecutor.
For the avoidance of all doubt, let me say that a public prosecutor of this kind could not, as the law currently stands, himself appear as a prosecutor in the national courts; his role would be to support and advise the relevant national public prosecutor's offices.
It would also be his job to supervise OLAF's internal investigations within the institutions, and he would thus work in partnership with the Director of OLAF.
The Director of OLAF currently has to make contact with the Secretaries-General of the institutions if OLAF wishes to carry out internal investigations, and it is therefore easy to suggest that his investigations are not truly independent.
This problem would to a large extent be solved if there were a public prosecutor for internal matters.
There would be no automatic extension of such a public prosecutor's powers beyond the Union's institutions.
That would require an amendment to the Treaties.
Such an amendment failed in Nice because of opposition from several Member States.
However, the Commission cannot just sit back and do nothing, now of all times.
It must now demonstrate that it really is serious about fighting fraud and is doing everything possible, displaying originality and political courage, on the basis of the current Article 280.
One thing must be made clear, however: discussion papers, green papers and white papers are not enough.
There are plenty of those already. What is needed now is a concrete proposal for a regulation to be adopted by the Council and Parliament under the codecision procedure.
In other words, the Commission must exercise its right of initiative.
We need another great leap forward.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half years after the Prodi Commission took office, we still remember its fine-sounding but pompous announcements about zero-tolerance towards fraud and corruption, together with the promises made by the retread Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, to make this Commission the best administration in the world.
Unfortunately, even one and a half years on, there is still an alarming gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the Prodi Commission.
In view of its failure to catch up on the backlog of old cases and to prevent new cases of fraud, I feel bound to ask the Commission why it is not seizing this opportunity to make a truly fresh start.
Unfortunately, there is no sign of a new wind blowing through the Commission, apart from the hot air emanating from the tonnes of papers on reform generated by Commissioner Kinnock. And those reforms are already in danger of failing because of internal resistance from officials.
Real problems in the fight against fraud and corruption, such as the overdue reform of the disciplinary procedure, are not being tackled.
The Commission has high-handedly ignored all Parliament's suggestions in this field, and it is giving exactly the same treatment to Parliament's requests for a European Public Prosecutor's Office to be set up and for the independence of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, to be guaranteed.
Cover-ups, camouflage and deceit should not form the Commission's strategy for the fight against fraud.
The FlÃ©chard case, which dates back to the beginning of the 1990s, is an example of how not to do things.
The arbitrary and unlawful decision made by the Delors cabinet in January 1994 ultimately led to a situation in which this company was able to play an important role in a fresh fraud scandal concerning traffic in adulterated butter between 1995 and 2000.
It has not been possible to clarify or predict the extent and consequences of this scandal either in financial terms or as regards the significant risk to public health.
In my view, the way it handles this case is the most important yardstick for the Commission's attempts to improve matters.
I say that because this case in no longer just about the significant financial losses that the Community has suffered through fraud, but it is also about the health risk to the public both in Europe and beyond.
So swift and consistent action is needed more than ever.
The Commission cannot, as has so often happened, hide behind the need to protect companies' commercial interests. Instead, it should strike a balance between those commercial interests and the protection of public health.
As in all democratic European States, budgetary control is one of the most important rights and duties of the Members of the European Parliament.
So the Commission should not resort to artifice to obstruct that control.
Those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear from such control.
If on its own authority the Commission withholds documents classified as confidential, or gives them to some Members but not to others, that amounts to a blatant infringement of fundamental constitutional principles such as equal treatment and non-discrimination.
The framework agreement of 5 July 2000, which was worked out with excessive haste, and which is supposed to legitimise such actions on the part of the Commission, needs to be measured against these democratic principles and is bound to fail that test.
I would particularly like to thank Mr BÃ¶sch for his report and I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation across party lines in this highly important area.
Mr President, Commissioner, the main subject in the 1999 annual report on OLAF is, of course, the dismantling of the criminal organisation responsible for adulterating butter and fraudulently obtaining public funds, an organisation based in Naples but with influence at the heart of Europe.
In addition to congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report, I think that a special compliment is certainly due not just to OLAF but also to the Italian and French judicial organisations whose joint work led to this organised crime network being broken up.
According to the latest information available, the scheme for adulterating butter set up by a number of Camorra families in Naples produced 130 000 tonnes of totally or partially artificial butter.
I think that makes this the biggest fraud ever committed against the EU's common agricultural policy.
The first question that comes to mind here is how it is possible that a policy that is supposed to help rural communities and farmers can end up systematically financing major agro-industrial complexes, and that those complexes frequently turn out to be no more scrupulous in respecting the Community budget than they are towards consumers and the farmers in whose name they are financed.
The second question that needs asking here is how it is possible for a fraud on this scale, which was meticulously planned and put into operation over three years, and involving astronomical Community subsidies, to go undetected, and for the Commission to have been incapable of detecting anything at all.
After the persistent revelations of fraud concerning the use of subsidised powdered milk for feeding calves, of bogus butter exports and revelations regarding adulterated dairy products, the Commission still seems unwilling, despite this huge scandal, to carry out a thorough review of its entire system of intervention in dairy products.
The pan-European nature of this fraud, which involved major dairy product companies in countries such as Belgium, France, Italy and Germany, means that it is unacceptable for the policies needed to combat food adulteration to be permanently left in the hands of the Member States.
This also makes it more urgent for the Commission to adopt direct measures to combat the adulteration of products such as olive oil, wine and dairy produce.
The Commission has refused to divulge names, to arrange special surveillance or to take preventive measures against the innumerable dairy product companies involved, on the grounds of legal confidentiality and the presumption of innocence.
However, I am bound to say that the Commission's discretion in this case is very much in contrast with the way it dealt with the widow of an adviser to an ex-Commissioner. It is demanding that she should now pay back 18 months of her late husband's salary.
If there are dairy product companies that are incapable of distinguishing tens of thousands of tonnes of concoctions made from animal waste, oil and chemical products from real butter, how can consumers be expected to have any confidence in their ability to guarantee the quality of their own products?
What is also at stake here is whether we are all equal in the eyes of the Commission, or whether when it comes to major companies and big interests, some are evidently more equal than others.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr BÃ¶sch: my group believes that, with him, this report is in capable hands.
Despite this, we have still tabled a few amendments to his report.
We remain adamant about the fact that this Parliament is not a court of law and that it does not need to pass judgment on certain cases.
We must first wait and see what those reports bring and then judge whether the Commission has acquitted itself of its task expertly.
That is why the jury is still out on the butter fraud, a case which is indeed probably very extensive, on the flax fraud in Spain and possibly in other countries too, on New Zealand butter and on Stockholm.
We will wait for all the reports and will study the Commission' s behaviour in those situations, before passing judgment.
We endorse Mr BÃ¶sch' s observations with regard to OLAF' s role.
The Director will need to avail himself of his rights and will, as far as we are concerned, be backed by Parliament.
Independence is a great good.
We also endorse the remarks about the European Public Prosecutor, although I must admit that a minority in my group feels differently about this.
We believe that it is necessary, with a view to protecting financial interests, that the Commission table proposals along these lines as soon as possible, and we have quoted, in an amendment, 1 June 2001 as the ultimate deadline in this connection.
Closer cooperation is obviously needed between the Commission, the Member States and the European and national courts of auditors.
It is probably wise - and we have tabled an amendment to this effect as well - if the Commission were first to define what exactly is considered to be fraud and what is an irregularity.
That discrepancy will need to be done away with.
We can support Mr BÃ¶sch' s late amendment on Switzerland.
Switzerland is a key country in Europe when it comes to combating fraud, and we do well to bear this in mind.
It is unfortunate that the Swiss population feels so lukewarm about Europe, a fact which we will also need to take into consideration.
On a final note, we do not believe that Parliament should have unlimited access to all documents from OLAF.
The nature of OLAF' s work is such that certain aspects must remain confidential and perhaps even secret.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all, I would, of course, like to congratulate Mr BÃ¶sch on his sound and accurate report.
Allow me to comment on the sore points.
First of all, OLAF' s necessary independence.
That means indeed that the OLAF Director will be given full autonomy and far-reaching powers to conduct investigations within all European institutions.
This also means that the Commission will refrain from intervening in appointments in any shape or form.
Can Commissioner Schreyer tell me how the Commission has reacted to Paragraphs 3 to 6?
Second sore point: the European Public Prosecutor.
We know that a change in the Treaty is needed for this.
An attempt which was made, partly on the Commission' s initiative, failed in Nice.
We will therefore need to continue putting pressure on the Member States.
It is true that what we are asking now is not as far-reaching.
Pursuant to Article 82, we want the OLAF regulation to be supplemented with a clause which provides for the appointment of a public prosecutor with powers limited to punishable offences committed by the members and staff of the European Union in respect of the budget.
What are your thoughts on the matter, Commissioner Schreyer?
Third sore point: the cooperation between Member States.
The tobacco case in New York versus Reynolds and Philip Morris is indeed a good illustration of how the European Commission actually acts vis-Ã -vis tobacco giants.
I am delighted that quite a few Member States, including my own country, have offered their support.
In this way, we can finally extricate mafia practices from the world of the tobacco giants, practices which cost the Union many billions of euros every year.
Fourth sore point: the disclosure of information.
I was one of the people who rejected the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
I refuse to go into any further detail and I completely concur with Mr BÃ¶sch' s requirements.
Finally, I regret that this entire House is haunted by a nationalistic and jingoistic ghost which is quick to take offence.
We should be able to spell out in this report what went wrong in Spain in the flax case and in Italy, Belgium and Germany in the case surrounding butter which was tampered with.
Consequently, my group will not be supporting the amendments which play down these matters or disguise them.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgetary Control is presently debating the granting of a discharge to the Commission for 1999.
It is a difficult matter.
The EC Court of Auditors has not seen fit to recommend it.
Parliament will be taking on a huge political responsibility if it grants discharge; before it does so it must have guarantees that fraud will be prevented and its perpetrators discovered.
There is some unfinished business which speaks against granting a discharge.
The Commission knows what it is.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has expressed in detail what it sees as matters of confusion to the Commission.
The most important matter is the FlÃ©chard case, whose political roots extend back to the early 1990s.
Any examination of the case must stretch all the way from the Delors cabinet up until Mr Prodi' s Commission.
There are fake export documents, there is fake butter, minutes of meetings have been lost, payments were ordered but the debts were waived, and cooperation was continued with those who were guilty of fraud.
There are still some matters that are being hushed up.
This will not do. Mr BÃ¶sch is right.
This is the moment of truth for Mr Prodi' s Commission.
Mr President, butter, flax, cigarettes and employment agencies are becoming synonymous with fraud in the European Union.
Millions in European money have been paid out erroneously or, as in the case of cigarette smuggling, have not been collected in revenue.
This is not a matter of fraud within the EU institutions but at Member State level.
Rapporteur BÃ¶sch is right in pointing out that the solving of these serious fraud cases forms OLAF' s test case for efficiency.
I must add that these fraud cases cannot be solved completely without the cooperation of the relevant Member States.
In order to enforce this cooperation, the Commission must put sanctions in place.
I therefore find it completely justified that the Netherlands is not receiving any money from the European Social Fund for the time being, until such time as it can account for the unauthorised spending of those monies down to the last euro.
In fact, what sanctions are prompting Spain to clear up the flax fraud?
Businesses involved in fraud should be blacklisted so that they do not qualify for European subsidy again.
They seem logical measures to take, but not to the Commission.
That is how the company FlÃ©chard is starting to form part of a European soap: to be continued!
OLAF' s efficiency is being threatened by a lack of staff.
If the fight against fraud is one of President Prodi' s key goals, he, along with the Commission, has a duty to solve the delay in the recruitment of qualified staff promptly.
In this connection, the Commission should avoid any conflict of interest.
Commissioners who might be involved in the flax and butter fraud, should not have a say in the appointments of officials who are about to investigate their roles.
As elected representatives of the people, this Parliament has a supervisory task.
It is unfortunate that the Commission is forever putting spanners in the works.
To the Commission, transparency is an opaque word.
Clarity is what this Parliament wants and it should therefore be authorised to examine the OLAF reports.
Mr President, the increasing frequency of fraud offences within the Union and the Commission's behaviour are a scandal.
The financial losses associated with adulterated butter alone could exceed EUR 45 million.
What is more, it is evident that we are dealing with people who are repeating the same offence.
On the Commission's recommendation, one firm, which is now again under suspicion, was let off a EUR 17.6 million fine.
We must therefore, as a matter of urgency, give our full backing to the work of the European Anti-Fraud Office and ensure that it is properly set up as soon as possible.
However, it is also important for the authorities in the Member States to support the work of this new body, but if you look at the reports in detail, you cannot always be sure this is happening.
So sanctions should also be taken against those Member States which are not supporting OLAF's work, in the form of fines imposed by the Commission, which would also provide some financial compensation for fraud offences allowed to occur.
Mr President, this report is all part of the changeover from UCLAF to OLAF. As other speakers have said, we would like the transition to proceed more quickly.
We need an independent OLAF able to operate efficiently.
I must congratulate Herbert BÃ¶sch on his excellent report.
He has certainly made the point, in the text presented to us, that the fight against fraud is not an element in partisan infighting or in the internal politics of Member States. Instead, he made it clear that we are all equally involved in uncovering fraud at its source and calling its instigators to account.
All the parliamentary groups are united in wishing to recover the money and improve administrative checks. We do feel we are making progress in the fight against fraud.
That is our message to the citizens and we must ensure it reaches them. True, the Nice Summit did not produce any response to our request for a European Public Prosecutor.
Such a prosecutor would have been most helpful to us in uncovering this year' s major fraud, which involved the adulteration of butter. Incidentally, that not only concerns defrauding Community coffers.
It is also an indication of how much more we still have to do regarding food safety.
So, what we have before us today is a good report.
I should like to reiterate that we are all determined to combat fraud and recover the money.
I feel we should call on the Commission to let us know what it has in mind in the specific case of the European Prosecutor. Perhaps the opportunity missed at Nice could be retrieved through some specific proposals.
The cooperation of national prosecutors is not enough. Just as it has been shown in some cases that the national authorities know how to coordinate their work, so it is necessary to have someone within the Commission able to take the lead.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that he has carried out.
I would, however, also like to stress the pitfalls that might have been encountered along the way, as Mr BÃ¶sch has had to deal with the vague desires harboured by various members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who wanted to refocus the report on previous cases and Treaties, which are also dealt with in other documents.
In relation to this, I do not share the view of the speakers who say that the FlÃ©chard case is the main case in the discharge.
It probably is if you consider the time and energy that the Commission and ourselves had to spend on it, but it is definitely not in terms of importance.
I shall, however, focus my attention on the problem of fraud and irregularities.
In a previous report, the Committee on Budgetary Control stated that the slightest fraud of the Community budget must no longer be tolerated.
Whilst this call for zero tolerance is extremely laudable, we cannot disregard the fact that putting this into practice requires very significant resources in terms of personnel which is going to be difficult to achieve, given the huge numbers of schemes currently underway, and given the great diversity of the territories in which we have a presence.
In this report, it was proposed to remove the distinction between fraud and irregularities, which would be justified by the fact that, when these are detected, we do not know whether the cases in question are likely to lead to criminal prosecution.
I would like to express my concern about this position, for which I have two reasons.
On the one hand, we must ensure that our fight against fraud does not anticipate the conclusions of inquiries that various bodies are undertaking.
On the other hand, we would be running the risk of discrediting the European Union' s policies within the European Union itself if we announce levels of fraud in criminal cases that are much higher than reality shows them to be.
Quite the contrary, I think that we must make a concerted effort to present the fairest possible picture of these criminal acts, since it is impossible to treat problems related to small administrative mistakes and large scale organised fraud in the same way.
I support what Mr Mulder has just said regarding a classification of irregularities.
In the same spirit, we must focus our work on cases of fraud that require us to become immediately involved in following them up because of their scale and topical interest.
In relation to this, several speakers have mentioned the case of the adulterated butter.
The Commission must be in a position to help us to achieve our aim.
I would say, however, that I regret the attitude of the Commission, which sometimes takes too long to answer or provides unsatisfactory answers to the European Parliament' s requests.
The European Commission and the European Parliament should work together more closely in combating fraud.
This does not mean, however, that the European Parliament has to give up its power to penalise the Commission when it does not fulfil its duties, particularly with regard to protecting the European Union' s financial interests.
This cooperation is needed because it involves our credibility in the eyes of the citizens of Europe who have put their trust in us.
Mr President, the Commission' s report under discussion illustrates how extensively EU resources are divided up.
At the same time, it shows how large a part the Member States play in administering the EU budget, as they use up 80% of all expenditure.
Mr BÃ¶sch has drafted a creditable report and I would like to thank him for it.
The report also shows clearly how important it was to establish OLAF in 1999.
In my opinion, it would be important in the fight against fraud to bear in mind certain principles.
Firstly, let us speak of the principle of legality.
It is vital to comply with the law when using funds and investigating irregularities, and the final outcome should not be anticipated before a legal decision comes into effect.
Administration has to be simplified; there is an end to how much increased bureaucracy and supervision will improve the way funds are spent.
Personal responsibility has to be increased - in this respect, the Commission' s reform has been vital - and cooperation between the European Union and the Member States must be improved: that, too, will be vital in the future.
Mr President, if we create new bodies, then those bodies should be able to function efficiently.
In the EU, the institutions are located in different places and they are also subject to relocation.
That is why it makes sense to locate new institutions in places where they are geographically close to other EU institutions which they will have to cooperate very intensively with in the future.
Now, it seems to me that the European Public Prosecutor's Office will certainly have to cooperate with the European Court of Justice and that it should also have close contacts with the European Court of Auditors.
The same also applies to OLAF, which will have to work in very close cooperation with both the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors.
I therefore believe that these bodies should be located either completely or at least in part in Luxembourg, so as to ensure geographical proximity and also efficiency for these bodies.
, Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
(DE) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr BÃ¶sch on his report - he has done a really excellent job.
And his conclusion that there have not yet been any appreciable improvements in the fight against fraud also coincides with the OLAF Supervisory Committee's view.
Furthermore, the Commission itself says several times in its own report that there were no significant changes in 1999 as compared with previous years, and that the total of unlawfully used funds in fact increased in some areas, for example in the Structural Funds.
Let me emphasise once again that we are talking about taxpayers' money here.
We must do our best to protect it.
If we are to reach the zero-tolerance limit promised by the Commission, OLAF, the European Fraud Investigation Office established in 1999, must first and foremost be given greater independence.
This involves recruiting its staff without interference from the Commission, for example.
I support Mr BÃ¶sch's suggestion that the appointments committee should be chaired by an independent figure.
And the Director himself must set out in advance a clearly structured programme of work.
One thing that is clear is that we do not just want the old UCLAF to continue under the new name of OLAF.
Unfortunately, an opportunity was missed in Nice to strengthen OLAF by creating a European Financial Public Prosecutor's Office and putting it under judicial control.
Despite all Parliament's requests over the years and the commitment demonstrated by Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Schreyer in particular, this subject was not even on the agenda at Nice.
I therefore have some questions for the Commission now, as to whether, in accordance with Paragraphs 9 to 12 of the BÃ¶sch report, it will submit proposals by 1 June 2001 for what we might call a European Public Prosecutor's Office with restricted jurisdiction.
I would also like put this question to the Commission: not all the Member States have yet ratified the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and this is preventing it from entering into force.
Could you please tell us which countries have not yet ratified it and what the Commission can do to remedy this intolerable situation?
Another point: what is the Commission doing to overcome varying national interpretations of Community law on the recovery of own resources, as described in Paragraph 7(1) of its report?
And lastly, there is the recovery of unduly paid funds, for which there are no figures in the Commission's report for 1999.
Can the Commission tell me how much the Commission has claimed back and received as compared with the losses calculated, especially in the case of own resources in the EAGGF and in the Structural Funds?
Mr President, Commissioner, I feel the rapporteur deserves to be congratulated on the report. I believe he has incorporated very positive elements into it and endeavoured to steer a course avoiding both exaggeration and indifference.
In order not to look the other way, I shall focus on one of the matters covered in the report - that of flax - and put some figures to the House.
For instance, according to the figures, in my country, Spain, flax was grown on 3 376 hectares during the 1994-95 season. However, by the 1998-99 season it was already being cultivated on 100 000 hectares.
The initial subsidy in 1994-95 amounted to ESP 411 million, whereas by 1998-99 it had risen to ESP 10 000 million.
After the Spanish authorities reported the fraud, the area used for the cultivation of flax decreased as if by magic. Those 100 000 hectares were reduced to less than 1000.
As a result, the subsidy fell to below ESP 100 million.
Despite all this data, the head of the Ministry of Agriculture at the time maintained it was all part of an opposition campaign.
True, she recently changed her mind and stated that had not been the case, but that essentially the opposition was to blame.
I should like to focus on the type of liability the House might invoke. In the first place, there is penal liability as it applies to individual owners of processing plants.
They were privy to special information - I am not referring to information about the regulations, which was in the public domain, but information on how they could be got round.
These persons had at their disposal the capital required to set up the companies. Most importantly, they were sitting pretty, holding high office in the Ministry of Agriculture.
It is therefore appropriate to invoke strictly penal liability for them and for the producers who also played the game.
Parliament and the relevant institutions should do precisely that.
There is another type of liability: specific political liability. This means establishing whether any of the players directly involved in the fraud had been appointed to public political office by an institution in Spain.
It has to be said that such was indeed the case. One of the highest-ranking officials within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chair of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, was closely connected with flax processing companies.
Lastly, there is also administrative liability.
If this does apply, we should call the Commission and national and local authorities to account. We should not, however, create confusion and adopt the course advocated by Mr BÃ¶sch, insisting that liabilities be itemised in detail.
Mr President, so many words have been spoken in praise of Mr BÃ¶sch that it is hard to know what to say.
I think he knows how highly I rate his work.
I would therefore like to comment on a few points that have been mentioned in the debate.
The first point is that we welcome the fact that the OLAF report on the FlÃ©chard case was submitted last week, something that has not yet been mentioned.
This is a positive point that should be take into account in further discussions.
This report does not establish or seek to establish what the European Parliament's view on this case is.
That is part of the budget discharge process, which will be on our agenda in a month's time.
Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to give the Commission some sound advice.
It would certainly be very helpful for the discussions on the budget discharge if the Commission could reconsider the views it has already expressed on this case, and take advantage, for example, of the opportunity presented to it next week by the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
That could certainly assist the subsequent deliberations in the context of the budget discharge process.
There are also two other points in some way connected with misunderstandings. Mr Mulder mentioned one misunderstanding, and I think Mr SeppÃ€nen's speech was a case in point: there is some confusion between irregularities and fraud.
We must make it clear in this report, on the basis of the amendment tabled by Mr BÃ¶sch himself and supplemented by Mr Mulder's amendment, that we do not want to see these categories being muddled up.
I would like to clarify this in the light of one particular example: Mr SeppÃ€nen's speech.
In it, he literally referred to the FlÃ©chard case as an irregularity, and then connected it with the Court of Auditors' failure to give a positive statement of assurance concerning the Commission's budget management.
If we do this we are mixing things up and run the risk of giving our visitors in the public gallery the impression that even a bookkeeping error would be classified as fraud.
No one can have any political interest in doing that.
We must make sure that these two things are not confused.
The second possible misunderstanding is not a misunderstanding amongst ourselves, but rather a misunderstanding outside this Chamber, regarding the flax affair.
As I understand it, the decision-making process in one Member State was described by the Committee on Budgetary Control as if responsibility had been shifted from national to regional level.
On behalf of my group I would like to say that regardless of the internal organisation of the individual Member States, we want to ensure that responsibility towards the European Union at national level for the correct implementation of EU programmes is respected.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank Mr BÃ¶sch for his report.
It takes as its starting point the Commission's Annual Report on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud, which the Commission presented on 13 November 2000 and which also contains statistics on cases of irregularities and fraud reported by the Member States, as they are obliged to do.
A few months earlier, the Commission had presented an extensive strategy report in which it set out an approach to fraud prevention at a wide variety of levels and which contained a wide variety of instruments ranging from checks on legislation, in order to make it less susceptible to fraud, to a proposal for a European Public Prosecutor which the Commission put forward in Nice and which was unfortunately not accepted by the Heads of State and Government at that stage.
In that report, the Commission also set out the overall and central role played by the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, and I would first like to address the points made by honourable Members during the debate and also in Mr BÃ¶sch's report as regards OLAF.
In 1999 the Council and Parliament created the legal basis for OLAF, and that is, of course, also the basis for action by the Commission on this.
In accordance with this legal basis, OLAF was set up as an office which administratively speaking is part of the Commission, that is to say OLAF's staff are Commission officials and are subject to its statute.
This also means that if, for example, problems or irregularities arise regarding the behaviour of Commission officials within OLAF, the Commission would be held responsible.
In view of this, the Commission has said that, exactly as with the other institutions or other departments of the Commission, it wishes a transparent procedure to be in place for appointing those in senior management positions in OLAF.
This means that an Advisory Committee first scrutinises the applications and then makes recommendations to those making the final decision.
In the case of OLAF, the Director makes the final decision on the recruitment and appointment of staff.
The Advisory Committee is constituted so that members not directly linked to the Commission and those from OLAF itself are in a clear majority.
The Court of Auditors, the European Court of Justice and the Supervisory Committee are represented on the Advisory Committee, and I believe that the solution we have now found is a very good one.
I would like to remind you once again that this solution is in the interest of transparency in the appointment of senior management, but that the Director or Director-General of OLAF has the final say on appointments.
I hope that a solution will very soon be found as regards further recruitment at OLAF, as I can only repeat that it is certainly not only in my own interest but also in the interest of the Commission as a whole for OLAF to fill all the posts that have actually been agreed as quickly as possible.
I think it would also be in the interest of the various parties concerned if they could enter into a dialogue, as the Supervisory Committee has now set further conditions so that the rectifying budget can finally be brought in and this issue resolved.
I would like to briefly cover one point that you touched on in the report and which has also been raised here several times, namely access to OLAF's reports.
The legal basis for the establishment of OLAF clearly provides that it is the Director or Director-General of OLAF who makes decisions about reports and not the Commission.
Furthermore, the legal basis also stipulates that OLAF must, of course, take account of data protection, professional secrecy and also the investigation procedures, and this is clearly a key point.
The Commission accordingly has some doubts as to whether the demands made in the report can be reconciled with the legal basis.
Of course, it is also a matter for debate within the European Parliament whether, for example, if OLAF carries out an investigation within Parliament, this report should be transmitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control, to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, or to the President.
As I see it, this touches on questions affecting all the institutions and I think that this should really be debated and discussed in an appropriate interinstitutional forum such as the trialogue.
As regards OLAF's fitness for purpose, or rather the work done and successes chalked up so far, I would say that uncovering the fraud that we now refer to as the butter case, that is the butter adulteration affair, is one of OLAF's success stories.
This discovery was partly possible because OLAF was able to make its information available to the Member States carrying out investigations, and accordingly, at least as OLAF understands it, this helped to ensure that those involved were investigated in a relatively short time.
But the issue of when OLAF can report depends on when OLAF receives authorisation from the Member States, who have the prime responsibility for investigation, to make a report.
I say this because all OLAF's work is dependent on close and successful cooperation with the Member States.
This is crucial for strengthening OLAF overall, and in particular as regards making it a platform for information exchange.
As regards the FlÃ©chard case dating back to 1991 or 1994, the Commission will also explain its position to the Committee on Budgetary Control and it will, of course, respond in reasonable time to the questionnaire that has been drawn up.
With reference to the butter case, I would like to say once again that it is the subject of legal investigations being carried out by the various Member States affected.
On the Stockholm affair, which you also mention in your report, I can tell you that this is also before the courts.
I very much hope, and, of course, this is in the Commission's interest as well, that the Swedish courts will very soon come to a conclusion.
Concerning the issue of a European Public Prosecutor with limited jurisdiction, as opposed to the full concept, our investigations indicate - and this is also OLAF's legal view - that there is no legal basis for this, and that a treaty amendment would be needed to achieve this also.
You also mentioned the subject of what I might call legal supervision of the work of OLAF itself.
This question is certainly still open.
The Director-General of OLAF has undertaken to make a manual available very shortly so as to make it transparent what rules OLAF follows when it makes a decision about carrying out or closing an investigation.
I would also like to point out that since the last debate here the Commission has brought an action against two tobacco companies regarding alleged involvement in international smuggling, an issue that has been mentioned here.
I am, of course, pleased that you support this in your report, Mr BÃ¶sch.
The Commission has also introduced a more effective early warning system within its bookkeeping procedures, so as to alert the various administrative offices as quickly as possible if, for instance, there are plans to enter into a contract with a party already known for irregularities.
With regard to Mrs Theato's question about the signing of the Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the European Community, some Member States have still to sign it.
I can name three Member States that have not yet ratified the Convention, namely Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, for example.
However, not all the other Member States have ratified it either.
For that reason, and we have already had occasion to discuss this in this Chamber - the Commission will now be being bringing forward a proposal for a directive designed to transfer the provisions of this Convention into a directive, so as to put greater pressure on the Member States to incorporate in their national law a uniform definition of the offence of fraud against the interests of the European Communities.
I hope that will happen in April.
The Commission is working with OLAF on a Green Paper concerning the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, because we do not intend to give that idea up and will now be seizing the opportunity for a more open and wide-ranging debate.
Our objective is quite clear, and that is that when the Treaties are revised again in 2004, we hope to have such broad-based support that the Heads of State and Government will no longer be able simply to ignore this proposal.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Public access to environmental information
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0074/2001) by Mrs Korhola, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on public access to environmental information [COM(2000) 402 - C5-0352/2000 - 2000/0169(COD)].
Mr President, it is the custom to start with thanks and I, as rapporteur, have every reason to do that now.
The directive on public access to environmental information was already an excellent and ambitious proposal when it left the hands of the Commission.
Along the way we have enjoyed excellent cooperation, and it has been easy for us to understand each other' s objectives.
Furthermore, the representatives of the Council - I refer to both those of France and Sweden - have been encouraging and well-informed about the matter.
I am also grateful for the attitude adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I was delighted that all twenty-five of my amendments were adopted by the committee; moreover, there were some important additions contributed by committee members.
This is a report which is significant, not just for the individual citizen, but also for the Community' s environmental policy.
Access to information is an important horizontal instrument in EU environmental policy, and the revision of the directive has taken a long time.
The proposal for the directive has three principal aims: to benefit from the experience gained under the old directive dating from 1990 and to correct the shortcomings identified in it, to incorporate the relevant parts of the Aarhus Convention into the new directive, and to adapt the old directive to developments in information technology.
I think that one of the most important factors in my own report is first the obligation to establish registers.
It is a precondition of the viability of this directive.
A member of the public must be able to know what documents are available and what authorities are responsible for what.
I noted with satisfaction that Mr Cashman, in his own report on transparency, calls for exactly the same thing.
I also focused on some details relating to the refusal to disclose information.
If the request for information is denied on the grounds that it is incomplete the applicant must nevertheless be told when the information will be available and which authority is responsible.
Another clarification regarding the refusal to disclose information concerns the exceptions in Article 4(2).
An exception to these exceptions is emissions in connection with commercial and industrial confidentiality, which always have to be disclosed.
I tabled an amendment that recommended the disclosure of information on emissions even when there was some other kind of data protection involved.
The adverse effects of emissions do not depend on the nature of the work that produced them; from the point of view of public health and safety, it makes no difference whether the source is a public or commercial one.
I deemed it necessary to introduce a whole new article on the quality of environmental information.
Quality is obviously a major factor when assessing the significance of the directive.
In my study of the directive it hit me that no comprehensive harmonisation of emission measurement procedures had been called for in this connection.
It does actually make a difference whether we measure emissions from a pipe or in a butterfly net a kilometre away.
In other words, there must be information given on the methods used in taking measurements.
One awkward question in this directive concerned the definition of an authority: do the rules apply to the authorities in the conventional sense or do they also include a body that has been delegated to carry out an official task, such as a company which maintains possession of information legally entrusted to it by virtue of an agreement it has made with an authority?
We have now found a format that, hopefully, will be appropriate for most Member States.
There has been a good deal of consensus regarding this directive.
When I have rejected amendments, I have done so mainly because of considerations of style.
This is a framework directive, and its purpose is not to wish the world all that is fine and good about transparency.
As a legislative text is may also be more effective if it remains narrow in scope.
Some members of the committee wanted to tighten up the time limits set for the authorities to respond.
The Commission' s proposal shortens the time limit to a month and, if the volume and complexity of the information required so demands, two months.
In all cases, however, a reply is required as soon as possible.
I still consider this to be a realistic objective, although, in some cases, shortening the time limit might even have a negative effect on the quality of the response.
I do not therefore support the committee' s proposals for a more stringent attitude.
Viewed generally, we can imagine this directive will set a standard for Member States regarding the transparency of environmental information.
The amendment I tabled in Article 8(2) is based on the notion that the same standard should also apply to the EU institutions.
In this way, this directive will positively promote transparency throughout the EU.
Mr President, one major contribution which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights made to this report is the emphasis on access to environmental information as a right, not a concession.
We also contributed the clause which says that the standards for Member States should also apply to the EU institutions.
The contribution from my committee on practical arrangements incorporated in the final report includes a number of amendments which I am glad were taken up by the Environment Committee.
I am talking for instance about the inclusion of nuclear fuel and energy and of financial as well as economic analyses, the establishment of accessible registers or lists of available information, the idea that the applicant cannot be charged more than a reasonable cost, which is the actual cost price of collecting the information, and the insistence that there must be a harm test for exceptions, i.e. harm must outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
But as far as the scope of the proposal is concerned, I am rather disappointed, if not surprised, at the suggestion that the UK Government, British Labour and Conservative Members sought to exclude private companies whose activities affect the environment.
This is the kind of loophole that allowed the previous Conservative government to exempt the privatised water companies.
Those amendments failed but I am concerned that the amendment which did go through on Article 2(2)(c) might limit the scope too much.
One of the purposes of the new proposal was to close up these previous loopholes which allowed privatised utilities to escape the obligation.
The Commission text clearly covered privatised utilities.
Does the Commissioner think the amendments on Article 2(2)(c) that were adopted by the Environment Committee ensure that privatised companies which supply gas, electricity, water and so on will still be under the obligation to supply this information?
Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I feel that not only does Mrs Korhola deserve to be congratulated on her excellent work, but we should also be promoting something more fundamental than the mere fact of environmental information.
I believe that what we are debating is a far-reaching study. This is because it affects citizens' law and the development of European citizens' rights, over and above States, regions and any other party with an interest in wielding power.
Exercising power by controlling information is as old as the hills. We must therefore ensure that control of information is not taken over by those in power and that the citizens have the right to be informed.
Secondly, I believe that where the environment is concerned, one of the main problems stems from the fact that as a consequence of the principle of subsidiarity environmental protection is solely in the hands of the citizens.
The citizens need to be informed and the Commission must make a particular point of doing so in areas where subsidiarity applies. That will enable the citizens to defend their own rights and insist that their governments take the necessary action.
The Commission must therefore make a great effort to obtain the relevant information for areas where subsidiarity applies. It must also strive to lay down the ground rules for information and insist that all countries be obliged to provide information at both State and regional level, regardless of how they conduct their policy.
Recent disasters are making it clear that the citizen increasingly has the right to manage the risks he is exposed to. He is also entitled to express his views, and request and demand commitments to safeguard his own interests in areas such as health.
Consequently, in the interests of proper application of the principle of subsidiarity and its implementation we should not place power out of the citizens' reach. Information is every citizen' s right.
He needs to fully understand the relevant system, including any weaknesses. He will then be in a position to support it, make decisions pertaining to its finance and many other things.
Mr President, Commissioner, information is a basic principle of democracy.
Free access to and the dissemination of transparent environmental information are the basic right of every citizen who cares about the quality of the environment in which he or she lives and works.
The accessibility of the environmental data held by the authorities is crucial to raising public awareness and securing the trust and democratic involvement of our citizens.
Numerous shortcomings were identified during the application of Directive 90/313 and it therefore needs to be revised.
In the light of the signature of the Aarhus Convention and progress in information technology, the Commission has submitted a new proposal for a directive which covers most of the aforementioned points.
However, amendments have been proposed which seek to extend the Commission proposal even further. For example, the definition of public authorities must include agencies and legal persons acting on behalf of the public authorities.
The directive relates to environmental information and must include information in all accessible forms, such as written, visual, aural etc.
Any person or organisation may request environmental information without needing to prove a legitimate interest.
As regards the deadline by which the administration must respond to a request for environmental information, I think that a period of two weeks is long enough, so as to ensure that interested parties can use the information before it is out of date.
I think it is very important that there should be no commitment as regards the provision of information and no exceptions in relation to particularly important issues, such as gas emissions, discharges, dumping and other releases into the environment.
It is also essential, every time the public authorities refuse to disclose information, irrespective of whether or not this is based on an exception, that they give adequate reasons for their refusal.
The directive stipulates that the public authorities may make a charge for supplying information.
I think that this charge should be limited to the actual cost of reproducing the information, so as to facilitate the greatest possible public access to the information.
Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola on her comprehensive report which will, I think, represent an important step towards active public involvement in dealing with environmental problems.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Korhola has done a very good job.
The Commission produced a good proposal, and it has been improved since the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy went through it.
I hope that it will be improved still further following the vote in Parliament.
Clearly, our present and future environmental problems must be solved at all levels.
Some issues are European and some are national but, to be honest, the vast majority will be local.
It is only democratic that our citizens should be able to exercise influence, and it goes without saying that they should be entitled to all the information they need in order to perform their civic duties in society.
That is why we should like to see Amendments 6, 16 and 30 adopted by Parliament tomorrow.
These amendments set a limit of two weeks, and in difficult cases of four weeks, within which authorities and companies are to answer questions.
This corresponds to Parliament' s position in what is known as the Cashman report on public access to documents in the European Union.
It is also important that Amendments 19 and 20 should go through, stating that authorities are responsible for helping the individual citizen or organisation to obtain information.
Quite simply, they must be given help in asking the right questions in the right places, both orally and in writing, and in finding answers to these. That is a service which authorities should obviously be required to provide in a democratic country.
Mr President, I wish to join with the others in thanking the rapporteur in connection with this debate.
I can say that we have here a model example of a committee really seeing its work through to the end and bringing to Parliament a virtually unanimous decision on a proposal in which differences of opinion, such as there are in this case, have been limited to a minimum.
I would like to point out that we are actually talking about a very important review of the subject, which the Aarhus Convention set in motion.
The rapporteur has now drafted a report that concerns the implementation of the first task of this Convention, which relates to the right of the public to have access to environmental information.
The following tasks are then the right of the public to participate in decision-making and the right of the public to acquire rights in situations in which they are being treated inappropriately.
It should be emphasised that this is not a matter of our wanting the authorities to show good will to our citizens, but that this is a question of an inalienable fundamental right, and our citizens must be able to exercise that right without being asked to justify why they want the information concerned.
I myself was closely involved in the preparation of Mr Cashman' s report, and when I was familiarising myself with Mrs Korhola' s report I was wondering whether Mr Cashman' s report should not have a paragraph added to it stating that environmental and health-related information cannot be kept confidential even when it is classified as a trade secret.
It may be that a lot of environmental and health-related information will be withheld from the public if such a line is not drawn.
Mr President, I too must join in the chorus of congratulations and say, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, that we support the report and think that a good proposal has been made better.
To be entitled to access information on environmental issues is not only a right but also an issue of power.
Where many environmental issues are concerned, the public' s interest in a good environment is often pitted against strong private financial interests.
The right to information is basic to the ability to shape opinion and influence policy.
That is why it is also a matter of democracy that people should be able to acquire insight into environmental issues in good time.
The proposal we are now discussing is largely based upon the Aarhus Convention, which we consider to be an unusually positive and far-sighted example of international cooperation in this area.
The legislation we are now discussing does not cover the institutions of the EU, but these will be referred to in a later proposal.
In view of the negotiations concerning public access to documents - in accordance with Article 255 - it unfortunately looks as though the result of these negotiations may be significantly worse than what was established in the Aarhus Convention where the environment is concerned, and such a result would in actual fact be quite unacceptable.
When it comes to future regulations, it is also important that other institutions, too, should be fully covered by the Aarhus Convention, for example the European Investment Bank whose activities have quite a big effect upon the environment in different ways.
Mr President, it is good that we have so many environmental reports here today.
Indeed, what I have to say on the Korhola report is linked to the Oomen-Ruijten and the Myller report and it is very timely indeed that this debate is taking place, especially when we are marking the tenth anniversary of the Earth Summit which was held in Rio in 1992.
I use the words 'marking' very carefully because I do not think we can celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first Earth Summit.
The fact that the United States and the European Union could not recently come to an agreement on the permitted level of future gas emissions is certainly an unwelcome development.
I hope that the US and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of greenhouse gases.
The fact of the matter is that the greater the reduction of greenhouse gases, the greater the effect it has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities, not only in Europe but world-wide.
I am fully aware of the preparation of the European Union for the world summit on sustainable development which is being held in South Africa in the year 2002 and I support the four lines of action which have been drawn up by the European Commission in preparation for this world summit. The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of the economic development, to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency, promote sustainable use of water, land and energy as well as try to ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation is broken and this is best achieved under the framework of the United Nations.

Ten years after Rio, expectations have not been met.
The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world.
We ought to redouble all our efforts so as to be sure that next year's world summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a manner which protects existing communities.
The Community Fifth Environmental Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution.
Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environmental Action Programme would not be attained easily, the Commission has rightly decided on a step-by-step approach setting out its so-called interim environmental targets for the year 2010.
The Environmental Committee will continue to play an important coordinating role in this regard and I would congratulate the rapporteur on the report.
Mr President, recommending transparency and improving public access to environmental information are aims that have my full support.
The report by Mrs Korhola, however, contains several pitfalls for everyone to clearly see.
I particularly regret the fact that it is not more ambitious.
I equally regret that this text only addresses the public' s access to documents and not the access of Members as well, who carry out work as part of their mandate.
As evidence of this, I would like to give an enlightening example, which I myself experienced.
In February 2000, I had the impertinence to request the annual publication of the scientific, technical and financial balance sheet of the Life programme, which receives a package of EUR 613 million.
In August 2000, when I still had not received anything, I contacted the Director-General for the Environment and the Secretary-General of the European Commission to find out some information on the Life programme - which saved Lake Grandlieu by the way - which appears to be stamped with the words 'official secret' .
To my absolute astonishment, they sent me just a few trivial pieces of information, telling me that the project' s detailed summary of expenditure contained personal details, which meant that I could not see it.
I would like to know how communicating the purchase price of plots of land bought exclusively with public money constitutes a violation of an individual' s private life, rather than the legitimate monitoring of public funds that any self-respecting Member should be undertaking?
It is also impossible to have access to the scientific studies carried out under the much-vaunted Life programme, for the simple reason that the Commission does not have them in its possession, which is the last straw.
The Commission suggests that I contact the author of the document directly, who is in no way obliged to help me, and who, moreover, has not done so, which is hardly surprising, since the programme revealed a genuine ecological disaster.
It is in order to avoid this kind of abuse that we shall vote in favour of this text which is a step in the right direction. However, how can we ever expect to achieve any sort of transparency in the use of Community funds?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Korhola and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the improvements they have proposed to the text presented to us.
And I would also like to congratulate them on having accepted the majority of contributions that we approved in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose draftsperson was Baroness Ludford.
Parliament has, quite rightly, been in the vanguard of the movement to create greater openness and transparency in the activities of public authorities, including access to documents.
Access to environmental information should be regarded as one of the essential pillars of an effective environmental policy, because it helps to make the public more aware of environmental issues, thus improving environmental protection and the quality of the environment. It does this by facilitating more effective checks on whether Community environmental legislation is being fully and properly implemented, and, lastly, because it allows the public to play a greater part in environmental decision-making likely to affect their own lives.
This proposal for a directive is intended to replace the 1990 directive. In doing so, the most important objective is to adapt the directive to developments in information technology, thus creating a second-generation directive that reflects changes in the way information is now generated in our society.
By way of conclusion, I would like to emphasise two aspects: the first is the issue of the deadlines within which public authorities are obliged to provide information requested. This has to be done as quickly as possible and at the latest within one month.
The second issue is the fact that we have limited the scope for exceptions. Whilst it may be acceptable, in order to protect legitimate interests, for there to be arrangements exempting certain information from the disclosure requirements, it is nevertheless fundamentally important for these exceptions to be rigorously defined and strictly interpreted so as not to undermine the general principle of access so that the directive can indeed fulfil its objective.
Mr President, I agree with the views expressed by my colleague Jonas SjÃ¶stedt.
However, I should like to speak in support of Mrs Korhola' s report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. In particular, I shall speak from the point of view of the Committee on Petitions, and concerning the citizens' role in the observance of Community law.
I sit on the Committee on Petitions, and I have to say that 40% of the petitions originate from citizens and non-governmental organisations ensuring compliance with Community environmental law. They would be unable to operate if they did not receive the necessary information within the set time periods.
In our experience, the difficulties many petitioners encounter with regard to these petitions are twofold. Not only do they experience difficulty in understanding Community law - which is often complex and difficult to grasp - but they also have difficulty in obtaining from local, regional and national administrations sufficient information to enable them to submit their petitions to the Committee on Petitions in the approved manner.
The same applies to complaints to the European Commission, as the Commissioner is well aware.
It is therefore essential that this directive be adopted and transposed into the Member States' own law as quickly as possible. One of the difficulties experienced by the earlier Directive 90/313/CEE was precisely the delay in transposing it into the Member States' own legal systems and the unsatisfactory manner in which it was implemented during all those years.
This latest revision of the directive is certainly intended to bring us into line with the Aarhus Convention, whilst also taking account of the study of the outcome of the unsatisfactory implementation of Directive 90/313/CEE.
Mr President, the overall aim in amending Directive 90/313/EEC on access to information on the environment is to enable the Community and Member States to comply with certain provisions of the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation and decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.
In Ireland, we have already incorporated the general provisions including, of course, the original Directive 90/313/EEC, in our national regulations and our freedom of information legislation.
I should like to raise a few points with which we might have difficulty.
In general I agree with the provisions of Amendment No 15, relating to Article 2(2) and the definition of 'public authority'.
I have no substantive problems with that amendment, but I am concerned that some parties might attempt to revert to the original proposal from the Commission on 2(2)(c), which refers to "the operation of services of general economic interest which affect or are likely to affect ...".
If this were to be agreed - if, in other words, we revert to the original Commission position - it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to transpose into national regulations.
It would probably result in bodies which are not public authorities being brought in to have a level playing field, competitively speaking.
In Ireland, for example, Telecom Ãireann, which is now eircom, would be included as a former public authority.
We would then have to bring in private-sector telecoms and other telecom operations.
This does not fit in with the interpretation of Aarhus, so it could present problems.
The time limit proposed in Amendment No 16 on Article 3(2)(a) is unreasonable.
As this directive applies to all documents in the environment area, in many cases the files might be in storage off-site and perhaps not computerised.
The Commission proposal to deliver "as soon as possible or, at the latest, within one month" is reasonable.
It is a 50% reduction on the current position and is in line with existing Irish freedom of information provisions.
Finally, I have problems with Amendment No 24.
There must be discretion on the provision for charges, subject, of course, to publication and including time for searches, particularly when there are repeated requests for information.
