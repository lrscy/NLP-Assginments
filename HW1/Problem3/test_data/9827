However, if we realise that two thirds of Gabon's GNP originates from oil revenues, this means that the fishing industry is indeed an important industry for the country.
Interestingly, only 70% of the catch capacity was used between 1998 and 2001.
The Commissioner might be able to account for this.
It is also striking that, with regard to coastal fishing in the true sense of the word, in other words, fishing within the 12-mile zone, only the capacity of ships has been laid down in the agreement, and not the tonnage quota.
This is remarkable because, in the EU's internal policy, we always talk about actual catch quotas and not about the capacity of the ships.
Perhaps the Commissioner can also indicate that the extension of the agreement from a 6 to a 12-mile zone has no implications for Gabonese coastal fishing.
At the moment, it is insufficiently clear what the actual costs and benefits of the agreement with Gabon will be, also for European fishermen.
Although the European Commission tries hard to describe the previous agreement in its evaluation report, information about the cost-benefit ratio, the state of the fish stocks and the impact of the agreements on the regions in the EU merit further elucidation, in my view.
Mr President, I have already indicated that I congratulate the Commissioner on this agreement and that fisheries agreements are of paramount importance to a number of coastal regions in the European Union.
In that sense, this agreement buttresses the economy in those regions and also gives a structural impulse to the European fisheries industry, which is already under strain.
This does not detract from the fact - and we cannot turn a blind eye to this - that these agreements meet with increasing criticism, inter alia from the World Wildlife Fund and other non-governmental organisations.
In future discussions about fisheries agreements, we must underline more emphatically the importance of the social support base of these agreements, both in Africa and in Europe.
It would be good if the Commission too were to stress that these agreements definitely boost development cooperation with a large number of African countries, for this has not yet struck home where many people are concerned.
With regard to the report itself, I have indicated in a number of recommendations the points that require extra attention.
Among the aspects to which I request that more attention be given are control measures, since the Gabonese Government is not sufficiently able to carry out the control tasks adequately, and information about how the money is actually spent and to what extent the coastal regions are actually strengthened.
Regarding the implementation of this agreement, I would appreciate it if the evaluation of development measures were to be submitted to the Council and the European Parliament every two years.
The amendments as adopted by the Committee on Fisheries receive my unqualified support.
In fruitful cooperation with my own coordinator, Mr Farela, I have once again explained our true intentions in Amendment No 2.
For that reason, I much prefer this amendment to Amendment No 9 tabled by the Liberal Group.
This means that I would warmly recommend Amendment No 2, while I consider Amendment No 9 by the Liberal Group to be redundant.
I should also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation for the report and the information, and I would thank them for their input, since this too contributes to a broader support base for agreements of this kind.
Mr President, some schemes, which are perhaps the product of the intellectual laziness of their authors, seek to present a picture of a Community fleet that preys on the resources of developing countries.
Today's report could serve to cast doubt upon this stereotype, because Gabon is a country with enormous resources, mainly oil, which is extracted by Western oil companies, and has a very similar per capita income to Poland's, as well as an enviable annual inflation rate of 2%.
It goes without saying that the Community boats of four Member States, which will be fishing under this agreement, will of course do so in compliance with the principles of responsible fishing and under the strict conditions imposed by the CFP.
Many of us, however, are bound to wonder, as we do with regard to other agreements, whether this is a fisheries agreement or a development cooperation programme financed from the CFP, since, out of the total sum, 70% is earmarked for activities designed to develop the local fishing sector.
This is why we are asking the Commission to direct some of this money to support measures to control and preserve stocks.
Mr Maat, the Socialist Group will be voting against Amendment No 2 and I hope the Commission will do the same, because the fees that should be paid by shipowners whose boats fish under this agreement cannot be different to those paid under other agreements unless we take Greenland as an example, where the shipowners pay not a penny of fees.
I wish to conclude by saying that those who are attempting to prevent Gabon from being able, like any other country, to sell part of its fishing rights at more than three times its market value are doing it no favours.
By the same token, they should be against Gabon exporting its oil and its minerals to places such as the Netherlands, the United States, China or France, for example.
Mr President, my views on third-country fishing agreements are well known but once again I wish to record my disgust at the fact that the European Union is entering into agreements which, despite the honeyed words, are nothing short of economic imperialism.
What is particularly striking today is the sheer impotence of this Parliament, together with the contempt with which it is treated by the Council and the Commission.
Today we are being consulted on an agreement which came into force in December 2001 - nearly three months ago.
If this House had any dignity whatsoever it would protest against such cavalier treatment, but of course it is mute.
This supposed watchdog has been very effectively muzzled.
But even if the whole House rose up and voted to censure this proposal, it would not make a blind bit of difference.
As ever, to its eternal shame, the Committee on Fisheries approved this agreement.
But even if it had objected to it unanimously, once again that would not have made any difference whatsoever.
So as we move to a vote I am sure that this House will do what it always does and rubber-stamp the decision already made by the committee.
As a democratic institution one has to say that it is nothing more than a sham.
But my question, Mr Fischler, is how many hundreds more black Africans need to be killed by European Union boats before you start listening?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Maat for his report and for backing the Commission proposal.
This is a new protocol, in which we have been able to use the excellent results from the previous agreement to increase fishing opportunities for tuna to 10 500 tonnes per annum.
There is now a new segment with fishing opportunities for shrimps and cephalopods, in return for which Gabon will receive financial compensation of EUR 1.2 million a year, a good 70% of which will be used to develop local fisheries in Gabon, that is, as development aid.
We have also made several changes to the technical measures, in order to help guarantee the sustainable use of fish resources.
They include, for example, a system of catch declarations and observers' reports.
Now to the individual proposed amendments.
As far as Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 5 are concerned, we agree materially.
We already meet these requirements under the current interinstitutional agreements, especially the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 5 July 2000, which is why these proposed amendments are redundant.
The Commission must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9.
Joint financing of catch opportunities negotiated is a fundamental aspect of Community foreign fisheries policy.
What happens with agreements with third countries is that the financial compensation comes out of the Community budget and the shipowners pay the licences.
I should like to say, with respect to Amendments Nos 3 and 7, that the Commission obviously considers the sustainability of fisheries and the needs of local fisheries when it negotiates fisheries protocols.
I therefore have nothing against these proposed amendments but I think that they are self-evident and do not therefore necessarily warrant separate mention.
As far as Amendment No 8 is concerned, fish stocks are evaluated before any protocol is renewed and both contracting parties can demand that the joint committee be convened at any given time in order to adjust the current protocol if problems with fish stocks should arise.
I therefore feel that Amendments Nos 3, 7 and 8 are unnecessary.
I cannot accept Amendment No 6.
According to standard practice, no new mandate is required for periodic protocols renewing fisheries agreements.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.56 a.m. and resumed at 12.02 p.m.)
Mr President, this so-called compromise amendment was submitted to us late last night and then despatched this morning, initially - and inadvertently - with our name.
That was then revised.
I think it is wrong to vote on such a technical text at such short notice, which is why I have serious reservations about voting on it now.
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, it has to be the House which decides whether to vote on this compromise amendment or not.
(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 59
Mr President, I have the same misgivings as before.
We cannot agree to vote on it, hence our request that you put it to the House.
Does the House agree to put this compromise amendment to the vote?
(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 52
I have a question, Mr President.
When did the 'honourable' Member receive this compromise amendment?
All the compromise amendments were proposed in one go and given to Mr Radwan at the same time.
At 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon, he decided to take the first and ninth amendments - you will see in your documents that their numbers have changed - and as for the others, Mr Radwan refused them.
His two previous comments were made purely and simply in order to manipulate the House.
Nevertheless, the House has the right to express itself pursuant to the Rules of Procedure.
(Parliament adopted the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 44
Mr President, the original proposed amendment increases the thresholds from 10% to 25%.
Having consulted the Commission and the Council and the other groups, we have agreed to reduce this to 20%.
I trust that this will not be interpreted as manipulation on my part and that there will be a broad consensus.
Mr President, Mr Radwan's oral amendment is incorporated in the compromise amendment AC55 which, in my view, should be voted on before Amendment No 44 as it includes the following amendments.
Therefore, since the usual order is that we firstly vote on the amendments that deviate the most from the committee's report, I would propose that we now vote on AC55, which includes Mr Radwan's oral amendment, as per the discussion we had yesterday at 5 p.m., and which also includes Amendments Nos 44 and 33.
The House accepts the rapporteur's position.
(Parliament agreed to table the oral amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 46
Mr President, here too the increase is from 10 to 20%, not 10 to 25%.
The same applies to the next oral amendment.
Mr President, we have exactly the same problem.
The oral amendment is part of compromise amendment AC53.
AC53 contains aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32.
The adoption of Mr Radwan's oral amendment, which I approve, does not in any way imply that we are rejecting those aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32.
I therefore support the proposal - a logical one at that - for the compromise amendment, which includes all the proposals by various Members, to be voted on first.
I think it is totally unacceptable that, in the previous vote, the amendment of one of the points rendered other points null and void which had nothing to do with what was a global compromise amendment, whose aim was to make the House vote on this relatively technical problem as quickly as possible.
Therefore, if we do not agree to start with the compromise amendment, we will first have to vote on Mr Radwan's amendment, then Amendments Nos 46 and 32, which have not lapsed in spite of Mr Radwan's amendment.
Mr Radwan, if the oral amendment is adopted, I believe that Amendments Nos AC53 and 32 will no longer be valid.
However, I call upon the House to decide whether to agree to your request.
(Parliament agreed to table the oral amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 54
Mr President, I am dreadfully sorry, but I did not invent the procedure.
The proposed amendment arrived very late last night.
Just so that Mr Cohn-Bendit also understands: the two which were accepted were relatively straightforward.
The others, as the rapporteur himself explained, are very complicated amendments which run through the entire text and I would be more than happy to explain them to you in detail if you cannot follow them.
In any event, we are opposed.
Once again, I call upon the House to decide whether to put the compromise amendment to the vote.
(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 48
Mr President, this again is the increase from 10% to 20%, not 25%.
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, the increase from 10 to 20% is a thoroughly complicated issue which cannot be tabled just before we are about to vote. I think, however, that the compromise amendment submitted to Mr Radwan at 5 p.m., which he approved without hesitation, should certainly be taken before Amendment No 48.
I could play the imbecile and say that since Mr Radwan is using tactics that discredit the House, I shall call upon my friends to join forces to reject his oral amendment.
As for myself, in the interests of the stability of the financial markets in Europe, I think his amendment is fine.
Therefore, I approve it and I ask you to agree to vote on it, and then to adopt it.
But I would point out to you that Mr Radwan's thoroughly devious tactics have also caused amendments approved by the Council and the Commission, as well as many Members, to lapse and I think that devious tactics of this type are a discredit to Parliament.
Mr President, the shadow rapporteurs have reached a new compromise on this point and I should therefore like to withdraw Amendment No 76 on behalf of the Greens.
We accept this compromise.
Mr President, it seems that there is some confusion.
Mr Mann, of the Group of the European People's Party and I tabled compromise Amendment No 79, which was to be voted on in three parts.
The first part was adopted, but I do not think that we have yet adopted the second part, since you proceeded to the vote on Amendment No 22 by the committee which should, in principle, be contained in the amended Amendment No 79.
And then we have the third part of compromise amendment No 79: Article 1(2). I was going to propose, on behalf of Mr Lehne, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on my own behalf, this oral amendment, which Mrs Echerer also supports.
I think that we must then vote in favour of Article 1(2)(b)c and lastly, on Article 1(2)(b)d.
I am sorry that this is complicated, but life sometimes is complicated.
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?
It seems not.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President, as rapporteur I wish to move an oral amendment.
There is a compromise amendment proposed by the Socialist Group.
It involves an exemption from the need for a prospectus on behalf of the most creditworthy Member States.
We should make it clear that we want this exemption to apply only to debt securities, so that they would not, for example, be able to undertake a privatisation without a prospectus, and therefore insert the word "debt" at the beginning of the compromise on No. 65.
Mr President, this is the first of three documents on European Union initiatives in the field of the movement of money, insurance undertakings and banks.
In particular, this first report lays down more stringent rules for the supervision of the activities of banks and insurance undertakings.
As representative of the Pensioners' Party, I support this document because it is important that those who invest and deposit their money in banks and insurance undertakings have guarantees that their money will be well spent and will yield that fruit which is so important for many citizens, including the less well-off, which category, of course, includes pensioners.
I was therefore very pleased to vote for the motion.
- (NL) It is surprising to read how anxious a green economist is about safeguarding the burgeoning financial services markets against systemic risks.
Following on from the Lisbon Summit in the spring of 2000, which wanted to turn Europe into the world's most competitive economy, Mr Lipietz wants to make the EU the safest haven for financial activities.
This is why he would like legislation which offers the financial markets opportunities to develop.
In his view, it is not the Member States that decide which of the three methods are used for the calculation of the supplementary capital adequacy. Instead, the financial conglomerates can make that choice themselves, provided that they make their decision public.
I find little concern for people and the environment in his vision and too much understanding of the requirements of companies involved in capital management.
However, I am aware that it is preferable to regulate these markets than to leave them to their own devices on a world scale, whereby those with the greatest spirit of adventure are given free rein and the most immoral companies elbow the others out of the market.
I consider his proposal as a first step which will make it easier to draft rules later on in the interests of the financing of public services, the fight against poverty, democratic control and care for the environment.
The proposed directive establishes prudential rules (capital adequacy requirements and supplementary supervision) with regard to financial conglomerates.
We believe the aim is the socialisation of these sectors (credit, insurance and investment) because the purpose of these rules, in our view, stems from a public service approach.
In a rational economy, funding should be granted according to social need for investment, and insurance should be integrated into social funds for investment and social protection.
This directive is a feeble attempt to regulate the financial markets, the chaotic workings of which are now seen to be the cause of financial crises and social catastrophes throughout the world, as the Enron affair has illustrated.
I voted in favour of the directive without any illusions, if only to curb the ambient ultra-liberalism and because we are not in favour of making things worse in order to further our own ends, which would amount to waiting for faults in capitalism to result in a final crisis.
Social campaigning alone will put a stop to the erring ways of an uncontrollable system.
.
Key elements of subsidiarity and effective choice of a proper regulatory body as the final arbiter give cause for concern in this report.
Similarly, the call for statistical information to be made public as a solution to public awareness of what affects markets is impracticable and impossible to achieve.
The subsequent costs to industry also amount to a disproportionate effect.
The directive proposes to reduce some forms of financial crime, and we welcome this fine objective.
We must be wary, however, of being totally naÃ¯ve, first and foremost, because, as the rapporteur points out, 'it would have been better to have had recourse to a Community regulation.
But the Treaty does not allow it'.
The fact that criminal penalties fall within the remit of the Member States leaves the net wide open and encourages, as is the case in fiscal matters, criminal operations spanning several countries.
Furthermore, we do not believe to any degree that capitalism can work in a transparent and equitable fashion.
Capitalist competition is a form of war by all available means, such as pacts, lobbying, organised accounting practices and fudged audits, as current events illustrate.
We do not see money-making institutions taking swift measures to try to monitor their methods.
As for 'insider dealings', we do not see how they could be dissuaded by declarations of intent - even if they are called a directive - when this does not provide for any genuinely restrictive penalty.
In spite of these reservations, I voted in favour of the directive so as not to obstruct the minimal measures therein.
Mr President, as I explained last night, I am not thrilled with the compromise reached in Feira on the taxation of savings income.
I voted in favour of all the amendments in Mr PÃ©rez Royo's report because I authored the greater majority of them.
I am also very grateful to the rapporteur for no longer including these overly radical amendments, as I explained to the House last night.
I also voted in favour of the report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market so that it could be placed on the agenda.
Although I decided nonetheless to vote against the report on this occasion, it was in order to register that I am, in principle, against the fact that, at Feira, we abandoned the co-existence model which would have enabled Member States to choose whether to withhold tax or to exchange information on savings income received.
I also believe that we can no longer have a situation where Member States adopt and publish a directive on this issue before ascertaining whether the same measures will be applied in dependent or associated territories, and before having concluded negotiations with third countries on the application of equivalent measures, on the understanding that withholding tax is not the same as the exchange of information.
Mr President, Mr Fernando PÃ©rez Royo's report is on a proposal for a Council directive to ensure effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community.
Shivers ran down my spine, Mr President, and my hair stood on end when I read the title of this report: effective taxation of savings income.
Of course, it is right to pay taxes and, as this directive says, it is right to inform States that their citizens have come here, for example, and that they must be taxed on the interest on any savings they may have, but should we not decide once and for all not to make people who save pay interest or tax to governments just because they have been saving money?
Saving is a very good thing.
It was with great difficulty that I voted for the report.
. (IT) Taxation on savings has always been a hotly debated issue.
There are some who support a withholding tax, implemented as a tax levied at source which settles the tax position of the person concerned.
The other, which is certainly more up to date, is the information system: in this case people do not settle their own tax liability because it will be subject to a subsequent levy on their income tax return.
From the point of view of fairness, the second method certainly provides the Community with a guarantee that the income, whatever it may be, is taxed in its entirety.
However, this method is only fair if applied by everyone.
As soon as one country decides not to adopt it, for historical or opportunistic reasons, the structure that has been built upon it is blown apart.
All this applies to the PÃ©rez Royo report, which has taken the information method as the basis for taxation on cross-border savings.
For this directive to work effectively, it must be implemented when the third countries adopt it.
Therefore, agreement with the third countries is a sine qua non for this directive to enter into force.
Implementation without an agreement would cause a disturbance in the savings market, the negative effects of which cannot yet be readily assessed.

The liberalisation of movement of capital has been achieved, not only within the EU but also in non-Community financial centres. It is therefore obvious that the introduction of a new tax, as well as a policy for the exchange of information that is limited to the 15 Member States, will have a negative impact on financial transactions.
The introduction of such a tax would give rise to considerable tax evasion.
For these reasons, we believe that it is essential to introduce effective savings income within the Community in the form of interest payments, which is, in other words, also provided in a number of third countries as well as in all the autonomous territories that depend on a Member State.
Therefore, the entry into force of this directive should categorically depend on the conclusion of agreements on the introduction of identical measures in the countries and territories in question.
Since there is much work that has to be done before this last condition is fulfilled, we were unable to give our backing to this proposal for a directive.
- (NL) Banking secrecy makes it appealing to have savings outside one's own country as a means of evading income tax or property tax.
The EU has been unable to solve this cross-border problem for the past 13 years.
All proposals to make the existence of foreign capital visible to national tax offices have, further to opposition, subsequently been withdrawn.
Precisely in this area, each Member State in the Council has the capacity to thwart a regulation.
If a scheme is not put in place in time for the expected accession of ten new Member States in 2004, it will probably not enter into force in the foreseeable future.
For me, this is a reason to approve the compromise whereby Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria can continue to levy tax at source for another seven years while the other Member States adopt a scheme for the cross-border exchange of information.
Despite this, the problem is not completely solved by a long chalk, as long as wealthy people can transfer their capital to a separate legal entity which falls outside the scope of such an exchange of information.
I have noted that a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wish to exempt this latter group, which contravenes the proposal of the rapporteur.
In addition, the condition agreed among the ministers only to apply the scheme if, for example, Switzerland adopts the same scheme can, once again, lead to inertia.
I voted against the adoption of the report by Mr PÃ©rez Royo on the proposal for a Council directive to ensue effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community.
The text of the amended proposal does not mention the agreement reached on this issue at the Feira European Council nor does it mention, more specifically, the following crucial point, which is worded as follows:
'Once sufficient reassurances with regard to the application of the same measures in dependent or associated territories and of equivalent measures in the named countries have been obtained, and on the basis of a report, the Council will decide on the adoption and implementation of the directive no later than 31 December 2002, and do so by unanimity.'
This has become an essential condition for the entry into force of the directive.
.
Whilst the Labour Group supports the "Feira" approach to this matter, it is concerned that amendments in this report voted through undermined the cooperative basis already agreed.
.
Mr President, for too long the EU banking sector has been permitted to operate in a culture of secrecy for fiscal purposes.
Not only does this contradict the EU's aims to have more transparency and openness, but it also creates a situation whereby there is unfair tax competition.
Therefore, I wholeheartedly welcome moves by the Commission to tighten up this situation and combat harmful tax practices once and for all.
However, it is vital, as this report points out, that this directive should apply to dependent territories, such as the Channel Islands.
If these were to be excluded, the entire directive would be undermined by those who choose to bank in certain preferential tax havens.
This directive will do much to ensure that the single market is not distorted by asymmetric tax regimes and it will create a situation whereby, after a transition period of three years, Member States will exchange information on savings income received by non-residents.
These moves will enhance European citizens' rights vis-Ã -vis big banking corporations.
Mr President, the British Labour Members did not support this report.
We do not support the extension of the marketing scheme for nuts.
We recognise, however, that production is commonly found in less-favoured areas, principally in Spain, and that much of the production is barely competitive and brings little economic return.
For these reasons it would make more economic sense to support the affected regions by a comprehensive programme for alternative crops or other activities that could be financed through the Rural Development Programme.
Our vote accordingly urges the Commission to bring forward proposals to this effect.
We realise that these views are not universally popular but believe that they should ultimately result in a higher standard of living for the people affected.
This is preferable to continued subsistence living and uncertain financial provision from CAP funds.
We are critical of Mr Bautista Ojeda's report on certain nuts and locust beans.
In our view, the amendments tabled represent, in general, an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not meet the conditions and needs of modern global society.
In the light of this, and with a view to the impending general review of the EU's agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety.
The support regime for making the nut, locust bean and hazelnut sector more efficient has helped modernise production.
This process has been justified on the grounds that the sector is an important source of employment in parts of the Mediterranean region.
However, support of this kind cannot be provided for ever.
It is only right that these sectors should be covered by the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.
It is not, however, reasonable for the committee to propose a statement to the effect that the support system should be made permanent in order to guarantee the survival of the sector.
Instead, the Commission should conclude its analysis of how competitive production is (while the present support system is extended by a year in accordance with the Commission's proposal) and then decide as to the consequences.
Mr President, the British Labour Members voted against the Cunha report.
Our objective is a fundamental reform involving withdrawal of financial support for tobacco production.
The proposal to extend the present financial provision is unacceptable.
So too was the amendment in the report which would reduce the Commission proposals for higher premia for the Community Tobacco Fund.
However, the economic and social importance of tobacco in certain regions must be taken into account.
The Commission must bring forward measures to develop alternative sources of income with a greater degree of urgency than it is currently showing.
Recognising this as the priority we voted for Amendment No 21.
Mr President, the Cunha report, which deals with the regulation permitting the financing of tobacco growing in Greece, Spain and Italy, especially, has forced me - like Mr Ebner, who spoke a moment ago - to abstain because many pensioners are smokers, and therefore I cannot be against tobacco, but many of them unfortunately become seriously ill and die partly because throughout their lives they have breathed in the smoke from cigarettes smoked by others in their presence.
I am therefore in favour of those who want to smoke, provided they do so outdoors, in the open air, because it is their own business, and I am also in favour of doing everything possible so that those who do not want to breathe smoke-polluted air are not forced to do so.
I therefore abstained, and I hope the problem will soon be solved in this way, which I think is very fair.
. (EL) The Commission proposal for a regulation on tobacco is unacceptable.
It is unacceptable politically because it disadvantages tobacco farmers, on the pretext of protecting health, when the Commission has spent millions on products such as red meat and alcohol, which are also harmful to health.
It is unacceptable socially because it disadvantages tens of thousands of tobacco-growing families in the poorest areas of the European Union, who are unable to grow alternative crops.
It is unacceptable to the state because phasing out subsidies for Community tobacco will not reduce consumption by a single cigarette.
All it will do is increase sales by American multinationals.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development accepted my amendment to delete recital 5 which talks of phasing out tobacco subsidies.
It also accepted my amendments on replacing premiums on Tsebelia - Mavra and on conducting a special study into the ratio between Community production, imports and tobacco consumption.
Despite the fact that I beg to differ with the Committee on Agriculture's resolution on certain points, it is on the right track if tobacco growing is to be maintained and it has my support.
.
(DE) We need to look at the 'tobacco' sector as a whole and take a balanced approach to the various areas (CAP and the environment, economic and social cohesion, public health).
Studies by the Commission into this are under way and their results and findings will need to be incorporated in specific proposals.
We should not delude ourselves that, if we reduce tobacco growing, everyone will stop smoking in the EU.
We must accept that tobacco will then be imported from third countries, where we cannot do anything about tobacco growing, while jobs are being lost in the EU.
We have a duty towards the people who earn a living from growing tobacco and we must offer them reasonable alternatives.
Restructuring measures could be funded from the new area within the Community Tobacco Fund, the budget for which needs to be increased by 3%.
I also call for information and awareness campaigns to be stepped up on the damage which tobacco consumption causes to health.
In August 1967, the Commission consulted the European Parliament for its opinion on the first proposal on a regulation to establish a common organisation of the market in the tobacco sector.
I was appointed rapporteur by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which examined the proposal over the course of nine meetings, adopted my report in April 1969 and debated it in Strasbourg in May 1969.
Why am I recalling this?
Because, at that time, we proposed a new type of market organisation based on a contract system, providing, within the framework of the Community preference, a fair income for producers, as well as social measures and assistance for changing activity.
I would like to make it clear that I do not believe that, on the pretext of combating nicotine addiction, we must phase out raw tobacco cultivation in the Community.
There are regions where tobacco growing is a major source of income for small farmers and where changing activity, either to undertake growing other crops or to carry out other economic activities, is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
In 1969, we had already written that social measures and assistance for changing activity could be justified much more easily than financing excess production of varieties which do not find a buyer on the market.
We pointed out that measures for changing activity as well as those aimed at enhancing tobacco growing in a quantitative and qualitative manner should be integrated in the regional policy and the policy for improving agricultural structures.
We even warned that selling surpluses on the global market could only harm associated countries and the interests of the Community's external trade policy.
As it is never too late to make amends, it is justified that we support our rapporteur today in order to restrict ourselves to changing the Commission's proposals solely from a technical perspective and to postpone the in-depth political debate on the future regime on raw tobacco until 2003.
(Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We are critical of Mr Cuhna's report on leaf tobacco.
In our view, the amendments tabled represent, in general, an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not meet the conditions and needs of modern global society.
In the light of this, and with a view to the impending general review of the EU's agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety.
. (NL) The European Union pursues a policy which, on the one hand, discourages the smoking of tobacco products while, on the other, encouraging the production of tobacco by granting subsidies to tobacco-growing farmers.
Fortunately, there are now plans afoot to phase these subsidies out, but the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is still opposed to these plans.
This committee draws attention to the socio-economic importance of the production of tobacco, which is located in the poorest regions of the EU, and to the difficulty of switching over to other crops.
In the same way, this committee could refer to the importance of the production of the raw materials for cocaine by the farmers in the poorest regions of Columbia.
The difference is that, in one case, we provide subsidies and, in the other, we tolerate a situation in which, under American influence, armed action is taken against these farmers and foreign aircraft take off from Dutch colonial territory to carry out reconnoitring exercises with a view to spraying toxins.
Applying double standards lacks all credibility.
The money used for the tobacco subsidies could be better spent on informing the public about the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and on supporting regions that switch to other crops.
I emphatically condemn the rapporteur's opposition to this solution.
It is, in the long term, unacceptable for the money of EU citizens to be used to subsidise tobacco cultivation in certain Member States.
It is important, particularly from a public health point of view, to stop subsidising tobacco cultivation.
The high levels of subsidy militate against conversion to other crops.
The Christian Democrats are therefore in favour of phasing out tobacco subsidies in line with the Commission's proposal.
Tobacco growing plays a very important role, especially in the less favoured regions of Europe.
About 130 000 landowners and 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco production and processing in the European Union.
These figures alone are enough to justify and provoke a study on the social and economic costs of suppressing aid to tobacco, even before we get to the political debate on this crop's future in the European Union.
In any case, restrictions on tobacco growing in Europe would have no effect on consumption except to turn European consumers towards tobaccos from outside the European Union, which are of much poorer quality and certainly more harmful to health.
Added to this is the fact that Commission document COM (2001) 264 of 15 May 2001 on sustainable development stresses that 'political leaders should determine the pros and cons for other political contexts and take them into account.
A thorough evaluation of all the effects of a proposed political action must include estimates of its environmental and social impact both inside and outside the EU.'
As European Republicans, we therefore believe that the Commission should make a concerted effort to promote studies and research into possible alternative crops that would maintain the rural fabric in a sustainable manner.
We agree with the draftsman, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, that the political debate on tobacco should be held over until Parliament has received an evaluation report on the management of the fund, with any proposed amendments and improvements.
For the reasons given above, we say 'no' to the under-cover gradual elimination of subsidies for tobacco growing; we call for the current contribution levels for the research fund activities to be maintained for 2002/2003/2004, since agronomic research is today one of the most important ways of making tobacco consumption less harmful to health; and we support the amended report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
- (NL) According to the Dutch Government, European agricultural policy is in need of reform.
This is reportedly due to enlargement and the fear that, soon, a huge contribution will have to be made to the EU budget.
As we all know, the Dutch watch their pennies.
I support the call for a policy review. However, my reason for doing so is not enlargement, but the fact that agricultural policy includes schemes that are completely unrelated to healthy agriculture.
The common organisation of the market in the raw tobacco industry is, for a variety of reasons, unhealthy.
Although I recognise that agricultural policy must address the social dimension, as well as the economic dimension, of operational management, this common organisation of the market has swung completely towards social policy.
An industry is being maintained which is both harmful to public health and unprofitable.
The premiums remove all incentive from the farmer to adapt his agricultural plan.
In this way, he stands to lose out all round.
Tobacco is a product which damages public health.
I should like to invite MEPs who wish to challenge this notion to initiate proceedings against the warning on cigarette packets.
The argument that the market demands tobacco and that current European production must thus be maintained is a specious argument quoted by various Members of this House.
After all, market demand does not mean that production must be subsidised.
If this is set to become a commonly held notion in agricultural policy, the net payers in the Union are in for a rough ride.
Adjustments to the common organisation of the market in the rough tobacco industry must encourage growers to look for alternative crops.
The Commission proposal is promising. Reference is made in no uncertain terms to the gradual abolition of subsidies, while measures are introduced to develop alternative sources of income.
The rapporteur, Mr Cunha does not do Europe any favours by wishing to delete this Commission comment.
This is why, together with 31 other Members of this Parliament, I have tabled an amendment whereby this report would expressly call for tobacco production subsidies to be phased out.
. (PT) We are still waiting!
The specific measures in force for the outermost regions are inadequate and only cover the fields of agriculture and fisheries - a much more modest framework than the one established ten years ago when the POSEI programmes were launched and one which squanders the possibilities opened up by Article 299(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and this is both incomprehensible and unacceptable.
Even in the fields that the measures do cover, their overall financial provisions have remained the same, and so, in relative terms, they are worth less today than when the measures were launched.
In agriculture, some small improvements have been made to the framework of measures, and in fisheries, aid has been extended for the disposal of certain products, as is now being proposed once again, for a further year.
What is needed are permanent schemes, periodically adapted and supported by sufficient overall financial provisions, not only in agriculture and fisheries but also in energy, the environment, communications, the new technologies and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Community system of support for the disposal of some fishery products in certain outermost regions, including the Autonomous Region of Madeira, a system established in 1992 following on from the POSEI programmes, has been subject to successive extensions and revisions.
The need to adopt specific measures for the outermost regions with Article 299(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community as a legal base has been constantly reiterated by Parliament.
There can, therefore, be no doubt that it is appropriate to maintain instruments of support for the outermost regions, as laid down in the proposal for a Council regulation presented by the Commission.
I therefore offer my unreserved support to this proposal for a regulation, which seeks to extend the system in force by one year, until 31 December 2002, thereby ensuring the continuity of the legal framework of the system to compensate for the additional costs incurred as a result of remoteness in the marketing of certain fishery products.
A one-year extension will enable the Commission to come up with a new support system to enter into force after 1 January 2003, in light of the assessment currently being made of the impact of these support measures on the fisheries sector in the outermost regions.
- (NL) The conclusion of fisheries agreements by the EU with Developing World countries, which include many former colonies of current EU Member States, sounds better than it is.
Everyone talks about the mutual benefit.
For those countries, the shortage of funding is solved to a certain extent; for us, the shortage of fish.
It means that European ships can use those waters for fishing at the expense of the European taxpayer who pays for three quarters of the compensation paid to the less wealthy countries involved. These are countries which have to sell their rights due to poverty.
Gabon, which is once again selling fishing rights for a three-year period, is itself obliged to import fish.
Agreements of this kind are at the expense of these countries' own coastal fishing, certainly if it is assumed that the protected territorial waters which fall outside the scope of the agreement extend for only six, instead of twelve, miles.
The rapporteur dutifully refers to the need for scientific research, the environmental drawbacks, alternative funding, development aid and the disadvantages for the countries involved.
I share his views on many of the aspects he includes in his recitals but, unlike Mr Maat, I am not in favour of continuing with agreements of this kind.
. We are very unhappy with the fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries as we are aware that within this agreement with the Gabonese Government 40% of the money should be set aside for conservation measures.
Due to a lack of good governance, we are concerned that these funds may not be used for the purposes for which they were intended, and thus the Conservative Delegation abstained on the final vote.
I voted in favour of this report.
We must face the fact that the rate of biodiversity decline and loss in Europe and throughout the world continues to increase.
The existing measures do not seem to be sufficient to reverse current trends, particularly the decrease in the number of species and their habitat, ecosystems and genes.
Europe must fulfil a specific role, boosting initiative and providing impetus in this area and it must not merely voice pious hopes that will not be followed up with action.
To begin with, Europe must ensure that environmental legislation is applied.
Too many Member States, for reasons connected with their national political situation, resist transposing certain directives into their law in a swift and efficient manner. This is particularly true of the birds and habitats directives.
We must also take action in the areas of agriculture and fisheries.
Agriculture must play a key part, and the new CAP must be radically reformed and account taken of the requirements of sustainable development.
In the area of fisheries, it is essential that we provide for short- and medium-term coherent measures in order to preserve or restore biological diversity where it is at risk.
Lastly, preserving biological diversity does not mean we have to put a stop to the research effort and the development of knowledge.
Also, in the area of GMOs, for example, although we must not disregard the precautionary principle, we must support objective and step-by-step scientific validation of these experiments.
- (NL) In less than a century, mankind has changed the world beyond recognition, and certainly not only for the good.
The world population has risen enormously, previously virgin territory has been bisected by traffic connections, and large areas have been seized for the production of food, the growing of industrial crops and urbanisation.
Tropical forests are being cut down or burnt down on a massive scale, animal species become extinct due to economic exploitation, oceans are emptied of fish stocks, indigenous peoples are driven out of their territories, and plants and animals are being patented.
What until recently was still considered progress is nowadays increasingly seen as a threat to the future.
This is why it is so important to do more to protect what is left of natural plant and animal life and to promote the survival of people who, since time immemorial, have lived in sparsely populated areas surrounded by rich fauna and flora.
This group of people are becoming significantly impoverished and are therefore forced to move to the cities or destroy their natural surroundings to allow for more industry and intensive agriculture.
Appropriate measures include support for non-governmental organisations, adapting development plans for the Developing World and changing the EU's agricultural policy.
In the midst of all the changes for the worse, the adoption of this proposal with a view to protecting bio-diversity represents a little ray of hope, although I am not confident about its outcome.
I voted in favour of this report.
The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, consider the protection of citizens, their environment, their daily lives and their health to be of great importance.
Balanced texts on these subjects are very often approved at Community level.
It is apparent to us, however, that the transposition of a number of directives by the Member States is being unjustifiably delayed.
The directive on urban waste water treatment is an example of a directive that has been poorly applied.
It was adopted in 1991 with the aim of protecting the environment against the effects of urban waste water and biodegradable waste water discharge from the food industry.
When it was applied, the directive brought about a measured improvement in water quality.
The Member States' main duty is to put in place systems for collecting and processing waste water and to respect a pre-established timetable.
However, not only are some Member States delaying in passing on all the information required to carry out an objective assessment of this directive but, even worse, others are not communicating any information on this subject.
This is absolutely unacceptable!
I therefore demand that the time the Member States take to do this should not increase, that all the information is passed onto the Commission, as stipulated in the directive which was adopted in a timely manner by the Council.
I came out in favour of the Commission's launch of infringement procedures in cases where the criteria for identification of sensitive areas have not been respected or taken into account.
- (NL) Candidate countries are keen to call attention to the way in which the city of Brussels treats its urban effluent and thereby conclude that environmental rules only apply on paper and not in practice.
Of the 527 agglomerations comprising more than 150 000 inhabitants, 94 discharge their effluent unprocessed into the environment and 134 others provide insufficient information.
More than 43% are therefore in default.
The data for the reference date in 1998 is not yet available, and it is even unknown how many infringement procedures are pending at the European Court of Justice.
All of this confirms that the EU is mainly an economic community which sets large multinational companies free from national rules that hinder their operations.
Other matters receive far less attention, and useful rules remain hollow phrases.
In this case, it is not irresponsible companies that are to blame but failing government.
It is important, however, to identify the cause of this failure.
Large cities have many problems and receive far too little funding from their national governments, which economise with a view to reducing taxes and enhancing the profitability of industry and the stability of the euro.
This is why these cities fall into disrepair and are unable to carry out the necessary renovation works.
This too could be clarified if we were to back the rapporteur in her just endeavours to secure openness.
Industrial and domestic pollution has become the main cause of degradation of our European waterways, only 40% of which are attaining the quality objectives set according to different uses.
To tackle this potentially harmful situation, the Council and Parliament reacted by adopting the so-called 'urban waste water treatment' directive in 1991.
Like most of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I condemn the fact that 11 years after its adoption and four years after the deadline for cities with a population equivalent of above 10 000 to be provided with collecting systems and waste water treatment plants, there are many Member States who still do not conform to this directive's legally binding timetable.
I also regret the fact that the Committee on the Environment has not adopted one of the amendments that I tabled, namely a common sense amendment which explained the reasons why so many Member States have not yet applied this directive.
It is probably because the very short deadlines imposed by Directive 91/271/EEC (six and a half years for water treatment in sensitive areas) did not take into account the situation of several large Member States' cities.
These cities still did not have an urban waste water treatment plant in 1991 and also had to conform to other common European standards in the areas of the award of public contracts and studies into environmental effects.
Need we point out that the average time limit for awarding public contracts in the sector is three years, need we also stress that a water treatment plant with a connection system for collecting sewage costs an average of EUR 400 million?
To sum up, a good piece of Community legislation is one which chooses between what is desirable and what is feasible.
We must note that the drafting of the 'urban waste water treatment' directive has failed to adhere to this essential rule.
. (EL) The 'steel crisis' is proof most positive of the shortcomings of the market economy and neo-liberal system which the USA and the European Union are determined to impose on the world.
It demonstrates yet again that the capitalist system is in too deep a state of crisis to respond to any measures to manage it, even the World Trade Organisation's 'rules of good conduct' for free trade and free competition.
The United States has no hesitation in violating any agreements made in order to defend their interests.
This crisis has once again brought the antagonism within the international imperialist system and the more general conflict between the centres of imperialism vying for hegemony to the surface.
The American imperialist system has no hesitation in taking measures which hit the economy of the European imperialist system and the European imperialist system has no hesitation in hitting back, despite its amazing willingness to tread the same path and vie for its share of the spoils of military opportunism.
The demands of the American trades union have clearly been used as a pretext for the decision by the Bush administration to impose customs tariffs, a decision taken on the back of the more general crisis to hit the capitalist economy after the worst year's international trading for 25 years and after a fall of 38% in American steel imports over the last three years.
The workers stand to gain nothing from this wrangling.
In the end, American workers will not escape restructuring and unemployment and European workers will not ward off the spectre of redundancies by running to the WTO.
What the USA and the ?U are doing their best to save are the profits of the steel industries.
But even if they manage to limit the fallout from the present crisis, another one will be along shortly.
This is typical of social systems which have long run out of anything to offer society, and capitalism is one such system.
The only way out is to overturn it, however difficult that may seem under present circumstances.
Crises like the steel crisis bring new opportunities for action by the working classes; they can be used to rally the workers and they lay bare the ugly face of capitalism.
The European Parliament resolution only skims the surface of the problem and tries to deal with it within liberalist parameters.
It is interesting that the European Parliament resolution accuses the United States of failing to restructure the steel industry promptly, as the European Union did.
In other words, it accuses it of failing to close enough companies and make enough workers redundant unlike, for example, the Greek steel industry.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Europe voted against the resolution.
We can only regret the fact that the United States has introduced a tax on steel imports, at the expense of European interests and which apparently violates WTO rules.
Nonetheless, we were also alarmed by the assured and clear conscience displayed by Commissioner Lamy yesterday in the House, when he gave us a lecture on American free-market morale.
We must point out a few realities that have been forgotten, and which should lead to greater discretion being shown.
1- First of all, the tax introduced by the US, which is likely to be of up to 30%, closely corresponds to the depreciation of the euro since its introduction, which certainly imposes monetary dumping on our trade partners.
Naturally, no one in Europe mentions this because, however unexpected it may be, this depreciation favours us commercially.
The fact remains that it is the source of serious prejudice to our partners.
Admittedly, the United States hoped for the 'strong dollar', but equally, they did not want an overly powerful dollar, which seriously punishes their own industries.
2- In the steel dispute, the United States has cited the need for safeguard measures to avoid domestic problems.
In this case, they may well be disregarding the WTO rules that they themselves adopted, and by which they find themselves trapped.
The fact remains, however, that they pose a real problem.
Instead of trying to triumph over them, should they not instead jump at the opportunity, and propose to consider the legitimate exceptions to a free trade doctrine, for the developed countries, and even more so for the under-developed countries?
Europe, in particular, would do well to consider this issue if it wants, in future, to save its agricultural model.
In this respect, one might also wonder whether Commissioner Lamy's thundering declarations, attacking the 'unilateralism' of the American measures, will, in future, end up reinforcing (or are actually designed to reinforce) the multilateral approach of a simplistic free trade doctrine, as adopted at the end of the Uruguay Round through the manipulation of public opinion.
And we will in future realise that these reinforced approaches are, as an indirect consequence, holding us prisoner on other subjects that are vital for us, such as agriculture.
The manipulation goes on.
The attitude and decisions adopted by the US in order to shamefully protect its steel industry at the expense of European interests, perfectly illustrate that, beyond wonderful speeches and liberal statements, what now dominates the world is the law of the strongest. This is what George W. Bush is relying on in this case; take another look at the fable of the Wolf and the Lamb by Jean de la Fontaine.
That is why Europe must take firm action using the legal means provided for within the framework of the WTO, but also using all the other available means of exerting pressure at a time when the United States continues to call on other shared aims in its fight against terrorism.
This situation is proof of the true nature of American-style globalisation.
It sums up the speeches on the benefits of free competition that is lacking in rules.
It reassures those who believe that we need a political Europe that is capable of existing and also to influence the management of world affairs.
- (NL) For years, the US has been the champion of free trade, insofar as this means that others have to open up their markets for American products without import restrictions.
There is a continuous threat of trade wars if American products are subjected to requirements in terms of the environment and consumer protection.
The EU has largely adopted this free trade ideology.
However, it is becoming increasingly evident that this free trade too is subordinate to American self-interest and is only supported if it leads to the favouring of American companies.
The leading group in America considers its own country to be the best in the world.
Like the Soviet Union and China in the past, the US derive from this pretension the right to do everything they do not allow others to do.
Accordingly, international impunity is demanded for American war criminals, unilateral threats are made to use nuclear weapons and European steel is banned from the American market by means of an import levy.
One of the lessons the EU should draw from this is that free-trade ideology leads to accidents.
Europe should focus more on economic self-sufficiency, in other words autarchy, rather than on promoting imports, exports, globalisation and growing mutual dependence on the US and Japan.
This is the best way to steer clear of any trade wars and economic instability imported from outside Europe.
Transatlantic relations are currently in turmoil.
The root of the problem is the offensive of the US Government, which is using its military victory in Afghanistan to strengthen and consolidate its superpower.
However, America's quest for global supremacy is also giving rise to clashes and tension amongst the ruling classes in countries at both the centre and the fringes of the globe.
The current conflict concerning the tax introduced by the United States on steel imports is an obvious manifestation of this.
American imperialism is willing to impose 'global deregulation', but does not rule out the use of protectionist measures when it feels its interests are threatened.
I did not, however, vote for this joint resolution.
The European Union's opposition is merely a way of supporting European multinationals in a ruthless economic war.
Above all, we support workers throughout the world, including those in the United States.
We do not support the interests of multinationals against other interests.
The more the EU continues to 'combat' the United States, the more of their policy it adopts.
Therefore, the 'Lisbon process', whose aim is to transform the EU into 'the most competitive economy in the world', seeks to erode, through liberalisation, privatisation and excessive commercialisation, the living conditions of the working population in Europe and in the Developing World.
I voted in favour of this report.
This recommendation is based on a realistic and modern vision of the European economy.
The economic slowdown in the United States is having repercussions within the European Union.
However, this fact alone cannot explain the weak results posted by a number of Member States.
There are, in fact, domestic problems that must be resolved, and structural reforms are expected.
All European consumers must be able to freely choose their service provider.
Furthermore, an innovative competition policy, resisting all the dominant positions, is emerging within the European Union.
This approach must be encouraged, particularly by involving all the parties concerned so that we can be more effective, both personally and collectively.
This does not mean reforming against the actors, but to make these sectors develop in conjunction with them.
It is also essential to take specific measures in the areas of education, training and research development if we wish to retain highly competent employees and ensure that our businesses are as competitive as possible.
This report also proposes to increase the retirement age for workers who wish to remain active.
Today's widespread practice of compulsory retirement is an enormous waste of skills, talent and experience.
These experienced people can still fulfil worthwhile tasks in our businesses.
Lastly, analysts show that the current economic slowdown could have been much more serious were it not for Monetary Union.
Therefore, those who are now driven by concerns regarding their domestic policy and are advocating a return to the past, have got the wrong century, and are confusing personal interest with general interest.
. (EL) Yet again, faced with a Commission recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines, the European Parliament report has endorsed the anti-grass roots policies of the European Union which demolish the rights acquired by the workers for the sake of monopoly interests.
Yet again, the workers are being called on to pay the price of the slump caused by antagonism between imperialist systems, the way in which the monopolies operate and act and the shameless goal of increasing the return on capital.
The report goes overboard about stability and convergence programmes and coordinating the Member States' application of anti-grass roots policies "which take into account the complex nature of the world recession".
Under pressure from the monopolies, taking political decisions which result in lower labour costs and national insurance contributions, circumventing collective agreements and working hours and introducing lower-paid, flexible forms of work are all applauded and re-tabled as proposals.
The 'problem of Europe's aging population' is being used as a pretext for reforming pension systems or extending people's working lives by raising the retirement age and cutting pensions, that is, by phasing out the state's social security obligations and encouraging privatisation of the health and welfare sector.
Dismantling the insurance system and arranging working times to suit employers by making part-time work and 'flexible' working arrangements the rule will simply create a huge army of employable people with no rights or entitlements, enslaved to the unaccountability of big business.
Pressure to sell off the national silver is being stepped up, with the call for faster privatisation by liberalising the electricity, natural gas and transport sectors and privatising the utilities and liberalising services of general interest, never mind the impact on workers or consumers.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this report, which secures a guaranteed level of poverty for the workers and maximum profits for big business, which is getting stronger and stronger and intends to demolish workers rights and make part-time work the rule.
The workers will condemn and oppose these barbaric and inhumane policies by fighting to try and calm the impending storm and we shall be by their side.
The report by the former trade unionist Mr Bruno Trentin begins with a guideline which has the merit of being perfectly clear at least: 'the priorities?should involve reducing labour costs'.
It continues with incoherent proposals whereby we could reduce taxes and social security contributions, while at the same time ensuring 'that pensions and health services are fully maintained'.
Due to a lack of understanding of the reasons behind the economic recovery of 1997-2001 and the recent economic downturn, the report proposes solutions, such as the strict application of the inapplicable Stability and Growth Pact, which can do nothing more than to aggravate the current recession.
The report stresses efforts to promote training and R&D, as if, in the area of employment, spending on these could replace demands for salary increases and an overall reduction in working time.
It dares to mention 'social cohesion' whilst the lower taxes and social security contributions that it recommends can lead to nothing more than the formation of inequalities.
I therefore had no reservations in voting against this mediocre and hypocritical report which should bring shame upon its authors.
From the outset, the title of this report clearly expresses its objective: to provide the EU with a harmonised taxation policy.
It is disconcerting, therefore, that the Della Vedova report begins by making a sort of semi-sincere confession that tax policy must remain within the exclusive competence of the Member States whilst the rest of the text goes on to advise how the Union can go about acquiring the same prerogative.
It is true that we have had a close shave.
The text that was voted for in committee was a vast improvement on the proposal of the rapporteur, who perceived a European tax to be an opportunity to reaffirm the federal principle of European integration.
The majority of Members of this House thought it was more prudent to delete this excess candour and replace it with a text which, in the end, hides behind a certain type of liberalism, recommending lower taxes before eventually demanding moving to the use of taxation policy instruments that are controlled by Community authorities, the Commission and Parliament itself.
By inching its way along as usual, the House is making progress, admittedly, but in much the same way as a crab.
And we have still only made half as much progress as we intended.
The proposals regarding VAT are not bold enough.
We should have, on the one hand, reaffirmed that each nation is sovereign in this area and, on the other hand, made broader proposals than those which aim to make NGOs exempt from paying VAT and to include, for example, all the cultural events staged by non profit-making associations.
A report that clearly stated that tax policy is a matter for each nation and which recommended improved coordination between the Member States in this area would have received my vote.
Unfortunately, the report contains nothing of this nature.
- (NL) Nobody likes to pay taxes but, without taxes, our lives would be in chaos, and only the fittest would survive.
Without taxes, there would be no universally available education, no health care, public transport or safety on the streets, and anyone suffering from long-term illness or unemployment would be condemned to a life of begging on the streets.
Unfortunately, the European Commission has other priorities, and the Italian radical Della Vedova is a faithful supporter.
He complains about the tax burden which, since 1970, has risen, on average, from 35% to 45% and hopes that tax competition between the Member States will lead to a tax cut for companies.
Although he refers to the tax level as a domestic problem for every Member State, at the same time he pushes for companies to be able to choose their registered offices in a state where the tax burden is lowest.
He then goes on to focus on indirect taxes, such as VAT, and deems direct taxes, such as income tax, to be an unfair barrier to income from labour.
I agree with him that a tax on environmental pollution can be a viable alternative, but this will no longer be effective once the environment has become truly clean.
The emphasis on VAT, on the other hand, means that everyone pays the same amount for inevitable basic expenses and, as such, it widens the income gap between the rich and the poor.
This is why I reject his approach.
The Della Vedova report on the EU's fiscal policy is an ill-assorted compilation of fiscal affirmations and claims.
Some of these requirements also blatantly contradict the Treaty, which provides for unanimity in fiscal matters.
For these reasons, I was forced to vote against the motion for a resolution.
.
Paragraph 12 is inconsistent with the EPLP line that tobacco and alcohol excise duties should be harmonised upwards in order to achieve the social goal of reduced use and to indicate the strength of feeling held - that is, that you can tax for social reasons.
We voted in favour of the report as a whole because we believe that the EU should, for example, be able to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, something that requires the EU to be given legal personality.
We believe that a change of this kind can, in itself, be made while retaining the existing decision-making models and institutional structure.
We do not therefore believe that the three pillars which at present constitute the EC and the EU should be combined in a single pillar.
The pillar structure reflects the political distinction made between supranational and intergovernmental areas of cooperation, and the fact that the pillar structure gives rise to a complicated legal situation is not a good enough reason for abolishing it.
If there had been doubt regarding the content of the Carnero GonzÃ¡lez report - which calls on the European Union to acquire a legal personality - this was removed by yesterday's debate.
The speakers attacked with federalist zeal, thus demolishing all the precautionary comments that the rapporteur had made to prove that his reform was perfectly innocent.
Mr Napolitano spoke of establishing a supranational entity.
Mr Duff mentioned the need for the Union to become a fully contracting party on the international stage.
Jo Leinen said that granting the Union a legal personality was essentially the final piece of the jigsaw of all the federalist proposals.
And lastly, the Commission declared that this was an 'essential' reform, and that it would support the proposal.
It is clear, therefore, that the aim of granting a legal personality to the European Union, as well as the Communities, is to create a competent new actor on the international stage, which will use all the opportunities provided by Article 24 of the TEU (particularly since its revision after the Nice Summit) to gradually remove from Member States the autonomy of their foreign policy.
Europe would then have entered the era of the super-state, before the citizens have decided whether this is what they actually want.
We believe, on the contrary, as we explained in the minority opinion attached to the report, that the European Union must remain a unique organisation of major and responsible States - in other words, major and responsible national democracies - which are organised in a network.
It will be the work of the Convention coming together over the coming months to find the combination that best encourages voluntary synergy, without abolishing the freedom of choice of the people.
I cannot vote in favour of Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez' report for the following reason, among others:
I am in favour of intergovernmental cooperation, while the report is clearly supranational in character.
The rapporteur's proposal that the EU be given legal personality is a threat to intergovernmental cooperation within the EU.
Transforming the EU into a legal person would be one more step towards a European federation, and that is something I cannot support.
.
The overwhelming message of this report is that the European Commission has neglected the fish processing sector.
The sector is confronted with the impact of a whole host of EU legislation, from CFP management measures to hygiene and food safety, to the environment, and yet it is all too often ignored.
The waste water directive is a prime example where the concerns of the processing sector were overlooked.
I am therefore pleased that the Committee endorsed my amendments which emphasised that the impact of legislation should be fully assessed, and specifically, that the Commission should provide support for the development for water recycling systems, such as the one recently established by a processor in my own area in the north-east of Scotland.
Greater attention needs to be paid to structural support.
Processors have been hard hit by CFP management measures, from quota cuts to decommissioning, but received little or no assistance.
Structural support should be positive, not just reacting to management measures, but being proactive in supporting the sector, promoting new technologies and encouraging effective marketing.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 13.38 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
We shall begin with the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:

(B5-0167/2002) by Mr Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the breaking off of the peace process in Colombia;
(B5-0168/2002) by Mr Marset Campos and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on Colombia.
Mr President, we are all bound to regret the breakdown of the peace process that President Pastrana pushed forwards with so much political courage at the beginning of his mandate.
I must confess, Mr President, that having taken part, together with other Members of this House, in a meeting in Los Pozos with 'Tirofijo' and the leadership of FARC, this decision comes as no surprise to me.
On that occasion we begged for the release of the European Union citizens kidnapped by FARC and also, at the request of his wife and daughter, of a Colombian senator who was ill.
Needless to say, we achieved nothing.
Today, Mr President, this Parliament must raise its voice once again to condemn all the murders, including the recent murder of senator Marta Catalina Daniels, all the violations of human rights in Colombia and to demand that FARC releases all the people it has kidnapped, including the Presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt.
Our Parliament has always demonstrated its commitment to the way of peace and of dialogue to solve the conflict, but in the knowledge that dialogue must be sought by both parties and that a society cannot remain forever deaf, dumb and blind to violence.
Last Sunday, Colombian society demonstrated civil courage and democratic maturity.
This is why, Mr President, today more than ever and on the eve of the forthcoming Presidential elections, the international community and this Parliament and the European Union in general must continue to show solidarity and their support for Colombia's legitimate government, for the entire spectrum of democratic forces and of civil society, with the demand, as always, that in order to overcome the serious problems affecting the country we must insist on the way of peace, harmony, reconciliation, justice and dialogue, and insist that the problems cannot be overcome by violence, because Colombian society is crying out for peace.
To conclude, Mr President, I feel that this Parliament should stand side by side with Colombia in this crucial exercise of the Presidential elections.
Mr President, once again we are talking about Colombia, a dearly loved country on the American continent but regrettably, once again, we are doing so because of the negative issues affecting it.
If we study recent events in Colombia, we generally see a discouraging and tragic picture, in which the human rights situation leaves much to be desired.
Nevertheless, we are optimists and must have faith and hope in the way of negotiation and of dialogue and in respect for tolerance, in order to achieve peace in Colombia once and for all.
Perhaps it would be appropriate on this occasion to mention an illustrious European, the German naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt, who, exactly 200 years ago, travelled to that part of the world and established the bases for cooperation between peoples and the defence of human rights.
Mr President, I can actually speak before Mrs Auroi, in order to give her time to arrive.
Various political groups tabled motions for resolutions and then we agreed on a joint motion for a resolution, that should now - I believe - have the support of most of the House.
As previous speakers have said, the situation in Colombia is a painful issue for all of us, because we had great hopes for the successful conclusion of the peace process.
President Pastrana has dedicated his mandate almost entirely to these efforts, with a series of very generous concessions to the guerrilla organisations: he has opened negotiations, both with FARC and the ELN and yet has achieved little.
In specific terms, he has given FARC a territory the size of Switzerland, an entire enclave in which they can travel with absolute freedom, and lastly, when it still looked as though negotiations might break down, President Pastrana even extended the agreements or negotiations, in an attempt to conclude an agreement.
During this extension phase, FARC launched a campaign of kidnappings and murders, which culminated in the murder of Senator Daniels and the kidnapping of a presidential candidate, Mrs Ingrid Betancourt.
At the same time, FARC is continuing its extortion activities, claiming a supposed right to impose taxes on drug-trafficking organisations, which I believe has completely stripped it of any legitimacy, because an organisation that takes part in acts of gratuitous violence and which, furthermore, tries to make money out of drugs trafficking, ultimately loses any basis for legitimacy.
At the moment, therefore, we are rather disillusioned and feel a degree of despair, although this does not mean that we are going to give up on the possibility that an agreement can be reached.
In other words, the first aspect is to state that FARC has failed to meet its commitments and has all but abandoned the peace process; it has made it impossible for the government to negotiate, because you cannot negotiate with killers and kidnappers. On the other hand, it is necessary to try to restart the peace process and to leave the door open for negotiations.
We in the European Union have always supported this process of negotiation, including practical proposals, designed to alleviate some of the specific social problems.
It has become clear that the definitive solution to the problem of Colombia does not simply involve an end to the violence, but that we must get to the root of the social and economic problems that are causing this. In order to reach that point, however, peace must first be achieved on the ground.
I do not know at the moment whether it is possible to add a little trust and calm to the situation, but I would say that the European Union has - where the problem of Colombia is concerned - the advantage of distance and, furthermore, the willingness it has always shown to help Colombia with its exports, for example, in a range of key sectors.
Our resolution aims, therefore, on the one hand, to illustrate the responsibility of those who have caused the breakdown of the peace process and, on the other, to leave the door to negotiation open and to call on the European institutions to patiently continue with this lengthy and complicated task, by providing the aid necessary to make this process easier and, of course, by not giving in to despair, and instead by trusting that, ultimately, there will be a return to reason and to the negotiating table.
I believe that the European institutions can work together in this aspect, and we hope that the Commission can indeed help to resolve this deadly and longstanding conflict.
Mr President, I shall begin by reading a very short extract from the document that we were given today in the delegation to Central America, and I say 'read it', because I do not want anyone to believe that I am giving it my own interpretation.
The interventions I have heard so far strike me as somewhat lacking in balance.
I shall read the words of the non-governmental human rights organisation 'Human Rights Watch': 'The human rights situation clearly deteriorated in the course of last year.
In the first ten months of the year, the office of the Public Advocate recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time.
Most were linked to paramilitary groups, followed by guerrillas. The national epidemic of kidnappings, half of which were committed by guerrillas, gave no signs of abating.?
The report also states that two million Colombians have been displaced and that this year, more people than ever before - 300 000 - have been displaced.
It also states that human rights workers, trade unionists, journalists, government investigators and community leaders continue to be murdered because of their work.
Mr President, we will be voting on a resolution today.
I prefer the resolution we voted for last year, which I felt was more balanced, because it noted and clearly condemned the ongoing fumigation of crops and the fact that alternative crops were not being promoted to prevent human disease and the constant attacks on biodiversity.
Last year's resolution also stated that the European Union should adopt a different, non-militaristic position, which supports the defence of human rights, dialogue and peace.
We repeat this demand today and I agree with my fellow Members that this should be done.
This resolution also condemned the fact that, since 60% of Colombians live on less than one dollar per day, it is very hard to achieve dialogue, agreements, or peace.
This is why, Mr President, I felt that some balance needed to be added to the previous interventions, although I agree with what most of my fellow Members have to say.
But it was necessary to mention other parties involved in the war in Colombia, who exert an enormous influence in the absence of peace.
Mr President, you will understand that, as a member of the Greens, it is particularly moving to be presenting this resolution as co-author, since Ingrid BÃ©tancour is still currently being detained by members of the FARC, the violent paramilitary gang which has previously carried out assassinations of trade unionists or representatives of social movements from Colombian society. My fellow Members have reiterated how much the Colombian people need peace and tranquillity, rather than this type of action.
Today, we still do not have any news regarding Mrs BÃ©tancour's situation which could put our minds at rest.
The governments involved and the Commission must therefore try to obtain some information and assist in Mrs BÃ©tancour's release.
But apart from this, as other speakers have said, we must welcome the statement by President Pastrana, who stated that he wanted to step up his fight against this type of action and provide effective guarantees for the security of the civil society in Colombia.
It is perfectly clear that, if President Pastrana leaves the door to negotiations open, then these negotiations must relate to the respect of human rights and restoring order in Colombia so that genuine democracy can finally be established in this country.
The European Union must therefore provide greater support for cooperation efforts, which will improve the human rights situation, and it must ensure that the European aid achieves its objective, in other words to assist civil society in Colombia.
Mr President, it is difficult for any of us in this House to comprehend why one human being should kill another, and yet in Colombia members of guerrilla and paramilitary groups kill each other and thousands of civilians without qualms, and in some cases with relish.
This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999.
Sadly, for those 400 massacres committed by the government, paramilitary groups and guerrilla groups, not one person was brought to trial.
The ordinary people of Colombia live and suffer in an environment of oppression caused not only by these paramilitary and guerrilla groups, but often at the hands of a government which is either unwilling or unable to protect them.
As a body that has consistently upheld fundamental human rights and social justice, we need to do what we can to contribute towards bringing peace to a country that has been living under the horrors of civil war for over four decades.
In our individual Member States, and collectively as the European Union, we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and FARC back to the negotiating table, under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict.
We must also support those groups working for peace within Colombia, which have provided a safe haven for civilians but have recently been under attack from the AUC and FARC.
Additionally we must persuade the United States to fund peace initiatives rather than simply giving more money to the Colombian Government for military and drug eradication purposes.
The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting.
We, as a democratically elected forum, must use our moral authority to help the people of Colombia in their struggle to bring to an end the conflict in their country.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basic question is, are we going to stick to the peace process set up between the Colombian Government and the guerrillas or are we going to try and resolve the problem by some other means and, if we try to resolve it by some other means, exactly what means are we going to use?
The only way forward we can accept is the peace process which, apart from anything else, is combined with changes urgently needed to Colombian society if it is to avoid going down the same road as Argentina.
The decision by President Pastrana is a decision to condone violence.
At the same time, apart from anything else, it legitimises action by the paramilitary groups which have murdered so many people in Colombia.
Unfortunately, the European Union, together with the United States, is supporting President Pastrana, meaning that it is supporting violence.
However, as you and I well know, ladies and gentlemen, violence begets violence, and more violence and yet more violence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the current situation in Columbia and also shares the view expressed in the resolution, that negotiations are the only feasible way of helping to resolve the long-standing conflict in Columbia.
This position has been expressed in numerous statements.
The direct role which the individual Member States have played in this respect also deserves recognition here.
The Commission also welcomes the proposed support for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota.
We have already helped here and we shall continue to offer our help in the future.
The Commission is also supporting the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Colombia.
The Commission is standing by its commitment to the peace process, hence Commissioner Patten and the Columbian foreign secretary recently signed an agreement on financing initial peace work.
We intend to continue supporting Columbian civil society in its efforts to establish peace through regional development and peace programmes.
The Commission is currently examining in which specific areas projects can be funded.
At the same time, we are offering the victims of the conflict our direct support in the form of humanitarian aid, which is being distributed by ECHO and non-governmental organisations.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
(B5-0132/2002) by Mr Watson and others, on behalf of the Group of the European, Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the observer status of Taiwan in the WHO;
(B5-0138/2002) by Mrs Frassoni and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the observer status of Taiwan at the May 2002 annual meeting of the World Health Organisation in Geneva;
(B5-0147/2002) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the observer status of Taiwan in the WHO;
(B5-0150/2002) by Mrs Langenhagen and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the observer status of Taiwan at the May 2002 annual meeting of the World Health Organisation in Geneva.
Mr President, this debate is about Taiwan and the WHO, and all the political groups are agreed that we wish to give Taiwan the opportunity to participate as an observer at the Geneva Summit in a few weeks' time.
Taiwan is a country with a very ambitious public health programme, and its people are among those with the longest average life span in Asia.
Infant mortality is low, and many of the diseases that a large number of countries in the world are still combating, such as cholera, chickenpox and malaria, have been eradicated.
A delegation from the Taiwanese health ministry visited us here in Strasbourg during the last part-session, and we had the opportunity then to hear a little about Taiwan's experience.
Many valuable lessons have been learned in Taiwan, and there is a great willingness to be of help, both economically and in terms of sharing knowledge.
We know that the WHO is in great need of financial aid.
I also want to say something about Taiwan as a political entity.
My political group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, supports democratic developments in Taiwan.
We view what has been happening there with a very great deal of sympathy and support the Taiwanese people's right to decide their own future.
A few months ago, we invited President Chen Shui-bian here to award him the Liberal International Freedom Prize, but the French authorities would not give him a visa.
We then tried to invite him to Belgium, and the Belgium authorities would not give him a visa either.
Instead, they referred to an EU agreement not to invite the President of Taiwan, because to do so would threaten relations with China.
Last week, we invited him to Sweden under a private arrangement, and he was not given a visa for my country either.
When I recently investigated what rules apply, I learned that there is no such agreement at EU level.
It would be illuminating to be told what really applies.
I think it is disgusting to grovel in this way to the Chinese dictatorship.
It should go without saying that a democratically elected leader should be given a visa when, for example, he receives an invitation from his Liberal colleagues.
Mr President, I concur with the previous speaker; 23 million people live in a democracy in Taiwan, an established democracy, and Taiwan is by no means a country which causes us continual headaches.
Nonetheless, it is the topic of this urgent debate.
These 23 million people and their democratic society are excluded from international organisations.
This is not a country which is first and foremost an aid beneficiary; it is a country which actively supports international organisations.
Taiwan has been actively involved in the WHO.
It would be a mistake if this country were unable to join the international community, which is why we could make a start by giving it observer status and letting it work with other international organisations in the future.
Perhaps there is some sort of half-way status which Taiwan could be granted.
My question to the Commission is, are you prepared to support Parliament here?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is not just a political and economic success story; we have also achieved health standards which many other countries can only dream of.
A good, healthy constitution is important to everyone here on earth, but it is only through access to information and medical care that public health can be improved.
And there is much that can only be done jointly and in synergy.
I am thinking, for example, of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and others.
The World Health Organisation and its current complement of 199 members have nailed their colours to the mast and are committed to improving health throughout the world.
Health is a valuable commodity which everyone has the right to enjoy, which is why I take the view that, in an area which affects everyone, no one who wants to help improve the welfare of people in their own and other countries should be excluded.
Taiwan has expressed a desire to help the WHO, both financially and technically, which is why I think there is not just good cause, it is imperative that Taiwan be granted observer status at the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly.
I have first hand experience of the political problems and tensions affecting Taiwan and, as in most cases, it is not just one side which is to blame.
But I am firmly convinced that we should not be led by political differences to stop a country joining international efforts in the health sector and I therefore call on the House to support this joint resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does, in principle, support Taiwanese efforts, and not just in the area under debate; it supports all its efforts to become involved in the work of international agencies and organisations, provided that there are sufficient economic or other relevant grounds for such involvement.
However, its involvement must be compatible with the status of Taiwan and the EU one China policy.
We pushed for Taiwan's membership of the WTO and, together with the United States, we helped oil the wheels of its accession.
We have also supported Taiwan's involvement in several international organisations, including the OECD, its involvement in the Kyoto agreement on simplified, harmonised customs procedures and its involvement in several international fisheries organisations.
We are well aware of what Taiwan has achieved in the health sector and its increasing commitment in international aid and health operations, which is why we are in favour of extending contacts between Taiwan and the World Health Organisation, provided that the rules of the WHO so allow.
Unfortunately, however, it looks as if Taiwan does not meet the criteria set out in the WHO constitution for membership of the organisation, because only states can join.
There is some legal uncertainty as to whether the WHO rules would allow Taiwan observer status at the World Health Assembly.
We and the Member States shall be considering the legal situation in order to formulate a suitable position in the run-up to and at the forthcoming World Health Assembly in May.
We are also prepared, with the Member States, to re-examine the possibility of Taiwanese involvement in the work of the WHO in some other form, mainly through non-governmental channels, provided that any such involvement complies with the relevant WHO rules.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

Zimbabwe
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, initial indications of the election result in Zimbabwe seem to point to a majority for President Mugabe.
This was to be expected.
No effort has been spared to achieve this result, although the majority was smaller than anticipated.
Nevertheless, I see this as a moral victory for the opposition, which itself uses the term 'stolen elections'.
Following the stolen elections in Chad and the rigged elections in Zambia, this is the third round of elections which, with the best will in the world, cannot be considered free and fair according to international standards, no matter how moderate a view some other African countries, for reasons probably known only to themselves, still take.
After all, the writing was on the wall: 4.5 million voters expected and 7.5 million ballots printed so as to be prepared for every eventuality; too few polling stations to enable everyone to vote properly; and the inevitable confusion about who had to vote where, since different elections needed to be held for different levels on the same day but at different locations.
These are only the technicalities which typify Mr Mugabe's craftiness.
More important was the terror which preceded this, the obstructions put in place by the ruling elite in order to prevent the opposition from meeting, the monopoly of the state channels, the prevention of journalists from doing their job, the obstacles placed in the way of observers, the incidents of torture and the abductions, including even the abduction of important union leaders. The list goes on.
Even the ploy involving the distribution of corn, far away from the polling stations, was predicted by the opposition.
The performance about re-opening the polling stations was the icing on the cake, and yet we need to ask ourselves: what now?
The elections were not conducted freely and fairly, but do we need to condemn them altogether?
The elections in Zambia and Chad were not free and fair either.
However, we do need to maintain the sanctions.
I am not in favour of extending these, but they do need to be applied and monitored.
I do call for negotiations between the members of the majority and the opposition, for the country is anxious about a civil war.
Finally, I hope that a government of national unity, involving the opposition, will be set up.
The generation of independence fighters have belied their own nature.
The elections in Zimbabwe were an incredible farce, even by African standards.
Mr Mugabe made every effort to stay in power, using extremely brutal means.
Nothing was too extreme for the purpose of eliminating his opponents: violence, intimidation, murder, large-scale arrests and accusations of high treason.
Election laws were changed at the last minute.
There were selectively too few ballot stations, identity cards were seized, the media was not allowed to do its job and the observation of the elections was a joke.
Politically blind South African observers made absolute fools of themselves by declaring that the elections had been conducted fairly and freely.
Mugabe wants - by hook or by crook - to pursue his ill-fated policy which has led Zimbabwe to the brink of starvation, where 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line and 60% are unemployed.
Tougher sanctions must be used in order even further to isolate Mugabe internationally.
We should not punish the population for the wrong-doings of its leader.
What is the scope for tougher sanctions, according to the Commissioner?
What will the Commission propose to the European Council in Barcelona?
Unfortunately, democracy in Africa often leaves a great deal to be desired.
African solidarity with the dictator Mugabe is sadly a very bad omen.
This is why we must focus our political efforts not only on Zimbabwe, but also on the other countries in that region.
South Africa receives a great deal of aid from Europe but is unconcerned about the justified criticism levelled at its neighbour.
I pity Africa, I pity the population that has to suffer so much at the hands of incompetent, power-crazed and corrupt leaders.
When will we finally have a generation of democratic leaders in Africa?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would certainly appear that Mugabe has won the elections.
I can still remember electoral victories claimed by presidents who were very soon overtaken, and were very soon presidents no more.
I do not wish to draw any direct parallels, but it seems to me that he should not be too quick to celebrate his victory over his opponents.
Especially as the elections were held under the worst possible conditions, with intimidation, police action against members and supporters of the opposition and so on.
What saddens me is not just the situation in Zimbabwe itself, but the fact that numerous African Heads of State and Government and President Mugabe are indirectly providing a shield, even as they acknowledge his election victory.
Perhaps this hides the fear of more neo-colonialism on the part of Europe or the United States of America and other countries.
That certain parties may be entertaining such thoughts is, of course, no concern of ours.
It may be the case, but it is not the policy of the European Union.
What concerns us is the people who are starving there, who are suffering repression there.
A few days ago, I was on a jury which awarded a prize to the Nobel prize-winner Amartya Sen. This man has stated time and again that democracy and development go hand in glove and cannot be separated.
Which is why I think that the European Union should do everything it can to create democracy and the conditions for economic development here too.
We, by which I mean everyone from the European Union due to attend the session of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Cape Town, shall no doubt be addressing these concerns.
Most importantly, we must call on South Africa to do proper justice to its hugely important role in southern Africa.
Unfortunately, we shall also have to step up sanctions, despite the economic difficulties.
But, and I say it again, if his African neighbours were to work with the European Union in taking against this dictatorship, success would come quickly and we could really help the people in this sorely afflicted country.
Mr President, between 2000 and 2001, this Parliament tabled and adopted more than six motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe and today, after last weekend's elections, we are continuing to call for the rule of law and democracy to be re-established, for the process of land reform, which remains an unsettled issue, to be started and for the continuing land occupations to cease.
It was clear that, out of 15 000 independent observers, only some were given accreditation, that restrictions were imposed on the representative of the European Union and on the opposition and the European Union, therefore, considers that fraud clearly took place.
And as is so often the case, Mr President, it is the people that are suffering as a result of this situation, with more than 550 000 malnourished and more than 80% living below the poverty line, with the health and education systems collapsing and with more than 2 000 people dying every week of AIDS.
This situation will only get worse unless we continue to put pressure on the Zimbabwean Government and sanctions are imposed and the only way we can contribute to democratic change is by helping the people, whilst at the same time exerting pressure on the government.
Mr President, in this seriously flawed presidential election, we have good grounds for believing that Mugabe in reality lost the vote, but merely contrived to win the count.
He will now be able to have his foot on the neck of the Zimbabwean people for another six years.
It represents a new low for democracy in Zimbabwe and a disaster not just for Zimbabwe, but for the whole of Southern Africa.
Mugabe personifies all the most negative strains in African development: corrupt and authoritarian power with state leaders lining their pockets at the expense of the people, racial division, the exploitation of envy, political violence and economic backwardness.
Zimbabwe is a beautiful and once prosperous country with the potential to be the bread basket for the region.
Instead, the economy is in chaos, with rampant inflation and unemployment and half a million of its people living on the edge of starvation, sustained only by world food aid.
Mugabe's re-election will seriously exacerbate all of these problems.
I have to say that Mugabe realised that his game might be up some two years ago, ZANU-PF came close to losing the general election; and that is why for the past two years - not just the past two weeks - he has been trying to fix the political system in his favour by a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against anyone who opposed him.
This Parliament should pay tribute to Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC activists and all those who have had the courage to stand up to Mugabe for all this time.
I have to say it is a pity that the international community took so long to wake up to the situation in Zimbabwe and that the European Union waited until the eleventh hour before imposing targeted sanctions.
At least we in this Parliament can hold our heads up.
We have been active throughout the last two years.
The attitude of African countries has been particularly disappointing.
We always felt that South Africa, in particular, held the key to restoring genuine democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.
However, South Africa's leaders were found wanting.
They could not find it in their consciences to condemn what they perhaps saw as one of their liberation brothers.
What a pity for the people of Zimbabwe - all the people of Zimbabwe.
At least the Southern African Development Community election observer mission has felt able to recognise in its announcement yesterday that: 'the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region'.
What they mean, I think, Mr President, is that the election was clearly rigged.
Certainly, that is the opinion of the few other international observers that remained.
How else do we explain, for instance, the bizarre declaration that turnout in the city areas loyal to Tsvangirai was low, while in the ZANU-PF rural strongholds, it was remarkably high?
How else do we explain the missing ballot boxes which suddenly turn up stuffed up with Mugabe votes?
The international community must maintain its resolve.
It must not recognise the legitimacy of this election result.
There must be an intensification of the hunt for looted assets held overseas by Mugabe and his cronies.
There should be an extension of the EU blacklist, and we need to take further tough measures.
South Africa must begin to show leadership and demonstrate that it is committed to democratic principles in the region.
Our aim must be to help restore democracy, human rights and the rule of law to Zimbabwe and assist in the process of economic progress there.
Our tough resolution today is a contribution to this, and I hope the Council and the Commission will listen to us.
Mr President, the elections in Zimbabwe are a democratic joke.
The opposition's election workers have been threatened, persecuted, imprisoned and killed.
Freedom of expression is non-existent.
Many Zimbabweans queued for hours and were still not allowed to vote.
Mr Mugabe has broken promise after promise and driven his country into the ground.
Under his leadership, Zimbabwe, a country with fantastic potential, has headed straight for the abyss.
It is worrying that so many African leaders have tried to explain away what has been happening in Zimbabwe and maintained that the elections were fair.
I assume that the Foreign Ministers and the Commission will discuss Zimbabwe in Barcelona and decide upon suitable, wider sanctions and a strategy to involve the whole region.
A lot of pressure must be exerted upon South Africa.
In no way can we recognise these elections as fair.
We waited far too long before taking action against Zimbabwe.
We hoped and believed.
Our former colleague, Mr Schori, had to be thrown out of the country before the sanctions were introduced.
We must not betray those who are fighting for democracy in Zimbabwe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obstruction by the government notwithstanding, the European Union was able to follow the elections in Zimbabwe very closely and I should like to start by expressing my immense admiration of numerous people in Zimbabwe for their civil courage and for standing by their democratic convictions under such difficult circumstances.
The European Union has been observing events in Zimbabwe with growing concern.
Misgivings about the electoral process which the European Union voiced when Article 96 still applied have proven to be wholly justified.
I expect the Heads of Government will discuss this issue in Barcelona and that the European Union will be quick to make a statement on this.
Most of the election observers have come to the conclusion that the elections did not reflect the will of people of Zimbabwe and list a whole range of shortcomings in the election process.
However, we can emphasise that, however disappointing the outcome of these elections, the main point is that the international community has turned its attention to Zimbabwe and is doing everything it can to contain the crisis there.
A broad show of force would have serious, mainly regional repercussions.
In the short term, South Africa would face a refugee crisis and, in the long term, any such crisis might jeopardise regional prospects for economic growth and sustainable development, all against a backdrop of a serious food shortage.
The Commission, together with other partners, will be giving humanitarian requirements a high priority.
It is also extremely important for us to work with the SADC governments and the ACP countries in order to find a common basis for overcoming the crisis in Zimbabwe.
The European Union is planning to send a high-level troika in the near future, to discuss our misgivings about Zimbabwe with our SADC partners on the basis of our common commitment to the rule of law and democracy.
I trust that the European Parliament will be able to play an important role here.
(Applause)
Mr President, as a neighbouring state, Moldavia is a sort of foster child to us.
We have long hoped that, even with a Communist regime, this country would stick to economic development and the road towards the European Union.
That hope has now been dashed and the Communist government knew that it was playing with fire when it introduced the Russian language and made it compulsory to teach a Stalinist slant on history.
Language and culture have already sparked one military conflict in this country, which was only quelled within a few days thanks to a broad social compromise, with stability being established in the country through long-term action by the OSCE.
The government has now destroyed all that, and in one of the poorest countries in Europe.
I think it is wrong that the government is now trying to keep dragging out excuses.
We have seen this over the last few days, with the government maintaining that others are responsible for the political crisis.
It is responsible because it has tried to revoke this compromise, in one of the poorest countries in Europe.
If this country now falls into political crisis, just when it is on the verge of becoming a neighbouring country, it will also affect us, which is why I think the government urgently needs to give in, reverse these decisions and do something about creating economic and political stability in this country.
Mr President, firstly I should like to apologise for not participating in the debate earlier on account of some sad events with my stagiaire.
I am satisfied that we are finally taking the initiative and discussing Moldova.
The Liberal Group tried to do this back in January.
Everything that Mrs SchrÃ¶der said is true.
We have before us a very difficult situation which could lead to developments similar to those in Belarus.
We must be clear-sighted and see that it is Vladimir Voranin who has stopped economic reforms.
These events have led to a suspension of funding from the international institutions.
We know the means used to turn Moldova eastwards and to create problems with Romania.
For instance the Moldovan Government refused to allow the people to set up an Orthodox community attached to the Romanian Orthodox Church.
This has been condemned as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Transdniestria does not need mentioning further; we know about it and the present attitude of the government is not helping to solve the problem there.
The Christian Democrat party has been mentioned.
What has been said over the last few days in the Russian Duma, which has accused Romania of interference, is worrying.
What has been said in the Russian Duma is not accurate.
We now have a situation where a Romanian diplomat has been declared persona non grata.
This is creating a good deal of tension.
Parliament and the Commission need to focus much more on Moldova for the reasons mentioned by Mrs SchrÃ¶der.
We must avoid being confronted with a new Belarus.
We need intelligent sanctions, intelligent measures, because it is such a poor country.
Those of you who have been to that country know that the children in Moldova are the worst off in Europe.
Mr President, I agree with the two previous speakers, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs Thors.
It is time that the European Parliament took an active interest in Europe's poorest country.
The people of Moldavia have, for a long time, suffered not only poverty but also exploitation.
For example, tens of thousands of women have suffered degradation within the so-called sex industry in Western Europe.
I am personally acquainted with Iurie Rosca, Party Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, the largest opposition party in Moldavia, as well as with the deputy chairman, Vlad Cubreacov.
In common with the party's general secretary, Stefan Secareanu, who is mentioned in our resolution today, they are exposed to attacks whereby the Communist government headed by President Veronin is attempting to revoke their political immunity.
I wish to protest against the fact that, not long ago, the Justice Minister, who is also from the dominant Communist Party in Moldavia, suspended the political and financial activities of the Christian Democrats, who at present are in practice the only real opposition party in the country.
Those who are standing up for a multiparty system and for democracy in Moldavia deserve our esteem and encouragement.
The Christian Democrats have taken fundamental issues as their basic themes, including language, culture, schooling and the country's Western democratic leanings, something which has aroused the anger of the Communists.
I also wish to protest against the fact that the Bessarabian Orthodox Church in Moldavia is not allowed to operate freely.
Moldavia is a poor country in material terms.
We do not want it also to become poor in terms of democracy.
We have a big responsibility for Moldavia.
When, after the elections a year ago, a Communist government took up office in Moldavia, it was, of course, only a matter of time before that country was the subject of discussion in this Parliament, and that day has now come.
I would have preferred us to use our direct contacts with the parliament in order to raise a few issues which would possibly be the topics of debate at a later date, but I understand that some groups want to discuss this today.
It seems like a good idea to me.
It is important for the European Union to devote more attention to what is already considered Europe's poorest country.
A country riddled with problems, not only political problems, but also major social problems including those involving poverty, health care and the care of seriously disadvantaged children.
Precisely in a situation of this kind, it is, of course, very frustrating that it is the government that should be encouraging these contradictions in a country that is, in fact, disoriented, that is unable to choose between the East and the West, a country that is rather divided.
What struck me was that the recent protests were not only against the government but also mainly in favour of Europe, and this shows how the contradictions are evolving in that country.
In my view, the government has made a huge mistake by presenting controversial proposals which, precisely in the areas of language and the teaching of history, have caused a great stir.
Fortunately, the government has since realised that things are not that simple and has retracted a number of these measures, partly under pressure from the loud protest from outside Moldavia.
Today, too, we must stress that the government should realise that it should stop interfering with, and sabotaging, the opposition.
A warning has been issued about lifting the immunity of certain politicians.
This is not acceptable, in my view.
The opposition must be left alone, reflecting the dignified manner in which the opposition protested against the government measures.
What should be avoided at all costs in that country is a situation in which one group tries to force the other in a certain direction, either the direction of Russia or that of Europe.
This is something on which the people themselves must be able to decide in their own time and in a democratic climate.
I already mentioned that this debate is also an opportunity to say that the European Union should do more. I have understood that the Commission is looking into the possibility of granting more direct aid to the people in the country itself.
By aid, I mean health care, social development and such like. In my view, we can, above all, ask the government and all the people in Moldavia to create a situation in that country in which the international community can operate more effectively, for we are often very hampered in what we want to do there.
Finally, it is important in my opinion to urge the countries in that region to contribute to Moldova's stability and to help find a solution to the problem involving Transdniestria, for that is also a heavy burden resting on Moldova.
It is an issue on which Romania and Russia should exercise restraint, in my view, but to which the European Union in particular, together with the OSCE, should look to find a solution.
Mr President, Moldavia is a wretchedly poor country, it is true; but culturally it is a rich, beautiful country to the east of central Europe, linking the crisis-stricken region of the Balkans with the crisis-stricken region on the Black Sea and in the Caucasus.
That alone shows just how important this tiny country is for us in the European Union, quite apart from the fact, as Mrs Schroedter rightly pointed out, that it will border on the European Union once Romania accedes and, hopefully, will itself one day become part of the European Union.
Nor should we forget why Moldavia went down the terrible road which it has had to endure over the last few decades.
Moldavia was the victim of the Hitler/Stalin pact and, for decades afterwards, it was plundered as a European outpost of the Soviet Union.
With such a history, Moldavia does not have the strength to get back on its own feet and, as one speaker rightly said, what we have here is a very dangerous crisis waiting to happen.
On one side, Russia is directly involved via Transdniestria or the so-called Dniester Republic which, from Russia's point of view, is a sort of advance guard of nationalistic and militaristic circles in Europe while, on the other side, it has cultural and historic links with Romania, and it will become a dangerous bone of contention between an EU candidate country on one side and the European Union's most powerful neighbour on the other, unless we do everything we can to stabilise this country, by which I mean we must stand up for human rights, for the rights of our Christian democrat and other counterparts in the Moldavian Parliament who are under attack, we must stand up against neo-colonialist efforts to bring this country under control through language and by rewriting history and we must stand up for democracy and the rule of law.
I also think, Commissioner, that we should be more active than we have been in the past in helping with institution building, with establishing democratic institutions in this country.
It is in our interest to exert a stabilising influence here.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is seriously concerned about political and economic developments in the Republic of Moldavia, as my colleague Mr Patten made clear at his meeting with the Moldavian foreign secretary, Mr Dudeu, last month.
We therefore welcome this resolution by the European Union.
Moldavia is the poorest country in Europe and is still no closer to resolving its conflict with the rebel region of Transdnistria.
The Moldavian Government has refused to meet representatives of Transdnistria since last summer and a bitter fight is waging over border controls in which Ukraine has also been caught up.
An uneasy air of confrontation has recently arisen between the Communist Government of the Republic of Moldavia and the Romanian-speaking nationalists.
The reform process is suffering from constant setbacks and the IMF has refused to grant any more loans.
In the meantime, there are also worrying indications that the government is looking to Russia to resolve its problems.
The main reasons for the country's poverty are of a political nature.
The failure to resolve the Transdnistrian conflict is having a particularly serious impact.
The European Union is currently examining how it can support OSCE efforts to improve the situation.
We have set up a relatively generous aid programme.
A provisional sum of around EUR 40 million has been set aside to support this country over the next two years with technical assistance, food aid and special macro-economic financial aid.
However, we need a guarantee that Moldavia will also make an effort to put its finances on a more viable basis.
It is true that ECHO has pulled out of Moldavia because ECHO's job is to provide emergency aid, not resolve structural problems.
But even if ECHO's work can be continued using other instruments, such as TACIS, we must not forget that aid alone will not resolve political problems.
In any event, the Commission is willing and able to see what measures can be taken with the means available to help resolve the Transdnistrian conflict.
Kyrgyzstan is not yet a democracy.
There is no division of powers, and no independent judiciary power.
Human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, etc. are continuously violated.
There is an enormous abuse of power by the government, and people are thrown into prison at random under false accusations to eliminate political opponents.
There is repression against independent journalists, and the press is the government's monopoly.
What can we then expect as democrats?
Despite this, there are people who, with great courage, try to uphold democracy in their country, despite major personal risks, as Mr Beknazarov found out.
Democratically elected people, journalists and citizens who uphold the rule of law are oppressed and even subjected to torture.
But they should know that the European Union is on their side on this.
We must apply pressure on the government.
We have, in the framework of the partnership and the cooperation agreement, the chance to pressurise the government into engaging in dialogue with the opposition, ending the torture and ensuring that the country is on track to becoming one in which the rule of law applies.
Mr President, too often we have to come to this Chamber on a Thursday afternoon to make speeches we would rather not have to make.
That is certainly true today.
I have been to Kyrgyzstan several times in recent years, as it emerged from those dark days of the Soviet empire and set the pace for the region in terms of political, economic and health reforms.
I paid tribute then, as I have done since, to those periods of progress.
But in the last couple of years we have become worried about progress in that country.
President Akayev, who came from a background of the Academy of Sciences, was elected in a free vote in 1991 and re-elected in 1995, has subsequently become more of an oppressive president than a democratic one.
Both parliamentary and presidential elections in 2000 sadly highlighted the flawed nature of the electoral process.
We were concerned about candidates being banned on technicalities not least because of their knowledge of the Kyrgyz language; about the press being suppressed and repressed; about community groups being prevented from playing their part in the process.
Symbolic of all this has been the arrest of Azimbek Beknazarov, chairman of the parliamentary committee on judicial and legal reforms.
He was arrested in January and brought to trial in February.
The trial was then postponed until this month.
This is a country with many problems within its borders, including a lack of natural resources, racial tensions and incursions from abroad.
Eighty-eight per cent of its population lives on an income of under USD 4 a day.
It does not need the opprobrium that will come from world opinion if it makes a mess of its democratic processes, its independent judiciary and its freedom of speech.
That is why we move this motion today, asking them to listen.
We will be watching for results.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is violation of human rights in Kyrgyzstan, a country supported by us through the central Asian delegation to which I belong.
Time is short, so I shall address what seem to me to be two particularly important points.
First, when I visited the region, I saw clearly for myself that the people were raring to go and move towards our values.
Unlike all the countries which have since joined and will soon join the EU, the countries of central Asia are basically making their own way towards democracy, without the huge amounts in aid being received by other countries.
The only aid is TACIS.
The European Union is providing Kyrgyzstan with financial and technical assistance in setting up ministries in the agricultural and social sectors.
If you just stop to consider the different mentality, the cultural differences, religious differences and their completely different historical development, then you will begin to understand the huge difference between our and the central Asian understanding of democracy.
What I mean to say here is that we must be careful not to be too harsh on other countries in our demands for democracy and human rights.
Secondly, as partners and friends of central Asia, it is our duty to point out serious scandals in due and proper form, especially as Kyrgyzstan is in receipt of a certain amount of aid from us under the TACIS programme.
This European Parliament resolution takes account of the dilemma to which I referred.
As I said, on the one hand, a recognition of what are surely difficult circumstances and, on the other, the difficulty in establishing a working democracy which guarantees the involvement of all sections and groups of the population.
I should like to make a point of acknowledging what has been achieved so far.
However, when it comes to human rights, as Mr Bowis very impressively pointed out, there appears to be more retrogression than progression and I must express my very serious concern here.
Human rights and human dignity are the basis of a modern society and a stable democracy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission services are monitoring the human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan daily, including the cases of Felix Kulov and Topchubek Turgunaliev and now the more recent case of Beknazarov and his associates.
Of course, the Commission does not want to interfere in the legal affairs of a sovereign state, but the overkill on the part of the Kyrgyz authorities in the Beknazarov case is particularly worrying.
It includes isolation and possibly maltreatment of Mr Beknazarov on grounds which appear to boil down to professional misjudgment on his part or perhaps to professional misconduct seven years ago.
In addition, the proceedings against Mr Beknazarov have unleashed general disapproval among the people and could seriously undermine the credibility of the government and, in the end, the stability of the country.
The Commission is also alarmed by the fact that the Beknazarov case appears to be just one in an increasingly long line of judicial proceedings against the government's political opponents.
The Commission agrees with Parliament that Kyrgyzstan has put its good reputation on the line over the last two years.
The Commission has never failed, nor will it fail this time to stress just how much importance it attaches to Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement requiring contracting parties to promise to respect democracy, the principles of international law and human rights.
Mr President, Commissioner, Tunisia is a country in which there are major infringements of human rights. Sometimes the infringements appear to pass unnoticed.
The opposition is persecuted, there are at least a thousand political prisoners in jail, freedom of expression is minimal and freedom of assembly is restricted.
Journalists and workers for democracy are harassed, and lawyers are not permitted to work.
A number of Tunisian human rights campaigners have been nominated for the Sacharov Prize, and we have criticised Tunisia on several occasions in this House.
Now, there is cause to do so again.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the proceedings against Hamma Hammami and his colleagues in the banned Communist Party.
Their trial is a farce, and the way it is being conducted completely unacceptable.
There have been protests from all around the world.
Even in my own country, where Tunisia is rarely mentioned, there have been a number of indignant press articles in the last few days about the way in which the members of the Tunisian Communist Party are being treated.
Mr Hammami, Mr Madouri and Mr Taamallah decided of their own accord to come forward and stand trial.
Subsequent developments have been alarming and very far from being in accordance with the principles of a constitutional state.
The three have been maltreated, they are not allowed to see their lawyers, and the trial itself is one big legal farce.
We are agreed that they are prisoners of conscience who must be treated decently and in a manner appropriate to a constitutional state.
The trial is to begin again on 30 March and, until then, they should be set free.
Because they themselves have given themselves up, that is only right.
We must send a message to Tunisia to the effect that we are keeping an eye on the country and watching the trial, which we shall be following extremely closely.
The EU must address the issues of Tunisia and of human rights in the Association Agreements and in the context of cooperation.
We have been silent for too long about these issues.
We make tough demands on ourselves and on the candidate countries, but almost no such demands upon Tunisia.
That must not continue.
Human rights issues must be highlighted in our continued contacts with Tunisia.
We must stop grovelling to Ben Ali.
Above all, attention must be given to this case.
Mr President, Tunisia made a commitment to respect human rights and it is a key element of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement.
We now believe, however, that these undertakings, which were reiterated at the Association Council session of 29 January, have been flouted by the way in which Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants are being treated by the Tunisian Government.
The defendants, who voluntarily came out of hiding, a state in which they were forced to live following their infamous trials in 1997 and 1998, were again convicted on 2 February before the Court of First Instance and their sentence was confirmed in a farcical judicial hearing which, unfortunately, confirms the serious defects in the rule of law that has been in force in Tunisia for several years.
Two hundred lawyers gathered in support of the defence.
They were set upon by the police and the prisoners were violently assaulted.
Hamma Hammami began a hunger strike on 26 February to protest against the conditions in which he is being detained.
He was moved to the area in Tunis prison that is reserved for those sentenced to death, despite the fact that he is a political prisoner.
This situation is in breach of the Treaties, particularly Article 2 of the Association Agreement with the European Union on the respect of human rights.
It is now crucial that, a few weeks before the start of the Conference on Foreign Affairs (Barcelona V), which is being held in Valencia on 22 and 23 April, we, as Members of the European Parliament, call upon the Tunisian authorities to release Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants.
This is a first step which is essential for the respect of the rule of law in Tunisia.
We also call on the Commission to demand that the Tunis authorities comply with international law and to instruct its parliamentary delegation to raise this subject more firmly with the Tunisian Government.
In 1999, Mr Hamma Hammami and three other leaders of the Tunisian Communist Party were convicted in absentia for dissident activity.
Last month, after the defendants surrendered to the authorities, those sentences were confirmed in less than one minute without a presentation of evidence by the prosecution or defence or an examination of the witnesses.
There are also accusations of widespread abuses by the government against other dissident groups.
Democracy and the rule of law are attributes enjoyed until recently by few countries even in Europe.
They take time to evolve and can appear fragile in the face of threats.
In states such as Tunisia, it may seem an achievement merely to resist the kind of radical socialism or Islamicism that has blighted the lives of so many in the Arab world in recent decades.
We ourselves have to be careful, when we urge greater pluralism and respect for democratic norms around the world, that we do not undermine governments which, however imperfect, are moving in that direction.
I believe, however, that the EU has an important role to play in helping to provide an example for countries which want to move away from a spiral of poverty, extremism and repression.
Nor can we entirely isolate ourselves from the problems experienced by neighbouring countries such as Tunisia.
By encouraging economic and political reform together with foreign direct investment, and with respect for good government, democracy and human rights, we help others and we also help ourselves, by reducing not only the resentment often felt against the West in the Arab world, but also the migratory pressures that are generating serious problems in our own societies and which themselves require urgent solutions.
For that reason, it is right for the French Government to highlight the importance of giving aid to the Maghreb countries, many of whose citizens are settled in London, which I represent, as migrants or refugees.
It is also right to begin to open EU markets, including our agricultural markets, to poorer countries that wish to trade with us, in ways that benefit them more directly and prevent future migratory pressures by the long-term stabilisation of their own economies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, convicted in absentia in 1999 to nine years and three months in prison for membership of an illegal association, incitement to civil disobedience, distribution of pamphlets inciting violence and dishonestly spreading false information liable to disrupt public order, Hamma Hammami came out of hiding in order to challenge this judgment on 2 February 2002.
At the end of an eventful trial punctuated with incidents, the Court of First Instance in Tunis confirmed the original verdict and ordered the accused Hamma Hammami to be imprisoned.
The appeal trial began on Saturday 9 March before a number of foreign observers, including journalists, Western diplomats posted to Tunis, barristers from France, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as delegates from human rights organisations.
A dozen lawyers appealed, one after the other, to the bar to request to be given time to read through the dossier that they had been unable to access and to deplore the fact that they had been prevented from visiting their client as under normal circumstances.
After some deliberation, the Court of Appeal postponed the trial until 30 March and refused the request to release the accused men.
These are the facts.
The European Union has expressed to the Tunisian authorities its concern regarding the human rights violations, but has merely hinted at the fact that these violations may compromise its Association Agreement with Tunisia, which was the first bilateral pact between the European Union and a Mediterranean country and which was signed three years ago.
Last January, Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, met with the Tunisian authorities in Tunis whilst on an official visit to North Africa.
In a speech that he gave on that occasion, Mr Prodi stated that the negotiations related to trade and cooperation.
Instead of taking this opportunity, whilst speaking publicly, to raise the issue of human rights, Mr Prodi welcomed the economic reforms undertaken in Tunisia.
He stressed that the European Union respects the political sovereignty of Tunisia and does not wish to interfere in Tunisia's internal affairs.
However, at a meeting held in June in Tunis with President Ben Ali and the Prime Minister, Mohammed Ganouch, the European Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, paid more attention to the issue of human rights.
On 14 December 2000, the European Parliament adopted a resolution engaging the European institutions to use all the means provided for by the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights and, whereas the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement lays down the promotion of human rights as a key element, it regrets the fact that this frank and open dialogue had not sufficed to encourage the Tunisian authorities to advance along the path of democracy and human rights.
Mr President, I ask you to ensure that this resolution be forwarded to the Council and to the Commission and to the Tunisian Government and parliament for its information, and that we stress that we will follow events closely in the run-up to 30 March.
Mr President, once again, the House is due to vote on human rights violations in Tunisia and today we are dealing with the conviction of three activists from the Communist Workers' Party of Tunisia.
After four years of living in hiding, the three activists decided to appear freely before the court in order to challenge their sentence in a court of law.
The trial of 2 February, as other Members have said, was a sham.
The defendants were seized from their seats, taken away by the police during the court proceedings, and swiftly condemned to harsh prison sentences - Hamma Hammami was sentenced to nine years and three months. These men were not given the chance to defend themselves and were not given access to their lawyers.
All this happened before a number of Tunisian and foreign observers and protesters.
They are being detained in a civilian prison in disgraceful conditions.
This trial is a real parody of justice.
In response to this situation, the Tunisian Lawyers Council declared a strike.
Hamma Hammami and Abdel Jabarmadouri decided to go on hunger strike in protest at their conditions of detention and to demand that their lawyers be given the right of visit.
These events are part of a continuing campaign of intimidation and repression, which targets political opponents, human rights protesters, journalists, trade unionists, students, lawyers and magistrates.
We note that the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, stipulating that relations between the two parties are based on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, has once again been flouted.
We ask for an exceptional meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council to be organised as soon as possible to tackle the issue of human rights.
Parliament must demand the release of Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants, and that Article 2 of the Agreement be respected.
The Council and the Commission must use all the means provided for by the agreement in order to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights in Tunisia.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, large numbers of Europeans from my country like to holiday in Tunisia, where they find beautiful beaches, a beautiful landscape and a different culture and where, thanks to the security precautions taken in Tunisia, they feel safe.
Nonetheless, we cannot overlook and we are deeply saddened by the repeated violation of human rights in Tunisia, the most recent case being the sentence passed on Hamma Hammami and his colleagues.
These human rights violations were really not necessary, not in a country like Tunisia.
The type of trial, the procedures surrounding the trial and the argument which Tunisia keeps on using, that democracy is being established, that slow progress is being made is, more is the pity, just not true.
Or the steps, the progress being made, is so small as to be indiscernible.
