That is a highly complex problem and has to do with society as a whole; it is not one that can be done away with by censoring advertising.
What really is wrong, and, as I understand it, stupid, is to take the line that individual foods need to be rated.
So do you eat dry cornflakes all day?
I do not.
It is not least thanks to our opposition â of which I am rather proud â that our cause is not completely lost.
MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone has listed all the things we have achieved.
We have, in particular, managed to save fresh products.
It would not even have been permissible to describe fruit as healthy without it being tested scientifically, in a manner appropriate to the individual type, at the point of sale, which just goes to show how ridiculous the whole approach is.
We have also managed to rescue cough lozenges; how embarrassing that we had to do that.
We have also built in safeguard clauses for SMEs; how embarrassing that we had to do that, that there are laws that need that to be done to them, for it shows up all the pious speeches for the lies they are.
Commissioner Verheugen has just delivered yet another one.
This law will make SMEs suffer; it will cost jobs.
It will make laws null and void, and will bring the consumer no additional benefit, for it will do nothing to reduce obesity and we already have laws to protect consumers from misleading advertising.
The Council and the Commission know all that, yet they are standing in this Houseâs way like a wall of concrete, shoulder to shoulder together in a way I have never seen before.
The impression I get is that the Council is under the thumb of officials in the Commission â officials who themselves always want to make more policy, officials with legitimacy conferred on them by nothing and nobody, but whom the public pays well; not controlled by the public, but paid well by them, and it is the public who, at the end of the day, must pick up the tab.
It is the public who will pay the price for this law, and that price will be paid in jobs lost.
This law is the very opposite of what is always being talked about in the Commissionâs fine speeches about cutting back bureaucracy, better lawmaking, the Lisbon agenda, and all the rest of it.
This law is likely to make the public far more eurosceptic than they already are.
I think that is something we cannot allow, and we have no option but to vote in favour tomorrow in order not to end up with something quite terrible.
That is what I said at the outset, but I am persuaded that there is still something that can be done in the face of this bureaucratic madness.
I will be calling on the German Government to examine whether it might be able to take legal action against this regulation.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone.
I think that, along with her, the Council and among ourselves, we have reached a sound compromise.
I am also indebted to MrsÂ Sommer and the other groups that have played a part in this.
Many consumers are anxious about their health, about cholesterol and blood pressure, or wrestle with excess weight.
The food industry is cashing in on this.
There is a proliferation of all kinds of claims.
This morning, I enjoyed a sandwich that is beneficial for my intestinal flora, with a covering of butter that reduces my cholesterol and an egg that contains high levels of Omega 3.
Perfect âŠ or at least that is what I think, for I do not know.
Consumers do not know whether the claims manufacturers make are true, and that is why this legislative proposalâs stipulation that the health claims which food manufactures make must be scientifically underpinned is so crucial.
We must avoid consumers being taken for a ride.
Consumers are often prepared to pay more for a product that claims to benefit their health, but they should be able to be confident that it really does.
Whilst misleading advertisements are already banned, the burden of proof has so far been with the authorities.
Of course, this does not work in practice.
It is impossible for governments to constantly check claims on packaging and then to disprove them.
This proposal will benefit consumers, in that manufacturers in all 25 countries must from now on provide honest information.
At first reading, Parliament gave in to pressure from businesses that were scared of being exposed, businesses that deliberately mislead consumers by painting a different picture, and they cannot in any way count on my sympathy.
No profits on the back of people who are worried about their weight or health.
The internal market should not be a licence for leading consumers up the garden path, something which, fortunately, the compromise recognises to a large extent.
Deception comes in many guises.
According to ArticleÂ 4, health claims can only be made on products that meet a certain profile.
I would like to assure MrsÂ Sommer that those food profiles do exist.
They are used in the United States.
All major enterprises apply them and they work very well.
It is also appropriate that food claims can only be added to products that are, in principle, healthy.
After all, the greasy hamburger will not suddenly become a health food only by adding a few vitamins.
Nor will the sugary lollypop by adding vitamin A.
The compromise rejects health claims on alcohol, which will only be allowed where the alcohol percentage or calorie level is reduced.
If one considers all the problems involving alcoholism, including liver damage and brain damage, it is hard to allow health claims on alcohol.
Luckily, all parties were prepared to support this proposal in the end.
At first reading, it transpired that the proposal is unnecessarily bureaucratic.
This position was also shared by our group, although we did want sufficient guarantees for adequate procedures.
These are now in place.
There is now a weighty authorisation procedure for claims directed at children and claims that pertain to reduced health risks.
Our group is behind the consumer and well-meaning enterprises.
This legislation ensures that consumers are given honest information.
I would express the hope and expectation that this legislation will contribute to better food and better health.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, the aim of the proposed regulation on nutrition and health claims is to harmonise European legislation in that area.
That should combine two elements: firstly, introducing the general rule that in the interests of consumers, nutrition and health claims must be clear, accurate and meaningful; secondly, protection of truthful producers from unfair competitors.
After a very controversial debate we now have a compromise package for second reading.
Does it meet the original aims?
We believe it does.
We may not be entirely happy with the result, but we have to take into consideration various interests such as the fears of small and medium-sized enterprises, the danger of procedures that are too long and too bureaucratic, the interests of producers and genetic descriptors â provided the main objective of improving public health is maintained.
Some of the restrictions proposed by the Commission were unclear and open to interpretation.
In order to avoid legal uncertainty, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments, inserting clauses designed to make application of the regulation easier.
Some of them have become part of the compromise package that the ALDE Group supports, together with other political groups.
On one of the two most controversial issues â nutrient profiles and in particular the derogation in Article 4(2) â we consider that a workable compromise has been reached.
Therefore we wish to support the wording of Amendment 17.
The same goes for the proposal concerning trademarks and brands and for ArticleÂ 4(3) on nutrition claims about alcohol, linked to the provision that health claims supporting national authority or Community messages about the dangers of the misuse of alcohol should not fall within the scope of the regulation.
This is a good result.
I should like, in particular, to thank Mrs Poli Bortone for her successful work.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, MrsÂ Scheele and Mrs Poli Bortone, for all the work they have done on these two very important reports.
As with the other speakers, my remarks concern the report on nutritional and health claims.
This is an issue on which I am pleased to say Parliament has performed a great U-turn.
This time last year this House voted by a majority to follow the industry line and deleted elements which were absolutely central to the effectiveness of this legislation.
The purpose of the whole proposal was almost totally undermined, but now, at second reading, we have been able to reach a compromise agreement, as the rapporteur said, which reinstates the crucial points and takes us much closer to our original aim: to outlaw untrue and misleading health and nutrition claims on food that deceive consumers into thinking that those foods are good for them when they are not.
The Verts/ALE Group has supported the system of authorising claims through an effective and efficient process.
We have supported clear labelling, consumer involvement, banning health or nutritional claims on alcoholic drinks, as others have mentioned, and many of the other items on which we will be voting tomorrow.
This new law will make a big difference to peopleâs everyday lives, because food is a very political issue.
What can be more political than people being able to choose what food they eat?
People have a right to be confident that labels on food mean what they say.
It is not just a question of honesty on the part of food companies; it is also a question of health.
People are much more aware nowadays of the need for a healthy, balanced diet and they are much more careful about the food they buy.
Food manufacturers spend a thousand times more on marketing than governments spend on fighting obesity.
It is time we redressed that balance, and tightening these rules will play a part in that.
Â Â  . Mr President, following the scandalous outcome about health claims at first reading, Parliament is now being given a second chance.
It appears that the tenacious lobby of food and particularly the drinks industry has not been as effective this time round.
Or is it perhaps the case that the Members are simply embarrassed about the fact that for once, the Council was more progressive than Parliament?
The compromise proposal that is now before us contains a few valid points, banning health claims on alcohol being an obvious one.
The food profiles are back and will hopefully at any rate prevent the most scandalous health claims.
The protection of the consumer against false claims will, alas, be far from watertight.
There are still many loopholes in the law that make false claims possible.
Moreover, I have serious doubts about the very influential part to be played by the European Food Safety Agency, the independence of which is regularly called into question.
In other areas, such as GMOs and aspartame, the EFSA is happy to take industryâs line.
However imperfect this proposal may be, though, it is at any rate a great improvement on the sad outcome at first reading.
Moreover, without a compromise, we run the risk of dragging this issue behind us for many years to come.
Since it is unacceptable that consumers should be kept in the dark for that long, my group will be supporting the compromise proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to express thanks to MrsÂ Scheele and MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone for their contributions towards both agreements at the draft stage.
With regard to the report on additives, I regret that due to that agreement, it is no longer possible here in the plenary to thrash out the usefulness of, and need for, certain additives.
While the usefulness of a number of substances has been proven beyond any doubt, I still have my doubts as regards fluoride being added, for example.
That is also one of the reasons why some of my group will not be backing this agreement.
As for the food and health claims, I should like to say that I will back the result that has been achieved during negotiations.
Amendments tabled by this House at first reading have already improved many of the points in the common position.
I would refer to the opportunities which companies have to submit applications in their own Member States, as well as to a reduction in the timeframes.
I should like to ask Commissioner Kyprianou when the Commission thinks the food profiles will be ready and what role it thinks Parliament could play in formulating them.
Finally, I should like to add that I fully endorse the agreement on food claims and hope that this can be fleshed out properly in the Member States, so that consumers can enjoy effective protection.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to congratulate warmly my group colleague, Mrs Poli Bortone, upon reaching this stage of negotiations with what seems like a fruitful result for consumers.
It was an extremely arduous task.
At a time when the average EU citizen is getting heavier and up to 27% of European men, 32% of European women and a staggering one-quarter of Europeâs children are now obese, I warmly welcome the European Unionâs initiative in tackling obesity through a very important first step: the addressing of nutrition and health claims on food.
For far too long consumers have been influenced by marketing and advertising, much of which was without any basis.
At present, consumers are faced with a deluge of marketing ploys in order to entice them to purchase food products.
Often, the nutritional health claims on food products are not entirely accurate or honest.
A varied and balanced diet is a prerequisite for good health and individual products have a relative importance in the context of the overall diet.
Now we are in the process of voting through a system that will provide confidence to consumers on a product-by-product basis, with nutritional and health claims based on scientific evidence.
Ill health as a result of obesity is costing taxpayers millions of euro each year and exerting extreme pressure on health services.
The health problems associated with obesity are well known: heart disease, strokes, high cholesterol and diabetes top the list.
Common reasons cited are overeating and lack of exercise, but the problem is far wider than that.
Immediate action must be taken.
This is only the tip of the iceberg for European citizens.
In tandem with clear and substantiated nutritional health claims we also need to focus on organising a general information campaign on nutrition issues and the importance of acquiring healthy eating habits in a timely fashion.
Todayâs consumer is under pressure to prepare meals quickly.
We are becoming more and more dependent on processed foods.
I also welcome the increased support to SMEs.
I am delighted that they will get support and appropriate technical guidance and tools to help them in due time.
Â Â  IÂ would like to thank my colleague MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone for the effort she has put into the report on nutritional and health claims which is now with us for aÂ second reading.
This directive is extremely important at aÂ time when Europe has high levels of obesity and disease which would not exist if we ate in aÂ more healthy way.
We must shift the emphasis to consumer awareness, and therefore to food labelling that is not misleading.
If aÂ food is labelled as low-calorie this must be based on facts, without misleading the consumer.
The recommendations of so-called âindependentâ doctors or experts are often just an advertising ploy with no basis in fact.
If aÂ food product has aÂ high calcium content, which promotes bone growth, it is unacceptable call it âhealthyâif it also contains large amounts of fats and sugar.
Equally, low-fat yoghurt cannot be called healthy if it contains 100g of sugar.
Chocolate spreads cannot claim to be good for children just because they are full of vitamins and minerals.
Consumers read the ingredients on food packaging and often base their choice on what the package says.
Nutritional and health claims must be there to inform, not to misinform them.
My intention is not to have these products removed from the market, but they should not be promoted as healthy on the basis of dubious health and nutrition information.
This regulation will stimulate innovation.
Producers will have to produce food that really is healthy, and will therefore strive to reduce the amounts of fat, sugar or salt in their products.
IÂ also agree with the rapporteur on Amendments 28 and 31 which put particular emphasis on childrenâs food, where labelling controls must be tightest.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am shadow rapporteur for the Regulation on additives and I must therefore begin by saying that the Commissionâs proposal was reasonably balanced.
Nevertheless, MrsÂ Scheele has done excellent work in bringing points of view together and I would therefore like to congratulate her.
I would also like to thank the Council and the Commission for the efforts they have made in order to reach an agreement at second reading.
The consumption of enriched foods within a varied diet can supplement the ingestion of nutrients.
The important thing is that the fortification be based on scientific criteria and that all of the agri-food industries be subject to the same rules with the least possible bureaucracy.
The aim of this proposal is to harmonise the national provisions in force and we in my group do not therefore agree with accepting provisions allowing for stricter rules in certain countries, except where they are justified scientifically for public health reasons.
I believe that it is right to have extended the time limit for marketing for certain products already on the market and labelled on the date on which the Regulation enters into force.
Finally, the food available to us is extremely varied, and we are not going to put an end to obesity by means of rules and labels.
In order to do that, perhaps what we should do is ban the TV remote control.
The solution is much more complex.
Foodstuffs must be healthy and the consumers must be given accurate information.
The really important thing is for each person to choose their diet according to the life they lead.
Education is therefore much more important than any rule we may lay down in an attempt to put an end to obesity.
With regard to the report by MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone, both she and the shadow rapporteurs, MrsÂ Sommer in particular, have done excellent work.
The explanatory statement of this proposal for a Regulation emphasises the lack of specific Community provisions as one of the principal reasons for this new Regulation, and I agree with that.
Nevertheless, wine, for example, is an agricultural product that is governed by a very thorough common organisation of the market, which prevents nutrition and health claims on its labelling, which regulates advertising, which regulates promotion, and which regulates absolutely everything.
There is therefore no justification for regulating what is already regulated and it will merely confuse the consumers and complicate the legislation even further, not to mention the complications it will entail for producing companies.
Wine must not be subject to this Regulation and I do not understand why producing countries such as Spain, France or Italy have not expressed these arguments in the Council.
I also regret that we have missed the opportunity to amend the annexes.
I shall end simply by expressing my full agreement with everything that MrsÂ Sommer has said.
Â Â  I wish to join in thanking the rapporteurs, MrsÂ Scheele and MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council for the work they have done on ensuring that, tomorrow, we have an agreement on which to adopt a position and that will make it much simpler for consumers to make healthier choices, because they have access to more accurate and more comprehensive information.
Many of us have undoubtedly bought breakfast cereal, bread or yoghurt that, when we were in the shop, we understood to be extremely healthy.
When we have come home, we have discovered that the yoghurt may not have contained any fat but, instead, contained a large quantity of sugar.
It is not by chance that many of us have been placed in this position.
Companies know that we wish to make healthy choices and therefore do everything to make food appear beneficial, even if it is sometimes the very opposite of that.
A familiar device is for the manufacturer to select an individual ingredient perceived by consumers to be beneficial and then to emphasise this using large thick letters, at the same time as using microscopic lettering to state, for example, the sugar and fat content.
The agreement on which we shall vote tomorrow may put an end to these and many other types of misleading advertisement.
Statements about health benefits need to be substantiated scientifically and not be made about products that, considered as a whole, are not good for peopleâs health.
If, in future, companies wish to highlight the presence in an item of food of a particular ingredient that people perceive as beneficial, then that item of food should not, in principle, have an unduly high sugar, fat, salt or alcohol content.
Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done on this regulation, and we shall monitor future work carefully and, in particular, the preparation of nutrient profiles.
I and many others in my group are extremely proud of this agreement, but we are also prepared, if need be, to come back with further requirements designed to make it more stringent.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if all goes well tomorrow, our Parliament will give the green light to these two new regulations in the food sector.
One is designed to bring some order to the jungle of foods and of drinks that are fortified, for example, with vitamins; the other is designed to authorise or to ban, under certain conditions, nutrition and health claims that increasingly appear on these very products.
We are concerned here with two proposals that genuinely speak to Europeans and, with a view to helping them choose what to buy, provide them with concrete answers regarding the trust to be placed in these claims.
BEUC points out, in actual fact, that 60% of consumers believe that a calcium-rich product can only be good for a balanced diet, something that is not necessarily true.
In reality, the only way not to make a mistake is to know the full composition of a food or drink product, its sugar, salt and fat content; that is why we need nutrient profiling, real nutrient profiling and not cut-price profiling.
That is what is proposed to us in the shape of compromise 66, the famous disclosure clause, which in reality proposes giving both the red light and the green light to the same package. As far as I am concerned, this is the height of contradiction, a move designed to make the consumer as confused as possible and, on that point, I do not agree for once with our rapporteurâs analysis.
That being said, I shall abstain on this issue so as not to block this text, which is urgent.
I have already said on numerous occasions that I am opposed to this Article 4 being toned down in any way and to certain messages praising the virtues of alcohol being authorised.
I am therefore opposed to both AmendmentÂ 18 and AmendmentÂ 489.
I should, of course, like to thank our two rapporteurs, MrsÂ Poli Bortone and MrsÂ Scheel, and the Commission and the Council. They have grasped the full importance of these citizen-friendly laws, while taking into account, as has been pointed out, the anxieties often expressed by SMEs, as well as the need to work in this Chamber for the general interest and to resist certain specific interests.
I believe that, in one part of her speech, MrsÂ Sommer set the tone of the debate by making what I felt were harsh and unwarranted criticisms of the work of the Commission and of our Commissioner.
You will therefore allow me to conclude, at this point, that we have nothing to gain from European law being drafted at the International Sweets and Biscuits Fair in Cologne.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone, with her report, is giving this House another dose of good sense and I rejoice in the hope that we will, tomorrow, get the green light and will at last be able to give consumer protection renewed impetus.
What is at issue today is the need for more honesty.
Do we want to allow consumers to have excessively fatty, over-sweetened or over-salted foods palmed off on them by businesses that are then allowed to get away with boasting about the health benefits?
Nobody wants to ban the sale of chips, coca-cola or sweets, but we cannot allow these foods to be sold on the pretext that they contribute to health and wellness.
Nor are we talking in terms of bans on advertising, but only of new marketing rules.
What we need is minimum standards that ensure honesty in marketing.
Harmonised rules make for legal certainty and that is to the benefit of the businesses as much as of anyone else.
A survey revealed that 70% of consumers had confidence in the health-related claims made by manufacturers, and that is what makes this regulation a key piece of legislation, not only in terms of greater transparency in consumer protection, but also of improved health protection.
At present, over 200 million adults and 14 million children in the European Union are overweight or suffering from obesity.
There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence, especially among children, of diabetes II, which is attributable to nutritional factors.
It is because we are facing the possibility of obesity and lack of exercise dislodging smoking from its statistical position as the number one cause of death that we regard this compromise as a good one, and as a good package.
I would have liked to see more objectivity and greater honesty in this debate; in Germany alone, we are contending with nutrition-related problems that are costing us EURÂ 71 billion, and that makes clear that this is something we have to address.

I also hope that the German Federal Government will not act on MrsÂ Sommerâs suggestion and lodge an appeal; any government â not just the German one â that appealed against something after having agreed to it in the Council would make itself look ridiculous and lose credibility, and so I hope that tomorrow will see us achieving a milestone in our quest for more protection for consumers and for their health.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs.
During the first reading of the report on nutrition and health claims made on foods, we â as the European Parliament â approved a large number of amendments designed to facilitate the application of the present regulation for the benefit of consumers.
The majority voted against regulation of the nutritional ingredients in food and rejected Article 4, thereby considerably weakening the regulation in question.
This regulation should, above all, aim to make consumers more aware of the importance of a healthy, balanced and harmonious diet.
This is the reason why we should all agree with the Council's common position, which is why I continue to support it as a starting position.
However, given the difficulty in achieving a compromise and the need for European consumers for there to be such a regulation, I call for us all to at least support the package of compromise amendments.
In this way, we shall be able to secure proper information for European consumers.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that the Irish Government has mass-medicated my people with disodium monofluorophosphate for 40Â years.
The fluoride put in Irish water is a toxic waste.
Although it is added in levels that seem small, it accumulates in our bodies over time.
The practice of water fluoridation has blighted the health of the Irish people with conditions like skeletal fluorosis: fluoride seeks calcium, especially the bones.
It also causes conditions like a hypo- or underactive thyroid; fluoride was once used as a medication to suppress the thyroid.
It causes dental fluorosis, damage to the tooth enamel, which is symptomatic of fluoride poisoning in childhood.
A recent study revealed that 40% of young Irish adults demonstrate permanent and unsightly tooth mottling and staining related to dental fluorosis.
These are just some of the conditions that a steady accumulation of fluoride has inflicted on the Irish people.
In a review of the water fluoridation policy by the Irish Government a few years ago, 90% of the public submissions called for an end to this mass-medication.
Fluoride, as we use it in Ireland, is a toxic waste taken from the scrubbers of an artificial fertilizer factory, which also contain poison like mercury and cadmium.
It is unthinkable that we in this Parliament will allow fluoride â a toxin â to be included in a list of acceptable vitamins and minerals.
It is neither a vitamin nor a mineral.
In food and water it is a curse.
To avoid confusion, fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash is considered a cosmetic and is not affected by my amendment.
It only affects fluoride in food and water.
I beg my fellow Members to help the Irish people and vote for that amendment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, so-called âfunctionalâ foods, those fortified substances that are supposed to improve the health or well-being of consumers, constitute one of the most innovative sectors, with the most room for market growth.
We must therefore ensure that checks are carried out on this type of food and, above all, on the claims made on labels, which entice the consumer by promising benefits in terms of diet and health.
The compromise text guarantees clear and comprehensive information in relation to food labels and enables consumers to make an informed choice about their diet.
This measure is made all the more urgent if one considers the impact of advertising on children.
Advertising, in actual fact, directly influences childrenâs food preferences and changes their consumption patterns.
Furthermore, thanks to the measures taken by Parliament, due attention has been paid to SMEs, which must be supported if they are to adapt to the changes introduced by the regulation and which will consequently be able to rely both on definite time periods in which to place their own products on the market and on the possibility of using pre-authorised claims.
Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone, for the excellent, though not easy, job she has done.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the House for taking up this topic.
The regulation on nutrition and health claims on foods and the regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to foods are significant for consumer protection.
They give the consumer the opportunity to make the right decisions regarding the purchase of many foodstuffs.
They create better conditions for fair competition among those producing and supplying food to our market.
They facilitate a better diet which will then translate into better physical shape and health.
Adopting these regulations will be, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.
Â Â  Mr President, the previous debate in this Chamber was about the screening of proposals for legislation.
I suspect that if that had been in force before this health claims proposal came up, this one might have fallen at the first hurdle.
In fact it nearly did fall at the first parliamentary hurdle and for that reason I congratulate our rapporteur and our shadow rapporteurs who worked with the Commission officials to improve the original proposal.
That is why we feel able to support the compromise tomorrow.
However, we are still legislating in the dark when it comes to nutrient profiling, and that is not a good way of legislating.
We do not know how this will be achieved; we do not know how EFSA will run it.
We have to rely on the experts sorting it out after this measure has left this Parliament, and whatever they sort out will not come back to this Parliament for approval, so that is not good legislation.
Nevertheless, I think we can say that what consumers want â and they are the only vested interest that matters â is confidence in the terminology of claims, such as low salt, high in polyunsaturates, and so on. We want to make sure that negatives are not concealed behind positives and we want to make sure that the whole picture is honestly portrayed.
Ultimately, any claim must stand up in court based on the science which purports to support it.
So, I think we have made progress on those issues.
We have removed some of the health claim anomalies â not least, may I say, on light ale, which no more claimed that people would become light than a cough sweet claims that people will cough.
We hope that the Council will agree to our amendments because we want sensible information in sensible format, which will lead to a better chance of people choosing a healthy diet and thus enhancing their own health and that of their families.
Â Â  Mr President, I am going to speak on the report by Mrs Poli Bortone.
I welcome this legislation because we need it.
Just look around the shelves in supermarkets and see what is claimed on so many products, including an increasing range of sweets and confectionery â some of those claims are frankly absurd.
We have heard again tonight people in this House claiming that we do not need this legislation, that it is about the nanny state.
However, what on earth can be wrong with asking manufacturers who make health and nutritional claims to give the scientific evidence for those claims?
A recent survey carried out in my region by the National Consumersâ Association, Which, showed that 99% of people want health claims on food checked before the food goes on sale.
Indeed, many are quite surprised to find that the claims are not checked properly.
We have heard a lot of talk about Article 4, with people saying that we do not need it, that nutritional profiling cannot be done.
Of course nutritional profiling can be done: experts have done it and it is being done in the United States.
We must move away from the idea of banning this or that.
Nothing will be banned, but what you will not be able to do is to make a claim for a food substance if it is clearly not a healthy option for people.
As my colleague Mrs Westlund said, people are fed up with buying so-called low-fat products only to discover by reading very carefully that they are high in sugar or some other ingredients.
This legislation will mean that all claims should be based on sound and solid evidence.
Responsible retailers and manufacturers I have met welcome it.
We seem to forget that without European standards we will have a plethora of national standards, and that is not good news for business.
This is good for business, it is good for consumers and we should welcome it.
Â Â  â Mr President, even though the Council ignored this Houseâs abundantly clear vote on the health claims at first reading, we have now reached a compromise that I â albeit with gritted teeth â will vote to accept, for, as MrsÂ Sommer so rightly said, we are now, in practical terms, being faced with the choice between a great evil and a lesser one.
Turning specifically to two contentious points, I do believe that trademarks are subject to a different legal regime, are covered by other regulations and are quite out of place here.
As for nutrient profiles, whilst the compromise has made it possible for the profiles to be prevented from having a prohibitive effect, we are nonetheless a long way off making the right deletion, as we did at first reading.
I remain convinced that nutrient profiles are a misguided concept.
Obesity and excess weight are problems that need to be taken very seriously; they are the subjects of emotional debates that will be with us again â by the time of the Green Paper on the promotion of healthy eating at the latest.
I would like, at this juncture, to briefly jump ahead and say that advertising does not make people fat.
The causes of obesity are multifarious and highly complex, and it is not by imposing more bans that we will successfully address them.
We should seek the solution in cooperation with the food industry rather than in opposition to it.
Â Â  Mr President, this is just another piece of legislation that seeks to increase the authority of the EU over Member States.
We already have Directive 2002/46/EC, which requires safe upper levels for food supplements.
However, those limits have not yet been published.
A better example of EU incompetence would be hard to find.
Despite this, the EU juggernaut carries on with its overbearing legislation, which only serves to destroy small businesses and removes freedom of choice from the consumer.
The UK has had enough of this misinformed interference.
At present there is Private Membersâ Bill going through Westminster, calling for the UK to be freed from the directive I mentioned relating to food supplements.
I hope it succeeds and thus sets a precedent that is the beginning of the end in the UK for the authority of these damaging and unnecessary regulations.
That would be a significant step towards the UKâs withdrawal from the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this regulation takes as its starting point the need to tackle obesity and promote healthy eating, and that is something one cannot do other than agree with, but what we are presented with here is characterised by nothing more than a high degree of bureaucracy, which does little to achieve the objective and, in fact, simply asserts that there are bad food producers, consumers who cannot take responsibility for themselves, and foods both bad and good, the bad ones containing salt, fat and sugar, a state of affairs which nutrient profiles are now to put right.
If you, Commissioner, really had taken note of what Parliament proposed at first reading, you would have been able to achieve all these lofty objectives, of which I am in favour, and it would have been possible without red tape and burdensome impositions, for these nutrient profiles are beyond my comprehension, and I cannot forget how MrÂ Podger from the Food Safety Authority said quite clearly that he did not know how he was meant to arrive at them.
It is for that reason that we are, with this proposal, legislating in the dark, out of touch with reality, with what is going on in society and with the public, to whom it will be very, very difficult to explain this bureaucratic endeavour.
We can of course turn round and say that we want all data from now on to have a sound scientific basis, which is what everyone wants, but this legislation will not give it to us, and that is why it is not actually a very good idea that we should adopt it in its present form, and it was not well-advised of the Commission and the Council to submit exactly the same proposal, for a second time, at second reading, for it was Parliamentâs first response after first reading that was the basis for further discussion that would achieve our objective.
What we are now embarking on is the suppression of competition and of the market economy, and I do not think that will do our society any good.
Â Â  Mr President, the regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to food is a most important piece of legislation and has a very significant bearing on the safety and wellbeing of consumers in the EU.
MrsÂ Scheele is to be congratulated on the excellent way she has dealt with the subject.
Congratulations are also due to the Commissioner, Mr Kyprianou, for the open and responsibly cautious way he has approached the subject.
The reason for my short contribution is to add my voice of support concerning the need for bio-availability and establishment of safe maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals, as well as the need for an accurate but fully comprehensible system of labelling and consumer information.
Especially with regard to the latter, it is absolutely imperative that European consumers must be able to have at their disposal and be able to read and understand scientifically proven and honest information.
That may, after all, be essential in order to protect themselves and their families against ingesting excessive and possibly harmful amounts of vitamins and minerals.
Â Â  Mr President, European citizens are making increasing efforts to eat healthy foods, because they can see how important this is.
However, the intention is not sufficient on its own, if it is not accompanied by appropriate information.
These days, consumers are lost among the great variety of products, and have no alternative but to rely on the statements of manufacturers, which are sometimes unfounded, and often biased.
We, the legislators, must ensure that the efforts of citizens are not in vain.
We must ensure that the information specified on products actually helps consumers to select healthy foods.
At the same time, we are also responsible to ensure that regulation does not create an impossible situation for food manufacturers and distributors.
Consumer protection is an area that helps bring Europe closer to people.
When it is interpreted and applied correctly, it also helps manufacturers, because it reduces unfair market competition, it keeps away poor quality products, and ultimately strengthens consumer trust.
However, it also involves the risk that by incorrect application and over-regulation â as they say, by regulating the curvature of the banana â we could make it all look ridiculous in the eye of European citizens.
Therefore we must find the golden mean, where we can eat the cake and have adequate information on what it contains.
Europe will only develop if it does not create conflict, but cooperation in the social and economic area.
This is why I believe that we should welcome and support the proposal package with its compromises, prepared with long and hard work, even if it is not the ideal solution, as already mentioned by Mrs Sommer and others.
Beyond the above, as an MEP representing a country with considerable traditions in wine making and wine consumption, I would also like to call attention to the situation of wine.
It has been scientifically proven that moderate wine consumption brings real health benefits.
I do not think that in our attempt to fight against alcoholism, instead of trying to eliminate its underlying causes, we should use this or any other law to declare war on wine or beer, which are so important both to European culture and diet; this is why I support their exemption.
Â Â  Commissioner, let me begin with a short quotation from a letter I received recently from a company which employs more than 100Â people: âWith great concern we are following the debate on the claims regulationâ.
The regulation on our desk today will make enterprise more complicated and will increase costs for consumers.
Companies will increase prices and the increased prices will harm consumers, consumers whose needs and interests we mention whenever and wherever we can.
I think it is common sense to let companies look for their competitive advantages by themselves and let consumers make a choice.
I want to stress that we do not take into account individual choice and individual responsibility.
People are fat and people are inactive.
Some people are becoming fat and some are getting slimmer.
How easy it would be to blame companies, producers, retail chains and governments for being fat.
I am strongly against the second reading proposal on our desks.
It harms enterprise, it increases prices for consumers and it ignores common sense.
Our lives are in our hands and there are no entitlements without meeting obligations and individual responsibility first.
Â Â  Mr President, in the context of the concerns and wider debate on combating obesity and other chronic diseases, the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation, based on nutrient profiling, will have absolutely no impact.
It will in fact do damage from a health education point of view, as nutrient profiles are solely based on the composition of a food or food category and do not take into consideration the consumption of the food or food category or consumersâ individual habits.
The effect of a food containing a substance such as sugar or salt at a low or medium level, but consumed in great quantities, is much more damaging than that of a food containing a substance at a high level but consumed only occasionally.
Interestingly, scientists have now established that obese children and young people do not actually consume more junk food than children of healthy body weight, but their lifestyle contains a serious deficit of physical activity.
Establishing objective and science-based nutrient profiles may prove an impossible task and the European Food Safety Authority will have its work cut out.
Against that background, any policies based on such profiles are likely to be incoherent and lead to arbitrary decisions.
It is a central tenet of the Lisbon Agenda that legislation should be simple, clear and enforceable.
Instead of accepting compromises for the sake of political expediency, we should send this Monday morning directive back for redrafting under the better regulation initiative.
We should ensure that it is in step with scientific best practice in this area, with minimum red tape, that it is SME- and consumer-friendly and, most importantly, that it does what it says on the tin, i.e. it becomes a tool to help combat obesity and other chronic diseases.
With regard to the regulation on addition of vitamins and minerals and the so-called âcertain other substancesâ to food, I feel very strongly that mass medication of the population at large, through the addition of substances to publicly supplied basic necessities such as drinking water, is ethically questionable and should not be permitted, particularly if it cannot be scientifically proven that the health of sensitive groups within the population is not adversely affected by such an addition.
For example, the addition of fluoride to drinking water has a disproportionately negative effect on bottle-fed babies and young children, as their reconstituted milk formula made from that public drinking water equates to their total diet.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to MrsÂ Scheele on her report, which, with the amendments added, amounts to a fine dossier, and many thanks to MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone, who has certainly put a lot of work into a report that is complex and comprehensive without, alas, being in line with my way of thinking.
What has to be borne in mind here, both as a matter of principle and of policy, is that the Council and the Commission have played from what is still a position of excessive strength vis-Ã -vis Parliament, which has now been forced to give its agreement for fear of even greater damage being done.
The powers-that-be in the administrative community constituted by the Council and the Commission have got their way against the political will of a majority in this House, and a good draft, amended at first reading, has been well and truly filleted.
While I have no objection to nutrient profiles, a dossier needs to be put together in accordance with certain principles; for a start, there are no concrete proposals â what one might term the pre-production model â from the Commission.
The expert knowledge of medical specialists, nutritionists and psychologists needs to be drawn on, and their opinions need to be balanced against one another.
I wonder what added value this is going to bring to Europe; I want to be told about the chances of this being implemented, and about how SMEs are meant to survive.
I also ask myself whether protecting consumers should not mean something more than treating them like children, but should â and can â also involve helping them to reach their own decisions.
Looked at from the scientific angle, it has to be said that one can expect the effect of this on the way Europeans â particularly children â eat and consume to be virtually non-existent, but, even so, we will have created a new bureaucratic monster to persuade our citizens of Europeâs usefulness.
We will swallow this particular toad â the nutrient profile for which will probably describe it as âtoo slimyâ â but I hope it will be the last of its kind.
Â Â  MrÂ President, like my colleague, MrsÂ Sommer, I can only express my deep dissatisfaction faced with the common position that has been submitted to us for second reading.
We have here a typical example of a missed opportunity, particularly on the part of the Commission, to support the reasonable position adopted by Parliament at first reading, and this at a time when MrÂ Barroso constantly regales us with arguments in favour of more subsidiarity, less bureaucracy, and I could go on.
Seeking to impose nutrient profiles on consumers, without any scientific evidence, is as unacceptable as it is rash.
MrÂ Schnellhardt illustrated this point well.
As chairman of this Parliament's âwineâ intergroup, I have a duty to emphasise the disproportionate nature of the total ban on any claim appearing on alcoholic beverages of more than 1.2% volume.
Not only is wine the subject of specific Community regulations, but very credible scientific evidence exists to show that wine, when consumed in moderation, meaning two or three glasses per day for example, is good for a personâs health.
It is, among other things, effective in preventing cardiovascular diseases, cancer and dementia, a point that the Commissioner and his services magisterially overlook.
The compromise worked on by MrsÂ Sommer, whom I thank, is merely the lesser evil.
I can only lament the little understanding shown by the Council and the Commission regarding this matter, as well as the consequences of their obstinacy, particularly for employment.
In order to give the Council and the Commission one last chance to reconsider some incomprehensible positions that could compromise the conciliation procedure and the objectives set by the Lisbon Strategy, we, together with MrsÂ Klass, have tabled an amendment that excludes wine and beer from the scope of ArticleÂ 4(3), so as not to harm sectors that have been part of our cultural and culinary heritage for thousands of years.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I too have serious reservations regarding the Commissionâs proposal.
Its administrative and financial burden will hinder competition and lead to price rises for consumers.
I therefore wonder whom this costly system is supposed to benefit.
The proposal will be detrimental to SMEs, for which any new red tape is an obstacle to business, and it paves the way for the monopolisation of the European market.
I do not support these regulations on health grounds, since they cannot make any demonstrable improvements to the health of Europeans.
Expensive nutrition and health profiles on food packaging will not in themselves influence consumer behaviour and will certainly not cause Europeans to lose weight or to improve their health.
Such matters are influenced instead by lifestyle, a healthy environment and trust in doctorsâ explanations and professional advice.
What European consumers obviously need is to understand all of the complex information on foods, and that applies to all EU Member States.
I therefore support the consolidation of rules concerning claims made on foods throughout the EU and the fight against false claims.
Consumers, however, would still much prefer to have transparency and visible information regarding ingredients, rather than an assessment of the health effects of each food.
Unfortunately, this new regulation does not do a great deal in terms of improving guidance for consumers, for example with regard to the size of lettering and a clear, standardised format for claims.
Instead of rules of this nature, it proposes a complicated licensing system for the content of information on food.
Speaking as a doctor, I am aware of how important it is for people following special diets to be able to check exactly what is inside every food item.
For example, people with gluten allergies need to know for certain that products such as unpacked pÃ¢tÃ© do not contain flour.
From a health point of view, this is more important to them than information regarding the reduction of fat in yoghurt, something European consumers might enjoy along with a roll and butter, and, heaven forbid, even a slice of white pudding.
The Commissionâs proposal runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy.
I believe that tomorrow we will obtain a majority for our proposals, which at least pave the way for greater flexibility for registration, the possibility of greater protection of rights for claimants, a shorter protection period for scientifically established claims, the removal of unpacked alcohol products from the directive and other amendments.
Otherwise we would have to reject the proposal outright.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Members for a very interesting debate.
Those who have worked with me for the past year and a half know by now that I tend to speak in a very open and frank way.
I can honestly say that this is the only legislative proposal I never thought I would have to fight for.
It is a proposal based on logic.
It states that if someone wants to make money by using a marketing tool, that person or company has to tell the truth.
It is simple.
We talk about consumer choice.
What would consumers do: set up a little chemical laboratory at home to analyse every food to see whether it has sugar or fat?
How can consumers exercise this choice unless someone checks that this is accurate?
Regarding health claims, will consumers carry out clinical tests in at home to see whether a specific product lowers cholesterol?
It is impossible!
That is why it is important to have this legislation adopted, especially after the compromise, and I am surprised that there has been no legislation so far in this respect.
What happens if we do not have this legislation?
What will be the result?
Anybody can say anything and hope for the best.
In the European Union, all of us, including the leaders of large Member States, pledge to place the European citizen at the heart of European policies.
I believe that this is a good test of whether we actually do so.
I firmly agree that better regulation is an essential policy for us.
However, that does not mean there should be no regulation, especially when it comes to health and consumer protection.
It means we have to do it in the proper way.
As I stated in my introductory remarks, I believe that with Parliamentâs suggestions and amendments we now have a good piece of legislation which does not put any unnecessary burden on the industry and, at the same time, protects the consumer.
We tend to forget a very important aspect: the internal market.
You have my word that these areas of health will be regulated.
The question is whether it will be done at Community level, meaning that there will be one level playing field in the internal market and that industry, benefiting from the 450Â million consumers, can be competitive, or whether there will be 25Â different sets of rules and regulations breaking up the internal market.
All along I have been in dialogue with the industry and this is what it would like.
I always ask industry representatives whether they would prefer one piece of legislation, even a strict one, or 25 different laws with flexible levels.
They prefer to have one piece of legislation.
That is a very important factor.
On wine, I understand what was said, but we have to remember that wine is an alcoholic beverage.
It may come from an agricultural product, but it contains alcohol and it must be covered by this legislation.
On the issue of fluoride, I must remind you that the problem mentioned is compulsory fluoridation, which does not come under this legislation but under the Member Statesâ competence.
It is a different issue and we could discuss it, but it is not part of this legislation, because the claims and additions in question are voluntary.
In conclusion, as I have already said, it is a good compromise.
Each side would have liked to see this compromise go a bit further in one direction or another.
However, it takes into account, in a balanced way, the interests of all stakeholders.
I agree that, alone, it cannot solve the problem of obesity.
As you know, we have generally followed a non-regulatory approach to deal with such a complex issue.
We have set up a platform and we are discussing with industry and stakeholders how we can each help to solve this problem.
However, in certain areas legislation and regulation are required.
We therefore need a combination of all actions and initiatives to achieve the ultimate goal(1).
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  Although the compromise struck between Parliament and the Council is not perfect, it is one I can support.
Compared to the original proposal, it is far less bureaucratic without prejudicing consumer protection.
Consumers are given proper information without being patronised.
Dutch terms such as or may continue to be used to describe cough sweets, since everyone appreciates that these sweets cannot always immediately make the cough disappear.
Consumers must be able to rely on food and health claims being true and scientifically underpinned.
Research has shown that 53% of consumers trust food claims.
As we have rid the regulation of unnecessary bureaucracy without compromising consumer protection, the consumer can make an informed choice.
At the same time, though, the bakery round the corner can continue to promote its high-fibre rolls without having to negotiate a long-drawn-out authorisation procedure first.
The Commission can accept Amendments 50 to 89.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1 to 49, 90 and 91.
The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 5, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19.
Â Â  Make no mistake: eels were the trailblazers.
Long before we Europeans began to cooperate across borders, eels did so as part of their lifestyle.
They converge in the Sargasso Sea from throughout Europe in order to meet each other and produce offspring, irrespective of national borders.
In the last 40 years, however, eel stocks have declined by more than 75%.
The most rapid decline has taken place over the last 20 years.
It takes eels 20 years or more to reach sexual maturity, and it will be many years before we are able to fish for those eels being born today. This also means that it will be many years before we get to see the results of the measures, so it is time for all countries to help each other.
Eels have already taken more of a beating than they can tolerate.
Given that eels are a symbol of cross-border cooperation, it would be a symbolic failure for the whole of the EU and in terms of the whole future of the EU if we did not succeed in saving the eel.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcome this agreement, which is reasonable on two grounds.
Firstly, it is reasonable as far as the fishery resources in the Moroccan provinces of Western Sahara are concerned. It is not the opinion of Parliamentâs legal service that counts, but that of the International Court of Justice.
For centuries, Morocco has exercised a certain form of sovereignty over that territory. If Algeria wants an outlet into the Atlantic, that is its problem, but that is not a good enough reason to invent laws.
It is also reasonable because it is good to retain the benefits derived from these agreements and to transfer them to the Saharan provinces of Morocco and to the people.
I have just one reservation, however: it concerns the annual 60Â 000 tonnes of industrial fishing granted to the large seiners of Northern Europe, which have no historic precedence, especially not in comparison with the historic precedence of Morocco, which nonetheless authorised the presence in its waters of 244 vessels, which disappeared at the end of the agreement.
Since the agreement with Angola has been denounced, we must take delight in the fact that we have concluded this reasonable and balanced agreement with Morocco.
Let us not pick a quarrel with the Moroccans.
Â Â  There is a lot to be said about the EUâs fisheries policy. There is no doubt a lot of politics involved over and above the actual fisheries agreements.
This agreement in particular has a very great deal of politics associated with it, and there are many uncertainties where Western Sahara is concerned.
Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara since 1975, and the world community has still not succeeded in solving this issue.
Morocco has refused to accept the UNâs plan for a referendum and has unfortunately failed to contribute to any form of dialogue or negotiation.
I am extremely concerned that, by voting in favour of this report, we are giving Morocco opportunities to exploit fishing resources belonging specifically to Western Sahara and its people. The legal analyses are contradictory and, as many of these point out, the position under international law is unclear because the boundaries of Moroccoâs territorial waters are being erased.
It may lead to Morocco distributing fishing licences belonging to Western Sahara, something that would contravene both the UN Charter and international law.
Morocco has done this before, and the money has not benefited the West Saharan people.
I shall therefore support the amendments limiting the agreement to what is compatible with international law.
I think it important for the EU not to recognise the policy of occupation.
Rather, we should show that we want to see a solution to this conflict regarding what is Africaâs last colony.
If the amendments do not go through, I and, I hope, many others intend to vote against this agreement.
We cannot say that the agreement is just about fisheries and the conditions under which fishermen operate.
It is, to the very highest degree, about politics, and that is something we must realise.
We have a big responsibility to make our position clear, and that is something we can do by voting against this agreement.

Â Â  This fisheries agreement is a disgraceful agreement through which the EU is a party to crimes under international law.


The agreement covers Western Saharaâs fishing waters, but Morocco is occupying and oppressing Western Sahara and has no right to the countryâs natural resources. Western Saharaâs legitimate representative, the liberation movement Polisario, is firmly opposed to this agreement.
The Geneva Convention bans an occupying power from exploiting occupied areasâ natural resources for its own gain, but that is precisely what this agreement involves.
It means that the EU too would profit from, and legitimise, Moroccoâs illegal occupation of Western Sahara and thus be an active party to crimes under international law.

Commissioner, the agreement you have negotiated with Morocco is disgraceful.



Â Â  Mr President, yesterday evening you announced to Parliament that the Council was not going to be present after 7Â p.m. tomorrow evening.
According to our agenda, after 9Â p.m. tomorrow evening we are due to debate whether to grant a cent to the Energy Community Treaty and put an oral question to the Council with regard to this Treaty.
If the Council is unable, or unwilling, to be present to answer this oral question, I see little point in considering either the Treaty or the oral question.
I ask you, therefore, to gain an assurance from the Council that it will be present. Otherwise I will move that we defer this item until the next part-session of Parliament.
Â Â  We will try to ensure that the Council is here.
We will do everything we can between now and then.
You are right that there is not much point in dealing with this item on the agenda as planned if the Council is not present.
We will make a last effort, and if that does not work, we will discuss how to proceed, but we must not lose hope, which is the last thing that should be lost.
Â Â  The first item on the agenda is the Commissionâs statement on the Commissionâs contributions to the June 2006 European Council: a plan for citizens, producing results for Europe, the discussion period and âPlan Dâ.
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Members, the first message I would like to deliver today is that the Commission is listening to citizens.
We want to base our actions on and deliver on their expectations and concerns.
Listening is at the very heart of Plan D. The Commission has implemented a series of activities to stimulate the debate in all Member States and has given support to those countries which requested it.
We can draw some important lessons from the national debates, which are fully supported by the Eurobarometer surveys.
Firstly, citizens are concerned about the high rate of unemployment and the negative effects of globalisation.
This is no surprise to most of us.
Social protection is at the very core of the debates and the request for comparable living standards is high almost everywhere.
Enlargement is the second predominant issue.
More and more citizens question, if not the principle itself, the scope and pace of future accessions.
We need to show that enlargement does not happen by default and why it is necessary.
The third lesson we can draw is that Europeans want more not less Europe.
But they want to see results and to be more involved in the policy process.
They perceive the Union as an entity that can protect them.
They are asking for more security, as well a higher level of environmental protection, food safety and a more stable energy supply.
The Commission intends to respond to these concerns.
That is why we have adopted a citizensâ agenda for Europe.
We are not suggesting a completely new strategy.
Our work remains rooted in the three building stones of prosperity, solidarity and security, with a continued emphasis on jobs and growth, in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
We are, however, focusing to a greater extent on citizens.
What do we propose?
Deeper economic integration should go hand in hand with solidarity.
Europe is not just a marketplace; it also has a social dimension.
Next year, we will therefore launch an agenda for access and solidarity.
We have also discussed the idea of an âentitlement cardâ, to facilitate citizensâ full access to their rights and to make these rights more visible.
We will also continue to implement the sustainable development agenda.
In addition, we will launch a comprehensive review of the single market, to be completed next year.
The single market has brought huge benefits for citizens, but it is still unfinished business in the areas of energy, banking charges and roaming fees, for instance.
We need to remove the remaining barriers.
European Citizens rightly expect Europe to be a fair and safe place to live in.
But Europe is not always capable of combating terrorism and organised crime.
The existing decision-making tools create undue delays and, even more regrettably, do not ensure proper democratic scrutiny.
The Commission proposes improving the decision-making process in these areas.
We can do that by using the provisions of the current treaties.
Before addressing the institutional questions, I would like to mention two more areas where further action is proposed.
While honouring our commitments on enlargement, we must not lose broad public support for this important part of the EU project.
The Commission will take forward the debate on enlargement and its added value, and this will be part of the Commissionâs enlargement strategy report, to be submitted in the autumn.
Last but not least, the Commission is willing to improve the coherence and efficiency of the European Unionâs action in the international arena.
We will present concrete proposals next week.
In all of our actions, our commitment to subsidiarity, openness and transparency, as well as our efforts towards better regulation, will be vigorously pursued.
We will seek to involve national parliaments more in the process of policy formulation.
However, the Commissionâs main interlocutor remains the European Parliament.
Let me now turn to the institutional issues.
Five countries that had not ratified the Constitution before the start of the period of reflection have now done so.
Furthermore, Estoniaâs Parliament voted in favour of the Constitution on 9 May, which brings the number of countries to have ratified to 15.
We are pleased that Finland, which will hold the incoming Presidency, is also planning to ratify the Constitution.
We welcome the new ratifications.
They show that Member States are attached to the principles and values of the Constitution.
We have to listen to the views and the positions of the countries which said ânoâ, but it is equally important to listen to the voices of those who say âyesâ.
I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us on the following point.
The Commission continues to endorse the principles and improvements the Constitution would bring.
The Constitution would definitely make the Union more effective, more open and more democratic.
This is natural for a Constitution where parliamentarians were the majority voice.
Of course we would like to see the Constitutional Treaty ratified in all 25 Member States.
We stand with Parliament on this.
Many options have been floated on how to overcome the current deadlock.
Many ideas are being discussed.
Yet no consensus exists on the way forward.
Is the time ripe for a solution to be presented?
To use wording that is familiar to us, is it now time to work on the text or still time to work on the context?
We need to rebuild a climate of confidence and trust.
We need to reconnect with citizens and prove, with firm results, that the Union can address citizensâ needs and aspirations.
Let me be clear: delivering results for citizens through key policies is not an alternative to tackling the institutional issues.
It is part of a twin-track approach, where progress on one track makes it easier to move ahead on the other.
We propose that, next year, the three institutions should jointly adopt a declaration.
This should serve as a basis for European Council decisions on a process leading to a future comprehensive institutional settlement.
I see the declaration as firm proof of Member Statesâ, Parliamentâs and the Commissionâs firm will to solve the constitutional deadlock.
I expect the European Parliament to play an important role here.
Like you, I hope that together we can achieve a constitutional settlement by the 2009 European elections.
The listening exercise proved to be successful and should continue.
Plan D was not a one-off operation.
I have promised the Commission that after the June Summit I will address what our next steps should be â if you wish, the second phase of Plan D.
Our citizensâ agenda will demonstrate the added value of the Union and thus help to restore citizensâ confidence.
It is by reconnecting with citizens that we can create the conditions for a future comprehensive institutional settlement.
Looking forward to the debate with you today, I would like to thank the political group chairmen for their contribution to the Commissionâs policy formulation.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, Vice-President of the Commission, my group supported the Commissionâs Plan D because it believed, and still believes, that it is a good way of responding to the challenges facing Europe at the moment.
We therefore encourage you to keep going.
You said that we were going to move on to the second phase of Plan D; the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is going to make a proposal to you: we are no longer calling it a discussion, because a discussion that lasts for too long can give the impression that we are having a rest and not doing much more; let us call it an analysis, because I think that what follows an analysis is a proposal, which is what you are referring to with the joint declaration by the three institutions.
I think that this joint declaration by the three institutions is a good idea, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, firstly because it marks the symbolic anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which were the starting point for the Community, but also because it means that the Council, the Commission and Parliament want to put forward proposals together for a way out of the situation of the Constitutional Treaty.
You can therefore count on the European Parliament for this institutional declaration, but this means that we want to take part in drawing it up, not just sign it at the end.
I think that the fact that the process of ratifying the Constitution continued in Estonia and that the Finnish Parliament decided to ratify it is good news, which proves that all those who are prophesying that the Constitution is dead are wrong.
No one ratifies something that is dead.
I think that the task that we have at the moment â and when I say task, I know that what I am asking is not simple â is to convince European citizens of what we could call âthe cost of non Constitutionâ.
Remember many years ago, when the Single European Act was being debated, there was a report called âThe cost of non Europeâ, in other words, what it would cost people if the Single European Act did not come into force and the internal common market was not created.
I believe that what we need to do in this debate on the Constitutional Treaty is something similar: to explain to people, with examples, what would be lacking in their lives if there were no European Constitution.
I am certain that this is a good task for the second phase of analysis, because it could produce proposals that will ultimately help to achieve what all of us, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, want: for Europe to add value for people, for Europe to defend our common values and for Europe, ultimately, to make peopleâs lives more effective, fairer, freer and better supported.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
You are one of the really prominent people in the Commission who are speaking up not only for Plan D but also for the democratisation of Europe as a whole and for greater effectiveness in the Commission's activities.
You are â and I say this on behalf of our group â one of the personalities who can be described as an asset for progress in Europe.
Your speech once again made it clear that you, as the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for Plan D, are someone in whom we can trust and on whom we can rely.
What recognisable results have so far come out of this period of reflection, which, as MrÂ MÃ©ndezÂ deÂ Vigo said, is continually threatening to degenerate into a siesta?
What the citizens of Europe want is more transparency.
They want a better understanding of what happens in the institutions.
They want a clearer division of competences: who does what, where, when and on what legal basis?
They want greater effectiveness in legislation and administration.
They want the subsidiarity principle to be strengthened.
Not everything has to be done in Brussels â some things can be done at home.
Not everything, though, can be solved at home, and those things should be regulated by Brussels.
That is a clear message.
The people therefore also want the EU to have a stronger presence in international politics.
They want the EU to be effective in fighting crime.
We know all of that, and it is up to us, the Council and the Commission to achieve it.
It is all in the Constitution, though.
We all know that we need the Constitution if we are to meet these demands from the public.
At the end of the period of reflection, it is now clearer than ever that it is not possible to meet the demands of the public on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
It was not possible with 15 Member States â which is why Nice needed to be amended and replaced by the Constitution â and we will soon have 27 Member States and still do not have the Constitution.
How can it be possible now?
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
Without a shadow of a doubt, nobody should be fighting harder for the Constitution than the President of the Commission.
I should therefore like to thank you, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, but I would also say one thing quite clearly to the President of the Commission: How can you go into an interparliamentary conference like the one last week, where the overwhelming majority of the national and European parliamentarians present spoke out in favour of the Constitution and the next President-in-Office of the Council MrÂ Vanhanen declared that, during his Presidency, Finland would symbolically ratify the Constitution, and then, as President of the Commission, raise doubts â and these doubts do exist â as to whether you yourself are prepared to say to the Heads of State or Government: if you do not join with me in implementing the Constitution, the expanded Europe will grind to a halt?
I will give you an example: 25 ministers of labour, and representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament, were present at the last informal Council meeting in Luxembourg, at which the Services Directive was discussed.
After the initial two and a half hour long debate, each minister could speak for three minutes.
That is a long time in comparison with the European Parliament, but was out of all proportion to the matter on the agenda.
Europe cannot make any sensible policies in an elephantine body like the Ecofin: it is quite the opposite of good management, clear legislation and efficiency.
We are reaching the limits of the current structures.
If we want to make Europe more democratic, more transparent, more efficient â if we want to deliver to the people â we need to act, not talk.
That is why we need the Constitution.
As long as the Bureau of the Commission, and in particular the President, is sending messages that raise doubts about whether that institution is really determined to implement the Constitution, the opponents of the Constitution could well believe that we have given up.
No, those who support the Constitution are behind you, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, and they are in the majority.
There are those in this Parliament who oppose the Constitution.
Those people now raising their voices are in a minority.
The overwhelming majority of this House are in favour of the Constitution.
The overwhelming majority of the Member States are in favour of the Constitution.
The overwhelming majority of the Commission are in favour of the Constitution.
We therefore all have opportunities, so let us fight together, and that goes for MrÂ Barroso too.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Europe is undergoing a serious crisis, probably the most serious in its history.
We see it every day â Europe is not moving forward, or even standing still, but going backwards, and at the same time national egos are growing and the feeling of sharing a common destiny is in retreat.
Ahead of the next European Council, you have put forward a number of proposals in an attempt to respond to this crisis.
Our group has taken note of a few timid steps forward among those proposals.
For example, you are going to send all of your legislative proposals directly to the national parliaments at the same time as you send them to the European Parliament; that is good, but it does not change anything.
You are going to propose to the Member States a reform of the decision-making process in the field of judicial and police cooperation.
That is better, but did it really need to take a year to come up with it?
Do you really think that these proposals are going to recreate a climate of trust between the citizens and Europe?
Your revival plan, be it in the field of policy or of the institutions, is not up to the challenges with which we are faced.
You seem to be happy with taking very small steps, but what we need is a giant leap forward.
First of all, your Europe of results is singularly lacking in ambition when it comes to policy.
I should have liked to have heard you advocating new common policies, which are vital in order to prepare better for the future.
This is particularly true when it comes to research, where we are losing ground all the time, to the United States and Japan today, and to China and India tomorrow.
It is also true with regard to energy: it is clear that the issue of energy and energy supplies will be one of the major challenges of this century.
The issue of immigration is also relevant.
We need a common policy in this field, because it is clear that issues of migration and co-development need to be dealt with at European level.
Moreover, we should have like to have heard some proposals on the issue of economic governance.
If we want to generate growth, and therefore employment, we obviously need to strengthen our economic, budgetary and industrial coordination, at least within the Eurozone.
This really is a matter of urgency.
The lack of proposals from you regarding the institutions is, in my opinion, even more serious.
With regard to the basic issue of the future of our institutions, and therefore of our democracy, you contented yourself with commenting that there is currently no consensus between the Member States.
MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, the Commission's role is not just to make observations, but to present proposals.
It was incumbent on the Commission to define a path, and to defend and carry a vision, and you have failed in that.
We must stop lying to ourselves.
Even though the ratification process is continuing symbolically, we all know that this Constitution will never see the light of day.
We need to rewrite the Constitution, to produce a new text that is shorter, simpler, more readable and more tightly focused on the major principles on which the European Union is founded.
This text should say who we are, what we want and what values we espouse and defend.
If we want to be in a position to ratify a political project of that nature in 2009, when European elections will be held in all the Member States, we must start preparing for it right now.
Those, Commissioner, are the regrets of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Last week, MrÂ Barroso quite rightly called on the Heads of State or Government to take responsibility for the European project before their citizens.
Today, we call on the Commission to revive the inspiration without which nothing much can ever be achieved.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, in Ancient Rome, when a high-ranking man was condemned, he had the right to have someone else punished on his behalf.
It rather looks as if you are in that position today, and you do not deserve it.
However, the President of the Commission should hear the verdict of this House on his role in the constitutional process, and I hope you will ensure that he does so.
He has played a quite disastrous role: cowardly, unimaginative, contradictory and deeply counterproductive.
Perhaps he applied for a job as the grave-digger for the European Constitution; he certainly has every chance of getting it.
I know that the President of the Commission is a master of misunderstanding: we have certainly always misunderstood him.
One can hardly quote him without him claiming the exact opposite in the same speech, and whenever one tries to pin him down he claims to have meant something quite different.
Interestingly, however, the whole of Europe has understood the same message from this master of misunderstanding: no chance.
Nothing will happen for years.
Nice?
Oh, it was not as bad as all that!
As he said, the world will keep on turning without the Constitution.
And the worst thing is that the citizens still expect results, not rhetoric.
That is yet another misunderstanding, of course, but the citizens have understood perfectly well.
Since the start of his time in office, the President of the Commission has not made the slightest effort to find a solution to this constitutional conflict.
At no point has he acted as an advocate for the European Constitution.
For him, it is a glass bead game for political elites, institutional European navel-gazing â a phrase from MrÂ Blair, variations of which he continually drops in.
Commissioner, we will not make any progress this way.
Parliament has adopted a decision.
Right from the start there was a lack of support from the Commission, and there have been some significant misunderstandings.
Nice may well allow some steps towards integration, Commissioner: we know that there are 'bridges'.
There are possibilities for silent, almost discreet integration, but is that really what you want?
Without a Charter of Fundamental Rights?
Without the comprehensive democratisation of the EU?
With no capacity to take action?
Without the 'pedal to the metal' of unanimity in many areas?
Do you really want it without social rights?
Do you want it without a constitution to create the political environment in which the interests of the people of Europe can be better taken into account?
Greater legitimacy, introducing more representation into decisions, more transparency and openness to the citizens, greater accountability to the citizens, more checks and balances, more parliamentary and judicial controls: that is what the constitution contains!
It is not just formulas or pure rhetoric, as the President of the Commission keeps trying to suggest in this debate.
You say he is listening to the people.
I was very surprised by the Eurobarometer surveys following the referendums in France and the Netherlands, which clearly showed that more than two thirds of those who had voted 'no' were in favour of improving the constitution, and that they wanted those improvements to aim for a social Europe.
In other words, this conflict is about a European democracy and the social dimension of Europe as a response to globalisation.
And what is MrÂ Barroso doing?
He is listening to the people and hearing something completely different.
He is increasingly becoming the advocate of a Europe of governments.
The crux and the cause of the crisis is the Europe of governments.
Did he not understand that the people were protesting against the democratic deficit, against the lack of transparency?
Did he not listen?
They did not mention terrorism.
Yes, the Austrian Presidency is talking about subsidiarity and bureaucracy and the Court of Justice, but the citizens are not.
While the governments are clinging on to their claims to power, the citizens want a European democracy, they want a social dimension, they want their basic rights, and they want a better constitution.
It is the President of the Commissionâs historical responsibility to initiate and support this improvement process, and he would be well advised to assume it.
Â Â  Mr President, CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and a significant proportion of this Parliament have really distanced themselves from the citizens of Europe.
The people do not just want to understand better what is going on in the institutions â they want greater participation.
They want to be asked what they want, they want to make decisions, they want to be involved in the discussions on the future of Europe, and they want that to be taken into account.
I therefore have a rather different conception of the term 'listening' of which MrÂ Barroso is so fond.
Precisely in this respect we need to make changes, so that we can ultimately have a real discussion on the future of the European Union.
On his scores of trips, the President should not have just preached, but actually listened.
All of those involved could have heard, from many people, quite specific conceptions of what the European Union should look like in the future.
A few days after the European Social Forum in Athens, the European Commission held a press conference to present their initiative for a Citizens' Agenda.
However, if you expected any reference to the discussions during the European Social Forum, in which 35Â 000 people participated, you would have been disappointed.
The members of my group take this forum seriously, though, and both before and during the forum they were involved in the discussions regarding a European appeal â Europe gives the citizens their say â and regarding the Charter of Principles for a Different Europe.
This refutes all those insinuations that the Left within the European Union is not prepared to join in discussions on the future of the EU or on the Constitution.
I share the ideas used as starting points in both papers.
We need to have a truly democratic debate on the future of Europe and the path we are going to take, and this debate must be based on the assumption that the dignity of every person must be sacrosanct and must be respected and protected.
In my opinion, it is therefore quite grotesque for the President of the European Commission to state, as he did on 10Â MayÂ 2006, that we must deliver results for Europe through a citizens' agenda.
Today we adopted our proposal for a citizens' agenda; the communication proposes 11 initiatives relating primarily to the internal market.
President Barroso is remaining particularly loyal to that topic.
He is sticking by his basic conviction that the objective of the European Union must be to remain competitive as a whole in the global market.
However, that will never result in a true social Europe of solidarity with social cohesion at the forefront, and that is what the citizens of Europe are so critical about.
That is the path they do not want to be taken down.
They want different priorities to be set, and I think it is time for this to be taken into account.
That is what we need to discuss within the European Union, in the context of the constitutional process and the discussion on Plan D.
Â Â  . Mr President, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!
What a sad, inward-looking, almost ostrich-like speech that was from Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
I can only conclude that Plan D stands for âdelusionalâ.
You really ought to get out more, because it seems to me that you are surrounded by Commissioners, officials, sycophants and parliamentarians here, who clearly do not represent the view of at least half the citizens of Europe.
Mr Barroso himself is no better, because when he is not working in the Commission he is off on luxury yachts, holidaying with the super-rich.
I think perhaps I have a remedy for you.
I should like to invite you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, to come to my local pub one Sunday lunchtime and meet some real people.
I can do even better than that: I could invite you to the Oval to watch a test match.
Come and watch some cricket and, again, meet some real people!
If you do not have time for any of that, you could read your own Eurobarometer poll, which shows that less than half the citizens of Europe now think that the European Union is doing a good job.
You are ignoring all these things; in fact, you are developing a bunker mentality, and perhaps that is a good thing, because at least it shows that the end is in sight!
An organisation with any sense of honour would have respected the French and Dutch referendum results and there would have been a complete halt to further integration.
Instead, you have all conspired against the French and Dutch people; you have conspired against your own rules, when you said here that it would have to be unanimous, and you are pressing on with this crazy project.
The gap between the political classes and the real peoples of Europe is getting wider by the day.
Shame on all of you!
Â Â  Mr President, I think that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m prefers hockey to cricket, and I am bound to agree with her in this respect.
If I am to be honest, Plan D seems to have more to do with a democratic deficit than with democracy, and more to do with a lack of dialogue than with dialogue.
There is superficial discussion rather than real debate.
The European Commission, which emphasises that Plan D is not an operation to save the European Constitution, reminds me of the Soviet agency TASS, which always denied that disasters occurred in the Soviet Union or that poverty existed.
What you are doing, in fact, is comparing apparent actions so as to ride out the storm for a while and hold out until the Constitution is accepted, almost certainly in an unadulterated form, in just a few years.
If the Commission really and truly wanted to introduce a real Plan D, its first decision would be to call for constitutional referenda in the countries where the European Constitution was adopted by parliamentary decree, frequently by acclamation.
Only four out of a dozen or so countries have so far held referenda.
Two of these countries ratified the Constitution, whereas two rejected it.
This reflects the real debate taking place in society and the lack of a real debate within the structures of the European Union.
Let the European Commission finally stop resembling a Chinese opera chorus, which sings âLet us flee, let us fleeâ for three whole acts, but does not budge an inch.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has the opportunity to play a more significant role than that of the conductor of this chorus.
Â Â  Mr President, the paper âCitizensâ agenda: delivering results for Europeâ is to be welcomed in the emphasis placed on policy delivery rather than on institutional grand designs.
Even if I do not agree with all the proposed solutions, in particular I welcome the commitment to a comprehensive review of the single market.
I hope that this review will be heavily accentuated towards the opening of markets, liberalisation and tearing down economic barriers that still exist in Europe.
I know that the President of the Commission is personally committed â as I am â to economic reform and liberalisation as the only way of ensuring growth and greater prosperity.
I do not, however, welcome the proposed agenda in the field of justice and home affairs.
It is true that people in Europe want to see greater cooperation between Member States to combat and defeat the threats we all face in the modern world â particularly terrorism â but I want to see more intergovernmental coordination in tackling crime and terrorism, rather than trying to make such issues the subject of qualified majority voting.
They are matters that go to the very heart of the nation state and its responsibilities to its citizens in each case.
The national veto should remain in those areas.
The British Government is currently playing with fire in its ambivalence on the subject.
Instead, I urge the Commission to concentrate on delivering the economic reform agenda.
People in Europe want action; they want action on growth and they want action on jobs.
There is no appetite for endless debate on Constitutional, institutional structures.
They do not want grand projects that erode the sovereignty of their nations or affect their chances of getting a job.
So my message to the leaders for the June summit has to be simple: they should focus on peopleâs priorities, particularly the plight of the 18Â million who have no job in the Union.
There is nothing for them in the current European Constitution.
Europe needs to demonstrate clearly and unambiguously that it has learned some lessons from the votes on that.
It needs to show that it is ready to move on to an ambitious reform programme that tackles those very issues that I referred to of low growth, high unemployment and threats to our environment.
The social model needs to be reformed drastically.
How can one speak of a social model that consigns so many to the misery of joblessness?
My opposition to the Constitution currently is not based on dogma, but it is known â as far as I am aware â that it would not be good for the people of Europe.
I believe that is what the people of Europe have said, particularly in France and the Netherlands.
The time has now come for the governments of Europe to wake up.
We need reform.
We need to be accountable, more transparent, and we need to reform priorities.
We need to respond to the wishes and needs of the citizens, which was what we were charged to do at Laeken and where we have, unfortunately, currently failed the test.
As we move forwards to an EU of 27, let us celebrate the diversity of the modern European Union; let us harness that diversity to work together for a true Europe of nation states.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I fully support what you said today, and I know how committed you are to Plan D. However, what you said today about the Constitution is not in the papers.
I am talking in particular about the citizens' agenda.
I therefore share the criticisms made by MrÂ Schulz and many others that, reading these papers, one gets the impression that the Commission has given up on fighting for the Constitution.
I think that is a great shame, because you have severely disappointed not only many citizens who have also fought for the Constitution â for example in the referendums.
That really is worthy of criticism.
There are two major deficits to which you barely refer in this paper.
The first is the institutional deficit: this could be dealt with through the Constitution, and I agree with MrÂ MÃ©ndez de Vigo that the costs of not having the Constitution have not been stated.
The second deficit relates to the lack of financial resources. That, too, has barely been mentioned.
I now come to my main problem.
I agree with you, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, that it is absolutely vital not just to wait and to fight for the Constitution and for better funding, but also to take action now.
I am referring in particular to the problem of unemployment.
You have said some very pretty things here, with which I can agree, but where are the concrete proposals in addition to what we have discussed in the past with respect to Lisbon and so on?
Where are the concrete proposals regarding, for example, coordination in economic policy, which is absolutely vital, especially in the euro area but also outside it, in order to create better economic conditions?
The President of the Commission has agreed to make an effort to ensure that public investment in infrastructure is better coordinated, because we do not have enough money to fund everything from Europe and much will have to be funded at national level.
None of this is in the papers, though.
If I may turn to energy policy, we have discussed the fact that, independent of the Constitution â which also gave Europe more competences in energy policy â we need to take some significant steps, particularly with regard to infrastructure.
None of this is set out specifically in the papers on the table.
It is a similar case for foreign and security policy, in which it can be said, on the one hand, that we need to go as far as we can without Constitution, but also that it is very important to have a Constitution so that we can go still further.
You call for a European response to globalisation, but in this respect too there are far too few indications of what this European response could look like, in order to develop a European social model whilst at the same time pushing forward with modernisation and keeping up with the competition.
That, too, is a citizens' agenda, and it is precisely what many of the citizens expect from us.
Therefore, I would ask you once again to clarify the Commission's attitude towards the Constitution.
We must not just stand still; I am absolutely in favour of taking appropriate steps in parallel with that.
However, do not neglect the institutional conditions, because you will disappoint the citizens if you do not clearly say to them that a Constitution is also necessary so that their interests can be implemented globally.
Â Â  The period of reflection is coming to an end, but it does not feel as if very much thinking has been done around Europe.
The lively debate that was to be launched in all the Member States and that all the prime ministers promised at their summit on 18Â June of last year has mainly been conspicuous by its absence.
The Presidency clearly does not think it worth taking part in this debate, either.
This is not because people do not want to talk about Europe.
You know, as I do and as do all of us, that people want to debate Europe. In schools, at workplaces and in debates, people everywhere are committed to discussing the issue and have views and ideas about what our European cooperation should consist in, about how it can be changed and improved and about what it should not include.
What is missing is leadership.
European leaders are too absorbed in their internal problems to be able to raise their sights to European level.
Now it is time, however, to pull ourselves together and show the required leadership.
If the prime ministers and foreign ministers do not wish to show leadership, then we ourselves must do so.
A certain amount needs, of course, to be done in the institutional sphere.
A number of your proposals are extremely constructive.
I believe that, if more transparency is introduced in the Council and greater scrutiny exercised and if the way in which subsidiarity is applied begins to be monitored â all things that can happen without a change to the Treaty â then that would be a step forward.
We have high expectations of the Finnish Presidency.
On this issue, the light appears to come from the east.
We do, of course, need a Constitution in the sense of a set of regulations providing legitimacy.
I too believe that, in the end, there will be a revised Constitution different from that which we have at present, but it should ideally be founded on the same basic ideas.
We need to be proactive and committed in foreign policy and the fight against crime and to stand up for enlargement.
I hope that we can produce practical proposals within the very near future.
We all know that the period of reflection will be extended.
We must show that the EU is needed for the sake of jobs and the economy and in order to bring about continued internal market reforms.
We must show that the EU is needed in the world and we must point out the advantages of enlargement.
Among the matters debated a lot in Europe and featuring among the top subjects on the Commissionâs web site are institutional issues and the issue of Parliamentâs seat.
A huge number of people throughout Europe find it bizarre that the European Parliament meets in two locations.
It costs a lot of money for it to do so and gives Parliament an air of the ridiculous.
I do hope that this citizen initiative will soon land on MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶mâs desk with a million signatures.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not the first time that this House has debated the future of Europe.
The Commissionâs contribution to the European Council of June 2006, which is the topic of this morningâs debate, offers little in the way of analysis, unfortunately.
I would like to make one observation and three recommendations.
As the Commissioner knows from internal reports, one of the main reasons for the Dutch ânoâ was the loss of sovereignty.
It is perplexing that the Commission should subsequently attempt, through the back door, to extend the European Unionâs powers in the areas of freedom, security and justice.
I am all in favour of extending this period of reflection, provided that time is actually spent on reflecting on Europeâs future.
We must move away from the text of the constitution, and a reorganisation of existing treaties must lead to a user-friendly institutional framework.
This framework â call it a basic treaty if you like â must put concrete policy before the setting up of new institutions, such as an EU foreign affairs minister.
This course of action will ultimately benefit the citizen more than a meaningless signature by a prime minister of the kind suggested by MrÂ Barroso in a declaration of loyalty.
This will really not help us any further and will not impress the Dutch voter â something which my Dutch fellow Members do not need to be told.
Â Â  Mr President, I have three points.
Firstly, I agree with Mr Kirkhope that the Constitution is alive and kicking and we should be happy about it.
Last week was great: we had the Interparliamentary Forum, the Commission produced a paper, Estonia ratified the Constitution, Finland gave a clear signal that it would ratify and Mrs Merkel gave a great speech.
MrÂ Farage is no longer here, but it was interesting to see that his message to the âcricket peopleâ was that he wants France and the Netherlands to decide for everyone else how the Constitution should be dealt with.
It is an interesting message to give to the British people.
My second point, echoing what Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo said, is that we have five phases in this debate.
The first phase was reflection, not siesta, as some would have liked to say.
Now we are moving to the second phase, which is analysis.
The Austrian Presidency needs to move the reflection phase on into a period of analysis and take on board Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigoâs excellent idea that there should be a study on the cost of not having a Constitution.
Thirdly there will be a proposal phase and, fourthly, a negotiation phase.
Finally, much like the Commissioner said, we will hopefully have a ratification phase in 2009.
My final point concerns the blame game.
It seems to me, from listening to Parliamentâs debate and the public debate, that we are playing a blame game.
It appears that the Member States are blaming the European Parliament and the Commission for everything that goes wrong.
The Commission has a tendency to blame the Member States, and the European Parliament blames both the Commission and the Member States.
We need to get out of this blame game and start looking at this more as a team.
The idea of a joint declaration, in which the European Parliament also participates, is a good one.
May I just point out that we are talking about the future of the Union, in preparation for the European Council, and only one group leader is present in this Chamber: MrÂ Poettering.
Mr Schulz is no longer here, but he mentioned meetings of the Council of Ministers, in which each of the 25 Member States is given three minutes to speak, which makes a total of 75 minutes.
If you take that example and apply it to our Chamber, with two minutes for each of the 732 MEPS, the total is 1Â 464 minutes.
The debates in the Council are not necessarily sexy, but we could also make improvements in this area.
My final point is directed at the Commissioner.
You have just said that it is great that some Member States are ratifying the Treaty.
Five have done so since the negative referendum results and a sixth ratification is on its way.
I urge you to tell your Prime Minister, MrÂ Persson, that it would be great if Sweden ratified it as well.
This is not a statement in view of the Ice Hockey World Championship. It is a simple statement that Sweden should do it too.
Â Â  Mr President, the debate about Europeâs future is set to continue for some time yet.
In fact, the discussion on the EUâs course and policy will be a permanent fixture.
The Commission is right to point out that Plan D is not just linked to the debate about the constitutional treaty, however important that may be.
It is a first exercise in more open, more pro-active European communication.
More and more communication is an essential pre-condition for successful European cooperation.
Last week, the Commission presented the first results of operation âPlan Dâ, which I welcome with open arms.
The Commission clearly indicates the concrete action that has been taken, which, in itself, proves that the Commission sets great store by sending out a clear message.
At the same time, we have to be careful we do not fall into the trap of communicating for communicationâs sake.
In communication, less is often more.
Moreover, the way it is done is only one of the two components of successful communication.
We must also ask ourselves what exactly we want to say about the future of Europe and, above all, how this message relates to the action which the European Union has taken.
The information which the Commissionâs activities have produced so far is in this respect very interesting.
Public surveys â I refer in particular to Eurobarometer â have revealed that Europeans have high expectations of the European Union in many areas, which inevitably leads us to conclude that a negative vote on the EU is in any event partly attributable to the fact that the European Union does not perform the way it should.
I do not, then, have any problem with the Commission focusing on a concrete agenda of policy.
Does this, though, sufficiently highlight the context in which we have to operate?
I have a few observations to make.
Firstly, the citizensâ agenda must be sufficiently substantial in order to meet the citizensâ expectations at least to some extent.
Has the Commission in this respect achieved enough or has it only considered policy that is already in the pipeline?
Moreover, we must not only consider the expectations â which the Commission has clearly done â but also the citizensâ perception of the environment.
Should we not carry out studies into the way in which the citizens experience Europe and ask ourselves whether the citizensâ agenda can make a positive contribution to day-to-day life?
Secondly, an agenda such as this creates expectations which we need to meet.
Indeed, if we clearly state what we want to achieve and then fail to deliver, then this will only contribute to a negative opinion about the European Union, which brings me to my last point.
Which is the question as to the direction of the debate about Europeâs future in the different Member States.
Whilst the Commission, based on what emerged from the Eurobarometer survey, has managed to indicate the topics that are of concern for the Europeans, how does it assess the state of affairs in all those national discussions about European cooperation, the direction in which we are going, and the constitution?
Is some degree of convergence kicking in, or are we still no further down the road than we were in July 2005?
All institutions have a role to play, but certainly as a Member of this House, I should like to draw the Councilâs attention to its particular responsibility for the execution of a substantial policy agenda that is necessary to get the public to back the European project.
Â Â  Mr President, what we learned from the Dutch and French referenda was that many people, sadly, see the EU as part of the threat of globalisation, rather than offering a safe haven from its colder winds.
We need to stress how the EU offers both security in the classic sense and an internal strengthening and dynamism, which makes us able to compete in the world and deliver prosperity.
The Commission action on mobile roaming charges is excellent, by the way.
I want to concentrate on security in the justice field.
The single most visible demonstration of the EUâs usefulness to my London constituents that I have experienced came last summer.
Under European arrest warrants, a suspected murderer was brought back from Latvia in four weeks and a suspected terrorist back from Italy in six weeks.
That was a real illustration of the EU delivering the increased security from crime and terrorism our citizens want.
The British Conservatives, incidentally, are playing a weak hand on law and order in opposing the European arrest warrant.
So I strongly support President Barrosoâs push to improve decision-making on justice matters, with laws on police and judicial cooperation and legal migration progressed through more effective and democratic and open methods.
But the EU should also be united, solid and active on human rights.
There is a lot of support for the EU playing a strong role in the world, promoting peace, democracy and the rule of law.
But there has never been a Council common position or joint action under the CSFP calling for the closure of GuantÃ¡namo Bay or even just for the return of our own citizens and residents.
Recently, our Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition heard Javier Solana say he had no power to check whether Member States were upholding their human rights commitments.
I said that this conveyed a pathetic image of the EU.
Now Tony Blair, far from leading a national debate on the benefits of Europe, is conniving disgracefully in a dangerous and populist attack by Conservatives and the media on the European Convention on Human Rights.
Let us concentrate on delivering a real citizensâ Europe, security from terrorism and organised crime and from abuses of fundamental rights and discrimination, and promotion of Europeâs soft power in the world.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are talking about the future of Europe.
What Europe?
The Europe whose borders we do not know?
Who here in this House knows the borders of Europe?
None of us.
What Europe?
The Europe which has no foreign policy, but is led back and forth by the Americans?
What Europe?
The Europe which has no army of its own and has a European army with an American commander-in-chief like ÎÎÎ€Î?
What Europe?
The Europe with no energy policy?
Are we conspiring against Putin, who will give us gas, and getting embroiled in the trouble the Americans want in the Gulf so we cannot have cheap oil? What Europe?
The Europe without enough democracy?
Talk to me about a single electoral system!
You have one set of electoral rules, I have another, someone else has another.
What Europe?
The Europe which cannot have a single referendum because in some countries parliaments are in charge and in others the people?
Consequently, we are not one Europe with a future, because for one country, one nation, one union to have a future, it must know what it is and where it wants to go.
Fortunately, however, we received a lesson yesterday: a lesson in patriotism and culture from an Indian, MrÂ Morales who, of course, escaped the ethnic cleansing we Europeans carried out in his country.
It was a big day for Parliament when it heard that passionate patriot.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to what the previous speaker and a number of others have said, I have to say that I did not have a vision only yesterday; on the contrary, the European ideal is the vision, for it is an ideal that has for decades brought us the peace and prosperity that only few parts of the world have experienced in the course of history.
That is what we should call to mind, and it is a crucial point; it is something that is now simply taken for granted, rather than being â as it once was â regarded as a positive gain.
Nor is âno more warâ, and the fact that there has been none, enough any more, although it is still decisive.
Even though we know how thin the ice of civilisation is, we are unable to communicate to our citizens the real reasons for European integration, because what we talk about never rises above the trivial, and by âweâ, I mean the governments in particular.
When I think back to how some talked about nothing but their own status as net contributors, while others, who had got five billion, nevertheless complained about not getting ten billion more, so that that ten billion became the sole subject of discussion and was taken as evidence of a lack of European solidarity, then we cannot be surprised to find the state of affairs that we do at grassroots level at the present time.
I would like to urge the national governments to at long last get back to telling the truth and giving the people comprehensive information, and the Commission not to dispense them from this obligation and not to be over-cautious in this regard.
I hope that the document submitted for our consideration today will be a first step in this direction.
It has to be said, though, that misunderstandings in this respect need to be avoided.
True though it is to say that what matters is that this Europe of ours, as it is presently constituted, should be got moving again, with progress â which alone is convincing â in important areas, the impression must not be given â as it is being to some extent in the media â that this is an alternative programme to the Constitution.
It has to be made clear that we want, by doing this, to put the case for the Constitution and to make good use of the time remaining before it enters into force, but also that it is indispensable to achieving certain crucial objectives, not only in the institutional sphere with such things as voting rights, numbers of seats, and foreign and security policy, but primarily for the public good.
It has to be made plain that it is the Constitution alone that puts the citizen centre stage; that this is not merely a union of states but also a union of citizens, and that those citizens have rights; that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is of fundamental significance in terms of the future conception of the European Union; and that the European elections have something to do with the President of the Commission being chosen by the citizens and the Commission thereby being harnessed to the popular will.
These are the crucial points where we have to make progress, and it is in this respect that we are sometimes lacking in courage.
I was put in a very optimistic mood when a young Member State, two years after its accession to the European Union, on Europe Day â Schuman Day â ratified the Constitution by a 73:1 vote, and the country of which I speak is Estonia.
Something that is equally remarkable is the tremendous achievement on the part of the Finnish Parliament last week.
I hope this will be an incentive for the countries â such as Portugal â that will succeed Finland in the presidency of the Council.
Further to what Chancellor Merkel said in the last week, I take it as read that the German Presidency will discharge the obligation placed upon it by its coalition agreement.
We want this constitutional treaty, and we will do everything possible to see that it is ratified; I hope, Madam Vice-President, that the Commission will join in this endeavour with all the courage at its disposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Commissionâs Plan D. We need debates and I know from experience in my country that the more people are informed about the European Union, the more positive they tend to be with regard to it.
That is why people like Nigel Farage and UKIP have consistently opposed PlanÂ D, the funding of it and its stimulation of debates about Europe.
They want people to rely on their ill-informed prejudices about Europe.
We must counter that.
We must stimulate the widest possible debate.
I think it is right for the debate on the future of Europe to be prolonged.
We need at least another year.
We need wider and deeper reflection.
It is right to say that so far the reflection has been less about the text and more about the context.
However, we also know that we will, in due course, have to address what to do about this text.
The debate will need more structuring and more focus, perhaps along the lines on which Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Stubb spoke just now.
We will have to address this issue.
It is far too simplistic to say, as Mr Farage and MrÂ Kirkhope did, that the people have spoken and they have spoken against the Constitution.
That is simply not true.
We have different answers across Europe.
A majority supports this Constitution, even in countries which held referendums.
If you add all the referendums together, more people voted âyesâ than voted ânoâ.
Overall, as Commission WallstrÃ¶m said, we will soon have 16 States in favour.
In fact, if you add Romania and Bulgaria, 18Â ratifications will be in the bag by the end of next month.
That is going on.
It is a question of divergence, not opposition to the Constitution.
When we have divergence in this Union, we talk it through to find a solution to make it acceptable to everyone, recognising the majority trend and trying to find out what adjustments might be necessary to make the minority able to accept it as well.
We have a duty to the minority to talk it through and find a compromise, but we cannot ignore the will of the majority either.
Â Â  â Mr President, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental question is this: what do the public want from political institutions?
What they want is solutions to problems, and, from time to time, a vision â yes, that as well â and they want their problems, fears and worries to be taken seriously.
What the results from France and the Netherlands show is that this European Union of ours has not, so far, been successful enough in doing this.
This rejection did not, however, plunge the European Union into a crisis; rather, it did no more than make it clear that the EU was already in one.
According to Eurobarometer, even in Germany, only 38% of the public believe that their vote counts, so we need to make an active effort to seek the publicâs approval for the EU, and now we have the chance to do it, for the fact is that the first step is very simple.
We have to make it credible that the ânoâ uttered by two countries in the EU is actually accepted as such.
What is worse than a ânoâ vote is a ânoâ vote that politicians do not take seriously.
This does not mean that the constitution is dead, but it is a reason why we cannot vote again on a constitutional treaty in unamended form.
The Constitution must be revised, with its component parts kept separate from specific policies.
The simple fact is that it has to be made clear that, for example, the EUâs goals and values are not the same thing as policies on fisheries or electronic waste.
As for argument â day-to-day political argument â well, we need that too.
Most of it has to do with the sectoral policies; if the whole debate around the services directive showed anything, it was, no doubt, that the public are actually interested in what goes on in this place.
Arguments are the salt in the democratic soup; many in this House will be aware that I was not happy with what happened to the services directive, but I was pleased that 30Â 000 people were here in Strasbourg demonstrating, for that is real dialogue with the citizens, in comparison with which Plan D has something artificial about it.
It must also be clear to us that we have to hold fast to the separation of the powers, and that is why I want to spell it out to the House that anyone who promises, here in this House today, that national models of the welfare state will be transposed to the European level, is trying to hoodwink the public.
We have neither the money, nor the legal basis, nor the powers to do that.
If you want to make social policy â and it is quite acceptable that you should â then please use the national parliaments as your base for doing it.
If we make empty promises, then the 20 million unemployed will be given no hope, and everyone else will make us aware of how they have become more â rather than less â disenchanted with Europe.
So I urge you that what we should be doing is to democratise the European Unionâs powers, perform its functions well and make sure, at the next European elections, that we get a Europe-wide referendum on the revised text of the Constitution, and also elect the President of the Commission from among our own number.
Â Â  MrÂ President, put the Constitution to one side and start afresh.
Let us elect, by direct means, a convention to be given the task of producing a democratic constitution and a cooperation agreement between democracies.
Let the voters then choose between them in a referendum in every country on the same day.
In this way we can attain the ground rules that our people want.
Until then we should introduce practical reforms characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
Create new rules of procedure in the Council and the Commission so that, from now on, all meetings are open and all documents public unless there are good arguments for sitting behind closed doors or otherwise dealing with a matter in secret.
Let the national parliaments question their Commissioner each Friday, and why not let the voters choose their own Commissioner directly next time around.
Resolve that we will never vote in favour of an EU law that has not obtained a majority in either the national parliament or the European Parliament.
Last year, the EU adopted 3Â 124 regulations.
The European Parliament was involved in just 57 of them.
Put an end to this democratic deficit now, and also listen to those who voted ânoâ.
MrÂ Barroso and MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m will be visiting Copenhagen on Friday.
The official programme provides for not a single speaker representing the French and Dutch ânoâ votes.
You listen largely to yourselves, while the Commission pays for events, think-tanks and movements in favour of the failed Constitution.
Close the purse strings to propaganda, or give funding only to events that are pluralist.
Â Â  â Mr President, at last the time has come, one year after the 'no' in France and the Netherlands, but the 'yes' from the majority of Member States and citizens of Europe, to finally start to 'de-demonise' the European constitution and push Europe forward.
We decided then â and rightly so â that after the 'no', we should focus the debate more on the environment prevailing around the European constitution; in other words, we should focus on the context and leave the text to one side a little.
Unfortunately, however, we spoke little about the context and, by contrast, we allowed a school of thought to burgeon that the problem was actually in the text.
If, however, we look, for example, at the area of freedom, justice and security, we can see that, over the last year, it is the context rather than the text that is the problem.
Thus, the European constitution protects democracy in the European Union by giving Parliament a codecision role on most matters in the area of freedom and security.
The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights demonstrates that we do not consider fundamental rights as a 'bolt on' to the necessary protection of the security of the citizens, but as a central part of our policy.
Unlike the text the context has become more and more problematic over the last year: we have a series of laws that increase anti-terrorist cooperation.
At the same time, however, the Council still contends that the much desired and necessary framework decision for data protection in the third pillar will probably not even be approved by the end of 2006.
We must not allow the context to turn into a pretext not to debate the text.
Europe needs leaders today; it does not need evasions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the agenda for the citizens of Europe is a well-intentioned initiative, but, in the final analysis, a missed opportunity and hence a disappointment too.
It is a missed opportunity because you give the impression that the whole programme could be realised by the existing Treaty of Nice and that the constitutional treaty could be put on the back burner.
That, at any rate, is the impression that MrÂ Barroso has given in his speeches and statements, and that is what the people of Europe have come to believe.
The new âplan Dâ ought to do both.
You ought to be setting out the great challenges and suggesting ways of resolving them, while also telling people what works with the present Treaty and what would work better with the new one.
This is what you are failing to communicate; instead, you are hiding behind the governments and letting us here in this Parliament do most of the work, and that is not enough.
All your posturing about the completion of the internal market will not help to defuse the prejudice against the new treaty, which is prompting people to spread rumours about this being a superstate, a neoliberal concept, about the unbridled centralisation and militarisation of the EU, and this âplan Dâ is doing nothing to lay these prejudices to rest.
When the day of truth comes â which it will â we will have to get the treaty accepted in the remaining Member States, and all I can say to you is that many small projects for Europe are no substitute for the great European project that is the Constitution.
I hope you will succeed in combining the two; only then will you have done your job.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that the period of discussion and debate is now really beginning, as so far it had been a period of discussion and silence.
It is beginning thanks to the parliamentary forum that we held in Brussels last week, which was a real success.
It is also being encouraged by Estoniaâs decision, the announcement made by Finland, the statement from the Irish Prime Minister, the speech made by MrsÂ Merkel before the and the words of President Napolitano who, when he took office yesterday, stated clearly that there was no alternative to the European constitutional process.
It is being encouraged by all these factors, Commissioner, but not particularly by the words of MrÂ Barroso.
MrÂ Barroso should be capable of providing the political leadership of a President of the European Commission who helped to draw up the Constitution and is in favour of it.
That he should not be so is unbelievable.
Yesterday I read your Communication to the Council very carefully.
To be honest, it would be more interesting for any citizen to read the first and second parts of the Constitution, which are obviously easier to understand, than this document.
Despite all of your good intentions, no one will understand it.
What is its objective?
What is its purpose?
There will be solemn declarations next year saying that we need a Europe of plans rather than a plan for Europe.
No, there is no Europe of plans, but a plan for Europe, and that plan is the Constitution.
The objective can be nothing other than bringing it into force within the right timeframe, in other words with the changes that need to be made and in a different political context, but without losing our way.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner.
I should also like to inform my colleague, Mr Stubb, that there was more than one group leader in the Chamber for the duration of the debate.
When we look at what has happened in Europe and when we consider all the words, emotions and print pages that have been published on the future plan for Europe, one key element is missed.
That is that what the people across the European Union have said, not just in the referenda on the Constitution but also in previous European elections, was a cry for help.
They wanted a greater understanding and a greater knowledge of what Europe is.
The people we meet on the streets every day are not afraid of Europe or of the European Union.
They are not even afraid of further development or enlargement of the European Union.
However, there is a lack of engagement with the European Union and often a lack of trust about where they see the European Union going.
When we speak about Plan D for democracy and so on and we put forward these plans, they must be based on what people want.
Many of my colleagues have spoken about the blame game and who is more to blame, because President Barroso did not say this or a government did not say that.
