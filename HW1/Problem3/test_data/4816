As a keen cyclist I am especially pleased by the provisions for carrying bicycles on the train.
These will hopefully make a real contribution towards easing congestion problems.
It is a fine example of co-modality in passenger transport.
In conclusion I must thank the rapporteurs for their hard work and congratulate them on the outcome.
Thanks to their efforts we are a little closer to a common European rail market.
My thanks too, of course, to the German Presidency and to Commissioner Barrot.
(PT) Despite the fact that trains continue to offer a safe, environmentally-friendly means of transport, capable of carrying large volumes of goods and passengers comfortably and speedily, with a high quality of service, the truth of the matter is that an open, competitive railway system in the Community area is still a long way off.
Liberalisation is the only way to achieve the right financial and technological conditions for attracting investment and to provide the necessary impetus in order to make the railways more attractive and efficient and to achieve greater interoperability.
The negotiation of the Third Railway Package is another step in this direction and we hope that the combined will of the Council, the Commission and the Parliament reflected in that package will send out a strong and coherent political message, a message which is capable of mobilising the long-term investment which this sector needs.
I would like to congratulate our fellow Members, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Stercks, for their excellent work which has enabled us to discuss principles and guidelines today in relation to various matters. For example, the matter of access to the market for international passenger services by rail from 2010 and the question of agreement in the sensitive area of the charges to be applied to international passenger transport services, where it is necessary to safeguard both the financing of the relevant public service and the economic viability of transporters.
It should be noted that this process will now be followed up because the opening up of the railways market is to be the subject of a new Commission communication, scheduled for 2012.
Likewise, in the field of certification of train drivers, notable progress has been made over certificates and licences which in future, thanks to the Parliament, will certainly cover all train crew dealing with safety and, finally, there has been significant progress in the complex area of passenger rights and obligations with regard to compensation for delays and guaranteed mobility, for example, with a view to improving the efficiency and attractiveness of international passenger transport by rail.
Mr President, we all know that there is a very long road between the drafting of legislation and its full implementation and it is that road which we must travel if we are to achieve dynamic and coherent development of this mode of transport.
(ES) This evening marks a new stage in the modernisation, indeed Europeanisation, of rail transport, with the establishment of common ground rules.
Mr Jarzembowski's report, which carries out Parliament's mandate to the full, shows that an agreement has been reached that is satisfactory for all parties, despite the present imbalance between countries that have open networks, those that have put time and effort into modernising their infrastructure - in Spain, for example, with regard to the track gauge problem - and those who need more time to achieve the minimum level required in order to compete on equal terms.
All in all, it is extremely important that the final agreement reflected in the Jarzembowski report preserves the Commission's right to decide what proposal it will submit for the final stage.
In this sector, secure and sustainable as we know it and want it to be, it is essential that we proceed in a secure and sustainable manner.
We believed the most difficult part would be the opening-up of the rail networks; in the end the human aspect proved the most complex.
What is important is not simply the agreement on train drivers as such, but the fact that Mr Savary succeeded in establishing quickly and firmly the conditions for trains to be driven by drivers who have their training and certification in common.
And we also have a promise that other crew members will be able to operate under the same or similar conditions in the not too distant future.
As I was saying, what proved most difficult in the end were the rights and obligations of rail passengers.
To have reached agreement that these will apply to national as well as international rail travel is a fundamental achievement.
Our citizens would not have understood that something should be agreed at international level when they have to put up with these conditions daily at national level.
While not as comprehensive as we would have wished, a secure basis has been established for the rights of all passengers to prompt and efficient information and assistance.
We know this is not enough.
We want to go further, and campaigning organisations - particularly, in my country, the National Organisation for the Blind - have asked for more.
We must continue, but we believe that this evening with the Sterckx report we have opened up a promising avenue for progress.
As we conclude this stage, an equally promising stage is beginning that requires our full commitment.
We still have to deal with interoperability, all the safety aspects that need to be strengthened and Europeanised, and the task of putting flesh on the bones of the Agency.
Finally, there remains the great challenge of a European rail network for goods transport - the Commission's forthcoming proposals for a dedicated goods transport network - and all the logistical support required in order to make the European nodes that are being established today into a real transport network for the future.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his work in preparing a text for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Directive on the development of the Community's railways and on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges.
The text of the directive was agreed through the conciliation procedure. This directive will be important for the continuing development of the Community's railways, for passengers and for freight traffic.
The railways, which are already two centuries old, are becoming more important in today's world because of environmental protection as well as congestion on the roads.
The problems as regards developing rail transport will be funds for modernisation and for constructing and equipping new networks.
In order to achieve harmonious growth, poor countries will need considerable financial support.
The text that has been agreed for the new directive will have a positive impact on further growth in the railways.
Mr Savary's report on the rights of train drivers and Mr Sterckx's report on rights and obligations cover further issues relating to railway transport.
I would like to congratulate them on their work.
(EL) Mr President, the third rail package agreement is another step towards selling off the people's wealth.
Public property is being sold to capital in order to multiply profits at the expense of the working classes and to increase their exploitation.
The regulation of rights and obligations contained in the package is no more than sugaring the pill of passenger transport deregulation.
Railway workers have expressed their vehement opposition to the deregulation of rail transport both in the two previous packages and in the present one.
We, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, are opposed to the selling off of the railways, especially in Greece, where rail transport is far removed from the people's needs and in many cases continues to operate with obsolete infrastructure and equipment.
We side with the workers who are fighting for the development of public transport.
We need a public rail service guaranteeing safe, high-quality transport, which will both meet the current needs of workers and be environmentally-friendly.
We will therefore vote against the agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
We point to the responsibility of the EU and the governments of the Member States in this anti-popular policy and in the plundering of the people's wealth by capital.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as one of those who started the collection of signatures entitled 'One Million for Disability' I encouraged men and women throughout Europe to actively support people with disabilities.
In early October the signatures will be handed over to the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Parliament to urge them also to do more to support a social Europe.
Today, almost on the eve of that occasion, we are debating the third rail package, which is also and from my point of view very specifically concerned with the rights and obligations of rail passengers.
A substantial part of the regulation focuses on the rights and obligations of persons with reduced mobility, whether as a result of age, disability or any other factor, and - particularly noteworthy - of any accompanying persons.
They have the same right to freedom of movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination as all other citizens.
It has been a great victory on the part of the European Parliament that this part of the rail package will apply not only to international but also to domestic services.
That expands all rail passengers' user rights and improves the quality and effectiveness of rail passenger services.
It means all travellers have a right to information about rail services both before and during the journey.
Gradually all buildings and vehicles will also be made accessible to persons with reduced mobility.
Passengers will have more rights to compensation and assistance in the event of delays, missed connections or cancelled trains, and the complaints procedure that was lacking in the past will create trust between passengers and service providers.
All those factors will make using the train more attractive.
Unfortunately, Member States can still apply temporary exemptions, yet this result does mean we are safely on the right road.
Now the Member States can prove how serious they were in March this year when they signed the UN Charter on persons with disabilities.
I expect my country, Germany, to set a good example in transposing the rights of persons with disabilities.
I thank the rapporteurs and all those who conducted the negotiations during the conciliation procedure and recommend endorsing this package.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, the certification of train drivers is an important step forward Community transport legislation, one which is capable of kick-starting the revitalisation of the Community rail network, and Gilles Savary has played a vital role in this process.
It is also possible to promote use of the railways by creating incentives for improving the quality of service and by reinforcing the rights of drivers and passengers, thereby favouring modal equality.
The revitalisation of rail transport in the European Union makes an important contribution towards a sustainable transport system and towards the creation of the single European market.
This legislation will therefore strengthen the railways component of the single market, especially as regards international passenger transport, an area which is covered by the proposal for a directive to open up the market for international passenger services by rail.
Procedures have also been laid down for certifying train drivers in the European Union and the legal provisions which we have been debating also strengthen the rights of rail passengers, hence the importance of discussing these three reports and three directives.
The report on a joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the rail network in the Community therefore establishes specific legal provisions recognising professional attainment with a view to ensuring the mobility of train drivers throughout Europe and at the same time improving the mobility of international rail travel in the European Union.
These are positive steps which are to be welcomed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures needed to achieve interoperability have been thoroughly examined by harmonising the legislation concerning the training of train drivers and their certification, which is also a very positive step.
Significant progress has therefore been made towards achieving the railways component of the internal market by providing a clear guarantee of the rights of workers, undertakings and passengers, who are after all the European citizens who elected us.
Finally I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs Dirk Stercks and Georg Jarzembowski and, last but not least, Gilles Savary, for all their hard work.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(NL) Mr President, sincere thanks to the rapporteurs and to Vice-President Vidal-Quadras Roca for their hard work in securing a successful outcome on this complicated third Railway Package.
Some of the rapporteurs, Mr President, may feel they have to make the best of a bad job, having hoped to achieve far more, but I think the result we have is commendable in all respects.
It is a positive development that all rail passengers in Europe now have a number of basic rights.
The ability and the right of people with reduced mobility to travel are now much better regulated.
It is also good that additional rules on long-distance travel have been made compulsory, but those rules are not appropriate for urban and regional transport, so it is good that these have been exempted and will come under a different set of rules.
Mr President, we have had a substantial debate on the liberalisation of rail transport.
Not only with the Council, but here in Parliament too.
I am happy with the outcome.
Liberalisation was the right way to go on international rail transport, but not on national rail transport.
Mr President, the differences between Member States are too great to impose the national liberalisation of domestic rail links in a 'top-down' manner from Europe, because busy regional networks are fragile and there has to be scope for putting put these out to private tender.
That too is a form of competition.
I am happy with that outcome.
It is cautious competition, but appropriate to these complex networks, I think.
Mr Barrot says the Commission will be analysing prospects for the further liberalisation of domestic passenger transport; I expressly urge him to include in that analysis the question of putting networks out to private tender and how far that may benefit the operation of the market.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to welcome the fact that the inter-institutional Conciliation Committee has managed to reach agreement, and that the market in international rail passenger transport services within the European Union will therefore be opened up in 2010.
Liberalisation is a good move ... (the President interrupted the speaker); open competition is a necessity in the passenger transport services market.
It will not only contribute to implementing rail transport reform, but at the same time will create the kind of competitive situation in which the main winners will be the consumers themselves.
However, we cannot just go straight ahead and force national rail companies into free market competition, since several Member States' rail companies are facing financial difficulties. In addition, their infrastructure is often exceptionally underdeveloped.
We therefore need to support their development efforts and we must allow them time to become competitive so that they are able to hold their own in the battle to win passengers.
Alongside liberalisation, it is at least as important to enhance passenger confidence in rail services by improving, extending and internationalising passenger rights.
The new legislation means that rail service providers will have to assume greater responsibility.
Harmonisation of EU legislation on the rights and obligations of passengers, information, assumption of liability for passengers and their luggage, the issue of compensation, handling of delays and provision for passengers with reduced mobility are all things that increase safety and at the same time enhance the reputation of rail service providers.
It is an ambitious goal, but absolutely essential for facilitating development of the European high-speed rail network and cross-border operating arrangements relating to it.
At the same time, it also increases confidence with regard to domestic rail passenger transport.
Increasing efficiency and improving rail network and service quality are truly fundamental not only in terms of developing a sustainable transport sector but also in terms of overcrowding and air pollution.
Of course, alongside the new legislative package, in the interests of improving quality we must also ensure that the directive is appropriately transposed into national law.
In view of these issues, the implementation report due in 2012 will be especially important, as will the companies' annual reports.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and all those who contributed to the success of the negotiations; thanks to you we will at last be able to vote on this issue tomorrow.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(DE) Mr President, I too would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their work - it was no easy job.
After all, the third rail package is the continuation of a long process of opening up the European rail sector to competition and harmonising standards in Europe.
Like many earlier speakers, I particularly welcome the proposed regulation on the rights and obligations of passengers.
Here, for the first time, uniform rules are being introduced throughout Europe to strengthen passengers' rights.
As Mr Koch very clearly explained, among other things the regulation covers the provision of suitable access to trains, stations and platforms for persons with reduced mobility. It covers liability in the event of injury or death.
It covers the creation of a system of compensation for train delays and cancellations. It is high time that not just air passengers but rail passengers also acquire minimum rights.
It is only at first sight that this regulation appears to place a burden on railway undertakings.
In the end, granting passengers minimum rights makes the railways more attractive.
Strengthening passengers' rights makes a considerable contribution to promoting rail travel, which will result in an increase in the overall share of this mode of transport.
Travel by rail is finally to become a real alternative to flying within Europe.
That is important in terms of the climate issue.
The Commission proposal provided for the introduction of passengers' rights only for international rail travel.
I am glad that we managed to ensure that its scope is now extended to all rail passengers, especially of course to domestic railways and not just to passengers in international rail services.
It is after all incomprehensible for a passenger on a train from Cologne to Brussels to enjoy passengers' rights while someone taking a train from Frankfurt to Cologne is not entitled to the same rights.
It is a pity, though, that we have to be satisfied with the compromise of possibly having long transitional periods before these rights are implemented.
The consumer will not understand that.
(RO) Mr. President, this legislative package has a truly European connotation, both in principle, and in essence, although it still keeps the designation "internationalâ, while militating for the internal market development.
For this stage, a distinction is still necessary and is an important step in creating an integrated railway network in the European Union.
Member States have the possibility to more efficiently amortize their long term investments, which are absolutely necessary for special infrastructure.
The services maintenance and quality costs may decrease to the benefit of passengers who, in their turn, will have the freedom to choose between commercial services and public services, at the same time having their rights guaranteed.
Moreover, by cabotage, all passengers can have access to competitive services.
Nevertheless, we have to admit that, in the new Member States, such as Romania, operations still go ahead under disadvantageous conditions.
For this reason, liberalization must be analyzed and approached differently from case to case, focusing on improving interoperability and cooperation in transborder sectors, as well as by reexamining priorities within the instruments of financing investments in special infrastructures.
Moreover, the Union has to prepare for the true challenge: to create a functional integrated network with the railway systems of neighbouring countries, by Trans-European Transport Networks and by Pan-European corridors, observing the expansion and facilitation of access to Central and Eastern Asia.
I specify that there is a risk of the appearance of false jobs, generated by the relocation of the workers of a neighbour operator to a new operator.
Therefore, a balance must be found between competitive economic policies and social policies.
It is also necessary to discourage any distortion of competition. First of all, this can be done by transparency, as well as by preventing the creation of a monopolist alliance at the level of big railway operators that could block the access of new operators to the market because, in the end, the passengers are the ones who suffer.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers, whose contributions illustrate the extent of this shared desire to develop the use of our railways significantly.
For the benefit of Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Savary, I would add that the Commission has undertaken to present a report 30 months after the directive has been adopted, with, if necessary, legislative proposals based on the European Railway Agency's recommendations.
With regard to the certification of train drivers, our aim is to create a Europe-wide rail area and so, of course, we want to promote mobility for railway personnel.
Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, all this will work only if the Member States supply the necessary investment because we cannot have a successful railway policy until we make the trans-European networks a reality, and guarantee interoperability on all the major lines, notably through the ERTMS.
Clearly the duty to invest is crucial.
Investment is the price to be paid for giving full effect to the texts that you are about to adopt.
In relation to freight traffic by rail, there was, indeed, an initial proposal for a regulation on compensation for failure to meet commitments on service quality in this sector.
Subsequently, while recognising that the aims were sound, Parliament and the Council decided that the measure proposed was inappropriate.
Nonetheless, I have to say that I will continue to pay close attention to the development of freight traffic on the railways.
I am still concerned about problems of punctuality and the reliability of goods transport services by rail.
So I will submit a report towards the end of 2007 on the development of service quality and on suitable measures to tackle the problems.
This will obviously lead the Commission to propose a European railway network with a focus on freight.
I hope to present the report in October.
As many of you have said, any compromise is clearly just a step and may be seen to be limited, but a step can also be seen as a measure of progress.
For my own part, I am convinced that by adopting this third Railway Package, Parliament will send out a powerful signal to the people of Europe, who can make much greater use of rail as a means of travel.
I would add that we are in the process of establishing passengers' rights, based on the notion of European citizenship.
With regard to aircraft passengers, much remains to be done in order to give effect to the law.
In the case of rail passengers, they obviously need to be supplied with clear, straightforward information enabling them to understand what they are entitled to expect.
I believe, however, that we are effectively sending out a strong signal by demonstrating that we are determined to press ahead with development of a proper passengers' charter to give everyone - including the least advantaged - greater access to mobility.
Such is my conviction and I would conclude, Mr President, by thanking once again all the Members of the House, whose observations will assist us in the process of closely monitoring how these texts are applied.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 25 September 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council have managed to reach agreement on the third Railway Package.
With regard to my colleague Dirk Sterckx's report, it is a particular source of satisfaction that we got the Council to accept that passengers' rights and obligations should apply to everyone travelling by train in the European Union, and not just to international passengers.
All rail passengers are now to have significant rights, concerning, for example, compensation in the event of delays or cancellations, the information that is supplied to them, and access for people with reduced mobility.
With regard to Georg Jarzembowski's report, opening the international rail passenger market to competition from 1 January 2010 ought to make rail a more efficient means of transport and to have a positive impact for passengers, in terms of prices and choice of train operators.
In addition, it will be possible to finance loss-making railway lines if they have a public-service remit.
This measure is important for guaranteeing universal access to rail transport.
The provisions introduced in this third Railway Package represent genuine progress for ordinary people, and I welcome them.
in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased that the approach I had advocated has been taken, namely opening passenger services to competition, but without rushing.
The third Railway Package provides for liberalisation of international passenger services from 2010 onwards, with a viable mechanism for financing infrastructure.
After the Commission delivers its findings on the economic, social and safety-related aspects in 2012, we can consider calmly whether it is appropriate to extend the existing arrangements to include national passenger services.
We were keen that these measures to modernise the management of rail services should be balanced by significant steps to ensure safety.
Train staff will now have to meet common standards of qualification and training, leading to the award of a 'train driver's licence'.
Parliament has also secured a significant improvement in passengers' basic rights on both international and national lines: there are provisions for liability in the event of accidents, and rights for people with disabilities or reduced mobility.
I am sorry to see, however, that intractability in the Council has resulted in derogations being permitted for up to 15 years with regard to implementation of the right to information, compensation in the event of delays or accidents and, indeed, provision for carrying bicycles on trains.
in writing. - (HU) One hundred and sixty years ago, in 1846, the first Hungarian railway line was opened between the old city of Pest and the town of VÃ¡c.
Hungary's first railway line preceded the French bourgeois revolution of 1848 by two years, and more or less the same people were behind both events.
This was hardly coincidental.
The railway fostered the rise of the middle classes, economic development, disintegration of feudal restrictions and the birth of unified nations.
In the second half of the twentieth century, motorisation eclipsed the development of the railways in Hungary too.
Fortunately, however, this was only a temporary decline.
The Hungarian railway is in rather a bad state at present, and this is one reason why it is important to apply for Community funds to develop it.
Development of international transit rail networks is understandably a priority.
Similarly, the importance of suburban railways has increased.
At least half a million people commute to Budapest daily for work or study.
The only solution to the chronic traffic jams is to introduce congestion charges and focus resources on developing the suburban railway.
Liberalisation is to be welcomed as long as it does not threaten railway employees' jobs or the safety of railway operations.
It is likewise important to ensure that passengers' rights are protected by sound guarantees.
I hope that, under the new system, with the help of government and EU funds and private capital, the Hungarian railway will once again become as modern as it was in the early days, in the era of great reforms.

Decision on urgent procedure
Proposal for a Council Regulation derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards set aside for year 2008 - C6-0302/2007 -
Mr President, yesterday my committee had an extraordinary meeting in order to examine the Commission proposal and the request to treat this proposal as urgent.
My committee agreed that the request for urgent procedure should be approved.
It was approved unanimously.
The Commission is proposing to set a 0% rate of compulsory set-aside for 2008.
This proposal must be adopted as soon as possible - that is, before the end of this month - in order to allow farmers to take their decisions for growing crops on set-aside land in 2008.
The land concerned must be brought back to production because a poor 2008 harvest combined with 10% set-aside will expose the internal market to potential serious risks.
The cereal market at the beginning of the marketing year 2007/08 is characterised by historically high prices both at Community and world level.
The 2007 harvest will probably remain close to last year's level and will lead to further reductions in the EU of private cereal stocks by the end of the 2007/08 marketing year.
At global level, closing stocks in 2007/08 are expected to fall to an historically low level, especially in major exporting countries.
In this context, a normal 2008 harvest will trend yields, and the proposed derogation for set-aside in 2008 in the European Union would allow for a partial rebuilding of the private stocks, so I ask for urgency.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
(DE) Mr President, I refer to yesterday's plenary session and the one-minute speeches that took place at the start of the plenary session.
During those one-minute speeches there was an incident.
A Polish Member (I do not know which Group he belongs to) criticised our President in an improper manner in this House.
I defended the President of our House, as I thought was necessary.
I had the impression that many colleagues in this House saw things the way I did.
As a result my fellow Member, Markus Ferber, later threw a comment in my direction, the gist of which meant that I assume the right in this House to make comments on everything, which is definitely not the case.
I regret that I do not have the right to do this, but I do not comment on everything.
As a result I insulted Mr Ferber in the generally fevered situation with two German expressions, which I would not like to repeat here and which are not true either.
I therefore take it back, expressing my regret and would be grateful if you would convey to my fellow Member, Mr Ferber, that he should accept my apology and that I otherwise regard him as a very amusing fellow Member.
(Applause)
Mr Schulz, we shall include your comments in the record of proceedings and take note of them.
Restructuring of the sugar industry - Common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Katerina Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the restructuring of the sugar industry - C6-0176/2007 -, and
the report by Katerina Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector - C6-0177/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Ms Batzeli and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on this proposal.
I will now start to place the proposal into its context.
As you know, the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations during the second year of the restructuring period, after actually quite a promising first year.
As you might remember, we were expecting about 1.5 million tonnes of quota to be renounced in the first year and more than 3 million tonnes in the second year.
In reality, the total renunciation in the first two years amounted to only 2.2 million tonnes against an expected 4.5 million tonnes.
I am still convinced that the restructuring fund is a good instrument as such, which should be strengthened and improved, taking into account the experiences that we have had up to now.
Concerning the proposal we are to discuss today, let me make it clear that we are not in a process of renegotiating the sugar reform from 2005.
In light of the insufficient take-up under the restructuring fund over the first two years of its operation, the objective is to make a success out of it for the last two years.
Otherwise the final uncompensated cut of the quotas will kick in in 2010.
This proposal aims to make a very attractive offer to those undertakings and to those growers that want to give up quota production in the marketing year 2008/09, while in principle keeping unchanged the conditions for the last year of the restructuring period.
For the first time, growers will be able to trigger the restructuring process, but only up to a limit of 10% of the quota belonging to an undertaking.
The percentage of the restructuring aid reserved for growers will be fixed at 10% and this payment will be then supplemented by a top-up of EUR 237.5 per tonne of sugar quota and this sums up altogether to EUR 300 per tonne.
I think this is a very interesting offer for the growers and I do not see any need to go further.
That is why I will not be in a position to support the amendments in the report on the restructuring fund that asks for changes in the amounts paid, for example 6, 7 and 12, or in the percentage that goes to the farmers: namely, amendment 8.
An element of retroactivity will ensure that those undertakings and those sugar beet producers who have already taken part in the restructuring scheme up till now have not been or will not be disadvantaged by having done so.
As requested in amendment 9, the eligibility of inulin syrup producers and chicory growers for retroactive payments will be explicitly mentioned in the final text.
Moreover, undertakings that will be restructured in the marketing or growing year 2008/09 could be exempted from the restructuring levy applied to the quantity subject to the 2007/08 preventive withdrawal, provided that they renounce their quota accordingly.
And, last but not least, as an additional incentive for undertakings, their individual restructuring effort will be taken into account in case of an obligatory final quota cut.
In order to make it easier to reach a market balance during the restructuring period, it is proposed to make the preventive withdrawal a permanent tool, not only during the restructuring period, exactly as is proposed by Ms Batzeli in her report.
The proposed draft regulations aim to create a secure environment and to remove existing blockages from the system.
All these improvements should make the fund a success in the third year, without changing the common market organisation for sugar on the basis of the reform that we agreed in 2005.
The measures proposed are balanced to create strong incentives for all parties that are involved in the restructuring process.
I want to thank you for your good cooperation, which makes it possible for us to adhere to the tight schedule that we have to work under and to have this much more efficient system in place for the marketing year 2008/09.
I am aware that the fund must be improved to achieve its aim and, if this is not possible, I am quite sure that there will be no winners.
There will only be losers and, therefore, I have been very grateful for the support that I have met from the Agriculture Committee and the Members.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me first of all to remind you that in its original opinion on the Common Market Organisation (CMO) in sugar the European Parliament pointed out that the Commission's proposals ought to contribute to the essential viability of the new system and to the safeguarding of the sugar beet growers, the workers in sugar mills and areas of production, all of which will be affected by the elimination of quotas.
This was our political commitment and agreement, based on which we gave our consent to the Commission.
However, the final decisions by the Council in 2005 on the review of the sugar sector could not meet these high expectations.
The sector is particularly important for the equalisation of the arable crops market, the supply of European sugar and bio-ethanol factories, as well as the advancement of a new framework of policies for the modification of other CMOs under review within the context of the new CAP.
The Council's decisions have seemed doomed from the outset to a short life and marginalisation because they were no more than a patchwork of national demands and complex mechanisms.
This decision and the way it is implemented at national level mean that the reduction in production to date has been no more than 2.2 million tonnes, whereas the target is approximately 6 million tonnes by 2010.
I should like remind you that for any kind of reduced production after 2010 the producing regions, workers and producers will not receive any compensation from the Restructuring Fund, which is totally self-funded.
Such, then, were the important political issues occupying us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when we had to decide on the report with which you are acquainted.
Commissioner, in the Agriculture Committee we made significant improvements for the unimpeded implementation at national level of Community decisions.
We did not seek radically to review the sugar CMO, and, in any case, you indicate this in your text.
We did not seek to propose a multi-speed review since in many regions such as Ireland sugar production has already been reduced in part or totally abandoned.
In addition, we have considered the existing budgetary savings amounting to approximately EUR 3 million.
If this money is not used, it will not be ploughed back into the sector but will fund other projects or will be paid back.
Finally, in light of the principle of proportionality and equality with regard to sugar beet growers, we must all agree with the principle of the retroactivity of the measures proposed in order not to create a climate of injustice for producers, mills and regions that have already joined the new system.
I should also like to point out that the ineffectiveness of the large degree of the Member States' flexibility and subsidiarity worries us.
This flexibility has become an unofficial nationalisation of the measures: the Member States have been free to implement the new CMO as they please, bending to the pressures exerted on them by collective bodies and regional authorities.
The way the Member States treat the concept and policy of flexibility ought to be a matter of concern for us in future reviews, as should the issue of how this policy is to be used within the framework of health check decisions.
Commissioner, we must now move from political questions to technical issues, which will also decide the course of the CMO review.
With regard to the amendment of Regulation No 318/2006, we consider that what is required is a fairer application of the final linear quota reductions by 2010.
If a straight reduction in quotas is considered necessary in 2010, our committee believes that this reduction should be conducted in two stages.
During the first stage there should be a linear cut of 13.5%.
During the second stage the Commission's proposal should be implemented; accordingly, the Member States and those undertakings which have renounced quotas during the restructuring regime would be exempted.
The exemption will be in line with the efforts made at national level.
However, I should like to point out to the Commission and the Council, not attending the debate here today, that we must bear in mind the reduced contribution of undertakings, which have either voluntarily reduced their quotas by participating in the restructuring regime or participated in the preventative withdrawal mechanism.
We propose a broader and more long-term use of preventative withdrawal, thus assisting smoother adaptation of the sector to future challenges.
Since the subject of preventative withdrawal has hitherto not been found in the compromise at Council level, I should like to include it, Commissioner, if you agree.
As for the amendment of Regulation No 320/2006 on the restructuring regime, which is in any case the central aspect of the reform, my report proposes:
firstly, to increase to EUR 260 per tonne the lump sum of EUR 237 per tonne which the producers will receive.
We insist on this, despite your disagreement, Commissioner, because we believe that it is a significant incentive for producers to move to the concept of a 10% voluntary renunciation;
secondly, to increase to 50% the single compensation amount for producers from restructuring aid, which is currently fixed at 10%.
This increase is a political commitment by the European Parliament; it shows that the subsidies ought to go mainly to the producers.
The message more political than financial;
thirdly, the compensation paid to undertakings for the production of bio-ethanol should be raised from 35% to 100%, since, in our view, a significant incentive should be given to contribute to the renewable energy sources sector;
fourthly, and of particular importance for the regions, is the maintenance of aid for diversification in the regions where mills have closed: it should remain at EUR 109.5 per tonne of reduced sugar production until the 2009-2010 period.
Commissioner, we seek partly to improve funding in order to reduce the impact on the regions as well as to provide additional incentives.
The review is intended not to amend some general provisions but to strengthen incentives;
fifthly, the renunciation of 10% of quotas should apply first of all to small or less competitive producers;
sixthly, restructuring aid must be increased for partial abandonment, from EUR 218.75 to EUR 625 for the 2008-2009 period.
I have to admit that the rapporteur's position is particularly significant in supporting issues of this sort.
I should like to point out as rapporteur that certain proposals of the Agriculture Committee ought to be re-examined to get things in proportion.
For this reason, I believe we ought to take into account funding from the Restructuring Fund and also additional funding from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.
As rapporteur, I should therefore, like to endorse Amendments 27 to 30, which introduce three fundamental principles:
firstly, a retroactive measure, because producers, undertakings and regions which have complied progressively from the start of the new CMO cannot be penalised;
secondly, the amount of aid must be reasonable and acceptable to all sides (and not EUR 625 for one year);
thirdly, it is important to increase retroactively and until the end of the transitional period the amount of aid given to mills for partial abandonment of production.
In closing, allow me to express a note of warning.
Negotiations the Commission is holding with the ACP countries within the framework of the EPA are ongoing.
The Commission seems ready to abolish both the safety clauses with regard to the total quantities of sugar importable into the Community by each partner country and the minimum price clause for imported sugar.
In addition, it is also proposed that access to the Community market should be liberalised in a similar way for the sixteen Sugar Protocol countries.
Commissioner, I believe that we are called upon to do important work here.
Such decisions outside the institutional framework should be invalid: they would invalidate the political and institutional role played by the European Parliament.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President.
The Committee on Budgets fundamentally supports the proposal.
Let me also personally congratulate the rapporteur.
It is a very difficult task under any circumstances to try to persuade growers in a given sector to cut back their production.
Nor does it cast us in a very good light in the eyes of European citizens to be giving support and funding to this sort of thing.
Nevertheless, if it becomes necessary to intervene in such a way and, moreover, it has no greater impact on the overall budget of the European Union than the present arrangements, then it is appropriate that it should be better targeted and that some compensation and support should go to those who are genuinely taking action on this issue on the production side, as is happening in the present case.
It is a major problem, however, that there are cases where countries have already renounced some of their quotas, only to find that the regulations have subsequently changed.
The report proposes ways of resolving this and I ask Parliament to support these in this form.
Thank you for your kind attention.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give a brief review of the last reform.
Many sugar beet growers are asking why a reform of this market regulation, which has stood the test of time over decades, is necessary at all.
There are two main reasons why this reform was and is necessary.
Firstly, it was decided a few years ago, in the wake of the arms initiative, that as from 2009 everything except arms may be supplied to Europe from the poorest countries.
The sugar sector is also affected by this.
The second reason is that there is a WTO decision and we have to remove surpluses.
This means that we have to take more than 6 million tonnes of sugar out of production.
Commissioner, we put forward proposals to Parliament in 2005 and you have just said that the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations.
Today I would like to say here that if the Commission and Council had followed Parliament's proposals more closely in 2005, greater volumes of sugar would probably have been renounced voluntarily.
We now have the opportunity to make corrections so that incentives are improved.
I can only ask the Commission and Council to follow the proposals.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, for the report she has submitted.
The Agriculture Committee has largely followed these proposals - with minor corrections - and I am convinced that if the Commission follows these proposals, incentives will be increased to such an extent that much larger volumes of sugar will be renounced voluntarily.
I should like to state, Commissioner, that there are many members of the Agriculture Committee who have listened closely to the sugar beet producers.
If the requirements set out here are met, I believe that this reform will be successful.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mrs Fischer Boel, I think Katerina Batzeli's report and SurjÃ¡n LÃ¡szlÃ³'s opinion are technically sound and politically very correct.
Restoring balance in the market is important, and we are still a long way from being able to achieve a market balance by 2010 with regard to European sugar production and sugar beet cultivation.
I do not envy the Commission or Parliament, because it is not easy to create order and equilibrium in a distorted, excessively complicated and oversubsidised system.
This sector, after all, was the beloved child of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) compared to other, less favoured sectors.
I fully agree on the need for counterbalancing.
If we implement the additional 10% reduction, there will still be a surplus of 2.1 million tonnes in the system, and if we do not manage to deal with this by 2010 we will need to make a further reduction of 14%.
I believe it is unfair, and I would ask the Commissioner and the Commission to weigh this carefully, that those countries which have made major reductions, namely Italy, Portugal and Finland, will still have to make a further reduction of 10% along with all the others.
This is not fair.
I also agree that we should do more to protect the interests of small and medium-sized growers, because the 'first-come-first-served' rule puts them at an informational disadvantage compared with the multinationals.
In Hungary one factory in five has closed down.
The best sugar manufacturer has ceased operating, but neither the manufacturer nor the growers have come off badly.
The only thing not covered adequately in the earlier regulation was compensation to employees, I mean compensation to the employees of the sugar manufacturer.
Lastly, I think it is very important that undertakings should not have to pay the restructuring levy if they reduce their quota.
There is a demand to this effect.
I ask Mrs Fischer Boel to support this, as it would encourage further reductions and help restore a balance in the market.
Once again, helping small and medium-sized growers is therefore very important because this has a major social impact on European sugar beet growers.
Thank you for your attention.
on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Mr President, the reform of the sugar production sector in its existing shape is unacceptable.
It strikes primarily at beet producers and sugar factory workers.
The exceptional activity shown by European concerns in buying up sugar factories in Eastern Europe prior to their accession to the EU gives rise to the suspicion that this reform was already being planned back then, with vast sums in compensation for the owners of sugar factories who will be shutting them down.
In the new Member States, during the accession period farmers invested huge sums in upgrading their farms, including beet production.
Two years on it has turned out that production needs to be restricted, while the main beneficiary of the compensation for giving up sugar production will be the new owners of the sugar factories.
It is estimated that in Poland alone around ten factories will be closed.
The proposed adjustments, which allocate higher sums from the restructuring fund to growers, are good.
My doubts, though, arise from the support for producers who have been buying sugar factories over the last few years, because could it not just be that they have been buying them with a view to closing them profitably?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the sugar market regulation is not a showpiece of the Commission and Council!
Mr DeÃ has already said that if you had listened a little more to Parliament's proposals, some of the glitches would not have occurred.
When we have an instrument like the quota, we must use it and not threaten it for 2010, and then we must make flat-rate or staggered reductions and provide compensation for these.
Your way of doing this through pricing came to grief because you then increased the quota by a million tonnes in one go by converting C sugar into quota sugar.
Furthermore, financing by consumers by means of pricing has meant that the sugar industry has had no interest in restructuring.
Export subsidies have not been radically reduced.
This too would have been required.
The errors should be specified and they are not being corrected now either.
The restructuring fund and restructuring aid are essentially discontinuations.
The regions, trade unions and growers are against them.
No diversification has been adopted, as Parliament demanded, in order to safeguard the regions' socio-ecological development.
Nor are all these errors now being corrected.
We are therefore remedying the wrong symptoms.
Another important point is that you now want to limit restructuring aid going to growers to 10%.
It used to be that countries could fix a higher price.
We are putting forward another proposal here and I hope that Parliament will implement it this time with the referral instrument, because you have not honoured the promises you made to us at the last vote, but have now gone back on them.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, the new sugar sector regulation adopted in 2006 and already being implemented is a bitter pill and it has claimed its first victims.
We, of course, voted against it and were right to do so: sugar mills have closed and many sugar beet growers have ended up unemployed.
They receive paltry compensation which is intended to stifle their opposition and protests.
In my country, Greece, sugar beet cultivation used to guarantee that the people were self-sufficient in sugar; it provided many workers and farmers with work and injected economic life into neglected regions.
Today, two out of five factories have closed, production has fallen by 50%, unemployment in the sector has risen, farmers have been made destitute and whole regions have been devastated.
The amendments proposed today are aimed at fully implementing the new regulation.
There is to be no let up in the diminishing rate of production, fixed at a shortfall of 2.2 million tonnes and increasing to a planned shortfall of 6 million tonnes.
This means an even greater impact than we have already seen.
The winners will be the food industrialists, who will import cheap sugar; the losers will be sugar industry workers, since more mills will close and further numbers of small and medium-sized sugar beet producers will be wiped out.
We oppose this and we will vote against the additional arrangements: they are hastening the completion of the basic regulation and are yet another criminal ploy in the campaign against the European sugar industry and its workers.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the European sugar industry is on life-support.
The respirator, now the EU, each year gives millions of euros in direct aid and intervention to European sugar growers.
EU taxpayers are financing an antiquated system which has seen its day.
Unfortunately the Committee's proposals mean higher costs and a slower rate of reform, the direct opposite of adjustment to the market which this uncompetitive sector so badly needs.
Sugar-producing countries outside the EU must be given access to the internal market without restrictions.
International trade based on fairer conditions is a means for less developed countries to compete on the global market.
Liberalisation of the sugar industry would also benefit European consumers.
They would avoid having to finance an artificial system of support for producers through their taxes, and they would see lower prices in the shops.
This would benefit everyone.
Mr President, Commissioner, the common market organisation for sugar worked.
It was cheap and offered access to our market to ACP countries.
However, during the WTO negotiations, Thailand, Australia and particularly Brazil insisted on a sugar monopoly.
At the same time, to win allies during the Doha Round, Pascal Lamy, who was at the time European Commissioner for Trade, offered to abolish customs duty for the 49 least developed countries with the 'Everything but arms' programme.
In 2009-2010, Europe will begin to see imports of sugar in theory from poor countries, but which was produced with Kuwaiti, Saudi or other capital, in the Sudan or elsewhere.
European beet growers and sugar producers in outermost regions must therefore be sacrificed for the benefit of Brazil and other countries, hence the 2006 reform. The same applies to cereals and milk.
Soon it will apply to wine. Our producers will disappear, which in Europe is what we call 'restructuring'.
Of course, we pay cereal growers to stop growing crops: we call it 'restructuring aid', like the set-aside payment or the grubbing-up premium.
However, 18 months after this aid programme began, it is not working.
Commissioner, you are giving us the same old speech about grain mountains and milk lakes. You are saying that in 2007-2008, there will be a 4 million tonne surplus, hence the two proposals today for a regulation to obtain the abandonment, apparently, of almost 4 million tonnes of sugar.
We are increasing financial incentives and annual withdrawals, and additional payments and subsidies.
Of course, this aid will stop after 2010 and our farmers will be wiped out, just like the ACP producers, not to mention workers. The only winners will be importers.
These Malthusian policies have been applied to cereals since 1993. At 9 o'clock, Mr Parish told us that there was a wheat shortage, that prices were rocketing and that set-aside needed to be abandoned.
So there is some hope at least: in 2011, there will be a new regulation telling us that there is a sugar shortage and that we need to start growing it again!
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, as a Member of this Parliament for the Czech Republic where the sugar market has already been restructured, I cannot agree with the proposed changes.
They are inappropriate and unfair.
It is becoming clear that the reform does not result in a series of economically uncompetitive companies.
It produces a disproportionate situation from which only the big European sugar companies profit, with no benefit whatsoever to consumers and growers.
I cannot explain to the citizens how a number of countries have not renounced their sugar quotas at all or have done so only on a very small scale while the rest of us are now supposed to pay them more money for breaking a commitment.
First and foremost, I absolutely do not agree with increasing the aid in cases of partial restructuring to the level of full restructuring aid.
Secondly, increasing the amount of restructuring aid to beet growers and contracted suppliers of machinery from 10% to 50% is totally unjustified.
Thirdly, I do not support an increase of additional payments to producers or any increase of temporary restructuring aid; nor do I support an increase in additional payments to suppliers.
Fourthly, the proposal to treat the dismantling of facilities that took place last year as having taken place this financial year and in the course of the following years is, in my opinion, completely absurd.
On the contrary, ladies and gentlemen, the key issue for me is taking into account the full amount of quotas renounced during the whole restructuring period.
I certainly do not support the move to allow the quotas renounced by companies from the financial year 2008-2009 to be taken into account.
I believe that unless the Commission intends to modify its purely bureaucratic and highly unfair method of managing the sugar reform, the best thing to do would be to abolish sugar quotas as quickly as possible and liberalise the sugar market.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the EU's sugar policy is in a strange situation.
Sugar quotas have been reduced by 2.2 million tonnes but at the same time the Commission has been selling millions of tonnes of new quotas.
The net reduction is therefore just a million tonnes, whilst the target was six times that figure.
At the same time, the big producer countries have only increased their production.
For example, Germany has increased its production from what was around 240 000 tonnes a year and France from what was 350 000 tonnes a year.
It is primarily just the small countries that have reduced their production.
Of the biggest countries only Italy has reduced its production significantly.
The result of this has been that the small countries and those countries which are poorer off in terms of their natural conditions have had to reduce their sugar production.
At the same time again, more than EUR 3 billion - three thousand million euros - has accumulated in the restructuring fund, of which perhaps around EUR 2 000 remains unspent at present.
This money has mainly come from consumers, because consumer prices have fallen more slowly than producer prices, and this difference has accrued in the Fund.
On the other hand, it has also come from farmers, whose producer prices have gone down.
This money has been and is being paid mainly to the industry, in the form of a massive amount of compensation to the tune of EUR 730 per tonne, while at the same time just around 10%, at best 20%, of this cash goes on changing the industrial structure and tearing down factories.
The entire sugar policy is a warning example of what can happen when we start implementing agricultural policy on industry's terms.
The industry is being paid huge amounts in compensation and we are getting very little in return.
It is to be hoped that in the future agricultural policy will be practised as agricultural and not industrial policy.
We should focus special attention on the importance of solidarity.
It should also be taken into consideration because all countries, including those which have reduced their sugar production, still have to pay prices for sugar which are higher than global market prices, although they are simply not allowed to produce it because the industry has decided against it.
In the same way, in the future we will need to ensure that we do not start applying any similar kind of system to other areas of agricultural production.
Mr President, I should like to thank Ms Batzeli very much for her report.
I should also like to thank Mr DeÃ very much for shadowing this report for the PPE-DE Group.
I think it was Margaret Thatcher who once said 'you can't buck the markets', and the problem with the whole sugar regime is that it is exactly what we have tried to do over the years.
I commend the Commissioner and what she is doing, because it is a very complex situation and one that we need to sort out.
We need to take more sugar out of the system and we need to make Europe much more competitive in sugar production.
The whole thrust of CAP reform now is to give support to farmers for environmental reasons, but also very much to push them in the direction of producing for the market place.
I think that the reform of sugar this year is perhaps going to be easier than in previous years, for the simple reason that we have now seen cereal prices three times what they were last year.
Therefore, some sugar producers will perhaps decide that they will take the money in the restructuring and that they can grow cereals or oilseed rape and they can make a good living from that.
Because, whatever we do with sugar, we have to be sure, as I said, that we move in the direction of reducing the amount produced in Europe - but we must still allow the farmers to have a living from the land.
We also have to consider not only balancing sugar production in the European Union, but the fact that there are ACP countries from which we import sugar.
In my own country, the United Kingdom, Tate & Lyle imports over one million tonnes of sugar.
It is very concerned to make sure that it can get access to this sugar at the same time as we are reducing and reforming the sugar regime.
I would ask the Commissioner to look sympathetically at that side of the argument as well.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, almost two years ago a legislative package was adopted for the reform of the sugar sector, with the aim of adapting it to a globalised market that really left few opportunities for our farmers.
As you well remember, Commissioner, it was a traumatic reform on which it was difficult to reach an agreement in Parliament.
Now it seems that the objectives of reducing quotas are not being achieved; that is why the Commission is putting forward this new proposal aimed at redressing the situation before it is too late.
We think that in principle, the Commission's proposal is positive, as to a certain extent it gives farmers the opportunity to take the initiative to renounce.
However, in certain aspects, Commissioner, we also think that it is inadequate and that it may produce undesirable effects in some countries such as Spain.
I would therefore like to highlight two points that I think are very important.
Firstly, I would like to stress the importance of the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group, and I would like to thank our rapporteur, Katerina Batzeli for her work, on the need, in some cases, to extend additional aid for withdrawal for farmers to the 2009-2010 marketing year.
We think that this change is vital so that the measure does not fall short and the expectations of producers are fulfilled.
Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the amendment that was adopted in committee in my name, which comes to plenary as Amendment 11, on deeming full dismantling to have taken place where facilities have been converted to bioethanol production.
This measure has two purposes: on the one hand, it encourages renunciation, as it gives a way into other markets for these facilities and, on the other hand, it promotes a sector such as biofuels at a time when there is so much talk of the need to increase supply.
Commissioner, this reform has already been traumatic for many countries, such as mine; I think that there should be money and opportunities to maintain income for farmers who wish to renounce, but above all, for farmers who wish to continue.
(PL) Mr President, the reform of the sugar market is one of those reforms whose sense is very hard to explain to farmers in the European Union, including farmers in my country, Poland.
The administrative and financial pressure to cut back sugar production from 18 to 12 million tonnes is not convincingly justified.
There is talk of a need for solidarity with farmers on other continents, though it is clear that this is not about their interests: it is not about farmers' interests so much as the global interests of large concerns.
In the name of these interests, the European Union, under the auspices of successive 'reforms', is gradually disposing of its agriculture and setting forth down the very hazardous road of making itself dependent on food supplies from outside.
This policy is leading to a loss of security in food supplies, a security that is of great importance to future generations.
My fear is that it will not be long before everyone, and not just farmers, will regret these irresponsible reforms which are going on today, the harmful consequences of which we shall all soon recognise.
(PT) As is well known, we are very critical of this reform of the sugar sector.
We always uphold food sovereignty and we therefore think it is unacceptable that a country such as Portugal, with only one sugar factory in Coruche and one small factory in SÃ£o Miguel, in the Azores, which scarcely managed to supply half the country's consumption needs, should be confronted with the obligation to reduce its quota for sugar produced from sugar beet.
It is clear what the consequences will be: farmers and undertakings will abandon production, thus creating more unemployment and adversely affecting the development of rural areas.
It is therefore essential - as thousands of small and medium-scale farmers asserted on the streets of Porto on 17 September whilst the Agriculture Council was meeting in Portugal - to change policy in order to take account of the specific situation in each Member State and their own production and consumption needs, securing farmers' incomes and the development of rural areas.
That is what we are once again proposing to the Commissioner.
Mr President, before I begin can I remind everyone that it is not a question of beet or grain.
In Ireland, beet was grown in a mutually beneficial rotation with wheat.
Commissioner, sugar restructuring in Ireland was a disaster.
It was handled badly by the company Greencore and our Minister for Agriculture.
Many of my constituents have suffered and social displacement is widespread, which is why the least we can do is go back and compensate these people.
Our hope of having a rational biofuels industry that was integrated, rather than competing with food production, was set back by years, if not destroyed.
When I approached the Commission to try to head off disaster, I was told that the scheme was set and that to tamper with it, even for a good reason, would unravel the whole thing.
But now we are tinkering with the scheme.
Is it not possible at this stage of adjustment to do something about the mess left behind in Ireland?
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Batzeli and Mr DeÃ, we all know that the proposed amendments to the regulation on the CMO in sugar aim to make participation in the Community sugar industry more attractive under the restructuring regime so as to achieve the target of reducing Community sugar production.
Allow me to make three observations about this.
Firstly, the Commission's approach is positive.
This is particularly the case with its proposal to give even retroactively increased support to beneficiaries who have already complied with Regulation No 318/2006, allowing them to feel that they have not been unjustly treated despite contributing first to the restructuring of the sector;
Secondly, it has been made perfectly clear, I believe, that if the desired reduced level of production is not reached, future measures for a linear reduction will apply only to those Member States which have not made an effort to attain this target.
On the other hand, the regulation will take into account the countries which have made significant reductions and whose industrial units still remaining have now reached critical levels.
It is particularly important for countries such as mine to be certain that this position will not be forgotten when we discuss the future of the CMO in sugar for the post-2010 period;
Thirdly, I should like to raise the matter of bioethanol.
Let us take this opportunity to examine seriously the possibility that perhaps in the end our enthusiasm for bioethanol will evaporate, and maybe many of the factories producing it will not be viable.
What will the future hold for the workers in this industry, and what will happen to the farmers?
Shall we once again have to cope with an army of unemployed?
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
Regrettably, the restructuring of the sugar market has not brought the results we had hoped for.
In modifying the restructuring scheme, it must be taken into account that some Member States have renounced a substantial portion of their quota.
Hungary has abandoned 27% of its quota, whilst the average for the European Union as a whole is just 10.5%.
When determining the final quota reductions, therefore, I am in favour of taking into account the scale of production in each Member State.
It would be inappropriate if the same reduction was prescribed for all Member States of the European Union at the same time since production characteristics differ in each country.
Moreover, modification of the restructuring scheme should not impact negatively on Member States that have already implemented a higher-than-average quota reduction.
For this reason I oppose taking beet and isoglucose quotas together when calculating the ratio of the quota renounced to the initial quota.
Meanwhile, the maximum amount of restructuring aid should also be granted in instances where facilities are not dismantled but converted to alternative uses such as biomass or bioethanol production.
Thank you for your attention.
(PL) Mr President, the fact that, as part of the reform of the sugar market, sugar supply has fallen by 0.2 million tonnes in the last two years, an amount that differs considerably from the proposed level, should come as no surprise to anyone.
This outcome was foreseen by Polish MEPs, as witnessed by our speeches both before the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in the plenary of the European Parliament.
The failure to achieve the intended aims indicates that adequate motivation and incentives, including opportunities for beet growers to take up other production, were not put in place.
This was acknowledged by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when they proposed, among other things, raising the amount of aid set aside for growers and entities providing services from 10% to 50% of the aid allocated to a sugar factory business, and raising the extra payment for growers for the marketing year 2008-2009 from EUR 237.50 to EUR 260 per tonne of the quota which was being renounced.
It also needs pointing out that the Commission is currently not implementing the principles of the reform, the aim of which is to maintain production in the most competitive regions.
The proposed changes do nothing to counter the problems, let alone resolve them; they are making the situation worse.
(ES) Madam President, thank you very much to the Commissioner for being here.
I think that the Commissioner, the rapporteur and many of the speakers have highlighted the problems that there have been with implementing the 2005 sugar reform, and the fact that abandonment of production has suffered delays leaving it far short of the objective of 6 million tonnes provided for in the reform.
I therefore believe that we all welcome the proposal that the Commission is now putting forward, which will give a new impetus to abandonment.
The sector, too, mainly the beet production sector, is very pleased that the restructuring process is being speeded up given that, as the Commissioner also said, otherwise there will be an across-the-board cut in quotas in 2010, with no aid funds to compensate for those cuts.
I think that the amendment I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in line with this philosophy and this new proposal.
I am referring to Amendment 31, which calls for a report evaluating the reform and, if necessary, proposals to extend this aid fund by one year during the 2010-2011 marketing year.
It was initially planned for a period of four years, to compensate, as I said, for this initial delay in implementing the reform.
This is something that has been called for by producers, and I think that it should be supported, especially given that the fund is financed solely by the sector, and therefore has no financial impact on the Community budget.
I ask, Commissioner, for this amendment to be approved by the Commission, and of course also my fellow Members.
Finally, I would just like to thank Mrs Batzelli for her work, her reports, and the improvements she has proposed, with the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture, and for the proposal presented by the Commission.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that far-reaching reforms are needed in the sugar industry in the European Union to enable it to remain successful in the future.
Reducing production is an essential component of these reforms.
However, this reduction should focus primarily on companies that are uncompetitive; unfortunately, the reality is often different.
For example, in my home country, the Czech Republic, the sugar factories that were new, effective and prosperous were closed and quotas were renounced on behalf of supranational producers.
Of course this had a very negative impact on domestic growers and consumers.
I would therefore like to appeal to the Commission to take competitiveness principles into account, to a greater extent than before, when implementing the necessary reforms in the sugar industry, and to pay much more attention to the development of the biofuels sector.
I think that biofuels offer new opportunities to sugar beet growers and represent the future.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the reform of the sugar market which was begun in 2005 is not achieving the anticipated results, despite huge financial outlay.
Despite large financial incentives, amounting to EUR 730 per tonne of reduction in sugar production, in the Community as a whole sugar production has fallen by barely 1.1 million tonnes, instead of the anticipated 6 million.
The next set of changes to the functioning of the sugar market proposed by the Commission are not only failing to improve the situation, they are actually making it worse, as they are not consistent with the main principle of the reform, in other words sustaining sugar production in the most competitive regions.
What I think is needed is, firstly, to create conditions for stable development for the most competitive sugar producers in the Community, to enable EU production to compete on an increasingly open world market.
Secondly, we need to draw maximum advantage from sugar's export potential within the framework of the limit agreed with the World Trade Organisation.
And finally, thirdly, if these solutions fail to produce a marked improvement in the sugar market, it will be necessary to reduce production, but using a linear factor that is the same for all Member States.
(CS) Madam President, I represent a country that invented the sugar cube.
High-quality sugar was something we used to be proud of but the European Union ruthlessly took this pride away from us.
If Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 is implemented, the Czech Republic will be penalised for its appropriate behaviour towards foreign investors from the original EU countries that it has allowed to take over the sugar industry in the country.
This Regulation is an inappropriate attempt to satisfy the interests of the big European sugar refining companies, while the interests of the countries that are the traditional growers and producers are being ignored.
It is therefore necessary, as the amendment by Mr Fajmon and others suggests, to enable Member States to scrap provisions a) and b) and leave it to the individual Member States to determine how to deal with the critical situation that would arise if the quota fell by 20% or more.
Otherwise, the Czech Republic might, absurdly, become an importer of the traditional product it has been making for centuries.
One day, when our grandchildren are making a list of reasons why the Czech Republic should leave the European Union, the sugar policy and the regulations we are now debating will be at the top of the list.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I understand very well that sugar quotas need to be cut further and I am in favour of it.
I also understand, in the light of the figures we have, that the previous reform did not succeed.
This issue, however, is how this future reform is to be implemented.
It should be fair to all Member States, and if we consider it from the viewpoint of my country, Finland, for example, there were two sugar factories in the country, and the previous cut in quotas, a reduction in practice of 40%, led to one of them shutting down.
If there were to be another cut of 13% under this reform, that would mean in the worst case scenario that all sugar production would end in Finland, because both factories would have had to close.
This is obviously an unfair situation for Finnish sugar growers and Finnish industry.
That is why I support the amendment which my colleague, Mr Fajmon, has tabled and which states that this proposal should not apply in any way to Member States whose quotas have already been cut by more than 20% unless they themselves then decide otherwise.
I would hope that the Commissioner also understands the situation small countries are in.
In Finland, while we are now discussing the subject of cuts in aid to the south of the country under Article 141 of the Accession Treaty, the rural population's belief in the European Union is very weak.
There needs to be some glimmer of hope, and above all these reforms have to be carried out fairly, so that all Member States get treated the same way.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank all of you for all your valuable comments.
I think that we see the complexity of this issue from the comments delivered here today.
I would just like to make a few comments.
First of all, I am convinced that what is now proposed - which I would describe as a big carrot for the sector - will work.
The carrot is quite attractive because we now give farmers the possibility of getting 10% of the restructuring fund, and the restructuring fund for the year 2008/09 is EUR 625.
EUR 62.5 plus the top-up that we pay from the restructuring money - EUR 237.5 - comes to EUR 300 per tonne that the farmers send back to the Commission.
What I consider the most important thing is that, for the first time, farmers can trigger the restructuring fund.
This has not been possible before.
Previously it was only the industry.
Now farmers can say 'I want to leave and I want my EUR 300 per tonne, and I get the compensation for the reduction in prices on top of that'.
And that is not a one-off payment: that continues.
I completely agree with Mr Parish.
I think that the alternative to sugar beet production is much more attractive now than it has been for decades, with the cereal prices, with the oil-seed prices.
Therefore, I presume that farmers will make their calculations and look at the bottom line of the most attractive way of arranging their future production.
I mentioned retroactivity the first time that I spoke.
Retroactivity is there so that those who have delivered from the very beginning will not be punished; they will be compensated.
It is for beet growers, for inulin syrup producers and for chicory growers.
So there is no difference between the various types of beet production.
So I am confident, and I am very thankful for the quick reaction from Parliament, which I hope will allow us to find a political agreement in the Council tomorrow so we can send a clear signal to the sector, to the beet growers, so they can start planning their next production season.
I am quite sure that this will be to the benefit of the whole sector because, as was also mentioned here today, the alternative to not using this possibility will be a linear cut with no compensation.
So I am quite sure that lots of calculations will take place on the various farms and areas where this may be attractive, to deliver the tonnes that we need to find the right balance in our sugar sector.
Once again, thank you very much - especially to the rapporteur, Ms Batzeli - for all the work done on this difficult dossier.
The debate is closed.
The voting will take place today.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (HU) Madam President, in its current review of the sugar reforms, the European Commission is requiring European farmers and the European sugar industry to make yet further unreasonable sacrifices in the name of restoring a balance in the sugar market.
In my opinion on the European Parliament's report drafted on behalf of the Committee on International Trade some time ago, I pointed out that it would not be possible to achieve the desired balance in the European sugar market as long as there is no legislation providing for effective import protection.
In its report, the European Parliament also put forward proposals to the European Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers to limit imports of sugar from third countries.
In the end the legislature did not incorporate these proposals into the final document.
I agree with the tabled amendment to the present proposal suggesting that Member States that have already renounced at least 20% of their quota should not have to implement further quota reductions.
This would be equitable and just towards countries that have already made a serious effort to implement the sugar reforms.
At the same time, however, I think it is important that a review of the sugar reforms should also include measures to make the sugar industry more competitive.
With this in mind, I have tabled an amendment giving Member States discretion to decide first to make it possible for smaller, less competitive sugar beet growers to renounce the right to transport beet.
This is a significant advantage for smaller, less well-informed growers, but at the same time it will help the European sugar industry to become more competitive internationally too.
in writing. - It is regrettable that the Commission has returned within such a short period of time with a second sugar restructuring package for Parliament to vote on.
The initial package resulted in the demise of the Irish sugar industry, to the detriment of the country, farmers and growers.
Unfortunately, to date the compensation package has not filtered fully down to either farmers or contractors.
I disagree with the Commission's attempt to limit the compensation paid to growers and contractors to just 10% in the current package - allocating the remaining 90% to processors seems excessive.
In the initial restructuring scheme a minimum of 10% was allocated to growers and contractors, with Member States being given the flexibility to decide on the precise share out but with this package the Commission is very fixed in how compensation should be allocated.
It is clear that increased levels of restructuring aid are needed to reach the Commissions targets.
I welcome that increased level of restructuring aid will be paid to those who have already quit beet production.
I would urge that the compensation payments due to Irish farmers and contractors be paid out as a matter of urgency - this saga has gone on for too long.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the rules of the common agricultural policy have been being flagrantly violated in many markets in the industry for some time now.
The sugar market is just one more disreputable example of this.
The reform of this market adopted barely two years ago contained unfair solutions for the new Member States, as it gave preference to a few old Member States which generate surpluses in the so-called B quotas that are costly to the taxpayer.
One of the aims of the reform was to improve competitiveness in the sector.
Those who were supposed to remain in the market were those who were most competitive.
The revision that is currently being proposed is aimed at punishing those who are most competitive.
After all, that is what the introduction of new factors and the increased compensation with retroactive effect will achieve.
Is there any logic to be discerned in what is going on here?
When the interests of the old EU are challenged, principles go out of the window.
Solidarity or an equal chance to compete no longer means a thing.
This is true of the entire agricultural sector in which the richer countries get the larger subsidies.
All attempts to do away with discrimination against the poorer new Member States run up against the disarming sincerity of representatives of the older States - you are right, they say, but we are not going to open up 'Pandora's box'.
But now, looking at the sugar sector, the arrangement that was signed up to not very long ago can be changed!
Just because it is affecting the interests of the older Member States and the big concerns.
Dangerous toys manufactured in China (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on dangerous toys manufactured in China.
Two Commissioners will speak.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
Toys are not like any other product.
They are designed for the most vulnerable consumer group of all and it is therefore perfectly clear that we must have the highest standards for toys where children's safety is concerned.
A whole range of very grave issues have rightly been raised here in connection with the latest recall campaigns of an American manufacturer, which has recalled faulty products from the market at its own initiative.
First of all I would like to say that both cases concerned here involve products not licensed under European law for the European market.
Toys with lead paint have, of course, been banned in Europe for a long time, unlike in the United States of America.
Toys with magnetic parts or other dangerous parts which could become loose have also been banned, of course, for a long time in Europe.
What we have here, therefore, is not a problem of applicable law (although I will be coming to applicable law, an area in which something has to be changed, later), but it is a problem of the implementation and observance of the applicable law.
Products we deal with every day cannot be one hundred per cent safe.
The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that no defects will occur in production.
The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that supply chains now organised on a global basis will not encounter a problem at any point.
Nor can the best legislator in the world prevent trade with criminal or fraudulent intent.
I would remind you of the case in which three people died in Greece after using a faulty steam iron.
This iron not only had the European CE marking, but also a specific German safety symbol.
Nevertheless the appliance was not safe, probably because it was counterfeit.
No legislator in the world can do anything to stop this.
That is the responsibility of the manufacturer and it is the responsibility of those who have to ensure that manufacturers comply with the existing rules.
These are the market surveillance authorities of the Member States.
There is no European market surveillance system.
This comes under the sole responsibility of the Member States.
I would like to point out to you that we are in fact having to deal with a problem here that is very closely connected with economic globalisation.
Today this means we have to deal with worldwide supply chains.
We have to deal with companies operating under pressure of costs, meaning that they are constantly putting their suppliers under pressure of costs, thereby contributing to prices constantly being reduced.
There is a very great risk that this will come at the expense of safety at some point.
This is the reason why we are constantly saying that the more international and more extensive the supply chain becomes, the greater the responsibility of companies to ensure that the existing regulations are observed at each individual stage of the supply chain.
This was not the case, for example, in the case of lead paint on toys produced by the American manufacturer.
A Chinese supplier supplied a paint here which it should not have supplied.
These is the truth of the case.
Corporate responsibility is foremost.
Companies are responsible for their product complying with the current European rules.
Then comes the responsibility of the Member States.
They have to ensure that market surveillance works.
And then it is up to us as European legislators.
We have to ensure that our legislation is kept up-to-date and possible risks are identified in good time and incorporated into the legislation.
This is why the Commission began a thorough review of the existing Toy Safety Directive more than two years ago.
The Toy Safety Directive is one of the oldest directives resulting from the 'new approach'.
It is clear that the toy market has changed dramatically in the last 20 years and this new directive will therefore pick up on a whole range of recently recognised risks and hazards and will ensure, with very strict rules - on the use of chemical substances in toys, for instance - that dangers are avoided.
The directive will be brought before the legislator by the end of this year.
At the beginning of this year, we had already put before you an entire package of measures for strengthening market surveillance for improving protection of the CE marking.
Let me say something about the CE marking at this point.
The CE marking means that the manufacturer (whether a European manufacturer or a manufacturer outside Europe wanting to sell in Europe) provides an absolute guarantee that its product is fully compliant with the rules in force in Europe.
The manufacturer guarantees this with the CE marking.
That is what the CE marking means.
In a whole range of cases, the manufacturer is not allowed to use the CE symbol on the basis of a self-declaration and his own proof, but must be certified by a third body, namely whenever there may be a risk to users due to the product not working properly.
Certification by a third body is now mandatory in all such cases.
The way these bodies, which we call Conformity Assessment Bodies, operate can be significantly improved.
We have put forward the appropriate proposals and they are available to you as the European legislator.
In relation to toys, a decision now has to be made about a very difficult issue for the Commission and for you as legislator: do we want to move to having each individual toy coming onto the market certified by a third body or do we want to leave it that the manufacturers provide the guarantee by using the CE marking and therefore also assume liability - to which I must also add that the manufacturers have to be able to prove at any time and with full documentation, according to the rules in force today, that they have been using the CE marking lawfully?
Or do we perhaps want to take a third way by defining certain types of toy in the new Toy Safety Directive, where we stipulate certification by a third body?
I do not want to hide the fact that I have great sympathy for this latter solution.
I would like to give you an example: what do we do with all the toys containing chips?
When children put them in their mouths, chips are a dangerous item.
There must therefore be a guarantee that these toy parts can under no circumstances pose a threat to children.
If we do not want to take Game Boys away from children - I do not believe that anyone intends to do this - the only possibility would then be to make certification by a third body mandatory at this point.
The Commission's ideas are along these lines and I also expect to get some impression from this debate of Parliament's thinking on this issue.
The final point I would like to mention is a request to manufacturers and consumer organisations.
Manufacturers need to be aware of the fact that the pressure of costs, as great as it still is, does not absolve them of the responsibility for a full inspection of every individual part of their production process and their supply chain.
The more international production and supply chains become, the greater the responsibility of companies active on the market.
Furthermore, consumer organisations would accomplish a great feat if they were to create an awareness that cheap is not always the same as good.
This is not just a question of safety, but also one of quality, because how often have you seen - even with toys the child opens under the Christmas tree - how a child plays with it just once before it is broken.
It might have been cheap, but it was not good!
Cheap does not always mean good, nor does cheap always mean safe.
This means the consumer needs to be aware that the price of a product has a direct bearing on the quality and safety of a product.
In relation to the low-price ideology, which is spreading in at least some Member States, this is a subject that gives me increasing cause for concern.
I can say in conclusion that European law today is in any case better than what we see in other parts of the world, that it can be improved and is being improved and that wherever toys are involved, the strictest standards of all are being applied and must be applied.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, there is a Japanese saying (and I emphasise 'Japanese' rather than 'Chinese' in the context of this question): 'A problem is a mountain of treasures'.
I think Mattel's problem has really focused attention on the important work that we do in this House, particularly my fellow members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on what is traditionally seen as rather a dry subject, one that concerns product regulation, market surveillance and conformity assessment.
Well, the public know why it is important now and I hope they will continue to focus on it.
I want to thank the two Commissioners for coming here today, but perhaps remind them first of all that an oral question was tabled, which they have, I think, anticipated and have covered most of our questions, but I also think we are a bit ahead of them.
You will see the resolution tomorrow that we will vote on, which takes a broad view about product, and particularly toy, safety in the global context.
There are a number of points addressed to both Commissioners.
I am pleased that Commissioner Verheugen has confirmed to us that the Toys Directive will be here towards the end of the year, something that we have been asking for.
I am pleased he has lifted the lid a bit on some of the thinking, but we invite him to perhaps share a bit more of that with us.
We have not been entirely clear which direction he is going in.
He is talking, perhaps, about some differentiated standards for particular areas.
I would merely caution him about that.
I am not entirely convinced, for example, that a toy containing a microchip is any more dangerous than a bicycle, but I let him ponder on that.
Let me just emphasise some of the points that we want to look at.
First of all, the big disappointment this morning is that there is no one from the Council here.
And they have a crucial role to play, as we know, in product conformity and assessment.
Secondly, I agree with the assessment of both Commissioners that the manufacturers and producers have to bear the brunt of the responsibility for managing a supply chain where they do quality checks and they ensure that they are producing consistently high standards of product.
Finally, I think consumers are entitled to more and better information.
I cannot understand why we are so reluctant to tell consumers where products are made.
The Council is sitting on a proposal in selected areas at the moment.
I think that the toy industry must really look seriously at a proper toy safety mark that it develops and manages itself so that consumers really have that assurance that, when they come to buy toys this Christmas, they will have safe, good quality toys.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I think that we in the European Union have to all intents and purposes achieved very high safety standards for products.
I agree with Mr Verheugen when he says that we can never achieve 100% safety, but our aim in Europe must be to have the highest possible level of safety and we have not yet achieved that target.
We still have a great deal to do to make this target a reality.
These recall campaigns (it is not just Mattel, there have also been others in recent months) have shown that there is a very great need for action in the European Union to guarantee that product safety is at the highest possible level.
Three months before Christmas we are, of course, keeping a close eye on toys that need to be especially safe.
Our children are our future; therefore we have to pay particular attention to their safety.
Hence we are already very annoyed that it is taking the European Commission so long to revise the Toys Directive.
I hope that it is true that this directive will have been revised by the end of this year, or even before the end of this year, so that we can actually bring it completely up to date.
I am also very anxious about which proposals will be forthcoming because this has always been very unclear to date.
There is one further point that is quite important, namely the implementation of this law.
The Commissioners have also been addressing it and that, too, is a problem.
On Monday I had the opportunity to go to a certification institute and to have a look and inquire as to what the problems are.
One very clear problem that was highlighted is that the CE marking does not contain what it actually promises.
We need to work on this and hence we are demanding that there should also be additional safety labelling, particularly for toys, so that safety can also be guaranteed.
It is not enough for inspections to be carried out when the products are already in the shops; they must be made beforehand.
We need these inspections beforehand and they must also be compulsory wherever necessary and this is very particularly the case with toys.
A third and final point: the RAPEX system needs to be improved.
When we look at the figures, we see that activity in this area varies considerably from one Member State to the next.
I think that we have to appeal to the Member States here to improve and promote this system so that we are able actually to carry out the necessary product recalls as well as ban products.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I am pleased that there are in fact two commissioners here.
This is evidence of a dynamic approach to the recent problem concerning Mattel.
This problem is of course twofold, which is now also evidenced by the fact that it is less serious when it relates to China, and by the fact that Mattel too has made an error.
As I said, this problem is twofold.
I believe, first of all - and here I would like to reiterate Clinton's words - that politicians must think first and act later.
These were the words of President Clinton during an election meeting last year, during which he also said that we must not immediately become stressed when a button is pushed, as in the case of toys.
I too am guilty of this on occasion.
When something happens, we politicians become stressed and immediately want more stringent measures and stricter regulations.
I believe that we must think first, before we take action.
Fortunately, this is what we did with our resolution.
This brings me to the second item, that is to say why the Mattel problem also has a positive consequence; in particular, we are going to expressly consider the importance of a CE marking, a quality mark that indicates safety, and the way in which we can improve that mark.
I fully agree with what Commissioner Verheugen says about the fact that 100% safety and security can never be achieved; however - following on now from Mrs Gebhardt - we must nevertheless strive to achieve 100% safety.
If a product bears the CE marking, this raises the issue of 100% liability, which is of course of great importance to the consumer.
If the CE marking is present, then the consumer knows that if something should go wrong with the product he or she has purchased, he or she will always have recourse to the manufacturer or importer.
The resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, Madam President, relates to this matter in particular.
I feel that we have prepared an excellent resolution; the supervision - and here I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Kuneva, who says that we do not need more legislation, but rather that we must regulate existing legislation more effectively and efficiently - is open to improvement.
We cannot leave it to the individual Member States to exercise control in third countries.
I believe that a coordinated European approach in cooperation with the Member States is essential in order to achieve this and I hope that the Commission will make efforts to establish this.
Subsequently, Madam President, it must also be clear to consumers which marks exist.
We have the CE marking and, in the resolution, we are also calling for a toy safety marking, at the very least as a replacement for all existing national markings.
The aim is not to establish a selection of markings, as a result of which the consumer would no longer be able to see the forest for the trees and would therefore no longer be able to make a clear choice, as I feel that by doing so, we would be overshooting the goal.
Things must become clearer, with fewer, but improved regulations.
I believe that this is of the utmost importance.
Subsequently, I hope that we can introduce these markings on a voluntary basis, as the market will enforce it.
If we are going to create obligations, we as an authority must carry out monitoring and I think that the market, the consumer, will opt above all for safety and a clear marking.
If this were to happen, my group and I would be entirely satisfied with the decision.
We look forward to the revision of the Toys Directive, which you have already mentioned.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, inspections and a forest of new symbols - this completely misses the heart of the problem!
Inspections are good, laws are even better!
We do not need more pseudo-safety, or more pseudo-political action for the sake of action, but better laws and better standards.
CMR substances, carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substances have still not been removed from children's toys.
Toys should not become toxic traps for children.
Poison does not belong in children's hands, even in minute quantities.
Mr Verheugen, I find it intolerable how you absolve your own failure by scolding producers and consumers.
We know that the legal basis, the Toys Directive, has not offered children any protection from toxic toys for years.
The Commission knows this.
You can glean from your own report of 2004 that you get a resounding slap in the face there.
It states in black and white that the Toys Directive has failed.
We have been sending reminders on the revision of the directive since 2001 and they have repeatedly been shelved.
It is not true to say that lead is banned in toys.
Lead per se is simply not banned under the Toys Directive!
Or can the Commission explain to us perhaps why it has not initiated any legal product recall campaign, and why it was a voluntary product recall campaign by the toy manufacturers?
We should no longer therefore be leading the consumer to believe that we have got the problem under control.
We need better protection.
This must quite clearly mean that we have to change the foundation and replace absent standards with clear laws and bans.
It is downright absurd that carcinogenic substances are allowed to get into the hands of children.
Better controls are therefore of no help to us at all here.
Right now, then, we have to tighten up the laws and then carry out better controls.
We should not have our children poisoned while they play!
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, in the debate on the recall of the toys in question it has often been said that responsibility for the fact that dangerous toys are on the market rests with the country of manufacture, in this case China.
I regret that the discussion has not focused more on the responsibility borne by the firms which outsource production to countries such as China, in this case Mattel.
I do not want to single out this particular company for criticism since a great many firms outsource production.
They do so because they want to keep prices as low as possible.
They want to increase profits.
But we must devote much more discussion to the responsibility incumbent on such companies.
They endeavour to keep costs as low as possible while at the same time taking no responsibility either for consumer safety or for the employees who work with these dangerous products.
We must put pressure on companies to make them understand that as consumers we demand safe products that we can trust.
We also demand that products be manufactured in decent working conditions without risks to the health and safety of employees.
It is of course especially tragic when it is children who are hurt by dangerous products.
Clearly we must join together to ensure that this is stopped.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the European Union and China are major mutual trading partners.
This means that China may be called to account for the quality of products supplied.
The European Union cannot resign itself to unsafe clothing or unsafe toys.
The Union should never allow its economic interests in China to take precedence over the interests of the European consumer.
This debate once again shows that the European consumer is served not only with low prices, but much more so with quality and safety, as Commissioner Verheugen also indicated.
This is all the more so, when the safety of children is at issue.
In this debate, I want to look not only at the importers, but most certainly also at the Chinese manufacturers.
Safety does not become an issue only if products reach Europe.
Consideration for safety must form a guiding principle at as early a stage as possible within the production chain.
After all, safety is not a luxury or a nice extra, not here and not in China either.
I call upon the Council and the Commission to convey this message to our Chinese trading partners in a clear and vigorous manner, and Commissioner Kuneva's words in particular give me full confidence that this will in fact be done; I wish her much perseverance in this difficult task.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, China knew and still knows about the dangers of many of its products, not just toys.
China has on many occasions assured us that the vast majority of its exports conform to European standards, but consumers have little faith in Chinese products.
The 2006 Commission report on dangerous products highlights an increase in dangerous infringements, by toys, hairdryers and lighters.
Toys are, in fact, the products with the highest number of irregularities, and China is the country of origin with the most infringements.
Commissioner Kuneva has warned that if China does not respond to the EU's demands, the next step will be to ban the import of some Chinese products.
I believe that we ought to strengthen customs barriers because the EU should protect not only consumers, not only its industry, it should not only support free competition by means of equal market access opportunities, but it should also take action on social and environmental grounds as regards the highly speculative output of Chinese industry.
We need controls not only on the final quality of the product, but also a clear mark of origin and checks, before the distribution of Chinese products is permitted within the internal market, on the safety standards and conditions under which the products are made in their places of origin; otherwise, the institutions will remain complicit in environmental disasters, social exploitation and unfair competition by Chinese industry.
Madam President, it is indisputably right that Mattel should have recalled these dangerous toys.
But a number of pertinent issues arise.
Firstly, for all our consumer protection laws, it was not the EU or any EU agency which picked up on the danger, but rather the parent US manufacturer.
Does that not tell us something important about the efficiency and the reliability of our own protections?
Secondly, we impose on our own indigenous industry, in all spheres, severe standards and demands, ranging from health and safety through to CO2 emission.
Yet we throw open our doors to Chinese goods which are the product of woeful production conditions, fall far short of what we require of our own factories and come from plants which belch out emissions as if there was no tomorrow.
Little wonder we have driven so much manufacturing to the Far East!
But, what I ask is, with what net global gain?
In fairness to both the workers and the consumers of Europe, it is time we brought some sense and order to our approach.
If we had not decimated our own manufacturing industry by punitive regulation, then maybe now we would not be so dependent on China and its shoddy goods.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, the recent recall campaign by a toy manufacturer acted as an alarm bell, and rightly so.
It is now up to us to deal with this problem in a rational and well-considered manner.
If, after many years of effort to achieve a high degree of consumer protection, also with regard to product safety, we are still sometimes confronted with situations in which non-compliant goods are produced, imported and introduced onto the market, that is of course not an ideal situation.
Perhaps, however, it is not entirely possible to prevent this from happening.
Yet despite this, European citizens and European consumers can expect us to continue to deliver maximum effort in order to put a check on this.
In the case constituting the immediate cause for this debate, the products in question are toys from China.
In spite of this, I would like to make an appeal to the effect that we do not restrict ourselves to this - not to the fact that they come from China, because unsafe goods enter the market from other countries too.
In some instances, they are also manufactured by us.
It is better to come to effective agreements than to initiate protectionist campaigns.
Nor must we focus solely upon toys, even though one in four products in which a defect is identified is in fact a toy.
We must ensure that product safety is guaranteed on a general level.
We do not need to devise a new approach as such; rather, we must close the gaps in the existing system.
We are working to achieve this with the proposals from the Internal Market Package for Goods.
I would like to make it clear to everyone that these proposals were drawn up with the aim of enabling the internal market to operate more effectively.
We always incorporate a high degree of protection for the consumer as an objective in these proposals and it now appears that this is actually the case.
The internal market and consumer protection are therefore not conflicting issues, but rather are entirely congruous and this is a path that we must continue to follow.
I have just one question for the Commission, Madam President: in our joint resolution, we are calling for an assessment to be carried out in order to examine whether a voluntary safety marking is available in addition to the CE marking.
I would like to ask the Commissioners what their response to this is.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have been enjoying myself inserting 'toys' and 'China' into Google.
I would recommend you all do this, too.
You will then get entire lists of suppliers, the Chinese supply industry and producers and see all that you can buy there.
80% of the toys from China end up on the Commission's website and vice-versa.
The European market imports 80% of its toys from China.
If you look at these two figures together, you can imagine the scope of what we are dealing with here.
Of course, you have to see that on the one hand we are now in a context internationally where the world economy is becoming interlinked and European industry and jobs are naturally dependent on supplies from China.
On the other hand, it must also be said that world-wide networking of this kind in industry only works when there is trust.
This trust is based on certain aspects that also have to be maintained.
Trust grows when there is fair competition.
Fair competition is achieved when there is assurance from the Chinese, and also from the producers and the supply industry, that they are actually able, and have the know-how, to carry out all the necessary checks for exporting their products to Europe according to the criteria of the European market.
However, trust grows, of course, and fair competition can be generated only when the producers, and specifically the Chinese government in this case, guarantee that the environmental, social and worker standards that we have will also be gradually introduced to the same extent by the Chinese, as otherwise we shall have conditions of unfair competition.
Unfair competition always has an impact on this country's ability to make checks.
We can see this because all the data show that most of the problems we have with dangerous toys from China do not necessarily come from producers of the major brands, but from those who are involved in unsafe supply chains.
This monitoring operation therefore needs to be considerably developed by the Chinese.
Honourable Commissioners, we too must put our house in order, of course, and I believe much still lies in disarray in Europe.
I would not like to repeat what my fellow Members have already addressed, but instead list a few points concerning the Committee on International Trade and particularly the responsibility of European importers to introduce border checks and the need to initiate legal product recall campaigns and the issue of when to resort to import bans and import restrictions as a whole and under what conditions.
We will soon be having difficulty - at least in certain sectors, such as the textile sector - as the safeguards we currently have are expiring.
We shall then have additional problems at least in that sector.
(FR) Madam President, what should we learn from the Mattel affair?
I must make an initial observation, a digression certainly, but it is important, as has already been said.
If this trade saga has a happy ending, it is partly due to the sense of responsibility of the directors of this company, who took the necessary decisions: a mass recall and effective communication.
Secondly, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Kuneva, who has lived up to our expectations by calling for effective use of the RAPEX system, which of course could still be refined further, and by sending a firm message to the Chinese authorities.
Thirdly, I would like to express my frustration.
In reality, the Mattel affair is almost the story of a predictable failure: that of surveillance in the European Union of CE marked products, in this case toys, but they are not the only products affected.
In 2004, during the debate on the directive on the eco-design of products, I and others here this morning - I see Karin Scheele, Peter Liese, Claude Turmes - criticised the presence on the European market of other dangerous products carrying the CE label.
Our joint resolution certainly contains interesting possibilities: the revision of the existing directives, enhanced cooperation - with China in this case - more resources allocated to customs authorities and national surveillance authorities.
The two Commissioners here today stressed this essential point.
I wish someone from the Council had been here this morning: we needed them to be here.
To conclude, if Europe wishes to protect the health and safety of consumers, it must track down and convict fraudsters, as it has done, but also ban the marketing of consumer products containing dangerous substances such as CMR substances and endocrine disruptors.
(DE) Mr President, I welcome the importance the Commission is attaching to this subject today.
The fact that two Commissioners have taken the floor clearly shows that finally even the Commission understands that we have to act here.
However, doubts remain as to the statements when reference is made in the first instance to the responsibility of the Member States and manufacturers.
Certainly the Member States bear a good proportion of responsibility and market surveillance has been scaled back in recent years in many Member States.
This is the wrong response to the challenges of globalisation.
Nevertheless, this alone is not enough.
Revision of the Toy Safety Directive is urgently needed.
When we recognise that this recall campaign is now the fourth since November 2006, it raises questions, for instance: who is actually following up these recall campaigns?
What are the sanctions in the Member States and the law on importer and producer liability achieving?
We urgently need a revision of the Toy Safety Directive, which also does real justice to the new challenges.
This directive is not a response to these new challenges.
We have to address subjects such as the law on collective action.
Mr Verheugen, you have rightly addressed the fact that we have to make clear to consumers that quality is also important and that prices and quality have to reflect this.
But then I also ask myself, of course, why consumers no longer have opportunities within their grasp, under a European law on collective action for example, for insisting that something should also be changed here in relation to costs?
I would like to delve further into the subject of CE marking.
We have discussed this at length and across the board and are familiar with the failings and limitations of this CE marking.
I think it is wrong when it is suggested to consumers that CE marking is a clear signal that the product is safe.
CE marking is primarily a statement that this label complies with European directives.
It may relate to certain parts of a product, it may relate to a whole product, but it does not reveal anything as a whole about the safety of the product.
We have a flaw here, which needs to be removed from the new Toy Safety Directive as a matter of urgency.
(EL) Mr President, 65% of toys imported into the European Union are made in China.
In August one particular US toy company recalled approximately 18 million China-made toys from around the world.
The problem is the high levels of lead in the paints used in these toys.
This raises the serious question of what sort of future we want for our children.
In their desperate efforts to cut back production costs, multinationals are ignoring the cost being imposed on public health.
Mrs Kuneva, the Commissioner, has stated that she intends to revise the legislation on toys.
I congratulate her on such an initiative but, at the same time, regret the fact that the Commission is being called on yet again to close the door after the horse has bolted instead of preventing such unfortunate incidents.
(DE) Mr President, when we hear about toxic substances in babies' bibs, children's clothing and toys, or even of self-igniting batteries, it is clear that our system of controls is not working properly.
Nearly all European manufacturers have at least part of their products produced in China or other low-cost countries where cheaper products are used in order to make more profit, despite higher raw material prices and salaries.
It is, of course, the importers' responsibility to ensure compliance with the legal requirements and this depends therefore on their standards and controls.
We have a dangerous problem of mentality when responsibility is shifted onto producers with a few words, and manufacturers would rather pay fines than initiate recall campaigns.
This is where, in my view, the EU should start, perhaps by increasing fines so that they become more punishing, if information is not being passed on immediately and products recalled.
In addition, CE marking must in my view become more than pure self-regulation by the industry.
Mr President, we live and work in a global market economy, and we cannot expect to put in place legislation which interferes with that.
Commissioner Kuneva, I have nothing to say to what you have said.
I agree totally with everything you have said - my congratulations; just make sure that it is implemented.
As far as Commissioner Verheugen is concerned, I am sorry to say that the buck does stop somewhere, and it is all very well for the Commission to continue to pass the responsibility on to Member States, or whatever, but in actual fact you have to implement the legislation that is put in place by this Parliament.
I believe, therefore, that it is the responsibility of your department to ensure that the products that come into the European Union are at least as safe as the products that we produce within the European Union.
I say to Ms Breyer, a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who quite rightly talks about legislation: there is little point in putting in place legislation in the European Union if all we do is import products which do not meet the same standards that we are putting forward within the European Union.
We have put in place, for example, legislation on barometers.
How many children eat barometers?
And yet we stopped barometer production.
About 10 minutes ago, we stopped the production of sugar in the European Union, and say we have to support Tate & Lyle, which imports it.
We have things like foot-and-mouth and blue tongue coming into the European Union because we live in a global market, and yet we are not enforcing the legislation at the port of import sufficiently to ensure the safety of the products.
We do live in a global market, and the last thing I want is to see legislation that is trade defensive.
We have to accept the fact that products are going to come in from the rest of the world, but they must be of the same standard.
I want to ensure the safety of my constituents - the children, the grandchildren of the people that have elected me - when they go to buy their Christmas toys to ensure and guarantee that they are not going to die from some lead paint.
I leave you with one last thought.
As a farmer, I have seen the effects of lead paint that cattle have licked off, that has been there for years, and it just kills them in a very slow and nasty way.
Ensure and guarantee, Commissioner, that my children, my grandchildren and those of my constituents are safe.
(SV) Mr President, as a parent of young children myself, I find this matter highly relevant.
To be honest, I do not always think about what chemicals a toy contains or what standard of safety it conforms to when I buy toys for my children.
For me, it goes without saying that the toys I buy in Sweden, Brussels or Strasbourg are safe.
Perhaps you think I am naive, but I am not alone.
When I raided my daughter's toy box three weeks ago and pulled out one thing and another, I asked some neighbours along my street what they thought about this when they bought toys.
They all said that, as long as the items were sold in toy shops and had a CE label, they felt quite confident.
So our consumers are lulled into a false sense of security.
It is now our responsibility to ensure that that sense of security does not continue to be false.
I therefore appeal to the Commission to review the Toy Safety Directive as soon as possible.
What can have higher priority than our children?
Amongst other things, we must ensure that toys do not contain carcinogens.
We must introduce a ban on all carcinogenic and other toxic substances.
Many such substances accumulate in the body.
Children who are exposed to them will have them in their bodies for the rest of their lives.
This responsibility cannot be left to parents.
We do not have the expertise.
Who would buy a toy knowing that it contained carcinogens?
We must modify and strengthen the CE labelling system.
Consumers today believe that the CE mark means that a product is safe, but if that is to be the case we must have a well developed system of market surveillance and a uniform testing system.
We must also ensure that retailers and suppliers of unsafe products are made to bear full liability.
I also welcome a review of the RAPEX system.
Having talked to Swedish consumer advisers, I understand that this is a very important tool and that it is used on a routine basis.
However, it is not complete until all EU countries make use of and contribute to the system to the full extent.
Finally I want to stress once again that our consumers must be given priority, for without safe and secure consumers we shall not have a flourishing internal market.
(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by creating an internal market, the EU, primarily and most efficiently, is implementing the free movement of goods.
The EU is implementing the New Approach Directives in order to protect consumers.
The Toy Safety Directive is one of them.
EU manufactures are responsible for the safety of the goods they produce.
Are importers responsible for the safety of goods?
The situation in the European and global toy markets differs greatly.
Only last August, the US toy manufacturer Mattel recalled almost 19 million toys manufactured in China.
Mattel toys are sold in the EU too.
In 2006 half of all products sold in the EU that were deemed hazardous to health were manufactured in China.
The same safety requirements should be applicable not only to EU manufacturers, but also to exporters in non-EU countries intending to sell their products in the EU internal market.
I believe that manufacturers that transfer production from the EU to China can do much to influence this issue and they must take full responsibility.
They cannot simply make use of the cheap labour force in China, but should also be honest with their consumers - the citizens of their countries.
I would encourage the Commission to review the Toy Safety Directive as soon as possible, to introduce clear toy safety criteria and CE marking control and to protect our children from dangerous toys brought onto the EU market.
Furthermore, on the subject of the certification of institutions, I believe it should be compulsory for manufacturers and importers to lose their production certification if the products they place on the market are recognised as unsafe, that is, when confidence is lost.
(SV) Mr President, we buy toys for our children so that they can have fun and be stimulated in their development.
Without exception, parents expect society to protect children, but current legislation makes it possible for us to put toxic bombs in our children's hands.
Mr Verheugen says that lead is banned in toys, but the truth is that the law permits an intake of 0.7 microgram per day.
However, the law leaves industry to set the standard for how safety is to be achieved, and that is where protection for our children stops.
The standard says that the 1985 toxicity data are sufficient.
The Commission's own experts want an update.
The standard says that the entire daily intake can be imputed to toys.
The experts say a maximum of 10%, which would mean a requirement ten times more stringent.
The standard assumes that no child swallows more than 8 milligrams from a toy.
The experts think that is absurd.
The standard only requires one toy per category to be tested, not every product.
The experts think that is absurd.
The Commission's own experts regard the protection as a disaster, and this is only the beginning.
Thirty-four aromas which are banned in cosmetics are permitted in toys.
Carcinogens, mutagens and reproduction toxins which are banned in cosmetics are permitted in toys.
Allergens are also permitted in toys.
The Commission has known about the problem for ten years.
Now we want legislation, a law which protects our children both on paper and in reality.
Why do the toys industry and the governments get the documents but Parliament does not?
- (FR) Mr President, 65% of the toys distributed in Europe, sold in Europe, are made in China, and the presence of our two Commissioners shows just how important this problem is.
This is not only a safety issue but also a health issue affecting a specific consumer group, namely our children.
When very young children are involved, the problem is even more serious.
We cannot compromise on safety, especially when the products concerned are intended for small children.
I especially worry about the failure of Member States to carry out the necessary controls.
We know that many products made in China are dangerous, but it does not just concern toys, it also concerns textiles and now vehicles.
Therefore, this is a huge problem and the European Commission must properly address this issue.
This is why I am in favour of raising safety standards - the famous CE safety mark - so that we can reduce the risk of dangerous substances being present in products that come from China.
I am mainly thinking of chemicals, which we have discussed a great deal.
It is a question of corporate responsibility, although Mattel showed that it accepted responsibility.
The responsibility of Member States is even more important: it is even more important because I am deeply concerned about what will happen with Internet sales.
How can we be sure that the toys recalled by Mattel will not go on sale to European consumers over the Internet?
What control do we have?
Consumer information is important: consumers must be aware of the risks of buying these products and must realise that low prices and cheap goods do not go hand in hand with health and safety.
It is also important that we introduce controls - controls at production sites, controls carried out independently and autonomously - and that we prevent these stocks of faulty products from flooding the market and doing more harm.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has said that the subject occupying us today is primarily a problem of failure to comply with existing laws.
This is partly true.
We as the European Parliament should not neglect sending a clear message to the Member States that we cannot demand increasingly strict European laws and then not take enough money at home to guarantee their implementation.
It has also been stated, however, that we ought to apply the strictest standards of all in the toy sector.
This is where the Toy Safety Directive, which has been in existence for a long time, needs to be revised.
When this directive is revised, I am expecting a clear stance to the effect that the strictest standards of all will be applied and chemicals classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction will be banned.
Today I hope that we in the European Parliament will hold to this position in the decisions we make.
Not only does this discussion about toys provide evidence that CE labelling is misleading, but also the many discussions at home with our citizens do so too.
As I see it, we are hoping for either an indication of origin or at least a certain level of quality.
I think that as part of the revision we should rethink how we can mislead our citizens less.
I would say straightaway that I cannot quite understand voluntary safety labelling either.
In Europe and the European Union we have to become better at conformity, but it makes no sense to develop specific labelling as a reward for the fact that we have been complying with the existing laws for a long time.
I am very sceptical about this and I think that it is more important to focus on monitoring the implementation of strict rules.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioners, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I would like to say that cooperation between the European Commission and China is of course of exceptional importance and that we are following the Commission's activities there as closely as possible.
I would, however, also like to inquire about our Chinese colleagues' activities in China.
I can tell you that, somewhat by coincidence, a Chinese delegation is here this week, as our interparliamentary meeting is being held tomorrow and the day after, and also that one of the items on the agenda is precisely product safety and the way in which we can cooperate more effectively in that regard.
Should the Commissioner have any additional suggestions for items for the agenda - incidentally, we have already received a memorandum from the Commission in this regard - we would of course welcome those suggestions, as it is of course clear that cooperation between China and Europe is of particularly great importance.
I would like to point out that the Commissioner has already made efforts to that effect during the summer and that a further follow-up is expected in October.
With regard to collaboration within our RAPEX system, in which we exchange information with the Chinese and the Chinese AQSIQ authorities, affairs must run as smoothly as possible.
Nevertheless, it cannot reach a situation whereby we - that is the authorities, the government - assume responsibility for products.
If we are to control each product, manufacturers should be able to say 'let them go ahead and do it; we can see what we are introducing onto the market'.
Responsibility must remain with the manufacturer.
This also became abundantly clear in the Mattel case.
Manufacturers must ensure that their products are safe by means of research and checks.
Moreover, we must ensure that these checks are implemented as effectively as possible across Europe and China and that we can determine what is happening by means of spot checks.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a very calm discussion this morning.
I welcome this greatly, but it is a very difficult subject.
We have three problems in all with consumer products, and with toys in particular, and these have already been amply discussed.
Firstly, market surveillance - and you, Commissioner Verheugen, have indeed addressed the fact that an iron was wrongly given two different safety labels on Europe's internal market.
This is bad enough, but the worst thing is that a Member State found this iron and did not inform the other Member States about it until a year later.
There is a need for change here, particularly in the Council.
Secondly, importer liability has already been addressed.
I can only support what has been said here.
However, I believe that a crucial problem - and this is my third point - lies in the fact that we have different approaches at European level.
On the one hand, we have the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD), which applies to all consumer goods, and on the other hand the New Approach.
This varied approach to consumer products is still not completely watertight at all points.
Hence my belief that we need the CE marking that applies in the New Approach as a basis for safety and for products entering the internal market, and that we need additional certification for all those manufacturers on the European internal market and beyond, which must be voluntary, and which offers European manufacturers the opportunity to raise standards as a whole in global competition - because Europe's internal market is the world's largest internal consumer market, bigger than the USA and bigger than all the others in this product sector.
This solution - a voluntary one with a basic principle legally governed by regulation at European level - offers the consumer the security of knowing what has been assigned to a product by a certificate.
We therefore have an internal market-friendly solution as well as a solution for dealing with globalisation.
One further point on toys.
There are many different types of toys.
It is totally clear to me that a teddy, which children put in their mouths, naturally has to meet different conditions than a computer keyboard and we should also factor this differentiation into the implementation of the legislation.
Hence my appeal to our Members: let us therefore think about taking CE marking as a basis for all goods coming onto the internal market and additional, voluntary certification for consumer goods.
(FR) Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the recall by the US toy manufacturer Mattel of several million toys made in China is significant for three reasons.
First of all, it confirms the urgent need for a revision of the 1988 Toys Directive.
Secondly, this event shows the need for greater control and market surveillance, the need to make CE marking compulsory and to ensure that it is truly credible.
Finally, we are right to question the failings of the current trade globalisation model, and to ask ourselves how the world's leading toy manufacturer could not work with reliable subcontractors.
