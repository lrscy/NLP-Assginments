A simple prohibition will not suffice, as it is not known what will then become of the stuff.
As I have always said, you can't just chuck the stuff in a ditch.
It is precisely then that it becomes hazardous, when, unsterilised and unmonitored, it can find its way to animals, possibly leading to the spreading of plague and foot and mouth disease.
But not if it is sterilised.
I am glad the Commission has acceded to this proposal and said that it will, by 2004, present a directive - and yes, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I too think it should be a regulation - on biowaste, in which it will lay down rules on all the possible uses of food waste, including its use as feed.
It is unfortunate that the compromise we reached has not been minuted.
As it will be the next Parliament that will have to negotiate about it - and things are forgotten very quickly - I will be distributing a note for the records which you can have a look at.
We may be able to sign it, and then give this a permanent place as what we want as regards the handling of this issue in the next Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
The first item is the vote on two requests for urgent procedure in relation to:
a proposal from the Commission for a Council decision providing further macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2002) 436 - C5-0401/2002 - 2002/0192(CNS)]
and
a proposal from the Commission for a Council decision providing further macro-financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina [COM(2002) 437 - C5-0402/2002 - 2002/0193(CNS)].
Mr President, in actual fact, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy originally considered that, for procedural reasons, this urgency should not be authorised, since this is the third or fourth time that the Council has proposed the urgent procedure in relation to these issues, when really it should present them on time so that Parliament can give its opinion within the usual timescales.
However, in the end, considering the situation in Bosnia Herzegovina and in Yugoslavia, bearing in mind that this will be the last time we authorise an urgency - we ask the Commission and the Council in the future to act in full accordance with the norms - we are prepared to accept the urgent procedure.
Mr President, a letter was sent from Commissioner Patten to the President of Parliament yesterday asking Parliament to adopt, as quickly as possible, Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 in order to allow the budgetisation of the EUR 70 million for Afghanistan.
The additional funding is consistent with the pledge made by the Commission in Tokyo last January.
At the trialogue which was held yesterday evening between 9 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., an agreement was reached between the representatives of Parliament and the Council that Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 should be adopted as quickly as possible, as already approved by the Council.
On the basis of the letter from Commissioner Patten, could I ask you to consider the vote on the SAB 4 as an urgency, so that we can adopt it during this part-session?
If that is agreed to, then we will be calling a meeting of the Committee on Budgets at 10.30 a.m. this morning.
I should therefore like to inform those of my colleagues who do not already know, that there will be a meeting of the Committee on Budgets at 10.30 a.m. today in place of the coordinators' meeting that was planned.
As soon as your Committee tables the report, it can be placed on the agenda.
As there are no problems we will deal with it this week.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0289/2002) by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms (COM(2002) 85 - C5-0079/2002 - 2002/0046(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank Mr SjÃ¶stedt, who is rapporteur for this subject and who has made a sterling contribution to this complicated area.
It is an area that is important not only for ourselves here in Europe but also for the rest of the world and, in particular, for our partners in the developing countries.
As you must be aware, the Protocol we are to debate today is linked to the European Community's recently implemented ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
The overarching purpose of this UN agreement is to establish common rules for the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms with the objective of creating global protection of biological diversity and human health.
The European Union must fulfil its international obligations.
We must therefore incorporate the provisions of the Protocol on Biosafety into our legislation.
This proposal supplements the Community's existing regulations, particularly on the issue of the export of genetically modified organisms, so that it is in greater accordance with the provisions of the Protocol on Biosafety.
The proposal consists of the following main parts. Firstly, the obligation to give notice of exports of genetically modified organisms intended for deliberate release into the environment.
Secondly, the obligation to inform our international partners about the Community's methods, legislation and decisions concerning genetically modified organisms, as well as about any unintentional release of such organisms.
Thirdly, a set of rules to be used for identifying genetically modified organisms for export.
These rules are in accordance with the latest developments within Community legislation on genetically modified organisms and, in particular, with the provisions of the draft regulation on traceability and marking.
The present proposal contains no new special Community provisions concerning imports by one Member State from another, or movements between Member States, of genetically modified organisms. Such imports or movements will, in the future too, be covered by existing Community legislation.
I would emphasise in no uncertain terms how important it is for the work on this proposal to proceed swiftly.
The EU has played a key role in the international negotiations right from the beginning.
We must show that there is no doubt that we shall fulfil our commitments and that we shall be able to implement the Protocol in full as soon as it comes into force.
Mr President, when the Cartagena Protocol was adopted a couple of years ago, it constituted major progress both for the European Union and the EU countries.
The Protocol is based on the precautionary principle and respects the right of states to have stricter national rules governing the trade in genetically modified products.
The Protocol is an important example of the way in which global trade regulations can be based on environmental and consumer protection.
It constitutes a positive alternative to parts of the World Trade Organisation's practice.
With the adoption of the proposed law we are now debating, the Cartagena Protocol will become EU law.
While existing EU rules would apply to imports, the proposed law would regulate exports from the EU.
It is a matter of urgency that the rules be adopted.
The number of countries ratifying the Protocol is increasing, so that it will soon be possible for it formally to come into force.
By adopting this legislation, the EU can become a positive global example in this area.
We in Parliament should like to cooperate closely with the Commission and the Council to ensure that these laws are made ready as swiftly as possible.
As rapporteur, I believe that the Commission's proposed legislation has quite a few weaknesses.
In important areas, the proposals do not go as far as the Cartagena Protocol itself, and in other areas the proposals create an unnecessary lack of clarity.
I and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy therefore propose tightening up on a number of points.
It must not be possible to export seeds or products not approved for use within the European Union.
Only for reasons concerned, for example, with the climate, will it be possible for seeds to be exempted from this rule.
We cannot have one set of safety and consumer protection measures for ourselves, and another set for others.
In order for products to be approved for export, the importing country must be required expressly to have approved their importation.
It must never be possible for a failure to respond to be interpreted as authorisation, as it in actual fact could be under the Commission's proposed law.
That especially applies to countries with limited technical capacity in this area, for it is crucial to ensure that they genuinely recommend the imports and are able to handle them.
The actual exporter shall always be responsible for notification.
That is important in order to prevent a lack of clarity where the matter of responsibility is concerned.
It is also more in line with what is in actual fact prescribed by the Cartagena Protocol.
In the continued negotiations within the framework of the Cartagena Protocol, the European Union must support proposals for international regulations explaining companies' legal responsibilities.
The public's right to information about what is exported must be both clarified and reinforced, at the same time as respect for legitimate company secrets is maintained.
EU regulations must also make it unambiguously clear that exports to other countries must always respect the stricter rules which these countries are entitled to introduce, and this in full accordance with the Cartagena Protocol.
I therefore hope to see the adoption of as large a proportion as possible of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as of the amendments tabled jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
I also wish to thank the responsible Commission officials for their very helpful cooperation.
I would also thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in the year 2000 that the European Union signed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an international agreement which is now to be implemented, and as quickly as possible.
The Protocol aims, by applying international rules to trade in living GMOs, to prevent effects detrimental to biodiversity and to human health.
It governs the safe transfer, handling and use of genetically modified organisms, placing the emphasis on their movement across borders.
For this there is to be a procedure involving the prior informed consent of the importing country.
In the case of GMOs intended for immediate use as foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, or for processing, it envisages notification to the Commission or to the Biosafety Clearing House.
The Regulation's provisions will apply only to export to third countries outside the European Union.
Community law already applies to imports into the European Union and to trade between its Member States.
The future EU Regulation should be as strictly as possible in accordance with the Protocol's requirement, in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and for uniform international standards to create legal certainty.
It must, at the same time, be ensured that European export businesses do not, as a result, face formalities additional to those with which they must already comply when exporting to third countries.
The report that Mr SjÃ¶stedt has presented has, however, largely lost sight of the aim of maintaining biodiversity.
Of the many demands contained in it, some, on the one hand, go far beyond what the Cartagena Protocol requires, whilst others attempt to artificially restrict trade in living GMOs.
I see it as inexpedient to incorporate into the Regulation requirements relating to traceability and liability, as these issues are currently being debated in the course of a separate legislative procedure and therefore do not belong in this Regulation.
The Protocol takes for granted the exclusion of GMOs exported for use in closed systems from the complicated and expensive notification procedure.
No such provision is present in this report, or in the Commission proposal.
That is why I, along with Mrs Sommer and Mr Purvis, am reintroducing the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee's Amendment No 50, which we ask you to support.
It is my conviction that GMOs used in laboratories and not released into the environment represent no danger to biodiversity or to human health, and should therefore be excluded from the notification procedure.
Our Amendment No 51 calls for further derogations from the notification procedure in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles hampering trade in GMOs.
Moreover, the Regulation must follow the Cartagena Protocol as closely as possible in order to create greater legal certainty for international trade.
That is why GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted an exporter a license, and GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted a license for field trials, need to be capable of being exported without expensive approval procedures.
Dual notifications make little sense, as they result in more bureaucracy and far from greater safety for people and the environment.
What we need is sensible and practical rules in order to make good use of biotechnology's chances in third countries while maintaining biodiversity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, for the good work he has done on this report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on biosafety.
As the Commissioner has repeatedly observed, he has obviously studied the original document with great care, and this has enabled him to add even greater precision to certain items in the Commission proposal, which is in any case essentially a good one.
The implementation of this Protocol has mainly to do with seeking something long overdue, namely rules for EU exports of living GMOs to third countries, and in this practicability is of the utmost necessity.
We have to bring into being a realistic and usable piece of legislation.
It is precisely for this reason that I consider it wrong and, indeed, damaging for us to want to use this report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol to intervene in ongoing legislative processes.
By this I mean the proceedings relating to genetically modified foodstuffs and feedingstuffs and their labelling and traceability.
It was only a few weeks ago that we debated their first reading and had a plenary vote on them.
The decision was a close-run thing, in other words, there were divergent opinions, and we are at present waiting to hear what position the Council takes on this.
The proposal for a directive on environmental liability is also only now being debated in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with little prospect of any decision on it, which means that anything this report lays down on the issue of liability for the traceability of GMOs and additives must be emphatically rejected.
These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law, and so I have decided to bring in a number of requests for separate voting in order to correct the result of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which I believe to lack objectivity.
Nor initially did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development take the right approach, in that it, in its opinion, sought to extend the derogations from the documentary and information procedures for living GMOs in transit and in closed systems to organisms genetically modified for the purposes of research and development, that is, to field trials under Part B of the Release Directive 2001/18.
This was however, in my estimation, more of an inaccuracy, or rather a misunderstanding, as such a course of action would not be justifiable in terms of ethics or morals.
This is, in any case, about living GMOs, as yet at the research stage, and thus not guaranteed to be safe.
If we allow GMOs that are not permitted within the EU to be exported to third countries for the purposes of field tests - that is, for the purpose of their release into the environment - and do so without the possibility of their being monitored, then we are acting irresponsibly.
I say this precisely because I am an advocate of green genetics, as I am sure will have become abundantly clear in discussions to date in this House on the Release Directive and on draft regulations, traceability and the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.
A derogation from the requirement for documentation of living GMOs intended for release in third countries would mean that we were helping to send research into a lengthy foreign exile outside Europe, whether the EU's moratorium remained in place or were lifted, as it would be, in every instance, much simpler to engage in research anywhere other than in the EU.
We must see to it, though, that we make research within the European Union possible again and move it forwards, an incidental consideration being that we will then be able to monitor what it is up to.
I am therefore, together with my colleague Mrs Emilia MÃŒller, introducing two new amendments on behalf of my group, namely Amendments Nos 50 and 51 to Article 4, which have already been mentioned.
The first of these amendments seeks to restrict derogations from the documentary and information procedures to GMOs in transit and in closed systems.
This is where we really need these derogations in order not to hamper research, and I am convinced that fear of possible mishaps in this area, such as those that might result from containers fracturing in transit, is exaggerated.
Were it not so, I would not dare cross the street, get into a car, or board an aeroplane, as the possibility of an accident is always present, even if its likelihood is minimal in the extreme.
The second amendment has to do with a derogation from the information procedure for exports of GMOs to a third country, where this third country has already granted approval for release to another country in respect of the same GMO.
These derogations are necessary, as the use of the so-called AIA - Advanced Informed Agreement - as an information procedure in this instance offers no greater security and thus makes transborder movement unnecessarily difficult.
I hope you can follow my line of reasoning, and, of course, therefore ask you to support me with your votes.
I should first like to thank the Commission for the proposal for a regulation it has tabled and to thank Mr SjÃ¶stedt very much for an outstanding report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol, which will place us in the best possible position to ensure global protection in connection with the movement of GMOs.
I think it important that the developing countries in particular be protected against the harmful effects of what is often the aggressive marketing of GMOs, with their possible serious consequences for people's health, especially if we wish to conserve biological diversity in the countries concerned.
Certain points in the Commission's proposal for a regulation are not perhaps entirely clear, but that is something I think is largely remedied by Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report and a number of the amendments tabled. In this context, I shall just highlight the essential features.
First of all, I think it crucial that we help the developing countries develop the administrative capacity and expertise needed if they are not to be crushed by multinational companies with unlimited marketing resources available to them.
Secondly, it is important for the precautionary principle to be established.
In relation particularly to the developing countries, it is absolutely crucial that doubts about the harmful effects on biological diversity in the countries concerned should really be taken seriously, and it is also crucial that the legislation apply both to GMOs released into the environment and to genetically modified food and animal feed.
Finally, I think that Mr SjÃ¶stedt is right to emphasise, and table proposals about, the fact that it is not enough for exporters to give notice of movements of GMOs.
There should be actual approval on the part of the authorities in the recipient countries, organised in such a way that the absence of a response from these authorities could not of course be interpreted as a tacit acceptance.
I think that this should apply to all movements, and not only the first, since the recipient country should have the opportunity to monitor the spread of GMO products in its territory.
It is also good that only products approved by the EU itself should be exported from the EU area.
Finally, I would add that it is very important for the EU countries to apply tough and uniform sanctions so as to avoid a situation in which certain countries visibly get away, or almost get away, with disregarding the legislation while others do not.
A state of affairs ought not to arise in which there is more incentive in some countries than in others to contravene the legislation on transboundary movement.
I think that by adopting Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report and a number of the amendments tabled also on Mr SjÃ¶stedt's initiative, we shall see the Cartagena Protocol implemented fairly and consistently.
Mr President, as is evident from the Commission proposal and Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report, what matters more than anything is for the Cartagena Protocol to be transposed into European legislation and for us to be able to enforce it.
Biosafety and biological diversity are crucial and it is therefore essential that we should ensure that the Protocol becomes EU law.
Do we, however, assume that it is sound as it stands, or would we like to use this opportunity to make an exception and be more rigorous than the Protocol?
If it is the intention to implement the Protocol, that is what we should do, and it is important, in my view, for the sake of scientific research in the EU, not to close off the EU unnecessarily in one way or another from the rest of the world or make the work unnecessarily more difficult than in the rest of the world.
Genetic engineering is a ground-breaking discipline and strikes me as very useful.
As with all technologies, of course, the question is how it is employed.
In addition, I believe that trade is necessary and boundaries need to be crossed so as to allow scientists to do their research.
This is quite simply how science works, and as far as I can see, science hinders this research as little as possible.
We must do what is needed and leave out what is not needed.
Accordingly, I am of the opinion that we should implement the Protocol and that the report contains a few elements which are not conducive to this process.
Further to discussions on the GMO reports which were held a couple of weeks, or even months, ago, I have already pointed out that I personally have a problem with traceable and non-traceable products, in other words, things which can, and cannot, be discovered.
We have no intention of re-entering the debate, as it has already been held, but my group will definitely be endorsing Amendments Nos 51 and 50.
This topic has been discussed among the Christian-Democrats.
When restricted use and transit are at issue, the Protocol provides for an exception.
I can therefore not see why we cannot do the same.
Secondly, if the receiving country has already admitted GMOs, it is beyond me why we should re-apply for the same product to be imported and duplicate all the paperwork.
These are unnecessary restrictions, in my view.
It is, of course, true - and this is something I welcome - that we should provide the developing countries with as much information as possible, allowing them to be able to reach a sound verdict.
What matters most is that we transpose the Protocol into EU legislation, but just as important is for the European Union not to become an island where little or no research may, or can, be carried out in this technology, which could be very useful in my opinion, both to us and to the people in the developing countries.
Mr President, our group fully supports the report by Mr SjÃ¶stedt.
My speech will focus on what we believe to be the most important aspects.
The report proposes stricter control of the transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms, not in order to distort trade - as has been said here - but in order to preserve biodiversity, the health of the population and the citizens' right to choose.
It also proposes that the principle of caution be duly applied - and it is not always applied as it should be - and the cooperation of the Commission and the Member States with those third countries that do not offer a sufficient guarantee to be able to decide.
The report supports international regulations and measures which are stricter in terms of responsibility and compensation for possible damages.
It will not be possible to export genetically modified organisms unless there is written agreement from the receiving countries.
There is an issue which we know is controversial and which is going to cause difficulties: the export to third-world countries of genetically modified organisms which are not accepted in the European Union.
We had this same problem last year with the Directive on the marketing of safe products, or unsafe products, when the amendment we requested to prevent the exportation of organisms or products to the third world which are not accepted in the European Union was not approved.
I believe it is morally unacceptable that genetically modified organisms which are not accepted in the European Union can be exported to the third world.
We are asking for a restriction of confidential information, we demand more transparency in order to respect the citizens' need for information.
There are certain amendments - as Mr SjÃ¶stedt has said - which have been signed by three political groups in this House, which we support in particular, but I am going to refer to Amendment No 54, which we feel is important since we are in contact, above all, with the people of Latin America, and which relates to the socio-economic aspects resulting from the effects of genetically modified organisms on the protection of biological diversity and their impact on indigenous and local communities.
Recently, in this very House, indigenous Mapuches from Chile defended this very notion, diversity.
We cannot endanger it through exports - which are dangerous from a health point of view - of any genetically modified organisms which we do not accept here.
Mr President, we believe that the report by Mr SjÃ¶stedt does not have any interest behind it, either economic or from any particular lobby, other than the defence of health, of biodiversity and the citizens' right to choose.
Since we were not able to prevent the more or less uncontrolled proliferation of genetically modified organisms, let us make the control of this cross-border movement and respect for the Cartagena Protocol a message from this Parliament to those people.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report.
In my opinion, he has done a splendid job, above all because he has dared to go beyond the minimal standard laid down by the Commission.
I do think that the way we vote on this in Parliament has to set a milestone, and - as the lady who spoke before me said - must make it clear that the protection of biodiversity and of the public has pride of place, but that so too does the freedom of choice of what we term third countries, to which we export.
It has become clear from the latest reports from, and the latest difficulties with, the United Nations, with African States, especially Somalia - countries who have, as it were, a gun put to their heads and who are told to eat or die, countries where the hunger of people in these countries is exploited as a pretext for forcing them to buy genetically modified foodstuffs - that we are dealing here with a real lack of free choice.
I cannot do other than urge the Commissioner to take a firm line with the USA, and I want to take this opportunity to beg you not to bow down before the USA's threats, but rather make it abundantly clear that we will not give way on this.
Most of all, though, we must not lift the moratorium, for, as you will be aware, only one Member State has transposed the Release Directive.
Both a rule on liability and a satisfactory rule on labelling are a long way off.
We have to focus on that.
By this report and this vote, we have to show that we are in a position to close the gaping loopholes that are still there in the Cartagena Protocol.
I want particularly to highlight food aid and the export of foodstuffs, where we must not yield to American pressure by denying these countries what they want, but must make clear that they have to be informed about these matters as well.
Here too, what matters must be our refusal to trample on the right of consumers around the world to decide what they eat; above all, our vote must send a clear message that we cannot export to other countries a risk that we are unwilling to take ourselves.
That was our experience with Eastern Europe, but especially with the Third World.
We cannot simply move the risk elsewhere, but must make it our concern that the standard be enforced in Europe and that we avoid research that would not even be carried out here turning these countries into hazardous areas.
We must not misuse these countries for the purpose of research that is full of risks.
To do so would be not just an offence against safety; we would also be trampling human rights underfoot if we were to exploit these countries for the purposes of research that we find too risky.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt has, though, already addressed the importance of our finding a truly satisfactory solution to the issues of liability and labelling.
We have to fashion liability into a tool to get industry to deal with this issue in a more responsible manner, and so I would reiterate my plea to the Commissioner that she should, in her closing statement, enlarge on her view of UN food aid and what she plans to do about the moratorium until such time as we have sorted out these criteria, of which we would remind the Commission too, in a satisfactory way.
Mr President, I have already indicated in previous debates that it is essential that GMOs be exported to third countries in a responsible manner.
The argument that the development of genetically modified organisms helps solve the world food problem should very much apply in practice.
The stories of the so-called terminator gene, which prevents the growth of descendants, are very worrying indeed.
It is my hope that abuse and improper practices can be prevented by duly complying with the Protocol.
The European Community and the Member States have already made a first step in the right direction with regard to the imports and exports of GMOs, namely by endorsing the Cartagena Protocol.
We are now facing the next step, which is transposing the Protocol into clear-cut legislation, for which Directive 2001/18/EC and pending legislation on labelling GMOs should serve as a basis.
I am therefore of the opinion that the present regulation governing the international trade in GMOs should be completely in line with this.
In other countries too, people have to be aware of any safety risks before they can decide to accept a batch of GMOs.
They also want to know whether the level of protection, safe use and biological diversity can be guaranteed.
Moreover, I can imagine that those countries too set great store by freedom of choice, a value so cherished in Europe.
The Treaty of Rotterdam on the imports and exports of chemical substances shows up similarities with the present legislation.
Both treaties are based on the sound guiding principle that imports can only take place if the importing parties have been informed beforehand and have subsequently accepted.
I consider this to be an excellent guiding principle. Another gain is the fact that developing countries can obtain help and information on GMOs.
In this way, use can be made of expertise on GMOs that is present elsewhere in the world.
Needless to say, it is up to those countries what they do with this information.
We must also accept that countries may take more far-reaching measures in order to achieve a higher level of protection.
Whether they are within the EU or outside it, countries must have the option of going further than the Cartagena Protocol.
The present text helps the Member States to make every effort to prevent unintentional transboundary movement of GMOs.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report therefore receives my warm support.
Mr President, here we are once again to speak about GMOs.
Today, we are discussing the transboundary movement of these goods that are quite unlike any others.
Will our next step be to pass legislation on cases involving the accidental release or the unintentional risks of GMOs?
I am, of course, being ironic.
But this surely marks just the beginning of long series of debates which, we must admit, sometimes take on a surreal quality.
We approve of the direction of the proposal for a regulation on the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol, but we would like to point out the paradoxical aspect of the process.
This agreement is designed to provide the necessary legal framework for the transboundary movement of GMOs, but, at the same time, it acknowledges the contradictory notion of unintentional transboundary movements.
It is evident that such provisions enable situations of scientific uncertainty to be dealt with, an approach that the countries of the South do not have the resources to undertake as impartially as ourselves.
Moreover, during the vote we took in July to set a threshold of 0.5% or 1% for the adventitious contamination of GMOs, did we show impartiality?
Furthermore, are we not going round in circles at the moment in the Agriculture Council, with regard to the proposal on genetically modified products intended for animal feed?
Which procedure should be chosen to authorise these products?
Must we lay down a permitted level for non-deliberate traces of GMOs that are unauthorised but are considered to be safe?
The Community has decided to play a leading role in the sale of biotechnology, but the approach is entirely paradoxical: even though neither the safety nor the danger of GMOs has been established, it is already being presumed that they will be extremely successful on the market.
It is also true that the Commission has started to ask that the moratorium be lifted.
The protocol does indeed leave the Member States a great deal of discretion, based on the precautionary principle.
Yet, the SjÃ¶stedt report reduces this room for manoeuvre.
We must remain vigilant and remember that Community law uses the precautionary principle as it sees fit and that, when the States wish to take advantage of it, it is suddenly placed well out of reach.
The current French embargo on British beef is a worrying illustration of this.
It is up to the Member States to ensure that scientific uncertainty is not transformed into a futile problem of social uncertainty in the face of the risks, or even to lay the foundations for an acceptable co-existence of GMO and non-GMO cultures.
We are not closing the door on biotechnology or their transfer, but we wish to voice our reservations concerning a text which is merely a weak link of a shaky legislation thrown together in piecemeal fashion and which shows no hesitation in putting the cart before the horse.
We are therefore choosing to abstain from the vote on this report.
Mr President, I much regret that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not deliver an opinion on this subject.
Our coordinators were led to believe that there would be insufficient time to prepare an opinion before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy finalised its report.
In fact, this process took quite a lot longer than originally planned and there would have been sufficient time for the Committee on Industry to have given an opinion.
An opinion from that committee ought to have been regarded as essential - in fact it is arguable that the Industry Committee should have been the committee responsible for this report.
This proposal will have a substantial impact on the European Union's biotechnology industry, on the EU's research programme and, in particular, on the priorities of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research.
It also impacts on our trade in GMOs and in genetically modified research material with both developed and less-developed countries.
The Commission proposal adds undesirable restrictive requirements beyond the internationally agreed Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, but the Environment Committee's suggested amendments go drastically further.
It is essential that in our vote today we radically change the direction of this report.
I am only sorry that, coming late to this matter as I did, there was insufficient time to introduce all the changes and separate votes I would have liked.
Why is it such a problem?
These additional restrictions and bureaucratic requirements will only discourage investment in life science research in Europe, and further encourage the investment in research to transfer to other areas with more favourable legislation outside Europe.
Our scientists will go the same way as the research investment.
Have the Commissioner and the rapporteur any concept of the damage this is likely to do?
Did they give any consideration to the ambition expressed at Lisbon for Europe to be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world?
This proposal does not restrict imports into the EU of GMOs for contained research, but exports of public and private GM research material to third countries will be subject to yet further and disproportionate regulation.
This proposal runs diametrically contrary to the EU's life science and biotechnology action plan.
Was there any coordination or consultation with the Commissioner for Research and the Council of Ministers for Research?
It is quite appropriate that the Commission should propose, and Parliament and the Council approve, the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, but we should go no further.
If we do, we will jeopardise our life science base for the future, our scientific community, the whole Lisbon strategy and Europe's future as a dynamic knowledge-based economic power in the world.
I call on Parliament to vote overwhelmingly against Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report in all its critical aspects and, in particular, to support Amendments 50 and 51, which will at least mitigate the extent of the damage this proposal and report are likely to cause.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the words of thanks to the Commission for the present proposal.
It cannot be emphasised enough that the proposal is important for, among others - and this is sometimes overlooked - the developing countries, and that sufficient resources must be made available.
I should also very explicitly like to thank the rapporteur, not only for the volume of work, but also for the excellent work he has done, and for the political courage he has displayed in making a few observations with regard to the Commission proposal.
I am also somewhat taken aback by the reactions in this House, where the divide is once again apparent.
The MEPs to the right claim that we can apply the Protocol to the letter, but if we do, we must do it properly.
At the same time, we must ensure that science can carry out its research unhindered.
Those are the goodies.
The other side of Parliament is represented by those who are always frightened of God knows what and who want to impose restrictions on everything.
This is the wrong way to view the situation.
It should be viewed within the framework of the general debate surrounding GMOs, in terms of the consumer's right to freedom of choice and of the precautionary principle.
We still have no 100% certainty about this technology.
We must therefore ensure that at least the consumer has the choice.
This must be included in the Protocol.
This is also what we should now have the courage to vote in favour of.
I therefore wholeheartedly support the rapporteur's political courage and his observations.
I hope that tomorrow's plenary will adopt the same stance.
Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this report on the transboundary movement of GMOs in which the Committee on the Environment has adopted a more stringent and more comprehensive position than that proposed by the Commission, following the lead given by the rapporteur.
I would like to add to what colleagues have said in thanking him for his work.
I also welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment expanded the regulation to cover food and feed which have been produced from or with the aid of GMOs, as well as GMOs intended for contained use.
The report shows that whilst the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is a good basic framework for regulating the transboundary movement of GMOs, this is a minimum, a base line from which parties can and should be proactive in aiming for ever higher standards of control to meet the demands of the consumer.
This includes, as many colleagues have already mentioned, the right of freedom of choice.
We are only too aware of the recent examples of food aid to developing countries being cynically used to force GM food on people, to promote GM food and to force countries that have declared themselves GM-free to accept GM grain.
This includes countries such as Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe which have all taken a stand against the untested and unproven nature of GMOs and it is totally unacceptable that these are being forced upon them by countries such as the United States.
The European Union, in cases such as this, buys local non-GM food, adhering to the principles and the rules of the recipient countries in a manner in keeping with the ethos of the Cartagena Protocol.
On the other hand, in the past two years Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Ecuador have all been forced to accept GM food aid even though this was contrary to their national regulations.
I welcome the committee's report which clearly allows for countries to take more proactive steps to ensure international biosafety.
It is an important step forward in the whole GM debate and the report has my full support.
Mr President, I would like to start by offering Mr Purvis some small comfort.
He is indeed right that it would have been a good thing to have had an opinion from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but we, the European People's Party members of the Environment Committee, whilst of course representing the interests of the environment and of consumers, also represent the interests of business.
We all stand for an environmentally responsible market economy.
We know that protecting only the environment while ruining the economy is no use to consumers.
With us, Mr Purvis, the environmentally responsible market economy is in safe hands.
Austria ratified the Cartagena Protocol this year, depositing the instrument of ratification with the UN in New York on 27 August.
We know that some Member States see ratification as dependent on the passing of this draft EU regulation on the implementation of this Protocol.
This gives us all an interest in this draft being passed quickly.
Allow me, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, to comment on some of the amendments, for example Amendment No 6. The Regulation addresses only the Community, so that it is quite unnecessary, and, I think, irrelevant, to speak of 'any other Party'.
Like some of my predecessors on the floor, I think that the Protocol should cover only living GMOs, and that anything else would be wrong.
The area of liability and compensation is also, of course, very, very important and crucial, but on this we should wait for the outcome, which we expect to bring with it traceability and labelling.
It would, after all, be absurd for us now to insert some provision or other, and then engage in long-winded discussions on a quite different regulation, or another directive, on traceability, labelling and liability.
I rejoice in the knowledge that the Danish Presidency has as one of its objectives a Common Position at the Environmental Council on 17 October, following the conclusion of the First Reading stage in plenary, which is planned for the end of September.
We look forward to 17 October with great interest and wish the Danish Presidency and ourselves all the best for it.
Mr President, EU legislation runs up against boundaries on a regular basis.
Many of our rules affect imports and exports, and this brings with it a dual responsibility.
We must ensure that we do not compromise in the area of safety and at the same time, we must resist the temptation of imposing unnecessary restrictions on third countries and European exporters.
I should like to thank Mr SjÃ¶stedt for the courage with which he has negotiated this narrow path.
Where biotechnology is concerned, there is in this Parliament a strong need to send a message to the rest of the world.
The message is that biotechnology is controversial, possibly even dangerous and undetectable.
The consumer must therefore be informed of GMOs.
I have no problems with sending out this message within the European Union, but we must refrain from applying it in the context of the Biosafety Protocol, which is about safety.
In the case of non-detectable GMOs, safety is not an issue.
If the importing country does want this notification, then this should naturally be supplied.
However, this is completely unrelated to safety, and this is why we do not actually need Amendment No 30.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continually need to send out our message, but we should realise that forced evangelisation does not work.
The world is certainly not waiting to be patronised by Europe.
In his explanatory statement, Mr SjÃ¶stedt states that the EU must play a leading role in legislation in the field of biotechnology, but we should realise that we have long given up our pioneering role in this respect, in which we could give the world much more.
Unfortunately, with regard to biotechnology, Europe is trailing behind.
Hardly any GMOs are being exported, at the very most products produced by means of them.
Cheese and olive oil are prime examples of this.
I should like to ask the Commission a question.
What will be the implications if this report were to be adopted?
Would this increase the EU's deficit?
What would be the additional administrative burden for exporters, and what would be the economic implications of this?
Mr President, I too wish to begin by thanking the Commission for its proposal and Mr SjÃ¶stedt for his splendid and sterling work on confirming and clarifying what this matter is really about.
The Cartagena Protocol is designed to create a framework for international trade involving GMOs.
It is based on two important principles, firstly the precautionary principle and secondly the principle according to which countries that want stricter rules are entitled to have them.
Certain speakers here today seem to believe that the Cartagena Protocol is something quite different, aimed at facilitating trade as much as possible.
The Cartagena Protocol is, however, an agreement on biosafety.
The precautionary principle must be the guiding principle. There is no other way.
It is therefore crucial for the European Parliament to vote in favour of Amendment No 52, which is also supported by the rapporteur.
This states that transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms should proceed 'in every case and at each stage on the basis of the precautionary principle'.
That is something we must not go and lose.
My colleague, Mrs Evans addressed another important point, namely the ethic that permeates the Cartagena Protocol and that is based on the requirement for countries that do not want to produce or consume GMOs in any form to be entitled to refuse them.
Aid consignments containing GMOs, as discussed at the Johannesburg Summit, must not take place.
We must help bring about a situation in which no compulsion is felt to receive such consignments.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m explained that there is no doubt that the EU must fully comply with the Protocol.
In this situation, I doubt if it would further the Cartagena Protocol if the European Parliament were to accept Amendment Nos 50 and 51, or if the content of these were to be complied with for, in that case, it would not be possible for the Protocol's intentions to be put into practice.
I therefore recommend that these amendments be rejected, for their purpose is to ensure that trade is impeded as little as possible.
The reason that the Cartagena Protocol came about is that GMOs and trade require special precautionary measures.
We can never have too much safety. On the other hand, we can have too little.
There must be no doubt that, in Community legislation, it is the precautionary principle that applies and that it applies in full.
I support this report in its entirety.
Mr President, the regulation on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms is a rather surreal document.
Therefore, please will you forgive me my customary digression, for I cannot stop my flights of fancy.
Yesterday, I met a GMO wandering about between borders, who said to me: 'Why have you got it in for me so badly?
Yesterday, while I was wandering between borders, I went to Naples.
I saw the beautiful Gulf of Naples, Vesuvius and Mergellina.
It was absolutely beautiful!
Then, a little further on, still by the sea, I saw a horribly ugly, uninhabited area where there was a steelworks that had been deserted for 10 years.
The area was called Bagnoli.
Why do you not do something in Europe to enhance the environment in this area near Naples?
There you are, you see, wandering from one place to another I have been useful: I have seen an area where you, as Europe, might be able to do something to enhance the environment.
Why, then, have are you so against us GMOs?
Even we have our uses.
Are you sure you are aware of our full potential?
Therefore, be more flexible in allowing the genetic modification of organisms which are useful to the human race.'
Mr President, I wish to thank both my colleagues and Mrs WallstrÃ¶m for the viewpoints that have been put forward in this debate and that I think provide quite a clear picture of the lines of demarcation.
I think that there are a number of factors that should be borne in mind where this protocol is concerned.
The first is, of course, that we are concerned here with minimum regulations.
We must comply with what the protocol requires of us, but we may, according to the protocol, go further if we wish.
That is the situation that applies.
It also, of course, means that other countries around the world may go further than the protocol requires.
What I state in the report is that we shall respect this.
We require of our exporters that they respect the Cartagena Protocol and so, too, the legislation that other countries may adopt and that may go further than the European Union's.
If we did not, we should in practice be acting contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Cartagena Protocol.
I believe there is no question of our doing that.
Secondly, we should be aware that the Cartagena Protocol is in the process of development.
Regular negotiations are under way.
Quite a few areas of the Protocol have still not been clarified. It is just the general thrust of it that is being delineated.
Other areas have been clarified. We must therefore bear in mind that we need a policy that is far-sighted and that shows the general direction in which the EU wishes to develop the Cartagena Protocol in the future.
It is precisely this to which the regulations on liability relate.
We are not concerned here with the EU's liability legislation, which we are in the process of debating elsewhere.
What is at issue is Article 27 of the Cartagena Protocol, which says that we must begin to negotiate internationally concerning liability where this type of product is concerned.
As a Parliament, we support the Commission and the Member States in campaigning, in future negotiations within the framework of the Cartagena Protocol, for a global system of liability which would of course favour the serious actors in this area.
It is a system of this kind that is required.
When it comes to the amendments, I believe that Amendment Nos 50 and 51 seriously weaken the report by aiming to remove important areas from it.
Amendment No 50, in particular, actually goes against the Cartagena Protocol.
We cannot adopt that amendment.
I should also like to ask those who regard GMOs differently from myself to reflect for a moment.
We naturally form different judgments of what is possible and different assessments of the risks that this technology may involve.
Irrespective of how we regard the future of this technology, I think there is something we must bear in mind, namely that we must have a system of rules under which the companies that operate in this area are credible.
Is a company credible if it exports to countries that have not given their permission?
Is a company credible if it exports to a country that has not been able to respond to the request for permission?
I believe that an industry that acts in this way disgraces itself.
We do not stand to gain, and nor should industry stand to gain, from rules that lead to what is in actual fact the bypassing of countries' right to say yes or no to would-be imports.
Next question: are we credible if we export to others what is not good enough for ourselves?
Are we credible if we export what we have rejected, for example for reasons that have to do with environmental safety, biological diversity or consumer protection?
Of course we are not.
Even someone who takes a very positive view of this industry - complicated though it is, with both advantages and disadvantages - ought to appreciate that it is in everyone's interests to have comprehensive, credible regulations.
If the European Union accepts these regulations, they will have an effect not only upon ourselves and our exports, but also upon the world as a whole.
They will show that the major global players too take this issue seriously and are prepared to assume their responsibilities.
It is with this in mind that I have prepared this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want first of all to thank you for your interesting and constructive contributions to this debate.
I want to begin with a general comment. The Commission is, and remains, very active where the issue of biotechnology is concerned.
As you know, we have presented a communication on how we should make use of biotechnology.
We are actively working on our internal Community legislation in this area, partly by revising Directive 2001/18/EC on traceability and marking, and we are also working on the issue of liability for environmental damage.
It is constantly a question of striking this delicate and difficult balance between, on the one hand, exploiting the advantages of a new technique, a new technology and new knowledge in this area and, on the other, preserving biological diversity and, most importantly of all, protecting people's health.
I believe that this proposal is in line with Community legislation and that we are still being ambitious.
I was myself involved in the negotiations in which the EU was the party pushing to guarantee the introduction of international regulations.
I believe that we are achieving that balance in this area too.
It is also true, as Mr SjÃ¶stedt points out, that there will be further negotiations and work in a number of areas with a view to shedding more light on a number of important issues.
If, finally, I may now offer my views on certain of the amendments in order to clarify the Commission's attitude, I will begin by commenting on Amendment Nos 30 and 57 which cannot be approved because they go against the proposal on traceability and marking by extending the proposal also to include food and feed manufactured with the aid of GMOs.
It is important for different legal acts on biotechnology to tally.
Amendment Nos 5 and 47 deal with the important issue of capacity development in developing countries but contain no mechanisms for putting this into practice.
The Commission believes that this is an important issue but that it can better be dealt with in a more suitable forum, for example the European Development Fund.
Amendment Nos 7 and 45 relate to the issue of environmental liability, and the Commission again believes that this proposal is not the right instrument for getting to grips with this problem, to which special international negotiations are better suited.
Further attention will be given to this issue in international negotiations.
Amendment No 22 proposes that the export of GMOs for deliberate release into the environment should be limited to organisms already authorised within the EU.
In its present version, the amendment could entail serious obstacles to research outside Europe comprising, for example, field trials involving GMOs not cultivated in our latitudes.
The Commission is not therefore able to accept this amendment in its present form.
Amendment No 29 addresses more fundamental problems.
Firstly, procedures are being established that do not in their entirety correspond to Article 11 of the Protocol on Biosafety and, what is worse, are inconsistent with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law.
For that reason, the Commission cannot accept the amendment.
The proposal in the last sentence of Amendment No 60 to the effect that an exporter should be obliged to give notice of further movement of GMOs already authorised in the recipient country would not be in accordance with Community legislation governing deliberate release or with the Protocol on Biosafety per se.
This part of the amendment cannot therefore be approved.
It is, of course, a question of not creating unduly bureaucratic rules that cannot be implemented in practice.
The Commission is, on the other hand, able to accept Amendment Nos 50 and 51.
Mr President, I want in conclusion to repeat that the Commission shares most of the European Parliament's priorities and views in the problem areas.
If we want it to be possible to implement the Protocol on Biosafety, we must, at the same time, be accountable for the feasibility of such implementation.
International discussions on the Protocol on Biosafety are still going on.
A proposal capable of being implemented will not only help make it possible for the negotiations to continue in a constructive climate but also help show that sound protection of the environment and of human health can be combined with trade.
We shall have to return to other issues mentioned in the course of this debate, such as the moratorium and UN food aid, for they demand both time and thorough preparations.
I hope that they will lead in time to a constructive exchange of opinions, but this is not the right time and place to touch on all these different aspects.
A summary of the Commission's position on the matter of the amendments is being presented in writing to the President
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon today.
The next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution (B5-0490/2002) tabled by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the postponement of the ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is actually a technical measure.
The resolution before you, on which we are to vote, refers to what we term comitology, something which the spectators in the galleries will be surprised to learn, many Members of this House have difficulty understanding, and indeed, they certainly do not have to.
It is comitology that entitles the Commission to use the specialist committees to approximate legislation within the scope of the power that the legislation itself confers.
The resolution passed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy charges the Commission with now desiring to avail itself of a right which it does not possess.
What we are talking about is the Commission's intention of deferring the entry into force of the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, which was actually meant to have happened some time ago.
In the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, Parliament decided on a ban on the marketing of cosmetics that had been tested on animals, sharing as it did the conviction of most of the public that we have enough cosmetics and do not need more - toothpaste, shower gel, and so on - for which animals have had to suffer and die.
This ban had a definite deadline - 1998.
In 1997, the Commission gave itself the power to delay its entry into force.
Whilst, admittedly, stating that the entry into force was to be in 2000, it added, at the same time, the option of an extension of two years.
I do not want right now to state whether that was lawful.
As things stood, the marketing ban was meant to enter into force on 30 June 2002, and it did so.
The Commission is now planning to use a comitological measure to again, very soon - in a week or a few days, quite possibly on 24 September - put back the date of entry into force, by six months.
This it justifies by the assertion that we are in the midst of the conciliation procedure on the seventh amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, and that the measure could therefore not enter into force in June.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, I am sorry that you are the member of the Commission to whom I must say these things.
We charge you with acting illegally, with breaking the law.
You are in breach of the Treaty and of existing legislation!
I would much rather say that to Mr Liikanen, but he is, unfortunately, not here today.
I am aware that the Commission acts as a collegiate body; I am equally aware that there are individuals sitting on the Commission who have very different views.
That, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, is why I regret that it is you whom I have to address today.
I would very much prefer to have been very hard on Mr Liikanen.
I admit that, with you sitting there, I find it more difficult.
Nonetheless, what you are doing is illegal!
It is against the law, and we will therefore be taking you to the Court of Justice if necessary.
I am sure that the majority in this House will support that.
What you are now proposing to do is not merely contrary to the law, but is positively absurd.
I could use old-fashioned language and call it daft!
You want to pass a measure with retroactive effect.
You want to pass something that enters into force retroactively, namely from 30 June.
Why, actually, do you want to do this?
We are already at the end of September.
The conciliation procedure will be completed in two months at the latest - it has to be.
Even now, you have not implemented the marketing ban.
In theory, you are already acting illegally, but we are saying: OK, that's something of a legal vacuum, we'll put up with it.
The Member States are not proceeding with transposition, and we know that they are doing the right thing by waiting for the seventh amendment.
What the Commission now has in mind is the creation of a precedent, and we are not going to let them get one past us.
They want, again, to give themselves the right to defer the sixth amendment, and if we now lie down quietly like little lambs, then they will believe that they have the right to carry on doing the same thing.
We will not let you have your precedent!
We are not good little lambs! I'm not one, and nor are my fellow MEPs!
That is why we are telling you now that your actions are illegal.
This resolution makes that very clear.
We call upon you not to implement this measure.
The four articles are very clear in calling on you to desist. We are telling you to keep your hands off this measure.
We are telling the Member States not to touch it, not to pass it into law.
And we are telling you that if you do it anyway, we will drag you off to the Court of Justice!
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, I really do beg you to take this message back to the Commission.
I can see the gentleman from the Industry Directorate-General sitting beside you.
Tell them that we are serious about this.
We believe that you are in breach of the law!
As the Commission, you may not break the law.
You know that it did not do past Commissions any good, and you too should act as properly and honestly as possible.
You are not doing that if you want to pass another Implementing Measure.
So, as rapporteur for the Cosmetics Directive, I can only tell you, as firmly as I can: hands off!
Mr President, of course it is nicer to stand in for colleagues under circumstances where you might receive applause rather than be attacked.
I would never want to be attacked by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, because I respect her very much.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank her and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the resolution on the postponement of the entry into force of the ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals.
The aim of this postponement is quite simply to regulate a short-term situation, from 1 July 2002 until 31 December 2002, and this corresponds to the period envisaged for conciliation.
The directive currently in force prohibits the marketing of cosmetics products containing ingredients or a combination of ingredients tested on animals after 30 June 2002.
The current conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council relating to the seventh amendment aims to settle definitively the question of tests on animals in the cosmetics sector. This conciliation procedure is expected to be finalised in the coming months.
At the same time, there are responsibilities incumbent upon the Commission in the areas of the free circulation of goods, protection of public health and respect of international rules.
The Commission therefore considers it has an obligation to take the appropriate measures in accordance with the provisions of the current directive.
The Member States, represented in the Cosmetics Committee, will have to express their views on this proposal.
The Commission is convinced that further work, in close cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, will finally lead to a balanced solution within the context of conciliation.
This solution should be of genuine benefit to animal welfare whilst safeguarding consumer health and our international commitments.
It is the intention of the Commission to do its utmost to achieve a result which satisfies everyone.
I will, of course, give your regards to Commissioner Liikanen.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think I will use up the five minutes I am allowed, I will be considerably more brief than that, because the resolution we are debating at the moment and which we will probably vote for tomorrow very clearly describes a situation which only has one possible and correct technical and legal solution: to maintain this Parliament's request that the Commission withdraw the proposal to postpone the entry into force of the Directive.
As is explained in the resolution and as the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, has already explained, the Commission was empowered by the Council to postpone the entry into force of this measure, which it did by postponing the date of 1 January 1998 to 30 June 2000 and, subsequently, from 30 June 2000 to 30 June 2002.
This postponement - as recital 10 of the Directive points out - should have been the last one.
Parliament cannot therefore accept it since, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already said, the Commission's proposal for a new directive postponing the entry into force of this measure - which, furthermore, has been in force since 30 June 2002 - is not legal.
In June, the plenum of the European Parliament approved, on second reading, a modification - the seventh - of this Directive which laid down the prohibition of the marketing of products which have been tested on animals, five years after its entry into force.
Currently, as has also been said, the process of modification for this sixth modification is being implemented and we are now on the seventh modification.
It is clear - and the rapporteur knows this because we have talked about it many times and she agrees with it - that an immediate prohibition of the marketing of products tested on animals, which the application - which is already in force, I would remind you - of this sixth modification of the Directive would represent, would at this time involve difficulties in terms of compliance which are practically impossible to overcome.
We know this, I believe that is the spirit guiding the conciliation on this Directive: to find a formula for agreement so that the industrial sector - the cosmetics sector - can comply with the new time limit which may be stipulated.
This is how the conciliation debate is developing: finding a final time limit which allows the industry to adapt to the situation without harming competitiveness.
However, while it is important to stress that we must find consensus during conciliation which provides a viable solution, this can in no way mean that the Commission is given the freedom to exercise a right which it does not legally have to order a further postponement of the entry into force of the said provision.
Parliament cannot therefore accept the use of such an undemocratic procedure as comitology to deal with a modification that contradicts the decision of this Parliament and of Community legislation itself.
And I also regret, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, that it has been you who has had to endure this torrent of criticism of the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m always brings a light and happy touch to our proceedings and we are grateful for that.
The severity of some of the remarks you will hear from the floor today do not reflect on her, but on the fact that she is caught in one institution which is now on a collision course with another.
The rapporteur said that those listening to us in the gallery today may be curious as to what the word 'comitology' means.
Some of us are too.
Our visitors should not go away with the feeling that comitology could be effectively translated as a lateral means whereby the Commission can frustrate the will of the Parliament.
We are an elected institution.
We have certain powers.
They have been extended.
They are still not all that considerable, but we know where the boundaries are.
On this issue I must say to the Commissioner - and I hope she will take this back to Mr Liikanen - that we in this House have had a debate which has continued through a number of Parliaments, through pretty much the entire parliamentary lifetime of everyone sitting in this Chamber now, from 1993 onwards.
In 1997 the Commission purported to give itself a further power of delay and that was extended, although challenged, because all of us here - and everyone who serves as I do on the Conciliation Committee - agree with the rapporteur in acknowledging the difficulties which arise where there are not yet viable alternatives to some forms of animal testing.
That is perfectly taken into account in the deliberations we have had, which estimate that it may take another decade to reach the point and the conclusion that we all want.
But what happens in the meantime?
What happens if this conciliation fails?
We are not talking then of something which is only temporary, only due to last for the duration of the present conciliation.
We are talking of something quite different.
I would like to read to the Commissioner the fifth paragraph of the vice-chairman's letter, written on behalf of our committee, to Commissioner Liikanen.
He says that the Commission exercised its powers - which are disputed anyway - in 1997.
When the implementation date for the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics was postponed to 30 June 2002 by Directive 2000/41, this postponement was to be - to quote the words of Recital 10 - for the 'last time'.
Now here we are again - and it is not the last time, it is the penultimate time.
Or is it just one in a whole series of delays and frustrations?
If you have an elected Parliament you have to listen to what it says, otherwise these people in the gallery are wasting their time and we are wasting our time in coming here.
Commissioner, you must go back and say to Mr Liikanen that he should think again.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are as one in our displeasure with the Commission.
It is not acceptable for the Commission to act illegally, for them to put off the implementation of this decision, delaying it, and so on. Nor is it acceptable for them to look on and do nothing while the Member States endow their omissions with something like legitimacy.
Now at last, what has been resolved upon - namely, a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals - must be put into effect with all force.
The Commission is itself, after all, the guardian of the law, and as the guardian of the law, it must ensure that laws are implemented.
Now the Commission, rather than guarding the law, is obstructing it. What you are achieving here will be catastrophic in its effect.
It is precisely in terms of the great implementation deficit in our European Union that you are giving such a bad example that in future all the Member States will be able to point to the Commission and say: Look at that, even the Commission itself is incapable of implementing its own laws, preferring to make laws for itself, and set itself above the law.
As Mrs Roth-Behrendt so rightly said, it acts illegally, bending the law to suit itself and contributing to the Member States' noticeably diminishing interest in putting the law into real effect.
Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to reiterate, with as much emphasis as I can muster, that it is not acceptable for you to send out this calamitous signal; on the contrary, the Commission must change its ways, become the guardian of the Treaties and do everything in its power to really get the Member States to transpose this law, and not itself go and break current European law.
That is not tolerable, and Mr Whitehead was right to say so.
How on earth do you intend to get it across to the public that the Commission has failed to make any real effort to put into effect things that should have been done in the past?
Quite apart from that, I find it positively absurd that the Commission is also stabbing the Conciliation Committee in the back, depriving it of fallback positions, and making something of a mockery of the work currently being done in Parliament.
That the Commission should go so far as to do that really is unique in history.
You can see how great is our displeasure, and I cannot expect us to do other than adopt this resolution by a large majority; I look forward to the Commission really seeing what an emphatic rebuke this is and realising how far-reaching is its significance.
Mr President, everyone is becoming caught up in the revision of the directive on cosmetics.
What has happened to the sixth revision?
Are we moving straight on from the fifth to the seventh and ignoring the sixth?
That is what everyone is wondering.
However, we all want to have safe and anti-allergenic cosmetics, to spare animals any unnecessary suffering, to maintain jobs, competitiveness and the expertise of our businesses.
This seemingly straightforward desire seems difficult, nigh impossible, to implement.
This resolution is a good illustration of Parliament trying to gain the upper hand, and the Council, quite rightly, refuses to support it.
To impose a target date for a ban on animal experiments could lead to several measures.
The first is to no longer guarantee the safety of products placed on the market.
These products would not have been subject to the full tests that provide the same guarantees as those carried out on animals.
The second point is to put European products on the markets of third countries at a disadvantage by continuing to carry out tests on animals, these are currently the only fully reliable tests.
The third point is to risk a sanction being imposed by the WTO which may perceive this ban as a barrier to the marketing of cosmetics produced outside the European Union, even though it is generally accepted that few directives proposing alternative solutions will come to light until another ten years or so and that animal experiments may be phased out completely in perhaps another 20 years.
In my view, it would be more realistic to enter into dialogue with the Council, leaving behind this overly passionate - and now ideological - debate, so that we can work together to find the best solution which will be acceptable to industry, consumers and animal campaigners.
I believe that a ten-year ban which includes exemptions for three types of tests - namely reproductive toxicity, toxicokinetics and toxicity through repeated use - would be more acceptable.
Lastly, I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time whereas others, such as Directive 79/409 EEC, have never been revised before.
Mr President, I should like to concur with Mr BerniÃ©, who stated that this is an ideological debate.
However, and this is meant for the Commissioner's ears, it transpires that the Commission does not share Parliament's ideology which has been approved here many times. It therefore breaks the law - if I may put it that way - by flouting the rules that we have laid down several times.
In other words, the Commission's ideology is not in line with Parliament's wishes.
This strikes me as a dangerous situation, not only because Parliament is thus rendered a plaything, but also because the responsibility of Parliament - which has not always been undivided in this very complex matter, but has always acted responsibly - is being eroded at the very moment that we are discussing the conciliation procedure relating to the seventh amendment.
I would therefore once again ask the Commission to take account of what Parliament has always stated, namely that animal testing for the purpose of cosmetics is unacceptable, that safety should always come first and that we are willing to help consider all the possible alternatives, and help weigh these up.
This is, in fact, something we have always pointed out for every amendment to this directive.
I would now ask the Commission not to frustrate Parliament, to withdraw its plans and implement what we jointly agreed on.
Mr President, I know that our concerns are close to the Commissioner's heart.
You, Commissioner, are a young and beautiful woman, and, whilst you have no need of cosmetics, I need them urgently.
I will be seventy next year, and, whilst I am very keen to get some anti-wrinkle cream, I do not want some animal to suffer as a result.
Do you really believe any woman would use any cosmetic product if she had to see an animal suffer for it?
We want to look good without others having to suffer to make it possible.
I really want to make an appeal to the cosmetics industry.
Look how the introduction of the catalytic converter led to prophecies of ruination and claims that the end of the motor industry was nigh -- and yet, it experienced a boom.
Why does the cosmetics industry not announce that it will invest money - a great deal of money - in research, in order to have the means to make women beautiful, but not at the cost of the suffering of others?
I believe the cosmetics industry would enjoy a massive upturn, and European women like us would be even more beautiful than all the other women on earth.
Mr President, Mr Martin has just told me that I have the luxury of being able to be somewhat flexible, rather than, as is otherwise the case, having only one and a half, two, or three minutes at my disposal.
I promise my colleagues, though, especially Mr Casaca, who is to explain the next report, that I will not exploit that advantage.
Mr President, I am glad that it is you who are currently in the chair, as you are also chairing the conciliation procedure on cosmetics and are as helpful a guide as one could wish to have in the conciliation procedure.
I therefore take great pleasure in seeing you here today.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate.
Our discussion today has not only been a very lively one, as our discussions frequently are, but has also been able to evoke some enthusiasm from the visitors in the gallery, as shown by their applause, which is admittedly unusual, but also gratifying.
I just want to return to one point and not so much correct Mrs Flemming as just add to what she said, so that our male visitors can be aware that it is of relevance to them, too: the Cosmetics Directive that we are discussing today is not just about anti-wrinkle creams - which I, at the age of 49 and working in Parliament, urgently need - but it is also particularly relevant to deodorants, shampoos, aftershave, toothpaste, soap - which all of us here today use on a daily basis.
The subject we are dealing with today, namely the issue of whether animals should be made to suffer for the sake of these products, is of concern to all of us irrespective of gender.
It is obvious that lipsticks and anti-wrinkle creams are always particularly useful for making points and adding emphasis.
I thank you for your support.
The past years have seen us working very closely together, which has involved the blurring of group boundaries.
We had elections in my country on Sunday, and election campaigns tend to polarise in order to emphasise differences.
Perhaps I should do that better in this House, but I am unable to.
I can only thank my fellow Members from other groups for their help and support, notably Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen, who, along with Mrs Flemming, is doing most of the PPE group's work on this issue; I could not, in fact, ask for greater support from an opposing group.
In this area, we are guided by the facts.
But what I must also say, addressing the other Members here, is that we have always reached compromises.
We have sought compromise among ourselves, a point I make for the benefit of, among others, Mr BerniÃ©, who is perhaps not yet fully convinced, but has not yet been in Parliament that long, and is not so long-acquainted with the subject.
Of course we are considering the industry's interests.
Of course we said, as long ago as 1993, that the industry still had almost ten years.
Even now, with the seventh amendment, a legal amendment, under discussion in the conciliation procedure at this moment, we are reiterating that the industry, once this legislation is adopted, will have five years to go before there is an absolute ban on animal experiments and a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals - and then another five years for certain special tests, the development of alternatives to which we can assume will take even longer.
How more accommodating can one be?
Of course, there have to be incentives for the industry and a certain amount of pressure still has to be exerted to get money invested in finding alternatives, as otherwise the money will be paid out only to the directors when we believe it could also be invested in science.
I will now again address the Commission, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and the ladies and gentlemen from the Industry Directorate-General, who are at the moment engaged in conversation but doubtless have an idea of what I want to say to them.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said earlier, in a response that certainly cannot have been easy for her, that the Commission is trying to get the best result.
If you are really trying to get the best result, then there are two things you have to do. For a start, you should tell Mr Liikanen that he should get round to at last coming up with a proposal that might help bring about a compromise in the conciliation procedure, and that he should not block Parliament's decisions.
You will be aware that, a few months ago, Parliament, by a massive majority of nearly 500 votes, decided in favour of these marketing bans, or to put it another way, sales prohibitions for cosmetics.
To date, the Commission and Mr Liikanen's Directorate-General have been blocking them, and so I ask you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to inform Mr Liikanen, and also the new Director-General, Mr Mingasson, that France is not the only country to have a cosmetics industry, but that there are other interests to consider and that Europe has a Parliament, and he would be well-advised to accede to that Parliament's wishes.
That is what I would like, but I have not seen it happen yet.
If the Commission wants to take seriously its role as mediator in the conciliation procedure, then let it make a proposal that meets Parliament halfway.
I furthermore call on you to inform the Member States - I'm sorry, but can I point out to the gentleman from Directorate-General III that it really would be helpful if you were to let Mrs WallstrÃ¶m listen for a bit?
Yes, I am happy to wait a moment. I am capable of quite a few things, but not even I can listen to two people at once!
So I call on you to inform the Member States that the marketing ban - and please note that it is an absolute one - has been in force since 30 June 2002, and that the Member States would be well advised to be rather more amenable, rather more flexible and a bit less obstinate in the conciliation procedure.
If the Commission wants to be helpful, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, then you can tell the Member States that they have two options: one is to be helpful to the conciliation procedure, and then your cosmetics industry will get another five years added on to the five it has already got. Alternatively, you can be unhelpful and keep on blocking as you are doing at the moment, and then you will have a marketing ban dating back to 30 June.
The Commission's task is to convey that information to you.
My request to you is really very firm, and is meant in earnest, although without it being intended to have any threatening undertone, but it would poison cooperation with Parliament and do it serious damage, if you were to have recourse to this comitological measure.
It is unnecessary, and we would interpret it as an affront and as a breach of the law.
Three months after it took effect, you would again resort to a comitological measure for another two months; any person with a normal mind would find that ridiculous.
Even the Commission knows that it is ridiculous, and is trying to dupe Parliament, to create a precedent, and that is how we too see things.
That is what you have heard today.
I would be obliged to you if, having heard all the Members of this House, you would tell that to Mr Liikanen as well.
We consider it an affront to Parliament, and a breach of the law which we would punish by taking it to the Court of Justice, and I ask you to help the conciliation procedure, support Parliament, and help me and the Members of this House, whom I again thank for their support, in the conciliation procedure rather than using comitological measures to make our cooperation more difficult.
Thank you.
Mr President, it would be indeed tempting to enter into this debate.
I used to be a minister for consumer affairs so I could very well do so, but will not because my task is to represent the Commission.
This is purely a technical issue of ensuring legal clarity during the six months that the conciliation procedure is ongoing.
The Commission does not want to impinge on future decisions or the result of the conciliation procedure, but would underline that it has a responsibility to ensure the observance of rules on the free circulation of goods, the protection of public health and the respect of international rules.
We have been urged by the Legal Service to make sure that we provide legal certainty to economic operators, who must ensure that the products they put on the market are safe.
That is the aim of this postponement.
This is important because the Commission proposal also has to be retroactive in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring that products are marketed only when they fulfil the conditions laid down by Directive 76/68 and because we must also be able to require manufacturers to guarantee that the products they put on the market are not harmful to human health.
The situation is such that there are no comprehensive alternative testing methods at the moment and that is why we must ensure that there is legal certainty for these six months.
That is the background to the Commission proposal.
I have taken note of everything you have said and fortunately, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we have developed the capacity for listening to two people at the same time.
You have to do that and the advantage of listening to German is that all the verbs come at the end so that also helps!
Thank you, Commissioner, for your additional intervention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr President, Commissioner, pursuant to Rule 9(1) of our Rules of Procedure, I must first inform you that I am a farmer and as such I hold a direct interest in every aspect of the Agricultural Fund, such as this proposal for a regulation.
The Commission is proposing a reduction in the minimum number of compulsory scrutinies for commercial and industrial undertakings which have received an agricultural subsidy from the Community budget, for the disposal of agricultural surpluses from the internal market or for other purposes.
We have nothing against reducing this number, since the quality, the Community character, the selection process and the transparency of this process are, of course, significantly improved.
We have been extremely concerned to see the high level of fraud and irregularities that beset operations whose control is covered by this regulation, specifically livestock exports and subsidies for the disposal of milk products and we have expressed this view on numerous occasions.
As seen in the European butter falsification case, fraud against the financial interests of the Community is indissociable from fraud against the financial interest of the Member States, against public health and against farmers, in whose name these considerable amounts of Community monies are spent, but who are often harmed by them.
According to information published recently in the press, the number of seizures by Members States' customs services of falsified food products rose from 2 340 in 2000, to 4 106 in 2001 and Commission administrators have stated that organised crime is today focusing more on falsifying food products than on falsifying luxury articles.
We are also receiving news of glaring shortcomings in the fight being waged by the Member States against food falsification, specifically in key fields such as wine, oil, and meat and milk products.
Given these circumstances, we again insist, as we have done over the last three years, on the Commission's significantly increasing its direct action to monitor fraud and falsification in the food trade and industry.
We welcome, of course, the proposals to reform the CAP, which call into question the continuity of these intervention mechanisms, which have proven to be open invitations to fraud and falsification, being of dubious effectiveness in supporting farmers' incomes, opting instead for direct aid granted according to the area farmed and to the rural work undertaken, using criteria of sustainable development.
There cannot, of course, be effective control without transparent procedures and without democratic scrutiny by Parliament.
A few years after the scandal broke of the more than 35 thousand tonnes of butter falsified by the Camorra and disposed of in Europe and beyond by milk product companies from various Europeans countries, we have still not been told which companies were involved and what measures have been adopted against them by the European Institutions, and to prevent this type of activity.
When will this matter be finally cleared up?
What progress has been made on physical scrutinies of these high-risk products that allow us reasonably to expect that we will see no further occurrences of scandals of this scale?
I must highlight once again that the idea that only the falsification of milk products directly subsidised by Community funds can be considered to affect the financial interests of the Community is unacceptable.
If this approach is accepted, whereas farmers that exceed their production quota for cow's milk, respecting the financial interests of the Community, are heavily penalised, industrial concerns that sell milk products that are not made with milk would not be penalised, despite having a much more damaging effect on the Community's financial interests.
I also think it is important, where this regulation is concerned, to disseminate the list of commercial and industrial undertakings and the amounts with which they are subsidised by the Agricultural Fund to dispose of surpluses.
I fail to understand why any competition process to adjudicate a commercial bid for tender or even to award a scientific grant has to be public, divulging the sums and the actors involved, but when we are talking about multinationals that receive sometimes enormous sums to get rid of food products, the public does not have the right to know who is receiving funds and to what ends.
Democratising Europe and increasing the confidence of the citizens in their institutions inevitably require a more transparent attitude and equitable procedures.
We hope that due account is taken of this regulatory amendment by both the Council and the Commission because it presents a unique opportunity to overcome the obvious shortcomings in this field of protecting the Community's financial interests.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Casaca for his report, although the Commission does not agree with all aspects of it.
I should underline that the implementation by the Member States of Regulation 4045/89 is generally satisfactory.
The Commission's proposal therefore only contains technical amendments aimed at adjusting reference amounts for inflation, as was the case with the last amendment in 1994, simplifying Member States' reporting requirements and including the possibility of reducing the number of scrutinies in certain duly motivated cases.
These would be cases in which control services from more than one Member State joined forces in scrutinising international-scale companies receiving EAGGF aid.
As I have said, the implementation by the Member States of the obligations arising from this control regulation is satisfactory, but some technical amendments are called for.
Let me stress one important factor: the regulation is a control regulation and not an anti-fraud regulation.
The Commission therefore shares the opinion of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that Article 37 and not Article 280 is the most appropriate legal base.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really would like, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the work he has done.
The Commission proposal is one that I am able to welcome in its entirety, as it aims to improve the combating of fraud in the area of agriculture.
For there is one thing that must be clear to all of us, and that is that fraud harms farmers themselves.
The EAGGF guarantee is a means of financing, for example, export refunds, interventions by the various market organisations or the co-financing of supporting and other measures for the development of rural areas outside the Objective 1 regions.
As the Commissioner has already pointed out, Regulation 4045/89 deals with retrospective checking of the business records of undertakings in receipt of agricultural aid from the Community budget for EAGGF guarantees.
Thus, this Regulation is the core anti-fraud measure in the agricultural sphere.
I welcome the Commission's presentation of proposals for adapting this instrument and bringing it up to date.
Controls are important, especially in agriculture, which is a sensitive area, because the whole industry would suffer without them.
The selection criteria for the undertakings to be audited were last amended in 1994, but have not been further adapted since then.
To take an example, the annual rate of inflation has to be taken into account.
Use of risk analysis techniques is to be even further improved.
Aid payments already received, which are fixed as the threshold at which scrutiny starts, are to be raised, and administrative assistance has to be simplified.
This makes me very thankful that this will take place across all the Member States, as this will enable us to reduce the number of audits by up to 25%, which must in no way be taken as a reduction in their quality, but a more targeted selection of undertakings to be audited, and one that relates more to the risks involved.
Fraud needs to be combated in a hard-hitting and focussed way.
In future, therefore, electronic data and documents will be subjected to scrutiny, yielding data on production and on the type of produce.
Direct payments to the producer will continue to be excluded from scrutiny, as will those payments covered by the integrated administration and control system.
I would like to conclude with particular reference to the real importance of taking into account the need to create special framework conditions, based on a multi-annual approach, for this in controls and measures or rural development projects.
Mr President, first of all I welcome the report.
I think it is very timely, and it will certainly be welcomed by everyone, because most people would welcome a reduction in inspection.
However, that does not mean in any way actively encouraging lesser controls.
I happen to believe that if you are going to have real control of the finances of the European Union, it can only be best carried out at Member State level, because the Member States also have the ability to follow such controls through.
I would agree totally with the previous speaker, that the vast majority of people in the agricultural industry, be they in the manufacturing side, the factory side or indeed at the farm level, are not involved in fraud.
There will, however, always be a small number of people in any country who are prepared to abuse a system.
I think that in Europe we must be more specialised in what we try to do, we must be clearer and more specific in our targeting of inspections as regards the areas we inspect, because in many Member States there is no doubt that some European money is not spent very wisely, and could be much better spent.
I welcome the fact that the threshold is to be increased.
I think it is timely and I return to my point - I still believe that the majority of contacts should be left to the Member States and that we in Europe should be more specific and more targeted in the areas that we want to see inspected.
No one, I repeat, wants to encourage fraud; certainly we in this Parliament would not in any way want to encourage fraudulent acts and where they are found they must be dealt with very severely.
So, we must have good control but it must be targeted, it must be specific, it must be to the point, and it must be in areas where abuse has been found.
I certainly believe we can improve the situation, I believe this can be achieved, and I believe it can be done by targeting particular areas which we consider to be the most vulnerable.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group, I wish to thank Mr Casaca for this report and also make it abundantly clear that we support him, even on those points where the Commission thinks it can make distinctions between control measures and anti-fraud measures.
According to your institution's information, losses of EUR 430 million were sustained in this area last year, which means that it is not we who suffered, but those sitting up there - the taxpayers of this European Union of ours.
When we talk about how we should reform agricultural policy in Europe, as the Commission recently proposed, in order thereby to bring agricultural policy closer to the public, and in this case, closer to the taxpayers - something to which Mrs Schierhuber, a farmer herself, referred, and on which point I wish to give her my support - we have to distance ourselves from such quibbles about what is control, and what is directed against fraud.
It is therefore my view that the Commission would have been well-advised to follow our thinking, which is that of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and, in the final analysis, give these measures the legal basis of the protection of the Community's financial interests.
We have already given some thought to how we could put a stop to export refunds, especially in the area of live cattle exports.
The images we see of Mediterranean harbours, which our young people get to see, are far from being an advertisement for this agricultural policy and far from being an advertisement for the European Union.
That is something we have to do away with, and there have been amendments on the subject tabled by this House in this Budget.
Let me say loud and clear that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission has given us no support.
The amendments will be back, and we can then expect more cooperation in the future, for, in this Parliament, which makes it its business to monitor the budget, we are well aware that this system of export refunds cannot be made immune to fraud.
On the contrary, such a thing is impossible.
The system of agricultural export refunds as currently practised is an invitation to fraud.
That is a challenge, and I see the debate on the choice between Article 37 or Article 280 from the Treaties as purely academic.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, we, who talk more to the people who live alongside us, eat and drink with us and pay us taxes, cannot afford that for the future.
Here the wholehearted support for our rapporteur and for his report.
Thank you, Mr President.
I should also like to congratulate Mr Casaca on behalf of my group.
I share his relentless ambition to improve agricultural controls.
If this policy is already controversial, and European agricultural policy is controversial, then we must in any event ensure that the money is well spent.
What is the essence of the Commission's proposal?
It aims to reduce the number of controls, but to improve them at the same time.
We hope that the latter is the case, but everything is yet to be proven, of course.
We will be closely monitoring this process, something that I support.
The proof will be in the pudding.
You will be given the benefit of the doubt, but I hope that your premises are indeed genuine.
Something which Parliament has always asked for are margins of error for the individual sectors of the budget, and this also applies to the agricultural budget.
How great is the margin of error in the dairy sector, for example?
How much is it in the cereal sector, or the tobacco sector?
The big question is whether you are able to supply these figures by means of this other system, because based on the Commission's new system of accounting, we expect that these figures will be available in due course.
The Court of Auditors has said that it will not be able to do this.
We would therefore ask the Commission to indicate, more or less on an annual basis, what the estimated margin of error and the estimated improvement will be.
This will enable us to assess improvements in the Commission's control procedures.
One subject that has not been touched upon, not even in the Commission proposal, is that we have noticed an increasing emphasis on rural policy in Commissioner Fischler's proposals.
Funding for rural policy is subject to good agricultural practices, which is excellent, and we must incorporate the environment and similar issues in this.
However, what exactly are good agricultural practices?
My guess is that good agricultural practices in Sweden may on the whole be different from good agricultural practices in the Netherlands, or Portugal, or Greece, or wherever. This is the essence.
What is considered normal in one country is still not normal in another country.
My final comment concerns Amendment No 10 pertaining to the publication of all data on the various destinations of agricultural funds.
I agree with this in principle, but as far as I know, this does not apply to any of the other subsections of the budget.
This is why we will be keeping our powder dry for the time being and will not be voting for this amendment at this stage.
Mr President, like my colleagues, I endorse the Commission proposal that has been tightened up by Mr Casaca.
As we have grown accustomed from Mr Casaca, it is a very sound report with good recommendations, and I regret that the Commission is unable to indicate that it will be adopting all of Mr Casaca's proposals, certainly in the light of the wide support which these proposals are enjoying from the Committee on Budgetary Control.
One of the aspects involved is the legal basis of this proposal.
As is generally known, we take the view that this should be Article 280 because it is essentially about the good management of EU funding.
This is not about giving in to the agricultural lobby for the umpteenth time.
In a way, the agricultural subsidies are, in fact, the EU's best kept secret.
We know that a great deal goes wrong.
Only last week, it transpired from the Court of Auditors' report that subsidies for oilseeds are being misused on a large scale, and yet, little seems to be done about it.
It is absolutely essential that we should make these flows of funds transparent.
Indeed, not a great deal of aid lands with the small farmers for whom it is intended, but ends up instead with large multinationals, as Mr Casaca has already explained.
Yet, it is not possible to make this data public.
The VVD and CDA in the Liberal and Christian-Democratic groups - that are, incidentally well represented in this debate today - are opposed to making these public.
Why?
Fear of public access?
Mrs Maij-Weggen was this Parliament's rapporteur who spoke in favour of public access to documents.
The Liberal group has always set great store by public access.
So that cannot be the stumbling block.
Could other elements be at play, such as self-interest and looking after the group's supporters?
Or a reluctance to make the flows of funds transparent because that would clearly demonstrate the need for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy?
I am afraid that this is the case.
I also regret that Mr Mulder is unable to support Amendment No 10 by Mr Casaca about making the flow of funds known, giving the excuse - for it is nothing but an excuse - that anything that does not apply to other areas of policy should not apply to agriculture either.
Mr Mulder constantly hides behind this argument.
He has done this for the past couple of years, and this is not the way forward, certainly not given the fact that the agricultural budget accounts for half of the European budget.
This problem will become more pressing following enlargement.
Even more businesses will join, and it is then even more important that we know where the money ends up.
Agricultural policy has taken on undesirable forms over the past few years.
Subsidies do not end up with those for whom they are intended.
An example of this, which was quoted only this summer, is the fact that even the Dutch Queen receives subsidies for creating an olive tree plantation in Italy.
If there is somebody in Europe who does not need this money, then surely it is one of the world's richest women. And this is going on while rural policy in Groningen in the Netherlands, for example, has insufficient funding to help small farmers keep their heads above water.
This proves that this policy has got out of hand and that we must inject transparency into the flow of funding.
This could, in turn, serve as a basis for a thorough reform even before the new Member States join.
For this is desperately needed.
Mr Casaca's report is a first step in this direction.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Paulo Casaca, on the quality of the work that he has submitted for our consideration, but especially on the rigorous work he has undertaken as a Member of this Parliament on accounting transparency and Community procedures.
I, like the rapporteur, acknowledge that the Commission proposal is acceptable, because it undoubtedly represents a significant increase in the quality of Community controls and procedures and demonstrates that the Commission is already committed to this procedure.
The monitoring of expenditure and of all Community funding procedures is indissolubly linked to greater transparency and equity.
It is, therefore, in these fields that the Commission and Parliament must focus their main concerns.
We are all aware of the quantity and the scale of fraud that has been perpetrated - despite the existing monitoring system - and therefore nothing that we can do to improve the system will be cost-free or dispensable.
The Commission in particular and the European Union in general can only gain by disseminating all available information to the citizens and primarily by the public's understanding of the relationship between the main beneficiaries of common funding policies.
We look forward to seeing whether the promises made by the Commissioner responsible for agriculture in this field can be fulfilled in the short term.
I also wish to endorse the rapporteur's proposal aiming to change the legal basis from Article 37 to Article 280 of the Treaty.
This would be a major change, of great significance, which would attach the utmost priority to protecting the Community's financial interests.
I should like, finally, to remind you that fairness in international trade is an incalculable asset in the medium term and, above all, that there are no isolated or unconnected economic sectors.
The potential harm to third countries arising from protectionist policies or the absence of transparency in procedures or in the implementation of rules will eventually be suffered by those who make this form of behaviour the norm for intervention.
It is absolutely crucial that the proclaimed reform of the CAP can incorporate these and other principles.
As there is plenty of time before the vote, I intend to apply the catch-the-eye system so that Members not on the list of speakers can take the floor.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to thank all my fellow Members who have been kind enough to refer to the work that we have produced in this field and I should like to say that, on this matter, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, in fact, worked extremely well.
We have all shared the same vision, which essentially we all hold with regard to the need to protect our financial interests, and we have produced a piece of work that is essentially collective.
Having said this, I should also like to thank the Commissioner for the attention that she has paid to this report, but I must say, Commissioner, that your intervention raised some questions that I think are absolutely crucial to clarify.
And, with the permission of the President, I should like to ask you four very specific questions highlighted by this report:
Firstly, the Commissioner tells us that Article 280 only concerns fraud and that this regulation is about scrutiny.
Commissioner, this is not the first time that I have heard the Commission say this, but I am tempted to say that perhaps the Commission needs to take a closer look at Article 280.
Because, and to translate freely from the English version, the first paragraph of this very Article states that 'the Community and the Member States shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community'.
It is quite clear, therefore, from the wording of Article 280 that we are not only dealing with fraud but with all and any illegal activity that threatens the financial interests of the Community.
It is, therefore, perfectly clear that this regulation falls entirely within the scope of this protection, and I must say that the overwhelming majority of processes to recover money undertaken by the Community are done carried out under this regulation.
I would say that perhaps around three-quarters of these processes and three-quarters of the appropriations recovered fall under this regulation.
How, then, can the Commission say something like this - that this has nothing to do with Article 280, when this regulation is a straightforward transcription of what is laid down in Article 280?
Secondly, the Commissioner says that the performance of this regulation has been satisfactory.
As has already been said, I do not believe we can look at this regulation in isolation from the other regulations and from the entire legal structure intended to protect the financial interests of the Community.
From this point of view, I only wish to point out once again the scandal that I have already mentioned; the scandal of the butter falsified by the Camorra of Naples and which had the cooperation of major European milk-product undertakings in almost all large European countries.
This is a scandal that started in 1995, that involved at least 35 thousand tonnes of falsified butter, and which was only stopped in the year 2000, in other words, 35 thousand tonnes of butter were falsified over five years, involving large undertakings in France, Germany, Belgium and probably in other countries.
And not once did this regulation enable the Commission to understand the first thing about this falsification of butter.
A local investigation had to be conducted by the Italian police in Naples for this scandal to start to be unravelled.
We are now in 2002, and we still do not know which undertakings are involved and what the Commission intends to do to these undertakings.
And the Commissioner thinks that this is satisfactory.
Please forgive me for saying so, but this is not satisfactory.
I do not think it is satisfactory that food falsification has almost doubled between the year 2000 and 2001, which is, for example, another figure that has appeared in the press and which has not, so far, been denied by the Commission.
This, as far as I am concerned, is not satisfactory;
Thirdly, Commissioner, we have the issue of transparency.
I have heard the Commissioner call for transparency - and rightly so - in the most varied circumstances.
In these circumstances, however, I do not understand why it is that when we reach this point, the Commission and, therefore, also the Commissioner, are no longer calling for transparency.
How is it possible that we can go onto the Internet and see who is applying for grants funded by the Community science Programme, for example, and who has received these grants, but we cannot find out which multinationals receive millions and millions of euros to export European food surpluses or to dispose of them on the internal market?
Why is this a State secret?
Why is the Commission not telling us which undertakings these are?
How much are they receiving?
For what purpose?
What aspect of this needs to remain secret?
And here, as our fellow Members have already said, and quite rightly so, our problem is not just with the Commission, but also with our fellow Members from the PPE and the Liberals, who have also hitherto refused to accept that this rule, which I believe is fundamentally transparent, is included in the regulation;
Lastly, Commissioner, I have a question to ask you about the definition of the protection of the Community's financial interests.
Because this definition has been made in the following way: the falsification of milk products is only considered to be a problem for the Community if the perpetrators are in receipt of a Community subsidy.
In other words, if they do not receive this subsidy, it is no longer an issue for the Community.
This is completely absurd, Commissioner, for the following reasons: milk producers exceed their reference quantity - in other words, they are producing milk - and this milk has not been subsidised - the Community allows the industry that buys their milk to immediately enforce preventive retention, in other words, even before a quota surplus is observed, a preventive retention of money is made to pay a fine on the quota.
In other words, even if these farmers have committed no offence, have not even increased their milk production, money is nonetheless taken from them.
This is what is happening to milk producers.
If we have an undertaking that is producing 'fake' milk products, in other words, that is making butter without milk, that is making butter with a huge variety of things that should never be used in any food product; totally artificial things, then the Community says the following: well, this is not our problem unless Community export subsidies have been received.
This makes no sense at all!
This is the Community doctrine, however, and has been the doctrine advocated in the Committee on Budgetary Control, year after year, and is still being advocated.
I cannot accept this, Commissioner!
I would like you also to explain to us clearly why the Commission is adopting this attitude, because I cannot explain it to anyone!
I cannot go to the farmers of the region that I represent here and tell them something like this, because there is no possible explanation for this and therefore I should like the Commission to clearly explain the reason for this incongruity.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their interesting speeches - I have learned a lot of new things, including about the equal treatment of the Belgian Queen, and olive growing.
Mr Casaca was right to express concerns about irregularities.
I would like to point out that Regulation 4045/89 scrutiny results in a high number of irregularities being reported to OLAF, and also in the identification of and follow-up to cases, to which Mr Casaca referred.
This is very important.
I should like to make clear the Commission position on some of the amendments and I will also try to answer Mr Casaca's four questions.
The first one concerns the legal basis.
I have three points to make.
Firstly, Regulation 4045/89 is a control regulation and not an anti-fraud regulation.
Therefore, Article 37 is the most appropriate legal basis.
Secondly, these are technical amendments and there is no justification for making substantive changes at this point.
Thirdly, the opinion of Mr Casaca's own committee - the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - based on the advice of Parliament's Legal Service, was that Article 37 was the most appropriate legal basis.
It is very important for all those involved that a distinction is made between control and anti-fraud.
That is why the Commission rejects this amendment on the legal basis.
Amendments 2, 3 and 4 expand on or slightly strengthen the existing provisions and are acceptable to the Commission.
Concerning Amendment 5, I have to stress that, as Member States are already required to send the Commission a list of beneficiaries, this part of the amendment is unnecessary.
The methods used by the Member States to calculate the minimum number of scrutinies have been checked by Commission services and found to be satisfactory.
That is why the Commission rejects this amendment.
We can accept Amendment 6, even though it seems to be superfluous.
Amendment 7 exceeds the nature of a technical amendment, would mark a major change in the relations between Member States and could also have major legal effects.
The Commission is not opposed to the amendment in itself but, in view of the legal and political issues, it is a question that needs to be taken up at horizontal level, and that is why the Commission rejects it.
On Amendments 8 and 9, the Committee on Budgetary Control wants Commission staff to carry out a certain number of controls each year, one in each Member State, plus one multinational control.
In allocating its control efforts, the Commission makes use of risk analysis.
This approach has been demanded and supported by the European Court of Auditors and Parliament.
These Amendments 8 and 9 would drastically limit the effectiveness of any risk analysis because of the amount of work that would have to be done every year.
DG Agriculture's audit services are responsible for the control of many measures, and to oblige them to carry out all the controls required by these amendments - whether they are high risk or not - is not an acceptable approach.
Furthermore, some Member States have one control service, others have several, and difficulties may be identified in some but not in others.
However, Amendment 8 requires one control per Member State per year whatever the circumstances: this does not take account of the risks identified and will mean scarce resources also being used on low-risk controls.
If Parliament insists on diverting from this professional audit approach, then it would also effectively be requiring the Commission to commit additional budgetary means to recruit the necessary staff.
Finally, the amendment by Mr Cunha aimed at publishing the list of beneficiaries, to which Mr Casaca referred.
The Commission promotes openness and transparency but does not think that this is a wise proposal.
The programme may be decided up to 12 months before the beginning of some scrutinies, and giving a beneficiary 12 months' notice of a control cannot be good control practice.
In any event, Regulation 4045/89 forbids the use of nominative data in this way.
I understand that there is also a volume question that has to do with the practicality of giving out some of the information in a meaningful way.
That is why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission.
With regard to the specific case concerning butter, I cannot supply all the details on that.
However, I would ask you to send the Commission a written question on this case.
We could then update you on what actions have been taken.
We will have to come back to the other more general political questions, because I would like to restrict my comments to the proposal before us.
Mr President, as we have a bit more time today, I would like to avail myself of the opportunity you mentioned earlier.
Here is a Commission proposal, one that has been the subject of wide public discussion in Europe, on how the agricultural policy should be reformed.
We are now telling you, Commissioner, which strands of the agricultural policy the Budget Control Committee believes should be changed.
Its arguments are well known.
The question of the legal basis - about Article 37 or Article 280, as proposed by us - is of course not just an academic one.
It is about how public the area of agricultural policy should become.
Is Parliament really on board, or is it not?
It is about all these things.
That is what we want, and we owe it to our citizens.
When I said earlier that our present systems of export refunds cannot be made proof against fraud, you on the Commission ought really to have pricked up your ears, if you are really serious about protecting the tax revenues that we raise in the Member States.
No reaction on the part of the Commission reaches my ears - on the contrary.
Looking at the preliminary draft budget for the coming year, we find one particularly sensitive area, one I have mentioned before, namely the subsidies for exports of live animals, specifically cattle.
On that, I must say that our budget is so lacking in transparency that Parliament first has to coax these export refunds, which do not even have a credit line of their own, out of it!
Commissioner, we will try to get one in the 2003 budget year, so that we can get a slightly clearer view of things.
Let us get back to our cattle. I see that the figures for these next year are bigger than those for this year, adding up to a policy precisely contrary to what we actually wanted - down with export refunds, especially where live animals are tormented in the way they were in the past, and where the Commission is not in a position to guarantee the correct implementation of what the directives contain on the subject.
In today's budget, Commissioner, we already have an agreement between the Finance Ministers and Parliament to the effect that the Commission will, by 31 May, present a report on the proper implementation of the Animal Transport Directives in the Member States and the number of sanctions eventually imposed by the Commission on those Member States that may have contravened them.
As yet, nothing has been put on the table - nothing!
How are we to get to grips with the issue if you simply refuse to do anything?
We will bring this issue up again.
I would be very happy if we could leave this debate at least with the certainty that we would soon have your institution's report on the table.
To repeat: the policy you are at present pursuing runs directly counter to our own interests.
You are increasing export refunds, at any rate for cattle.
You cannot, then, shuffle off onto anyone else the responsibility for the unspeakable torments inflicted on the live animals that we are exporting to the Middle East.
You yourselves must shoulder that responsibility, and if you think that controls in the Member States are in fact satisfactory on the whole, then I will repeat that last year's irregularities and frauds amounted to EUR 430 million.
I do not know how our fellow-citizens of the EU understand your utterances on the subject.
Finally, I was not in Johannesburg, and so I do not know whether you also represented us, but, Commissioner, was it not made clear to us there, all the time, that export refunds of this sort, this kind of agricultural policy, this type of subsidy, ends up making a massive contribution to the great misery to be found in many parts of the world?
Oh yes, we will find room in our budget for some sort of aid, for handouts of some kind, but what I have said is a fact, and you are at present engaged in a policy contrary to the interests of these countries and, above all, against those of Europe's taxpayers.
Please do not let these announcements be the end of the matter.
You may well have had the opportunity today to show your goodwill with a few small steps closer to what Parliament is proposing, but - and not only with regard to transparency - you have failed to do so, preferring to hide yourselves behind this or that paragraph.
We, who seek re-election by our fellow-citizens, cannot do that.
That is why we have to counter your conception of agricultural policy with our own.
Mr President, since we are all having a go at the common agricultural policy, I too would like to state a few facts in relation to it.
In the UK this weekend there was a huge rally - Liberty and Livelihood - where thousands of people gathered in London to protest at various problems relating to the countryside.
What this rally did not put across, however, was the way that the countryside is massively subsidised.
Agriculture in particular is very heavily subsidised compared to every other industry in the European Union.
When we see 40% of the EU budget going to 5% of the EU population then the policy is clearly in need of radical reform.
It seems strange to me, however, that within this reform process two areas are not being touched upon.
These are the scandal of the EU sugar market, where extortionate prices throughout the EU enable people to take advantage of what I believe to be a very corrupt regime, and also the scandal of the tobacco industry, the existence of which people are bound to feel is an absolute contradiction at a time when the European Union is also trying to promote health initiatives.
These are key areas.
But the most important issue here today is transparency.
Why is it that, while I can go to a website and find out where every single euro in relation to regional policy and Structural Funds is paid out in my area, I cannot do the same in relation to the common agricultural policy?
That possibility does not exist and it is a possibility I want to see created.
That is the relationship the taxpayers of Europe need to have with the recipients of this funding: in that way perhaps we will be able to see how much Prince Charles, the Queen and the rest of the royal family receive in relation to subsidies granted under the common agricultural policy.
We need to crack this open.
It is crucial that we get the support of the people who call repeatedly in this House for transparency.
That is what we are asking for.
The Commission needs to cooperate much more closely with Member States across the whole of the European Union to ensure that this is the case.
Agricultural subsidies make up a huge proportion of the European budget.
This is a fact.
For 20 years, I have been hearing that this proportion should be reduced, but this is an extremely slow process.
As an MEP, it fills me with great sadness and I am extremely disappointed about the fact that Parliament still has no grip on the situation.
When Mr Casaca then tries - at least based on the authority which we clearly have, which is a budgetary authority - to gain an overview of the whole subsidy scheme, we do not exactly receive satisfactory feedback from you.
It appears that you, as Commissioner, allow yourself to be fobbed off with what is being whispered into your ear by the bureaucrats who have accompanied you for so many years and who have for so long denied Parliament any direct input.
After all, we want to gain a grip on agricultural policy, the export subsidies, and the way in which these subsidies are distributed.
We would like to see an end to the exploitation of the developing countries.
I fully concur with what Mr BÃ¶sch and Mrs Morgan said on this subject.
When I was in Johannesburg, I was ashamed when I saw how, with our subsidies, we sound the death knell for a number of countries that have few resources to survive.
There are a few countries that only have sugar to export, and we have managed to hold on to these wretched subsidies that we grant to our sugar barons thanks to our Member States.
Parliament has decided in the Committee on Development and Cooperation that this should stop.
However, an amendment has crept in surreptitiously, upon which the plenary has yet again voted to maintain the agricultural subsidies for sugar.
There are innumerable examples quoted here.
As democratic representatives of our citizens, we would like a grip on these subsidies.
Similarly, I fail to obtain an explanation for the way in which Europe manages to distribute unnecessary and harmful subsidies, while we are actually committed to solidarity with the developing world.
I recently visited Botswana, where, apart from diamonds, they only have a few cattle to export.
We concluded an agreement in this respect.
There are so many African countries that wish to trade fairly with us, yet we still fail to create the opportunities for this.
Finally, I should like to point out that with regard to agricultural subsidies, export subsidies for live animals too are a disgrace and unacceptable to our public opinion.
I am appalled to find out that you intend to increase these.
Surely that is impossible.
I should therefore like to concur with our fellow MEPs in their plea.
I myself was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control for a while, and I have great respect for my fellow MEPs and for their reports.
I always read the reports with great interest, but I would finally like to see some change.
In the final analysis, we are not here to keep the show on the road; we are here to create justice.
Mr President, I do not want to discuss what has been said.
I am just very glad that I came into the Chamber early in order to do some work in peace and quiet, and then witnessed an interesting debate.
I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on permitting it and making it possible, and on giving your colleagues in the Bureau a good example to follow in the future.
What a pity so few Members were here, but perhaps more will turn up in the Chamber when word gets around.
Thank you, Mr Swoboda for your kind words.
I can assure you and the rest of the House that the Bureau as a whole is making an effort, now that the Rules of Procedure have changed, to ensure that debates in Plenary are exactly as you said.
This is a policy of the Bureau as a whole and I think that, as we have just seen, we can make debates in Plenary even better than they have been in the past.
Mr President, following on from Mr Swoboda's excellent suggestion perhaps this could be taken on board in the context of the whole debate about the catch-the-eye procedure.
We have a debate this afternoon on the budget where catch-the-eye is to be applied.
Perhaps the Bureau and the Council of Presidents could also consider the possibility of formalising the rule so that every debate that ends before the time allocated to it then finishes with a period of catch-the-eye.
I agree with Mr Swoboda that it is an excellent innovation.
It adds to the liveliness of the debate and it also means that the people in the public gallery have something to watch and to listen to in the last half hour, rather than having to face an empty Chamber.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
May I assure you and the rest of the House that your comments will be passed on to the Bureau verbatim.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed for the vote)
The next item is the vote.
Mr President, might I just ask you to give the floor to our Committee's rapporteur on this area, so he can say a few words on this report?
The rapporteur is Mr Mulder.
Mr Mulder I will give the floor exceptionally to you because I understand you have been carrying out the work on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee.
Mr President, Parliament is not always able to congratulate the Commission, but I should like to do so on this occasion.
Agricultural policy in the EU is controversial and if that is the case, for whatever reason, we must, above all, ensure that there is a sound mechanism to control the expenditure of the funds.
So far, the Commission has been able to inspect these funds two years following closure of the accounts.
Last year, Parliament proposed in a resolution to extend this period to 36 months.
The Commission followed this up promptly, for which I should like to give it credit.
At this stage, we can only hope that the Council meets Parliament's and the Commission's wish to improve control on agricultural expenditure.
Mr President, in June last year, we debated the First Reading of a Commission proposal on the regulation on structural business statistics, in order to add to it two sectoral annexes, one of which relates to credit institutions and the other to pension funds and, at the same time, to extend the scope of the regulation to other financial institutions, pension funds and credit and insurance auxiliaries.
Finally, two new items relating to the environment are included in the statistics on industrial firms.
Structural business statistics on credit institutions, pension funds and other businesses in the financial services sector are necessary in order to evaluate the single financial market, back up macroeconomic statistics and keep the stability of the EU's financial system under observation.
Data on industry's expenditure on the protection of the environment are an important tool for policymakers in assessing the cost of adherence to environmental law, including its effect on businesses' competitiveness, and checking whether the polluter-pays principle is being adhered to.
Following the first reading, I, as rapporteur, made contact in July 2001 with the then new presidency of the Council in the hope of an early Common Position from the Council, but this turned out to be over-ambitious.
The Belgians appeared to have forgotten us, and the Common Position eventually turned up towards the end of the Spanish Presidency.
I am glad that, despite what we term the summer recess, Parliament has allowed me to present my report for Second Reading just three months later.
I can sympathise with those Member States who have problems with submitting definite data on pension funds, but the Council has accepted four amendments by us, and I propose that this House should vote in favour of it.
Mr President, I am sorry that Members are getting a bit nervous, but I consider it important, in view of our strange new Rules of Procedure, that I should say what this is all about.
It is certainly not technical!
Economic and monetary union has been a reality in the eurozone since 1999, and what the Commission is now putting before us is an attempt at getting better statistics, to prevent the European Central Bank from making the wrong decisions on the basis of inadequate and bad ones.
The draft regulation before us aims to improve the quality of these statistics, firstly by cutting the time period for the transmission of the main aggregates of the quarterly national accounts from four months to seventy days; secondly, by suspending various derogations granted to the Member States; and thirdly by having the employment data transmitted in one unit, namely the hours worked.
These changes are necessary if we are to have the most exact statistics on GDP at our disposal without delay.
The banks' economists have been warning for years that inadequate economic statistics could result in mistakes being made in monetary policy.
Mr Eugenio Domingo Solans, a member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, told a German newspaper that there had to be statistics relevant to the Euro area.
It is in the interests of decision-makers in European business, of the financial markets, and, finally, of the citizens of the Economic and Monetary Union.
There is still much to do, though.
Nowadays, for example, the Commission is compelled to use incomplete data when drawing up the initial estimates of GDP for the eurozone and the EU, which could well undermine the reliability of these indicators and have a detrimental effect on the financial markets and, especially, on the central banks, and Mr ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, this report is concerned with N1 vehicles which is Commission jargon for vans.
This is of interest to that most notorious of British drivers - white van man!
White van man, as we know in the UK, is a person who despite being in a Ford Transit van thinks he is Michael Schumacher.
I know that this is a uniquely British thing, as here on the continent - and particularly in Italy - every driver thinks he is Michael Schumacher.
This report is largely technical and concerns how we test the CO2 produced from these vehicles.
I have managed to secure exemptions for small manufacturers of specialist vehicles, in particular ambulances, and have also introduced the concept of families of vehicles in order to group together the thousands of vehicles produced in different derivatives.
N1 vehicles are important to all of us because you are likely to make your last-but-one journey in an N1 vehicle i.e. an ambulance.
But you will also be pleased to know I have secured an exemption for the vehicle you will make your last journey in, because hearses are also to be exempted from this directive.
It gives me great pleasure, as a fellow Scot, to welcome to the European Parliament Sir David Steel, President of the Scottish Parliament, who has taken his seat in the distinguished visitors' gallery.
Sir David will be holding a number of meetings in Parliament and will be observing the proceedings.
You are most welcome to this House, Sir David, and we would like to wish you a pleasant and fruitful stay.
Mr President, I cannot disguise my disappointment that the report has just been rejected.
I would say to those who voted against it and to the members of the PPE-DE Group that I hope they realise they have just voted against greater cooperation in matters of asylum in the European Union; they have voted against sharing best practice in measures as we move towards a common asylum policy; they have voted against looking at good ideas and sharing those ideas ...
(Applause from the left)
They have voted against measures to make certain that we are absolutely clear that people do not abuse the asylum system for terrorist purposes.
Those are the things we were looking at and it has been rejected by members of the PPE-DE Group.
That is a disappointment for this House.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
(Applause from the left)
I do not want to start a debate.
Mr Ribeiro, can I ask what your point of order is and perhaps you could tell us under which Rule you are making it?
Mr President, I wish to use this point of order to draw attention to this highly irregular procedure, which demonstrates merely what it is to be a bad loser following a vote.
This intervention should have been made, at the latest, at the time of the explanations of vote and not now.
To my mind, this is a most irregular procedure.
.
(DE) The Commission proposal for facilitating more extensive financial corrections is to be welcomed.
The accumulated fraud with EU funds gives cause for concern, as do a number of situations in the institutions - I wish briefly to refer here to the Court of Auditors' most recent special report on the support system for oilseeds.
These matters call for more effective action than has hitherto been the case.
The Commission proposal for increasing, by means of an extended time period, the possibilities for recovering amounts lost, is a step in the right direction.
The Freedom Party delegation has therefore voted in favour of the report.
The reason why we are not opposed to this draft text is so that workers who so desire can leave employment before retirement age.
Several aspects of the draft text are, nonetheless, unacceptable.
It is unacceptable, first and foremost, that job cuts are not being made on a voluntary basis and that all those who so desire cannot benefit from being released from their duties.
What is equally unacceptable is that 600 officials are being encouraged to retire, whilst only 273 are being taken on.
This means there will be additional work for those who remain, whereas the report acknowledges that 1 254 positions need to be filled.
And, if the institutions are planning to compensate for the lack of employees by increasing job insecurity and sub-contracting - which is often one and the same thing - this is no better.
All this is unacceptable in a context of unemployment and job insecurity.
Therefore, whilst we are not opposed to the draft text, we did not wish to give it our backing and we abstained from the vote.
I voted for the Bakopoulos report to ensure our seas are safe and that ship pollution is prevented.
I endorse the proposal to establish a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships as it takes on board many of Parliament's proposals.
The new committee will establish greater transparency, implement Community policies more coherently, reduce bureaucracy and minimise costs.
Water transport is the poor transport relation.
If the Commission is intent upon developing 'motorways of the sea,' promoting sea transport and establishing shipping links as part of the trans-European network, sea-faring countries such Ireland must be given equal treatment.
The European fleet has shrunk.
Fewer people want to become seafarers.
The EU has lost 40% of its sailors.
By 2006 the EU will need 36,000 sailors.
Ships carry over 70% of all trade between the Community and the rest of the world.
Each year two billion tonnes of different goods pass through European ports.
Short-sea shipping carries 41% of goods traffic within the Community.
Sea transport is operating below capacity.
It can offer a real alternative to land transport.
. (PT) Because Portugal, and more precisely the coasts of the Algarve, have already suffered unprecedented maritime pollution, I can only agree with the recommendation by the rapporteur, Mr Bakopoulos, with all the European Commission initiatives that aim to improve legislative standards applicable to maritime safety and to the prevention of pollution by ships, and with making the implementation of European policy in this field more effective.
