Aung San Suu Kyi has asked for sanctions but we have done absolutely nothing about this.
Even the United States has at least halted new investment.
Why is the European Union not ensuring that sanctions are imposed?
We have to do everything we can to try and stop the forced labour and the human rights abuses.
As the resolution says, we should discourage any kind of tourism to Burma.
That should be supported.
Mr President, I agree with many of the comments that have been made so far by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Maij-Weggen on the situation in Burma.
However I would also like to refer to the specific case of a constituent of mine, which provides a good example of the brutality of the present Burmese authorities.
In September 1999, James Mawdsley, from the north-east of England was sentenced to 17 years' solitary confinement in a Burmese prison.
His mother is currently travelling to Burma hoping to see him.
His crime, according to the Burmese authorities, was to enter the country and attempt to draw attention to the human rights abuses taking place there.
The charges against him were trumped up.
For example, he was alleged to have entered the country illegally and yet British embassy staff have seen his passport, which is stamped with a Burmese immigration stamp showing that he had arrived completely legally.
British Government ministers and staff have been making constant efforts to draw the attention of the Burmese authorities to his plight, but with no success.
I ask Parliament and the Commission to do all they possibly can to secure his release.
Mr President, I would like to make it clear that the fact that Iran has been replaced by Burma in the debate on human rights does not mean that my group is not deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran.
We will continue to concern ourselves with that situation.
However, the current situation and the scandalous decisions being taken by the Burmese military Government and their appalling behaviour simply make it essential for the European Parliament to take a stand on this.
We are full of respect and admiration for the non-violent action, the remarkably consistent action being taken by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and also by the members and politicians of the National League for Democracy. They have earned our unreserved respect, and we wish to assure them that they have our support and that the European Union, together with the international community, will do everything it can to help to restore human rights, or to be more accurate, to introduce human rights, democracy and also the rule of law in Burma.
We are certainly still pinning our hopes in San Suu Kyi.
Her continuing campaigns show that her voice cannot be silenced and that we in Europe, therefore, also have a duty to do everything to ensure that her voice is heard not only here in Europe, but also in America and above all in Asia.
She bears the hopes of the persecuted and the repressed, and also of the many men and women used as forced labour.
She also bears the hopes of those citizens who opted for democracy, the parliamentary system and the rule of law before 1990.
We must call on our partners, the ASEAN States, but also other states in Asia to do everything to bring about a change in this 'transitional government' as it so cynically still calls itself.
That is why I think it is right that we should take stronger economic sanctions. The EU has acted correctly here.
We now need an institutionalised dialogue, and a debate on Burma should be right at the top of the agenda of the Laos Summit, to make it clear that both ASEAN and the EU bear some responsibility for events in Burma.
Violations of human rights in Colombia, particularly the case of Fr. Brendan Forde
Mr President, this Parliament has discussed the situation in Colombia many times.
The situation in Colombia is that of a latent civil war in which, over several decades, the violence has taken on a structural nature.
This latent civil war was complicated a great deal as a result of the development of drug trafficking, with Colombia becoming a country where drugs are produced and transported to the rest of the world.
In that situation, there are various groups who use violence.
I am referring not only to the paramilitary organisations and the guerrillas, but also to the drug trafficking organisations.
At times, even military units use violence and violate human rights.
In a situation of this kind, the attempt to establish peace zones, for example through the peace communities established in the rural region of UrabÃ¡, has faced great difficulties.
In fact, recently there have been murders in these communities in UrabÃ¡, specifically in the region of La UniÃ³n.
Their leaders have had death threats, and death threats in Colombia are something to be taken very seriously, because they tend to be carried out.
There is really not very much this Parliament can do.
We of course support the efforts of the Colombian Government and other organisations to achieve peace, and we reiterate our desire and interest in the European institutions cooperating with the Colombian Government in helping to maintain peace.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Medina Ortega said, we too must reiterate the unfortunate position of the conflict in Colombia, and highlight that in the Peace Community in La UniÃ³n, in the region of UrabÃ¡, there have been three murders since 1997.
Fortunately, the Colombian Government has decided to pursue those responsible and punish them accordingly.
But the fact is that, since 1997, there have been three murders, the most recent on 8 July of this year, and the Peace Community of La UniÃ³n and the Intercongregational Committee for Justice and Peace, including the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde, have had repeated death threats, despite their position of remaining neutral and contributing to bringing peace to the area.
We think that this situation again requires the strongest possible action on the part of the European institutions.
Both the Commission and the European Parliament have a series of opportunities for this in cooperation with the United Nations Human Rights Office and also through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia.
We urge the Commission, obviously in cooperation with Parliament, to provide the Colombian Government with all our political force and capacity for pressure so that finally the desired peace can come to Colombia and these tragic situations of assassinations, deaths and murders do not happen again.
I had the honour last year of visiting this beautiful, tormented country and it is a privilege accorded to us here in the European Parliament to be able to raise our voices to defend the rights of people a great distance from here.
I also had the honour of meeting many of the human rights activists in Colombia last year.
This year we have heard in Ireland, as is obvious from the concern expressed by Irish colleagues here today, of the danger facing Father Brendan Forde, a Franciscan working in the small village of La Ãnion who has chosen to remain with his parishioners at considerable danger to his own life.
He is so isolated he probably will never hear of the debate here today.
He has to go eight miles before he can find a telephone to communicate with anybody.
For that reason, it is our privilege here to raise our voices to demand that his life and the lives of those living in his community are protected and to make sure that the Colombian Government is aware of our concerns.
Madam President, first of all I would like to express my grave disappointment at the resolution which we have before us.
My group, the Green/EFA Group, signed the amendment, but we were appalled that the amendment and the resolution does not go far enough.
They do not cover a number of serious issues like Plan Colombia and the grave human rights abuses that are taking place in the country.
It has been stated by many human rights organisations that human rights abuses by paramilitaries have the support of the armed forces and that the murder of the poor people in rural areas is as a result of this.
Most of the Colombian military forces continue to be implicated in serious human rights abuses and their aiding and abetting of paramilitary atrocities are basically ignored by the Colombian authorities.
The US State Department has consistently reported that Colombia's armed forces have taken measures to punish human rights abuses in their ranks.
Plan Colombia will result in USD 1.3 billion from the US being allocated for mainly military purposes.
Many human rights organisations believe that the plan will worsen conditions for poor rural populations and will certainly increase political violence.
It is going to irreversibly damage the people and the environment and it will not solve the drugs problem.
There was no consultation on Plan Colombia with the Colombian people, which is unacceptable.
I was in Colombia last year with NGOs and I can tell you that the situation there is really grave.
The Colombian soldiers continue to actively encourage the paramilitaries responsible for human rights violations and it is clear that the United States and Colombia have acted against the interests of the people.
I believe that this should have been part of the resolution.
The only group that wanted to address Plan Colombia and the whole human rights situation in Colombia was our own group.
That is really unfortunate and a gross abdication of our duty to people all over the world.
Mr President, when President Pastrana appeared before this Parliament he committed himself to working for peace in his country, but he forgot to mention three quite important issues.
Firstly, the high level of responsibility of the Government itself, which covers up violations of human rights, torture, kidnapping and murders committed by paramilitary groups in collusion with the army.
Secondly, that such serious problems as cocaine growing and violence can only be solved through peace talks with the FAR and the ELN.
And thirdly, that he was preparing Plan Colombia for military intervention in the area with the United States, going behind the backs of European and world opinion.
For these reasons, and given the danger represented by Plan Colombia of Latin America becoming another Vietnam, we need to act with three specific proposals.
Firstly, that any aid to Colombia from the European Union will be granted once a peace agreement has been signed between the Government, the FAR and the ELN.
Secondly, that the European Union must condemn Plan Colombia and demand that the solution to the conflict be a negotiated and peaceful one, in order to avoid this escalation of military action.
And thirdly, the European Union must demand that President Pastrana puts an end to all violations of human rights by paramilitary groups in his country, and that the sad world records of thousands of victims that are reached each year should come to an end.
Therefore, allow me to also add - as has already been said, but I think that it is worth saying it specifically - that the European Union should establish a human rights observatory in Latin America, associated with the United Nations observatory that already exists.
Because there are so many countries, but above all Colombia, that fail to guarantee respect for democracy and human rights, it is our responsibility to give adequate help to the region, which has such importance for us and for the world.
Mr President, could I say directly to Commissioner Nielson that I wrote to you on 18 August expressing my concern about the life and the plight of Father Brendan Forde, the Irish priest whose life is currently under threat in the complex political circumstances that pertain in Colombia.
Could I add to that the name of one young man born and raised in Ireland, Tristan James Murray, whose mother comes from my part of Ireland in Wexford, and his Colombian colleague, Javier Nova, young environmentalists missing since July.
We all have concerns that Plan Colombia might escalate the conflict and increase the influence of the guerrillas out there.
Please ensure that aid from the EU, and indeed American aid, is used as it should be used, not to increase the attacks by the militia against the peace communities in the name of trying to take out the guerrillas.
Father Forde is staying where he is because he is trying to protect his community.
His life has been threatened; he has been given twenty days to get out and the International Red Cross will support all we are saying about it.
We have to raise the international profile of all the people, including the communities whose lives are under threat and we trust Commissioner Nielsen you will do all you can for us.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two minutes are hardly sufficient to relate the appalling figures which describe events in Columbia.
I will mention but a few, listed in the last e-mail I received from Amnesty International: 50 civilians were killed last month by paramilitaries; 400 civilian massacres took place during 1999; 3 500 victims of police crimes; 1 000 abductions; 250 000 Colombian civilians have been thrown out of their homes for political reasons.
In addition, there has been another massacre in the rural community La UniÃ³n, the third in three years.
We have a moral obligation to declare that this massacre was perfectly planned, that, nowadays, everything that happens in Columbia happens for a reason.
So what can we do?
Wait for the next massacre in La UniÃ³n or another village to produce yet another resolution expressing our grief or, as some of the Members have suggested - and rightly so - make our voice heard, loud and clear?
In my opinion, Parliament must now find the courage to make its voice heard, for, to make reference to Amnesty International once again, all the parties taking part in the conflict are responsible for the violations of human rights in Columbia, but one of them - the paramilitaries - has a greater responsibility.
Indeed, the paramilitary groups are crushing the civilian population in a lethal vice.
As has been pointed out, President Pastrana appeared before this House and offered to make a substantial effort to bring all the parties to dialogue.
It is Parliament's responsibility to call for a system of rules and rights to be re-established, within the Colombian State, most importantly, as well as condemning the current situation in Columbia.
The paramilitaries act in agreement and in cahoots with the army, which in many cases - including this one - draw up the death lists.
To date, there has been no serious attempt to bring the heads of this alleged paramilitary army to justice - for example Carlos CastaÃ±os, who continues to broadcast his interviews on Colombian radio with impunity.
We therefore reiterate our support for a peaceful solution and, without hypocrisy, we call upon the Colombian Government to reflect upon the tragic actions of the paramilitaries. Lastly, we call upon the Commission and the Member States to employ all the appropriate political resources to preserve the security of the civilian organisations involved in upholding human rights.
Mr President, as Manolo Medina said, once again we are talking about Colombia.
In this case, in order to ask for protection for the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde and his colleagues.
However, the last time a human rights defender was assassinated in Colombia was in May.
His name was Ramiro Zapata.
25 human rights defenders have been assassinated in the past year and a half. In recent years, 3 000 activists from UniÃ³n PatriÃ³tica have died.
Luis Guillermo PÃ©rez, also a human rights defender, insists that there is a plan, called the Hundred plan, to assassinate up to one hundred human rights defenders.
I think that this is a catastrophe for Colombia.
Let us hope that this human rights defender is exaggerating. But if what he says is true, it is a catastrophe for Colombia.
I think that the European Union should have its own initiative, its own strategy, separate from any military venture, as that of the United States appears to be, in order to make life more bearable for the people of Colombia.
Mr President, once again this Parliament, which has an inescapable and irrevocable commitment to human rights in Colombia and the whole world, has to express its concern regarding the situation in that country and, specifically, the death threats received by the Irish priest Brendan Forde and his community, which we firmly reject.
The European Union, Mr President, should, in my opinion, do something more than expressing its concern, demanding the safety of its citizens and reiterating its support for the peace negotiation efforts initiated by President Pastrana with the paramilitary groups.
It is now time to move from words to actions so that we do not just carry on making purely rhetorical statements.
I would like to point out that President Pastrana was the first foreign Head of State who wished to appear before the plenary session of Parliament in this legislature.
He now needs a specific response from the European Union that shows solidarity on the three fronts that he has opened up: the process of negotiation of the armed conflict, combating drugs, which we should approach from a point of view of shared responsibility, and strengthening institutions, with a particular appeal for the defence of human rights.
I would like to recall the words of President Pastrana in this Parliament: "I believe that a decent and democratic future is not possible without a culture of respect for fundamental rights.
I know that in the course of the protracted internal conflict in Colombia these rights have suffered serious violations, and this must not continue.
I am totally committed to the defence of human rights."
The reality that is currently devastating the country is quite different, Mr President.
Therefore, I think it is important that the Commission tells us what resources it has in order for the Community to respond to this problem, because, in the draft budget for 2001, no reference is made to the response that Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez mentioned a moment ago: a genuine response from the European Union itself.
How does the Commission intend to respond, to show solidarity with the conflict that is devastating the country?
British soldiers held hostage in Sierra Leone
Mr President, unfortunately, kidnappings in Sierra Leone are once again in the news.
This time it is the kidnapping of eleven British soldiers by the West Side Boys militia.
To this we must add the attacks carried out by this group of rebels with the aim of extending their area of influence, which have cost the lives of three members of the pro-governmental forces.
These are actions that the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns and which the European Parliament should also condemn. At the same time, it should also demand the immediate and unconditional release of the soldiers who are being held hostage and show its support for the Government of Sierra Leone, and for the UNAMSIL and British army forces who are working to consolidate peace in that country.
It is still a precarious peace, which is demonstrated by this kidnapping.
That is why we cannot just stop at words of condemnation, but we must move on to action and also demand that the LomÃ© Peace Agreements are complied with and that all the militias are disarmed.
However, as long as poverty continues to rule in Sierra Leone, until the trafficking of diamonds is put to an end once and for all and the arms trade is ended, there will be no chance of peace for this tortured country.
The European Union must therefore use every means within its power, not only in order to help fund the peace process, but also, above all, in order to make it possible to establish living conditions that make peace irreversible.
We therefore need a generous and coordinated policy of development cooperation, especially in the field of education.
This is why a budgetary effort is being requested for this policy, as a policy that will contribute to ending the blight of poverty.
But, above all, we need decisive action on the part of the European Union, the Member States and the whole of the international community in order to put an end to diamond trafficking in the area.
As long as a country' s natural wealth is only benefiting warlords, that is, as long as diamonds enable the paramilitaries to have sufficient capital to provide themselves with arms and continue their activities, peace will be nothing more than an impossible dream.
Without peace, development will only be a Utopia.
Mr President, Commissioner, hearing these accounts of misery related each time we meet here in Strasbourg makes me wonder what we can actually do to help.
In Sierra Leone, not only are UN soldiers and British soldiers taken hostage, a complete nation has been held hostage for years We are accessories to this, if only through the diamond trade.
On 5 July, the Security Council instituted an embargo on diamonds from Sierra Leone.
The European Union should now pull out all the stops in order to make this embargo happen and to stop all trade in blood diamonds.
I believe that, for this reason, it is not sufficient to curb the diamond trade in Sierra Leone.
We should also continue to support the Government, but I also believe that support for the war tribunal is absolutely necessary.
We need to put an end to the immunity from punishment whereby people can use weapons to kill their fellow-citizens.
Mr President, of course I feel sympathy for the 12 British soldiers captured in Sierra Leone by one of the armed gangs plaguing the country.
They, too, are the victims of a policy whose main victim is the people of Sierra Leone.
But primarily, that policy is a result of government action, of the action of the UK Government supported by all the major western powers, especially France, and the UN.
I find it disgusting that the resolution makes no mention of the United Kingdom' s past and present role in that country.
After plundering and exploiting the region, that former colonial power rigged the elections and imposed a government that mainly represents its own interests.
Its machinations are one of the main contributing factors in a barbaric civil war in which it is implicated directly, by its diplomacy and by the naval pressure it is exerting, and indirectly by the behaviour on the ground of the troops of its former African colonies, which is just as dreadful as that of the armed gangs.
These armed gangs, including the RUF, certainly do not represent the interests of the people of Sierra Leone, in terms either of their methods or their objectives.
But, however great their responsibility for the misfortunes of their country, it does not match the cynicism of the British ministers and high dignitaries.
To conclude, we will vote against this resolution, which conceals a colonialist policy that is hardly in keeping with today' s world.
Mr President, I rather object to the efforts made earlier by the Spanish left to make political capital out of Gibraltar on the back of the tragedy of the Kursk.
HMS Tireless is safe in British territory and the repairs will be carried out to the highest safety standards.
On the subject of Sierra Leone, I further object to the statement by the previous speaker, but there is a wider point that I would like to make concerning the British Government's role.
We warned the British Labour Government months ago about the dangers of an open-ended commitment of British troops to Sierra Leone.
Our troops should have been given a clear and finite mission with a realistic exit strategy from the start.
The present unacceptable situation is a clear consequence of mission creep and political indecision and provides a clear lesson for the future.
Mr President, the situation in Sierra Leone has been the subject of our urgent debates on several occasions, and we have always dealt with it by encouraging peace talks, national reconciliation and aid for the displaced population, and by calling for an international criminal justice system that can try those responsible for the genocide that is being committed in that country.
Today, we are not faced with a merely political issue, but with a criminal act that falls under a criminal code.
We are talking about a kidnapping carried out by criminals who have no political links, either with the members of the former military junta or with any of the groups that signed the peace agreement in July 1999.
Their demands are limited to a request for a group of prisoners to be freed and for the revision of a peace agreement that is supposed to be putting back together a country that has been torn to pieces.
The victims of the kidnapping undoubtedly have a great deal of political significance.
The international presence in Sierra Leone is a good example of the perseverance on the part of the international community in seeking world peace.
Therefore, taking on that responsibility, we are in support of the European Parliament addressing the Government of Sierra Leone today and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the British soldiers who have been taken hostage.
Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq
Mr President, this is a truly distressing affair.
Possibly the most important founding principle of the European Union was peace and those who seek to join the Union must try to conduct their domestic and their foreign affairs in as peaceable a fashion as possible.
Turkey, as we appreciate, suffers from an extremely vulnerable border and it is a particular problem for it to establish the requisite stability and peaceful circumstances that its integration to Europe properly requires.
As a part of the pre-accession phase of Turkey's candidacy, we should try to establish a functional forum where military as well as civilian and economic issues should be shared between us.
Turkey's membership of NATO presents many of our Member States with a special responsibility in this respect.
The development of a common European Security and Defence Policy should be seen as a pretext, and also as a bridge, for us to reach common positions on ways to combat terrorism while respecting fundamental rights.
If we are able to succeed in creating such a practical forum, we should be able to expect that this sort of sad critical incident will be put firmly in the past.
Mr President, Turkey is one of the NATO countries and is applying to join the European Union.
It has signed all kinds of international Treaties, including those protecting human rights, banishing torture, etc. Nevertheless, Turkey continues to bomb the Kurds who live outside its borders, in northern Iraq.
Commissioner, I think we should be quite plain about this.
Matters will never improve without a clear, political and peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem, and Turkey should realise this.
I believe that stabilisation - and we at least hope that peace in the Middle East is inching nearer day by day - will only happen if a solution is found to the Kurdish problem.
We naturally want to express our sympathy to the families hit by bombings, most recently in August, and we demand the greatest respect for international borders.
If this respect is not forthcoming, it will be a continual source of misery.
War will never lead to peace.
Mr President, the mother of a victim of the bombing who was interviewed on television asked "How is my child to blame?"
Why should women, children and defenceless civilians always be the victims of military action?
Over 32 people were killed and 40 were injured in the bombing of Kurdish villages by the Turkish military in Kendakor on 15 August.
This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity.
It is a sign of the Turkish Government's attitude towards peace and towards the Kurds at a time when the Kurds had made a peaceful gesture.
As a spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has confirmed, Turkey from time to time carries out operations against the PKK, who have now, for the third time, declared a unilateral ceasefire.
I would like to know why arms are being delivered to Turkey right in the middle of the pre-accession process, and why arms factories are being built.
Why were the human rights organisations and World Peace Day banned on 1 September?
Is it really possible to accelerate the democratisation process using weapons and arms?
The answer is no.
The best way to achieve peace is a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights.
Why is that mothers always have to suffer?
Can we not help to foster fellowship and peace between the Kurdish and Turkish peoples?
I welcome the MEDA programme, which states that all state, legal, political, cultural and social discrimination against the Kurdish population by the Turkish Government should cease.
Granting EU financial aid to Turkey should be tied to solving the Kurdish problem, and this aid should be devoted to overcoming the economic and social underdevelopment of the Kurdish region.
Bombing civilian populations should no longer be allowed in this century.
I wish to condemn this inhumanity and want to see an end to this crime.
Those guilty of such crimes should be condemned. I call on the Council and the Member States to consistently condemn the bombing of Kurdish villages and to make representations to the Turkish Government for them to start negotiations with the Kurds' democratic representatives for a political solution as soon as possible.
That is the fast track into the EU.
Mr President, this will be the third time that I have spoken in the House during this part-session on various aspects concerning Turkey and its relations with the European Union.
This will have given me an opportunity to address a number of points that I will be taking up in the report this Assembly has asked me to draw up on enlargement to Turkey and its accession to the EU.
I will not go back over that but I do want to give my opinion here.
If it turns out that the bombardment of Kendakor on 15 August was carried out by the Turkish army, we will have to encourage the Turkish Government gradually to reduce the role its armed forces continue to play, on the pretext of combating terrorism, in areas likely to cast serious doubt on the credibility of Turkey' s wish to join the European Union.
There seem to be signs that the fight against terrorism is being won and I sincerely believe that the time has come to take this kind of decision.
Simply because the military has that force, it cannot and must not, except in times of emergency, have the power of decision on the use of force.
My 40-year military career has fully persuaded me that cedant arma togae, let war yield to peace.
Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution on the Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq was tabled by five of the European Parliament' s political groups.
That proves the importance our Parliament attaches to respect for international law and human rights in that part of the world and its extreme vigilance when a candidate country for EU membership, in this case Turkey, is concerned.
Indeed, we cannot allow northern Iraq, which is an area of limited sovereignty by virtue of international decisions, also to become an area outside the rule of law, an area where anything goes and where, on top of that, the presence of observers is entirely prohibited.
The legitimate fight against terrorism does not justify collective acts of punishment, victimising the Kurdish inhabitants of entire villages.
Disproportionate reprisals of that kind should be banished forever from the military arsenal of a civilised country.
Mr President, as my colleague Mrs Uca said, it is unacceptable for a country that wishes to become a member of the European Union to bombard defenceless people, kill more than 30 civilians and injure more than 40 people.
We think that the least that can be asked of a country, in these circumstances, is that it respects international law.
And of course, we also must condemn the hypocrisy of some Member States which, breaking the code of conduct for exporting arms to countries that could use them in the way that Turkey did in this particular case, export arms there.
We think it is hypocritical to condemn the event and then to send arms so that it can happen again.
We also feel that the European Union should monitor each of the candidate countries primarily with regard to human rights.
Otherwise, it is not acceptable for it to become a part of this Union.
Firstly, on the refugees in Nepal, the Commission fully shares the concern of the honourable Members about the state of the refugees living in the camps in eastern Nepal and, like them, is calling for an early and permanent solution.
New impetus and political will are needed from both sides to find an appropriate solution.
Above all, arrangements should be agreed for those who wish to go back to Bhutan voluntarily.
Technical solutions cannot be found unless the negotiators are firmly resolved to reach agreement.
The Commission acknowledges the results achieved by Mrs Ogata, the head of the UNHCR, for instance, when she visited Bhutan and Nepal last May, and the commitment of both sides to find a viable solution soon.
I have also talked to government representatives from both parties.
They also seem determined to find a solution.
Mrs Ogata's and the visit of a European Parliament delegation in April this year have been instrumental to genuine progress.
However, the Commission regrets that the formula for verification in the camps has not yet been agreed, despite recent expectations that an agreement would be found.
In its regular contacts with the Nepalese and Bhutanese authorities the Commission has invariably stressed that this problem must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.
The EC is a major donor of humanitarian aid to the refugees and to date has spent more than EUR 11 million.
The Commission has used every opportunity to urge both sides to achieve tangible results.
It has repeatedly stated its commitment to provide the necessary resources to facilitate reintegration and resettlement of the refugees once real progress has been made.
A number of EU Member States have made the same commitment.
In the current financial year the Commission will supply EUR 1.5 million in assistance to the camps via the UNHCR.
The risk that funds might run short should be avoided. This is completely manageable, given the amounts involved.
It is our responsibility to prevent it.
The Commission is looking forward to assessing the results of the forthcoming discussion between the Prime Minister of Nepal, Mr Koirala, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bhutan, Mr Zimba, due to take place in the UN General Assembly on 11 September.
Moving on to the recent events in Burma, on 18 May the Commission deplored in this House the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military machine.
We referred on that occasion to extrajudicial killings, the imposition of forced labour, the forced displacement of local populations, the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the full functioning of legitimate political parties.
We also condemned the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and the routine practice of arbitrary arrests.
At the same time, the Commission expressed its support for the common EU position on Burma and for the decision of the April 2000 General Affairs Council to strengthen this common position.
We use every possible opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge the State Peace and Development Council to enter into a substantive dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities.
The aim must be to arrive at a mutually agreed solution to the present situation, re-establishing respect for international standards of human rights in Burma.
Several speakers this afternoon have mentioned tourism.
The EU has already clearly expressed its support for Aung San Suu Kyi's call on people from all civilised countries to refrain from tourist visits to Burma.
We encourage our citizens to respond accordingly.
The most recent developments in Rangoon provide perfect proof, if proof were needed, of the validity of our condemnation of the military regime's unacceptable practices.
The unwarranted seizure and subsequent detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party, together with local youth leaders, last Saturday, cannot in any way be justified by claims that they need 'protection' .
Nor can such treatment be justified by unsubstantiated allegations of conspiracy.
This was a simple exercise in thuggery by an administration acting in panic.
The Commission therefore joins its voice to the calls from all over the world for an immediate end to the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and her senior colleagues, the immediate restoration of normal channels for diplomatic access to the leadership of the National League for Democracy, the immediate release of the local youth leaders currently held without charge, and an immediate end to the illegal surveillance of private telephone conversations by democratically elected political representatives in Burma.
On the human rights situation in Colombia, our attention has been drawn on a number of occasions to the murders of innocent civilians in Colombia.
Impunity for the perpetrators of such atrocities has almost been systematic.
We have also seen a dramatic increase in death threats against people providing assistance on the ground to more vulnerable groups.
For example, we have been informed that serious threats have been made against the Irish priest Brendan Forde, who is working in one of the regions most affected by violence.
The Commission deeply deplores and condemns this situation and calls all parties in the conflict to respect humanitarian law and principles.
The Commission also supports the peace efforts promoted by President Pastrana.
It will do anything in its power in order to promote support for lasting peace in the country.
As regards what has been said in the debate this afternoon, in my view more guns are not a shortcut to a solution for Colombia but will merely add to the problems.
The Commission fully shares Parliament's concerns over the recent kidnapping of eleven British soldiers in Sierra Leone.
We hope the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining six soldiers are successful.
We would like to express our solidarity with the soldiers and their families.
The Commission is concerned that incidents like this and the abduction of UN personnel could hamper attempts to put the peace process back on track.
We would welcome any decision by the United Nations Security Council to strengthen the UN force in Sierra Leone.
The Security Council's resolution of 5 July this year banning the illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone has now been transposed into Community law.
This ban, as well as the ban on arms sales to other groups which has been in force since 1997, must be strictly implemented.
The Commission calls on all parties concerned - and that, of course, also includes the diamond industry in Europe - to support the UN's sanctions committees in achieving this end.
The Commission remains supportive of the Government's attempts to restore peace to the country and to implement programmes of economic recovery.
With funds from the European Development Fund support is being provided to demobilise and reintegrate ex-combatants within the framework of a wider reconstruction and rehabilitation programme.
Economic recovery is being assisted through a EUR 8.2 million programme of budgetary support and a technical assistance programme supporting improved public financial management.
Within the next few weeks the Commission will be seeking approval for a rehabilitation and reintegration programme of EUR 30 million, a health sector support programme of EUR 28 million, a programme of post-conflict budget support of EUR 34.75 million and a support programme to the Ministry of Finance of EUR 4.5 million.
As regards humanitarian assistance, the Commission, through ECHO, is continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs and the UN.
Since the beginning of 1999 ECHO has provided some EUR 26 million of assistance covering the supply of medical aid, therapeutic feeding, water and sanitation and psycho-social support for children affected by war.
This is especially important, given the terrible situation for child soldiers and children in general in Sierra Leone.
In addition, this funding has specifically covered support for amputees and refugees and internally displaced populations.
As regards northern Iraq, the Commission shares the concern expressed in various draft resolutions about the latest operations by the Turkish Air Force and the resulting civilian casualties.
The Commission has noted that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs is looking into the incident and into possible compensation.
The upheavals caused by each incursion of the Turkish military into Iraq undermine the efforts to stabilise the area and inflict unnecessary suffering on the Kurdish population.
They have suffered enough.
What is needed for a return to normal life in the area is stability, peace and support for economic development.
Over the past few years, the Union has repeatedly stressed the need to respect the integrity of Iraq and its border with Turkey.
These latest border violations again do not solve the problems in Turkey, or anywhere else.
In our view, a peaceful dialogue between the parties is the only viable path to lasting stability in the area.
I have noted carefully what Members of this House have said this afternoon about their expectations in relation to Turkey, not least regarding its future place in European cooperation, and I certainly share their views.
Mr President, I would like to say that, with regard to the situation in Colombia, we put a question to the Commissioner, who answered that the Commission supports the peace efforts being made by President Pastrana.
I asked him whether the Commission would complement this rhetorical support with any kind of support that did not just consist of words.
I realise that this is perhaps not the time to discuss this, but I would like the Commission to answer us, even if it is in writing.
I will be happy to augment what I am saying now by more thorough comments in writing.
My immediate response is that we have to be careful, to put it plainly and directly, not to be cast in a role as simply providing funding for activities that we may not agree with 100%.
We also have to take care to be sufficiently focused on poverty and doing something that really is to the benefit of the most disadvantaged groups.
So what we are doing now and what we will do in the future, financially speaking, in Colombia, will have to be tailored very carefully against that background.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 5.30 p.m.
TemelÃ­n nuclear power station
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
B5-0708/2000 by Mrs McNally and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the Czech nuclear power plant in TemelÃ­n;
B5-0723/2000 by Mr Flemming and Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats), on the TemelÃ­n reactor;
B5-0732/2000 by Mr Echerer and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the nuclear power plant in TemelÃ­n;
B5-0745/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the nuclear power plant in TemelÃ­n.
Mr President, I am taking the place of Mrs McNally who has had to go back to the United Kingdom this afternoon.
The European Union with the support of this Parliament has already done much to raise the technical and operational safety of Soviet-type nuclear reactors and to create independent regulators.
As I understand it, what is being done at TemelÃ­n has already been done in Finland and there is similar upgrading work in hand at Kozloduy in Bulgaria with the support of a Euratom loan.
What I would like the Commission to confirm, if possible, is if the work at TemelÃ­n follows the recommendations of twelve inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and that it will, in fact, create safety standards equivalent to those in our Member States.
That is the assurance, or reassurance, that the public in the European Union requires.
We have had many messages from the Czech authorities this week.
They claim that most of the actions which we request in this resolution have already been carried out and that the remainder are, in fact, under way.
Is the Commission in a position to confirm that this afternoon, and if not, will it undertake to supply its views on this matter with urgency to the Industry Committee of the European Parliament?
Mr President, many EU Member States have a very friendly relationship with the Czech Republic, and even one based on family ties.
But I believe that in a good family you can also say things that do not suit other members of the family.
Nuclear power stations in the European Union have the highest safety standards in the world, and a candidate country that wants to commission a new nuclear power station must, of course, comply with those standards.
It is right to say that evaluating safety standards at TemelÃ­n is a matter for the Czech nuclear regulatory authority.
But it is also true to say that during the accession partnership with the Czech Republic, the Commission has identified the implementation of Community legislation on environmental impact assessment as a priority, partly because of TemelÃ­n.
Nevertheless, although the Czech Republic signed the agreement on cross-border EIA, the Espoo Convention, in 1993, it has still not ratified it.
Now, all of a sudden, trial operation is to start at TemelÃ­n, with undue haste and in a few days' time, before Germany and Austria, which are neighbouring countries, have received the information requested and before the deeply concerned population of the neighbouring countries has had an opportunity to consider the position and make their objections known to the Czech authorities.
That is what the Espoo Convention stipulates, and it is, after all, valid EU legislation.
I call on the Czech Government, indeed I implore it, to take seriously the fears not only of people in neighbouring countries, but also within its own borders.
The reactors at TemelÃ­n are a Soviet design, VVER1000, and there is nothing Westinghouse can do about that.
Please just think about Chernobyl.
I appeal once again to the Czech Government to act voluntarily now in just the same way as they would have to act if they already belonged to the European Union and were a member of our great European family.
Mr President, I would first like to thank my colleagues for their constructive and objective cooperation, which has resulted in this joint motion for a resolution.
In the course of 13 project modifications, environmental impact assessment has been simply disregarded.
As Mrs Flemming said, it is a long time since the Espoo Convention was signed.
It should have been ratified by the Czech Parliament at the beginning of the year and transposed into national law, but this has been indefinitely delayed without any reasons being given.
Despite this, the constant concerns about safety expressed by the public, in the press and also in private discussions are not being taken seriously.
During the last bilateral meetings between Czech, Austrian and German experts on 2 and 5 September this year, it was once again stated that TemelÃ­n does not meet German safety standards and would not, therefore, receive an operating licence in Germany.
My fourth point is that electricity from TemelÃ­n is not intended for internal consumption: it is intended for export, and at dumping prices at that.
Fifthly, the safety of European citizens is at stake here and our responsibility towards them should be adequate grounds for action.
The Commission says that we do not have any legal options here.
Well, the Commission has known that for a long time.
Did the Commission expect that somebody would just pull a legal measure out of the hat?
No.
I expect that the Greens' view will be the well-established one that safety and nuclear power stations are two incompatible concepts.The fact of the matter is that there are eastern European nuclear power stations and western European nuclear power stations.
Double standards are being applied here, and that must stop.
Our friends in the Commission have to accept that you cannot use legal measures alone to solve every single problem.
I therefore expect the Commission and the Council to demonstrate together the same strong and combined political will that the European Parliament is displaying with this motion for a resolution.
I would like to comment on the Technical Group of Independent Members' amendment, which does not include any sensible or new requirements apart from a hint at compromise.
I cannot vote for this policy.
It is simply populist to gloss over the long-standing failure or lack of interest on the part of politicians towards this issue by threatening a veto - it will not have the desired effect and it will not create a constructive basis for negotiations.
The safety of Europe's citizens and, thus, confidence in the Community should be a priority for us all.
Our motion for a resolution is enormously important for the people of Europe and above all for the Czech public. I hope that we will not disappoint them.
Mr President, this issue should not even be a subject of urgent debate.
I deplore the cynical Green exploitation and misrepresentation of the situation.
Interference in the internal affairs of a candidate country with the political blackmail of a threat to veto accession to the EU is wholly unacceptable.
I regret that people in Austria have allowed themselves to be ruled by emotion, not rational scientific argument.
The Czechs show every sign of behaving responsibly and properly according to internationally accepted standards, and we should leave them to get on with it.
Although I signed the joint motion as instructed by my political group, I intend to vote against this resolution.
Mr President, as the third Austrian to speak, I was starting to worry that I would have nothing to add.
But having heard Mr Chichester, I think it is worth reiterating that we have to pay serious attention to the wishes and concerns of the people of Europe, and of Austria in particular, as regards nuclear energy. This applies especially to the TemelÃ­n nuclear power station.
My group is supporting this motion for a resolution on TemelÃ­n for reasons of principle, because we take the people's concerns seriously and because many of us have, for a long time, been actively fighting against nuclear energy in the East and in the West.
The political battle against the Zwentendorf nuclear power station in Austria has had an enduring formative influence on me personally, so I did not need to be convinced by the conservative arguments in the Austrian media over the last few days which I have followed with surprise and sometimes with quiet amusement.
Like Mrs Echerer, I oppose the single, very vaguely worded amendment, because I believe that the phrase 'high level' does not mean anything, because the Czech Republic itself is surely aware of the need for a high level of safety.
I therefore fully support the motion for a resolution before us and oppose the amendment.
Mr President, I should like to confess to the Members of this Chamber that I feel rather ambivalent about this issue.
On the one hand, I am an old opponent of nuclear power and have for many years been a member of the board of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate. On the other hand, I am chairman of the Delegation to the Joint EU-Czech Republic Parliamentary Committee.
I should therefore quickly like to say three things.
First of all: concern about nuclear power means that safety will not only be good but that it will, at all times, be as good as it possibly can be.
Secondly, the same rules naturally apply to the Czech Republic as apply to other candidate States and, in the long run, to Member States.
Thirdly, this resolution ought to be seen as part of an open dialogue with the Czech Republic, a dialogue we are conducting within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Committee but which ought also to be possible to conduct in our respective parliaments.
We must broaden out this debate, which is part and parcel of our democracy.
This ought not, however, to lead to hard feelings between the Czech Republic and the Member States of the EU.
I hope that the Czechs are able to give positive answers to all the questions and that a favourable solution can in that way be found to this problem.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you would think that we would all have learnt some lessons from the accident at the Chernobyl reactor.
In that case, the radiation was not confined to the Ukraine, nor was it simply a bilateral problem.
I know that there are both advocates and opponents of nuclear power in the European Union, and that there is no common line.
And, above all, there are no uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations.
There is an urgent need for action here if our credibility is to be maintained.
However, after the Chernobyl experience we have to ask if it really is possible to bring a nuclear power plant, TemelÃ­n, on line in the heart of Europe when it still has significant limitations in terms of safety.
The Czech Republic is trying to present us with a fait accompli in commissioning TemelÃ­n.
If you will forgive my saying so, this sort of behaviour falls far short of a spirit of partnership.
Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules.
A resolution was adopted in the Austrian Parliament this Tuesday by all the parties - all the parties, mark you - emphasising that approval could only be given to the completion of the accession negotiations if the TemelÃ­n plant is retrofitted.
I wish to make one thing quite clear: we support the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU. But the conditions must be right.
I call on you to support our motion for a resolution, the content of which is identical to the four-party resolution adopted in the Austrian Parliament.
After all, it must be our objective for nuclear power stations to have the highest possible safety standards.
Mr President, I shall also be voting for this resolution, which I consider to be reasonable.
If it can help to defuse the battle of words between the two sides somewhat, than it will certainly have served its purpose.
I regret that the Czech Republic is unable to defend itself here and present its case, as it is always good to hear both sides of such a complicated argument.
However, in the same spirit of openness I would also like to say that I do not think it is right for the Austrian Government and Parliament to be delivering a kind of ultimatum here.
That is not the way we have handled these things in the European Union up to now.
It is quite evident that there is a problem, but if we start issuing ultimatums then the next thing will be that a delegation will arrive representing displaced persons and demand that the Czech Republic can only join the Union if the Benesch Decrees are withdrawn.
And then some other group will come along demanding something else.
You have to be careful with ultimatums like this.
There are other ways of solving such problems.
But I would also like to suggest to the Czech Republic that they should pay serious attention to the concerns expressed by the German Association for Nuclear Safety. That was another point I wanted to make.
My last, but important point, is one for the Commission.
We hear a lot about environmental impact, and that is fine. But we also have the Euratom Treaty.
Article 37 of that Treaty effectively stipulates that the Commission must be kept informed about any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in any form whatsoever.
The Commission also has to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.
I know that the Czech Republic does not yet belong to the European Union. Nevertheless, I would be interested to know what the Commission's view is in relation to this article, and whether it considers that the Czech Republic has respected it.
It would be interesting, as Gordon Adam has already asked, to know what its view is on the environmental impact assessment.
Mr President, Mr Linkohr's comments are not quite correct.
I will gladly let you see the text approved by the Austrian Parliament.
It does not contain any kind of ultimatum or any hint of blackmail, and I, too, have made it quite clear now that we cannot and certainly do not want to compel anyone to do anything.
We request, we appeal to the Czech Government to act in accordance with current European law and quite simply to observe the Espoo Convention, even if they have not ratified it yet.
The Commission has been following the political debate on the TemelÃ­n nuclear power plant with great attention.
It has repeatedly stressed the importance of candidate countries adhering to a high level of nuclear safety in line with relevant Council resolutions.
The Commission is actively participating in the deliberations of the Council aimed at assessing and ensuring a high level of nuclear safety in candidate countries as a key requirement for accession to the European Union.
The responsibility for licensing nuclear installations lies with the Czech nuclear regulatory authority.
The Commission has cooperated with the Czech authorities in order to reinforce the authority's capacities.
The Czech authorities have ensured that the operating licence for Unit 1 of the TemelÃ­n nuclear power plant will not be issued until all outstanding problems are solved to the satisfaction of the nuclear regulatory authority.
According to current Czech legislation, an environmental impact assessment is required before the operating licence is issued.
The Commission expects this provision to be enforced by the Czech authorities.
Mr Adams asks whether the Czechs took account of the IAEA's inspections and views.
The answer is 'yes' .
The IAEA has reviewed the modifications made to the safety systems by the Czechs following the IAEA's programmes.
The IAEA concluded that the issues were properly addressed by the Czechs.
That is the information I am able to supply on this subject.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a few minutes' time, at 5.30 p.m.
Fires in Europe
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
B5-0703/2000 by Mrs Malliori and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the forest fires in Europe;
B5-0724/2000 by Mr Hatzidakis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the fires in the south of the European Union;
B5-0723/2000 by Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the forest fires in Europe;
B5-0737/2000 by Mrs Muscardini and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the fires in Europe;
B5-0746/2000 by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the fires in the Mediterranean regions;
B5-0747/2000 by Mr Korakas and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the fires in Greece.
Mr President, the fires which again destroyed huge tracts of forest in the Mediterranean this summer are mainly the result of the rise in temperature and prolonged dry weather, not to mention of course criminal cases of arson.
Climatic changes, which are happening more and more rapidly, impact on the entire ecosystem.
Scientists have pointed out the risks inherent in our inconsiderate treatment of the planet, one of the results of which is extreme meteorological phenomena.
Southern Europe has been set alight more and more frequently over recent years.
The Mediterranean has become a high risk area and needs special measures.
In my country, Greece, more than 500 fires broke out this year, most of which were dealt with minimal disruption.
However, there were, unfortunately, also occasions on which the fires got out of control, causing death and destruction.
I should like to express my sympathy to the families of the victims and the injured in all the countries which faced similar problems.
I think, Mr President, that a European strategy on the conservation of forests is our political responsibility and an immediate priority.
I also think it essential that we reinstate the budget line for natural disasters.
The Commission should exert its influence to ensure that Member States introduce stricter legislation on changes of land use, compulsory reforestation following fires, suitable training on fire-fighting for those in positions of local and regional responsibility and a public awareness campaign on the benefits of forests and how they can be protected and to encourage volunteers fire-fighters.
Mr President, every September we return to the House and take tragic stock of the number of victims and the extent of the damage to forests as the result of fires.
The fires are, of course, the result of climatic changes and the weather which prevails in the Mediterranean during the summer; they are also the result of criminal offences.
There may also be other causes, such as refuse tips and, of course, the lack of certain administrative structures, especially the lack of an overall, coordinated approach to fires, exacerbates the damage which they cause.
So what proposals can we make?
First and foremost, both the Member States and the Commission need to update the regional development programmes and action to prevent, restore and reforest.
They could use the Interreg Community initiative, for example.
Similarly, forest registers are desperately needed; this will help to protect and recover our ecological heritage and fight land speculation.
However, what we need is coordination and cooperation at European level and I call on the Commission to propose that a European fire prevention centre be set up in order to conduct systematic studies and introduce new technical methods to prevent and fight fires.
And to go one step further: the time has come for the Commission to draw up an integrated defence strategy to coordinate national action and measures against natural and man-made disasters, in line, of course, with the principle of subsidiarity.
I trust that these proposals will elicit a positive response from the Commission so that we can protect our forests more efficiently.
Mr President, indeed, like a chronic recurrent disease, the summer of 2000 will once again have suffered the ravages of fires raging through millions of hectares in our country and our continent and even causing the tragic death of a number of firemen and local residents.
This scourge is the result of criminal action: the blame lies with irresponsible arsonists who should face deterrent penalties, and with unscrupulous developers prepared to use any means possible to get hold of land on which building is forbidden, who ought to be deterred by a whole range of legal means to prosecute them.
But there are also other reasons for this affliction: they include the lack of any inventories of economic activities, such as agro-pastoral activities in Corsica, and the lack of any real approach, on the basis of geographical databases, to a kind of rural planning that makes the most of natural resources and reduces the risk of fires spreading.
Lastly, and above all, there is the lack of any genuine environmental education that goes well beyond the necessary prevention and awareness-raising campaigns.
So this summer epidemic is curable, Mr President.
It is vital to bring a new balance into some of the land-use policies, such as stock farming in Corsica, and to allocate subsidies on the basis of economic and preventive factors.
These upstream provisions cannot replace the need for downstream investment in adequate fire-fighting equipment in sufficient quantity to be deployed in all the EU countries.
The citizens concerned are counting on the Commission to take practical action.
Mr President, this year, the fires in the Mediterranean, and in Greece in particular, broke all previous records.
I believe that the area destroyed by the fires was twice as large as at any other time and a great many people were killed despite the fact, of course, that the Greek Government was well prepared and despite the fact that Greece now has some of the best fire-fighting equipment, aeroplanes and human resources in the world.
What it has proved is that reaction is not enough.
We need to be pro-active.
That is what we all say, but none of us does anything.
It is a complicated issue and, of course, it concerns local authorities and the national government.
What can the European Union do?
What it can do, Mr President, is to apply a more active basic policy with more coordination and increased intervention.
It can examine the weaknesses of the common agricultural policy, which to all intents and purposes destroys the motivation of people living in and from forests and drives them away.
The common agricultural policy subsidises pasturing on burnt ground, subsidises animals which graze on burnt ground, at the same time as our forests are trying to reproduce naturally.
The European Union should also, of course, review its approach to and priorities for investments.
We have been crying for a land register for a long time now, especially a forest register and forest maps, which need to be supported as a matter of priority over everything else and, of course, any other development and investment measures which boost the development of forests as forests rather than a commodity and which enable people who live off the forest to stay there.
That is the best form of prevention and the best form of protection.
Of course we shall still have fires and, with what is happening to the climate, we shall no doubt be unfortunate enough to witness more and more serious phenomena.
But it is in our hands to try and do what we can to forestall the known causes at least.
Mr President, Portugal has also been affected by these tragic forest fires which have been the result either of natural causes or of criminal acts motivated by base economic interests.
We know that this matter is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, which need to organise themselves and build up their own control and prevention resources.
We also know that they should give priority to actions of this kind, and to national afforestation projects, under their national regional development programmes.
It is also necessary, however, to back a European forest strategy with technical and financial resources in order to strengthen and complement national resources.
With this in mind, I would like to highlight the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of our resolution, which aims to create a European Fire Prevention Centre, and I would like to take the liberty of suggesting that it should be located in Portugal.
The Commission deeply regrets the loss of human life as well as the ecological and economic damage caused by the recent forest fires in Europe.
The principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this debate.
We have to avoid raising too many expectations and overloading the Commission with tasks.
We must be careful not to promise things we cannot deliver.
Frankly, there has been enough of that in the past.
We should be careful, when entering into discussions such as this, not to automatically assume that the Commission will solve the problem.
We can and should do something, but I wanted to make that cautionary remark.
To get to the core of this discussion, the question of an emergency aid budget line, the Commission is considering proposing a legal basis for such a line at the moment.
However, the Commission might consider financial support for the restoration of the forestry production potential on the basis of the rural development regulation, No 1257/1999.
According to the Greek authorities, the financial contributions from the agricultural funds are not sufficient for a substantial contribution to be made to the restoration work.
The Commission therefore invites the Greek authorities to present proposals for the amendment of the development programme so that the necessary appropriations can be considered.
I should like to draw your attention to EC Regulation No 2158/1992, under which preventive action in relation to forest fires may be financed.
Each Member State should verify that all the necessary steps have been taken to reduce the risk of fires to a minimum.
New Commission initiatives are already in effect, or will shortly become effective.
A proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community mechanism for the coordination of emergency civil protection action will be considered by the college in the near future.
This will aim to improve the mutual assistance between Member States.
It will also have an important side effect in that it will help third countries to manage unexpected emergencies or disasters they would not be able to handle by themselves.
Through this coordination mechanism Member States will be invited to identify groups which can intervene at short notice at the scene.
The Commission recently initiated a satellite-based project to improve information on operational fire fighting centres in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of determining the levels of risk from day to day.
We will consider whether this could lead to a system for early detection of forest fires.
The Commission is also encouraging Member States to reinforce their intervention capacities.
The Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund have already contributed substantially in the period 1994-99.
The national authorities should provide for the necessary financial resources to consolidate this action for the period 2000-06.
In general, the decision on the acquisition of such fire-fighting equipment will remain the responsibility of the Member States.
Self-tuition workshops on fighting forest fires are also planned.
However the Commission does not have enough resources to extend its activities beyond that.
The Structural Funds can be used for restoration after natural disasters and advantage has been taken of this possibility in recent years.
Mr President, like some other Members of the House, I have just been alerted to developments in the situation in northern Afghanistan where, after two months of relentless offensives, the Taliban apparently took the town of Taloqan last night, with a heavy toll of military and civilian victims.
It is obviously too late to table an urgent resolution on this issue.
But I would ask you, Mr President, to forward to the Conference of Presidents a request that the Council and the Commission make a statement to the House at our forthcoming mini-session in Brussels on what action the European Union could envisage to help find a political solution in Afghanistan and put an end to these senseless bloodbaths.
Thank you very much, Mr Morillon, we will pass on that request.
Mr President, I would like to support Mr Morillon's suggestion.
I would like to emphasise - and I am now speaking on behalf of my group also - that we consider the Council Declaration on this subject to be very important, and I request you to forward it to the Conference of Presidents.
I will gladly do that, Mr Sakellariou
Mr President, following the vote, I would like to ask the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets to tell us whether he has at his disposal the appropriations called for in paragraphs 12 and 14 of the motion for a resolution on fires in Europe for which we have just voted.
Mr President, this shows the folly of making policy on the hoof.
This has never gone through any committee.
There have been requests for money, which does not exist and no one has said where it is going to come from.
It is an urgency which has been voted by this Parliament - so be it, but it is quite ludicrous.
I got the message very well, Mr Wynn.
Situation in Fiji following the coup d'Ã©tat
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Fiji following the coup d'Ã©tat.
Commissioner Nielson has the floor.
The release of the hostages on 13 July, the arrest of the rebel leader and his main associates on 26 July and the efforts of the Government to reinstate law and order give some cause for satisfaction.
However, there are still serious worries about the future of Fiji.
First and foremost, the use of violence by certain ethnic groupings to impose their rule on other communities is unacceptable.
Secondly, a democratic government must be re-established.
The present interim government has no democratic basis.
There should be a clear blue-print for full restoration of democratic principles and practices.
The 1997 Constitution, which lays down the principle of equal rights for all Fijian citizens, must be reinstated. This process should be finalised very quickly.
The time-frame currently being proposed, two or three years, is far too long.
The fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji must be resolved.
Multiracial cooperation and harmony must become a reality.
This might require international mediation.
If we are to be realistic, we must support every possible step on the way to stability without losing sight of the scenario I have just outlined.
The international community and the donors of aid to Fiji agree on these principles.
As far as the EU is concerned, the Council has informed the Fijians of its request to begin consultations under Article 366 of the LomÃ© Convention, which calls for a thorough examination of the situation on the basis of information to be supplied by the Fijians.
Further input will be provided by the report of an ACP ministerial fact-finding mission to Fiji which took place in mid-August and which was led by the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea.
Furthermore, the Commission received first-hand information from the legitimate Prime Minister, Mr Chaudhry on 31 August.
We are now at the beginning of the consultations.
Measures under Article 366 will be taken if the consultations fail to produce an acceptable solution for both sides in the discussions.
All that can be said at present is that the measures, if any, should not harm the poor and those already suffering from the severe economic crisis triggered by the events.
Poverty-related projects should, consequently, continue.
In conclusion, I hope that the coordinated effort of the international donor community will have the desired effect on the current government in Fiji.
Even if we achieve our aim of restoring democratic principles and a government chosen in fair and equal elections within less than two years, this will be only a first step for the solution of the Fijian problem.
A strong long-term effort is required from all parties and, in the first instance, from the Fijian Government and the communities, to work on the entrenched prejudices and anxieties so that racial cooperation and harmony can be restored and become a reality in Fiji.
This is absolutely essential and there are no alternatives to that reality.
Mr President, the events that have unfolded in Fiji over the past few months seem to be taken straight from a soap opera.
Unfortunately, they are for real. What is more, Fiji is an ACP country which enjoys considerable benefits thanks to the sugar protocol with the European Union.
It is almost ironic that the new partnership deal, which considers democracy to be of paramount importance, was signed in Fiji at a time when that country was hit by a coup d' Ã©tat.
It illustrates, once again, how fragile democracy is, even in regions where it seemed to be an established value.
But the Fiji story is more complicated than that.
There is a delicate balance of power between the indigenous population and the population of Indian origin, who make up 44% of the population.
The army plays a dubious role.
The attacks on Indian properties could apparently take place undisturbed and without any intervention by the body of officials responsible for order.
In fact, certain elements within the army openly chose the side of the army taking part in the coup.
There are the recent revelations about the role of Mr Speight in the lucrative timber industry, which put the whole matter in a completely new light.
According to recent information, he was apparently discharged as chairman of the state enterprise which manages mahogany plantations, and earlier in the year, he was in danger of missing out on a major contract for the development of hardwood.
All this seems to suggest that personal and economic, rather than political, interests were behind the coup.
Be that as it may, Speight' s undemocratic behaviour has plunged a whole country into a deep political and economic crisis.
Tourism, which represented one third of the gross domestic product, has dropped to less than one fifth.
Ethnic tension is once again mounting.
Thousands of inhabitants of Indian origin are still on the run, and the events in Fiji are also prejudicing the promising dynamic in the region which was to culminate in the Pacific Regional Trade Agreement.
The European Parliament which, in its agreements with the ACP partners, makes strict demands regarding democracy and human rights, can and must condemn such a course of events.
We need to continue to demand that the safety of all citizens be guaranteed and that any form of ethnic division and provocation be penalised.
Speight should not be let off the hook.
Above all, we must work towards the return of true democracy within the meaning of the 1997 Constitution, which guarantees equal rights to all inhabitants of Fiji, and it is true that elections must be called as soon as possible.
A three-year transitional period is not acceptable.
If the interim government fails to restore democratic order within a reasonable period of time, sanctions must be considered, preferably 'smart' sanctions, and structural aid must be suspended.
Consultations on this matter will be starting in September.
I do hope that the Commission will stick to its principles and will not succumb to political or economic pressure.
As we are about to embark on a new major partnership agreement between Europe and its partners in the ACP, it is of paramount importance not to create a precedent.
Mr President, I generally welcome the comments both of the previous speaker and Commissioner Nielson who made a statement on behalf of the Commission.
I am not as convinced as he is that the violence is actually over in Fiji.
I had the opportunity last week, along with a number of colleagues from various parties and groups here, to meet with Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry who reported to us that violence against the Indo-Fijians is still continuing in Fiji.
Secondly, I disagree that there is a fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji.
It seems to me, if one looks at the origin of the coup d'Ã©tat, that one should follow the money rather than the ethnic relations.
I welcome the fact that Article 366 of the LomÃ© Convention has been invoked.
If we look back at the history of what has happened in Fiji, we see a sweeping electoral victory by the Fijian Labour Party in the May 1999 General Election when they won, with their supporting parties, 58 out of the 71 seats, ousting the incumbent right-wing government.
Following that, there has been a systematic attempt to destabilise the new government led by elements of the former governing party and extreme nationalist gangs under the flimsy pretext of protecting indigenous interests.
It is interesting that, although Mahendra Chaudhry is an Indo-Fijian, twelve out of the 18 members of his cabinet are, as it were, indigenous Fijians and a majority of indigenous Fijian MPs actually supported the Government.
The destabilisation operation was financed by sections of private enterprise, frightened by the government's radical programme of social reform and poverty alleviation and by its close association with the trade union movement.
This financing was led by corporate groups bidding for the right to exploit mahogany and native hardwood forestry.
The police and the military singularly failed to protect and defend the government.
Alongside George Speight and his gang, when the people's coalition government were taken hostage on 19 May, were members of the armed forces' counter-revolutionary warfare unit.
What has happened in Fiji is nothing less than a coup d'Ã©tat by the military industrial complex.
In fact, it is another Chile written small.
As a result, the 1997 Constitution has been ripped up. A government has been imposed in power by the military that it is effectively controlled by those supporting the coup and the military is trying to offload the blame by prosecuting one small section of those involved, namely the gang around George Speight
I believe Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers must back the proposals by the Labour led people's coalition for reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution and, in the spirit of national conciliation, for the formation of a grand coalition for the government in Fiji.
Unless this is achieved, unless the slide towards a form of apartheid in Fiji, where Indo-Fijians who comprise nearly half the population are rapidly becoming second-class citizens, driven from their homes and jobs, is stopped, then we should demand support for sanctions against the current government.
We should support the moves by Premier Helen Clark from New Zealand for a concerted action at bilateral, regional and global levels, which should include, as Mr Van Hecke said, 'smart' sanctions targeted at those involved in the coups, denying them the freedom to travel, freezing foreign assets and threatening them when they are apprehended with the consequences of the UN Hostage Convention.
Second, Fiji should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events.
Third, there should be a denial of all economic and military assistance to and through the present government.
The issue of Fiji is important, not only in its own right, but because it will set a precedent as to whether semi-clandestine coups-in-waiting along similar lines will see the light of day and whether Europe and the rest of the developed world is prepared to tackle the issue of indigenous rights - the Third World's variant of the racism that is threatening us all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the coup in Fiji in May of this year was not the first one.
It was preceded by one in 1987 which resulted in exclusion from the Commonwealth. This does lead me to believe that the tension, possibly ethnic in origin, must go far deeper than we might like to think.
Then too, tension between the indigenous people of Fiji and Indo-Fijians was at the root of the problem and, needless to say, with Indo-Fijians accounting for 44% of the population and the indigenous people accounting for 64%, two peoples of more or less the same size are involved.
I can imagine that the removal of prejudice, as you referred to earlier Commissioner, is not a matter of course in such situations.
Moreover, unemployment promotes tension, and the legally elected government was driven out by the military coup.
What concerns me more than anything is that this conflict could spread to other islands with similar problems and similar tensions.
This is, in fact, the opposite of what we have in mind and to which reference has already been made: the establishment of a great Pacific Regional Trade Agreement between 14 nations.
If we are not careful, this will be the first major conflict in the Pacific and this may well affect the situation in the region for a few decades to come.
All this makes me wonder whether this coup is merely the thin end of the wedge.
It also makes me wonder what the European Union' s prevention policy actually consists of.
What can be done in order to put such a country back on the road towards being a democratic, constitutional state, no longer in a crisis situation and with the guilty parties brought to justice, as has been requested with good reason? We should also press for the safety of all citizens - this seems basic to me, especially in a country where thousands of people are on the run in their own country - as well as for a parliament which should be re-convened this autumn, and for a democratically elected government.
Some of our motions for resolution also include the requirement that the opposition should take part in the government.
This, of course, presupposes an agreement, which has not been concluded since the multi-racial constitution of 1997, which was seemingly approved by everyone at the time but which cannot, however, be applied in practice.
The European Union is Fiji' s key trading partner and provider of aid.
How can we translate this role into effective peace mediation?
Could we not appoint a genuine mediator or mediating body in consultation with the UN and the Commonwealth?
The Kotonu conventions provide for a partnership for development and peace, and the LomÃ© conventions also provide for procedures, especially Article 366, which has already been referred to.
These procedures should be applied with due care, intelligence and maturity.
We invite the Commission to come back before the end of the year to report on the developments in Fiji and the region as a whole and on the efforts which the European Union has made.
Mr President, the events of the past few months in Fiji are not an isolated incident.
They are more than the sum-total of a crazed, racist businessman, a disloyal army, the interests of timber merchants, and politicians who accept that the democratically enacted constitution has been invalidated.
The events have everything to do with the relationship between people and state in general and with the history of Fiji and the composition of its population in particular.
European colonialism caused workers from other parts of the then British colonial empire to move to Fiji, as a result of which the 44% of people of Indian origin have now started to form a near-majority of the population.
The original Fijian population has never had a say in the matter but has meanwhile been faced with the reality that the composition of the population has changed beyond recognition.
Descendants of those newcomers rightly feel that they are a part of the established population of the group of islands, with equal rights, whilst a large section of the original population still struggles to come to terms with this new status quo.
The situation is in many ways comparable to that in Surinam, Guyana, Trinidad and South Africa.
Indeed, European colonialism brought peoples of very different origins together in those regions too.
The peoples involved had nothing in common in terms of language, culture and religion and there are also striking differences in their appearance.
They very often live as closed groups juxtaposed to one another within the same territory, but largely in separate settlements and urban areas.
In these countries, there have often been harsh clashes between these peoples.
Sometimes, part of such a group believes it is superior, but often the clashes are about the ruthless protection of interests and the distribution of goods in short supply among competing groups.
These competitors need the same land, the same jobs and the same houses, whilst everything is in short supply.
In South Africa, this situation even led to an atrocious system of inequality and oppression, referred to as apartheid.
Meanwhile, the people of such countries have come to the conclusion that all people are equal and that they have no choice other than to join forces.
But this does not take away the fact that closed groups continue to live side by side without real integration.
Politicians and adventurers who wish to set peoples against each other still have plenty of scope.
That is the key difference compared with the current states in Europe.
The latter are generally united with one people, one common history, one language and more or less one culture.
This is true of old countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal but is also true of relatively new countries such as Poland, Italy, Germany and Romania or of very new ones, including the Czech Republic, Slovenia or Lithuania.
Precisely because these countries are incontrovertibly linked to the people who live there as a large majority, they can be open to minorities and newcomers and maintain their democracy.
But in European countries, too, there are unpleasant recollections of former newcomers who came as soldiers, robbers and privileged groups of businessmen and who put the people at a disadvantage.
Very often, people these days would prefer to see the descendants of these newcomers leave their country or else wish that they had completely adapted.
From our European perspective, we recognise the right of the Israeli and Palestinian states to exist side by side, as was illustrated once again very clearly this week during the remarkable visit of the presidents of both parliaments.
It is impossible to live there in peace in one state but people can quite easily co-exist as good neighbours.
Fair enough, Europe is to blame and should help solve the problems.
But that does not take away the fact that the situation which has arisen in Fiji is completely unacceptable.
The equal rights of the large Indian minority, the constitution and parliamentary democracy must be restored.
Those who use racism to their advantage must be punished and at least be excluded from political power, the refugees must be able to return home, and violence must come to an end.
The multi-racial constitution of 1997, which came about following a previous coup d' Ã©tat after lengthy negotiations, must be restored without delay.
Mr President, I speak as a friend of Fiji, as someone who has followed events there for many years.
I have friends and acquaintances there and have been there.
When I spoke to the politicians the last time I was there three or four years ago the one thing they were all pleased about was the new constitution which had taken four years to put together, and when I saw the events of recent times my heart sank because I knew the consequences for that country.
I should like clarification from you, Commissioner.
From what you said, I assume you are saying no sanctions, that it is a matter of wait and see and giving them time to sort themselves out before we take any action.
I would like clarity on that point.
I do not want to walk away from here just assuming that; it would be helpful if you could be more explicit.
Mr Ford has called for Fiji to be banned from all sporting events.
My sport happens to be a minority sport - rugby league football - and in October or November the World Cup will be taking place in the UK and in France.
Fiji will have a squad there as part of the World Cup.
The Australian Government wants them banned.
The Australian Government thinks that Fiji should not take part in this competition.
If you speak to the players, whether they be Asian, Polynesian or Melanesian, they will say they want to play, of course.
My specific question to you, Commissioner, is would the Commission advocate sporting bans at this time or not?
It may be quite useful for us, as politicians, to be confronted with the question of whether sports and politics should have anything to do with each other or not.
It is a very useful exercise in analysing the extent of our principles and whether or not there are human activities that should be quite independent.
Sport today is not only sport, it is also business.
For that reason the world of sport has created more difficulties for itself than used to be the case in more innocent times.
As far as I am informed, unlike the line you say they are following with rugby, the Australians, when it comes to participation in the Olympic Games are maintaining a clear distinction between politics and sport.
We have no specific view in the Commission as to one event or another.
At this moment we are engaging in the dialogue of the LomÃ© Convention, so at this stage we have not drawn conclusions.
In answer to your more general question, there may very well be broad sanctions, but it depends on the outcome of the dialogue.
This dialogue is well-organised and systematic based on the beauty of our relationship with ACP countries.
It is not just a donor-recipient relationship.
We have the background of a system to work from. This system is put to work in the given situation.
The options are open.
We have both the stick and the carrot.
We are actively drawing into this debate the regional ACP partners and giving the authorities in the country in question a say in the discussion.
But it is an extremely critical situation.
It contains all the dilemmas that situations like this normally present.
It is not easy to find out what the right thing to do is but we are doing everything to mobilise pressure for a rapid, irreversible return to democracy.
This is also the reply to Mrs Maes.
We do have a very important role as a trading partner and donor in Fiji and this creates a serious framework for the present discussion with the people in power in Fiji.
As regards coming back to the Parliament, I would say that I am always of course willing to go to the Development Committee and discuss any issue.
I would certainly like to have an opportunity to go more into detail before the end of the year if this is something the committee would welcome.
I can fully concur with everything Mr Ford said.
It is really tragic what is happening.
Also, as others said, the risk of a negative spillover in the region should also be taken into consideration when we are deciding what our measures should be.
One important measure that was taken - and this is a comment for Mr Van Hecke - was to call off the signing ceremony planned for Fiji.
So it is not the Suva Agreement that will govern our future relationship with the ACP states.
We went to Benin instead of Fiji in the summer and that, in fact, was a strong measure from both the EU side and the ACP side that it was taken as a natural thing that we could not sign the new agreement in Fiji.
So, in political terms we have already sent a strong message.
Mr President, in the joint compromise resolution there is a reference to setting a deadline at the end of November for a restoration of democracy.
Would the Commissioner accept that is a suitable target and a suitable deadline?
Otherwise, the danger is the current government in Fiji will go on negotiating forever, but never come to a conclusion.
If we reflect on the ethics of picking a date, that date is far too late, but the operational, practical idea of fixing a date is to put meaningful pressure on the partner in the discussion.
I am not sure that particular date is meaningful.
We have partners in the ACP Group who are part of the process of convincing and putting pressure on Fiji to do the right thing.
I would not like to dictate a date just like that.
I prefer to have my partners in the south well on board in the process, also taking into consideration the risk of the negative spill-over in the region.
I would not be willing to accept a specific date at this stage.
There is a tactical necessity not to create the problem.
The debate is closed.
I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure .
The vote on these motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)
Tribute
I am afraid I have to start today by announcing the passing away yesterday of our fellow member, Mr GÃŒnter LÃŒttge, who died after a serious illness.
Mr LÃŒttge became an MEP in 1989 and was mainly involved in transport policy.
I suggest we observe a minute' s silence in his memory.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, referring to the text adopted yesterday and the issue of human cloning, item 8 in the English version, paragraph 11, reads 'considers that any temporary committee set up by this Parliament ....'.
It does not actually say that such a temporary committee should be set up.
Could we have some guidance as to what the presidency will do about this particular section of the resolution?
I shall submit this to the Conference of Presidents, Mr Adam, and you will be notified of the outcome.
Mr President, my name does not seem to be on yesterday's attendance list although I did actually sign in.
Mr Bowis, that will be duly corrected and amended.
Mr President, following up the point that Mr Adam made, I presume you will report back at the beginning of the mini-session on the result and, of course, if there is a proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee this House will have to vote on it.
That will be the course of action, Mr Ford.
(The Minutes were approved)
European Year of Lifelong Learning (1996)
The next item is the report (A5-0200/2000) by Mr GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission report to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the European Year of Lifelong Learning (1996), submitted pursuant to Article 8 of European Parliament and Council Decision 2493/95/EC [COM(1999) 447 - C5-0205/1999 - 1999/2163(COS)]
Mr President, the report on the European Year of Lifelong Learning is seemingly an unimportant document, and yet it has revealed significant gaps and black spots in the European system.
The report concerns a year of information and promotion in response to the Luxembourg Summit and other summits, at which tremendous importance was given to training as a means of integrating Europeans into working life, irrespective of age.
The report has shown, first of all, that when money is invested in education, that money is multiplied.
The Member States keen to participate quadrupled their budgets.
That is, money invested in education gives the best results as it is multiplied and does not lead to fraud, or anything like that.
Secondly, the European Year of Lifelong Learning highlighted the Commission's difficulty in providing information and responses and being transparent.
It was practically impossible to gather all the necessary documentation, partly, it seems, because the Member States do not provide it, and partly because there are no procedures for collecting it with the necessary ease and speed.
We have therefore turned the report into a response and a series of recommendations on the criteria that we think lifelong learning should meet.
We found ourselves with a muddle of criteria, partly introduced by the Council, as the document published by the Commission, the proposal for the Year of Lifelong Learning, was of far higher quality.
It is clear that we need much more clarity over training.
However, training for integration, language teaching and recreational training for the elderly is mixed up with training for work, resulting in such a muddle that it is impossible to make an assessment or gauge the quality and know what the criteria are for good practice.
So, we are asking for the educational objectives to be clearly distinguished and regulated.
Obviously, education for the integration of immigrants is not the same as training for new qualifications, training for a first job or retraining, or many other types.
We have therefore requested clarity and better organisation of the system as a whole.
We have also requested greater lifelong learning and retraining for teachers.
It is clear that, if we consider lifelong learning to be simply for unqualified groups, account will not be taken of retraining university staff and teachers at training centres, who have to be the flagship of knowledge and disseminate information in society.
Finally, we have asked that it be made quite clear where the money from the Structural Funds for training, which is not monitored, is going.
From our point of view, this is a key issue.
What we cannot have is Europe paying so little attention to education and the education funds being used for other purposes.
One of the great problems of European history stems from the fact that once social classes have fought their way up the social scale and succeeded in integrating into the ruling classes, they have imitated the faults of the aristocracy, they have become conceited and lost sight of the value of training and the fight to retain the knowledge they have acquired.
So, we are living in an aristocratic Europe, which does not want to concern itself with education, which has become somewhat conceited about being European.
We consider that it is enough to be a European citizen and we do not realise that if we want to have researchers, if we want to have a truly competitive Europe, we need to take care of our human resources.
Europe needs to realise that, in spite of the subsidiarity principle, training people and helping them to manage themselves and their future is one of the fundamental objectives of its existence.
Therefore, a Europe that only takes care of its own interests, a Europe of subsidies, a Europe with teachers who only want to reduce their teaching hours, a Europe that contemplates and confuses trade union policy with educational policy is a worrying Europe.
I would like to draw attention to this situation, and I believe that we must rethink our attitude towards education, as we are talking about people and our future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the report before us, undoubtedly so that we can make improvements to it, as the rapporteur, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines said.
I also think, however, that we ought again to use this morning' s discussion to raise awareness once more and to make people aware of education again.
We are all delighted with the new achievements of our age: travel, the Internet, mobile phones and simultaneous television broadcasts from the other side of the world, as we are now experiencing again with the Olympic Games in Australia.
These are all achievements, but also signs of the time and of the society in which we live: the information age, the information society, the age of knowledge, technology and globalisation, to mention but a few designations.
All are characterised by a very rapid pace of change and by an enormous number of transformations, indeed revolutions, which have been triggered, and continue to be triggered, by the new knowledge.
The dissemination of information and knowledge is now incomparably faster and more extensive than it was even a few years ago.
People must be prepared for this vertiginous and fascinating roller coaster of change.
From the earliest days of childhood, from schooldays in fact, the key words have been lifelong learning.
That tenet is now only half the truth, however, and it cannot remain so, for the processes of change and transformation in society, in the world of work and in the environment are by no means over after school or after training, but continue and become still more marked.
Human beings must therefore learn to meet these challenges themselves and to adjust to lifelong learning.
Only in that way can we all, in future, also participate in the fine achievements of our age, that is to say, hold our own in the ever more rapidly changing competitiveness of life - both personal and professional - and both seize and help to create opportunities.
In order to help these insights come to the fore throughout Europe, 1996 was designated the European Year of Lifelong Learning.
With relatively modest financial resources of ECU 8.4 million from the European Union, a much welcomed ECU 34 million was raised for the project with the help of partner countries from the European Economic Area: Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Norway.
In many congresses, seminars and PR events, there was constructive discussion in all areas of society of the necessity and opportunities for rethinking education in the direction of lifelong learning.
These are opportunities - especially for Europe and European integration - of which we can avail ourselves here and now: knowledge of other languages, other cultures, other ways of life, everything that is so important for us as Europe grows together.
The European Year of Lifelong Learning set us thinking in a way which must be continued and consolidated.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the traditional concept of education was that students would cease learning when they left school.
It is true that a small elite would continue to create, pass on or acquire new knowledge and ideas, but for the great majority, leaving school meant the end of formal education.
Things have changed radically.
Learning has become broader and longer.
New methods and sources for acquiring knowledge and training have appeared.
Anyone who does not keep up with this progress, these new requirements, risks becoming marginalised, undervalued in his or her professional life, risks losing social status and suffering intellectual impoverishment.
It is said, and rightly so, that we are becoming a society of information and knowledge. The great philosopher Nietzsche, however, warned us that it is impossible to found a civilisation on knowledge.
This warning should give us food for thought.
Although, today, there is no alternative to scientific progress and to the increase in knowledge and information, the truth of the matter is that lifelong learning cannot be reduced simply to the acquisition of useful skills. It must be part of a culture, of a set of values that provide meaning for mankind' s life in society.
Lifelong learning and training has therefore become an indispensable factor that states, educational bodies and the public themselves can no longer underestimate.
Holding the European Year of Lifelong Learning and Training was an important step and a symbolic moment in raising the awareness of the European people with regard to this new state of affairs.
The theorising that preceded and continued throughout the European Year of Lifelong Learning and the considerable interest it raised in schools and citizens' groups made a major contribution to this.
'Lifelong learning and training' has definitively entered the vocabulary of politicians, educationalists and businesspeople.
Even more importantly, these words have also become part of everyday language.
Lifelong learning and training has also become an instrument in the fight against academic failure, students giving up on education and illiteracy.
It is therefore a good cause.
For these reasons, this initiative was valuable, timely and fruitful.
Its objectives were achieved and what was lacking in funds was compensated for by the harnessing of goodwill and by the number of people who signed up to it.
The line between people' s first educational experiences and later opportunities has now been crossed.
Education...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the Liberal Group' s support for the report by Mrs Cristina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, which, as she herself mentioned in the introduction to her report, is not, and should not be, considered to be purely a formality, a summary of the application of the European Year of Learning in 1996, but rather as an analysis that serves to make a series of proposals on what the standing of education should be in its various fields, including the fields of lifelong learning and vocational and technical training, which deserve special attention.
This coincides with the ideas expressed a few months ago at the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, when all the Member States pledged to develop a series of measures at European Union level so that, during this decade, the European Union can become a leading society at international level and achieve the levels of competence that North America has today, particularly in technological areas.
To be precise, the key element in the process to achieve this level of competence lies in training, education and in a society with levels of excellence that lay the necessary foundations for progress to be made in the most technologically developed and advanced fields of scientific and technological innovation.
The report by Mrs Cristina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, and she has also mentioned this today, shows the imbalances that still exist in the field of education between the level of the European Union and national level, that is, on the one hand we want action in education at European Union level, but on the other, the Member States do not want to give up their competences and establish true cooperation on an educational level.
It is true that there are some programmes that we always use as references, such as Socrates or Leonardo, but in precisely these programmes, we must recognise the lack of sufficient resources to achieve the scope and effect that we would like.
Finally, I therefore recommend that you pay particular attention to points 16, 17, 18, 19, 23 and 24, which constitute a good guide for the achievement of these higher levels of education at European Union level.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on her excellent work and also on the commendable way in which she cooperated in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
Philosophical and literary texts, as well as popular wisdom, tell us that 'you are never too old to learn' .
The 'Lifelong Learning' initiative was a perfectly proper one and the result of a wise decision, aimed at doing justice to the demands of the twenty-first century and at enabling people to adjust to these demands.
It is mainly the early phases of life which, right into our own time, have been, and remain, the time for education and training.
The importance of lifelong learning cannot, however, be limited to the spheres of education and training policy alone.
Its success also depends, in large measure, upon labour-market policy and upon the successful dissemination of science and technology.
Lifelong learning begins where schooling, or basic education, leaves off, and this is where the first and, in my view, also the greatest weakness of this wonderful initiative is to be found.
Lifelong learning can only work if there is a change to the way in which, and above all the pace at which, basic education under the original educational systems is adapted.
In a knowledge society, one of the main functions of schooling should be to offer students methods they need to gain access to large amounts of information, to understand this information and to transform it into knowledge.
Syllabuses, or the means by which learning has so far been imparted, must be fundamentally altered.
I do not of course want to interfere in the nation states, but this is, nonetheless, an idea which we ought to explore communally in this European Community.
Instead, the direction taken should be an individual one, but with social components.
We need to learn more about arguing critically, about increasing students' self-confidence and about increasing their ability to express themselves in language.
Skills of this kind will become ever more important alongside instrumental skills such as the ability to write, to acquire other languages and to do arithmetic.
One goal must be to enable pupils constantly to update their knowledge and skills so that they are neither able nor willing to view a diploma or certificate as the end of a learning process or as a seal of approval upon something finally completed.
Our society must break away from the outdated system of school, work and pension.
Lifelong learning begins, then, with the reform of our schooling.
The individual must learn for him or herself.
That is not something it lies within our power to bring about, but we can do a lot to help bring it about, for the population of Europe is not, of course, just a human resource for the European labour market, but a wealth of marvellous individuals.
Allow me to give a personal example by way of conclusion. I know a joiner in a small suburb of Vienna where the prejudice is still somewhat commonly held that anyone who works with their hands must not be very well educated.
This joiner is between 40 and 50 years of age, speaks four languages and is known as something of a philosopher.
A Europe of people like that would be my ideal.
Mr President, in Finland we ordinary people say: 'All in the good time of the powers-that-be.'
We could say the same in connection with this, as the political balance sheet for the Year of Lifelong Learning (1996) is yet to be reckoned.
In spite of the time wasted, the rapporteur regrets that the qualitative assessment of the implementation of the theme year programme is imperfect.
The number of opportunities can surely be counted in a shorter space of time than this.
In a seminar on the European paper industry held here in Strasbourg on Wednesday a representative of employees in the industry turned our intention to an important issue.
When we purchase hardware, it is always an investment, but when we acquire software labelled 'company staff training' , it is not considered to be an investment.
The rapporteur has justifiably emphasised this.
Training has to be considered to be an investment and not a running cost.
We must stress the importance of the fact that lifelong learning also involves an all-round educational element and not just a professional one.
Far too often training is too biased in its scope, and that is especially true today of information society development.
Electronic programs are complicated and get more so all the time.
Those who master the language of software often do not understand the language of its content.
Can I ask something that is being asked in Finland now? A man speaks six languages, but what has he got to say?
A person might speak the language of computers in the information society, but perhaps he has nothing else to say.
It is only noughts and ones anyway.
In this, we are clashing with the eEurope strategy, which the Commission prepared for the Lisbon summit.
Much attention was paid to hardware in it, but little to that software which we call training software.
The public must be trained, not only to use computers, but also to use them for their own benefit.
People must know how to use computers for beneficial and essential purposes so they can improve their own way of working and take better control of their lives.
Nowadays, everyone must have the necessary reading and writing skills to use the various forms of electronic media to their advantage.
This new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning.
When, under the eEurope programme, the aim is in place to bring a computer cable into every home, that will increase democracy.
These days, democracy is created by everyone having equal access to a diverse array of information.
For the information to be fully exploited we have to remember that learning is also a social event.
Training cannot be left to depend on the eEurope programme alone: we also need social communities for it.
As no one knows everything, an individual must be able to decide for him/herself what is worth knowing.
If the state makes that decision it is just a step away from propaganda and indoctrination.
When we examine EU programmes, which are often mean the same kind of thing for everyone or contain demands for conformity on the part of everyone, we see we are turning the EU into a totalitarian federation.
We need lifelong learning and all-round educational knowledge, so that we can counter the attempt by the European Union to create a European totalitarian state and be its politburo.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just an hour ago I was still sitting with my French teacher, making a big effort to learn some more French.
I must tell you, it is really fun learning a language.
It is good when you know that you do not have to take an examination afterwards but are learning for yourself and in order to communicate with other people and treat them in the right way.
I have to say that I am honestly enjoying learning French
(The President asked the speaker whether he might not like to continue his speech in French.)
(Laughter)
I believe that that is also what we need in the future: for learning to be fun.
In life, the learning pyramid is, in fact, turning.
When it comes to learning, we really used to think of young full-time students, whereas now we see that people in employment are having to learn more and more.
I believe that we, ourselves, in the European Parliament can confirm that we are actually, day by day, doing more in the way of learning, evaluating and passing judgment than ever we had to do at school or university.
With increasing age, you also become more aware of what it is you would like to learn.
You become significantly more selective, and it is the very joy of learning that makes you enthusiastic and want to learn new things.
What we have here, then, is a paradigm shift, not only in the economy, but also in broad strata of society, not only through e-learning and the new opportunities provided by technology, but also through a change in consciousness.
I believe that this very change in consciousness shows that adults in all walks of life really do consider lifelong learning of this kind to be more and more important.
I therefore consider it a very good thing that we in the European Parliament should have a good look at long-term strategic issues of this kind.
Especially on a Friday like today, it is important, I believe, that we should also have the courage to think in terms of long-term strategy about how we might best provide support to the people of Europe.
Particularly for elderly people, the subject of health becomes increasingly important on into old age.
We still have a lot to learn about, for example, how to eat properly and how to treat our bodies.
I believe that precisely these fundamental virtues are very important for the future.
What do we need now at the level of the European Community?
We need a general system of accreditation for private, public and in-house education, a European education passport like a European driving licence so that the building blocks of education can be used and compared throughout Europe.
We need ways of comparing educational expenditure and revenue throughout Europe, as well as ways of comparing qualifications.
We should be trying to introduce best practices worldwide as a spur to positive competition.
We ought to be learning from the whole world which system and which form of education are best for our people and citizens in Europe.
Mr President, I hope I will not strike too discordant a note, but it seems to me this debate has been excessively self-congratulatory so far.
When I picked up the agenda and read the phrase 'Year of Lifelong Learning' it seemed to me that this was an oxymoron similar to the phrase 'military intelligence' .
A year seems a short time for the project.
The question is: how valuable are these 'Year of ...' enterprises when applications for funding have to be submitted within three months and everything will have to be carried out in one year.
I have been at the receiving end of such systems, both as a university teacher and when I was involved in an educational and social charity.
From the point of view of people trying to do the job, these challenges, at very short notice and with very little explanation of how applications are to be made and what criteria are to be applied, can do at least as much harm as good.
One can always point to the fact afterwards that the money was spent and other money came in and that good things have been achieved; but could things have been done better?
Both the Committee reports - the Committee report and the subsidiary Committee opinion - draw attention to the fact that the assessment methodology used by the Commission was not very exact and the criteria set were not particularly clear.
This is not to say we should not do these things, but we should do them better and reflect very carefully on what can best be done at Community level and what at lower levels, not even at Member State level or in autonomous regions within the Member States, but right down at the level of schools, colleges and universities.
My constituency has just come through a serious crisis in its educational assessment, partly due to a lack of proper consultation with classroom teachers.
Grandiose ideas issued from on high and not adequately and rigorously tested at the sharp end will always fail, sometimes with damaging consequences for individuals and for society.
Subsidiarity matters, especially in a field like education and lifelong learning, and we forget that at our peril.
Networking can be useful in disseminating ideas for best practice, but we must not delude ourselves that a Year of Lifelong Learning will make a real difference.
That can only come from the commitment of the people on the ground.
Those are the people we must respect and encourage and support.
We are all in favour of lifelong learning, but let us not be too self-congratulatory when the evidence is so thin.
Lifelong learning is something we all look upon with the greatest benevolence.
We can hear that especially from this discussion.
When it comes to taking action, however, the situation is often the reverse.
I agree with the rapporteur who criticises the Commission' s efforts on behalf of lifelong learning during 1996, the year of the relevant campaign, together with the slipshod evaluation which followed.
Lifelong learning is a phenomenon requiring a lot of resources.
It demands new thinking on educational policy and calls for financial resources to be prioritised.
Allow me to begin by commenting on the new thinking required.
In our education systems, we specialise in the contrary, that is to say self-enclosed educational courses, limited by time and with heavy emphasis upon the final examination.
Lifelong learning requires the opposite, namely continuity and courses of long duration.
It is no longer enough to educate for the immediate needs of the workplace.
Now, it is a matter of educating people for life.
We therefore need new forms of organisation in education.
We need new educational ideas and tools.
Perhaps the greatest problem is that which many other speakers have raised, namely access to money.
We need to allocate much greater resources to education than we have done up until now, both to the workplace and to the public education system, as well as to other areas.
There must be money to pay for the costs of education and also to replace income in the form of wages, especially in the case of those who need to study full-time.
It is especially important to be able to finance the fairly long study periods which may be required if people are to be able to move from traditional sectors to new areas of the labour market.
Because access to money is always a problem, I think that quantitative objectives are required in connection with expenditure on adult education.
Consideration might be given to earmarking a certain proportion of companies' production costs for this purpose, a specific percentage of the State budget, a particular portion of normal working hours or, if appropriate, a certain number of the individual' s working hours. Alternatively, other similar quantitative measures might be made use of.
The Swedish Presidency, which will begin on 1 January 2001, has said that lifelong learning will be one of its priorities.
I think we could call upon the Swedish Government to propose just such quantitative objectives for lifelong adult education.
Many speakers here in the Chamber have agreed about the need to set financial priorities.
Perhaps we could issue a joint statement to the Swedish Presidency on this issue.
Mr President, one of the most pleasant forms of lifelong learning is membership of the European Parliament and, especially, participation in these Friday sittings at which, for once, you have the time to deal with the reports of colleagues from other specialist fields.
I hope that a majority of this House will also learn and not go ahead and abolish these Friday sittings.
But now to the subject in hand.
Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines has submitted an excellent report which is also very critical of the fact that our heads of state and government are constantly making grandiose announcements.
The Feira Summit was just such an occasion - a pure media event, to use the buzz word. Very little of substance happened, however.
Little is being provided for in terms of the budget and few resources are available, because it is all about appearances.
We need to put an end to this kind of spin.
I am therefore very grateful for the sound report which Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines has submitted.
One thing, of course, she has quite clearly emphasised is the importance of the subsidiarity principle. Nonetheless, resources must also be invested at European level.
Above all, value must be attached to quality in this area, and quality means setting priorities.
One of our priorities must be to extend precisely this idea of lifelong learning to people in the candidate States for, in Central and Eastern Europe, a totalitarian system has, for decades, robbed people of the opportunity to develop freely.
It is a great failing of our strategy that we concentrate very heavily upon young people in these countries.
It is obviously important to do that as well, but the bulk of people are elderly - elderly people who have to overcome decades of dictatorship but who are, today, able to make a fresh start.
This too is something we need to support by making this area a priority.
I should also like to say that, in my view, elderly people in particular, who nowadays still have twenty or thirty productive years in front of them after they retire, must be able to play an increased part in our society.
As a part of this process, there must also be educational opportunities.
I am sorry that, nowadays, the discussion is about increasingly closing the doors of universities to older people, charging fees and ensuring that older people can no longer take an active part in the life of universities.
Mr President, GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines' report states that the Union administration' s besetting sin - its slow start to getting measures off the ground - afflicted the theme year of lifelong learning.
National coordinating bodies suffered from such matters as materials arriving late and there not being enough of them.
Furthermore, things moved slowly when it came to using the Internet.
That naturally made it hard to implement the theme year programme.
Unfortunately, the situation appears to be the same with the Socrates programme 2 that has just started.
Messages of concern are coming from national agencies that the agreements between them and the Commission are still not finalised and there is a lack of certainty about payment.
This cannot help but be reflected also in the implementation of the adult education component, Grundvik, which forms part of Socrates.
That is a pity.
The administrative problems associated with Socrates have to be resolved swiftly for the Union' s input into lifelong learning to come within reach of the people.
Training and education are being seen more and more clearly as European resources.
They do not mean just vital items of expenditure.
Hopefully the change in attitudes will also be reflected before long in the Union' s budget.
But the Year of European Languages, organised for next year, will have to persevere in the same way, appropriations being as meagre as they were with the Year of Lifelong Learning.
Parliament, however, did its best to establish a legal basis in time for the measures to be effected.
Although training comes under the principle of subsidiarity, its European dimension is strengthening all the time.
European success in global competition is built on skilled and involved people.
Lifelong learning is essential in the fight against unemployment and exclusion.
It is justifiable that the report adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport should contain a request to the Commission to apply the notion of further education, not only at the level of advanced know-how and skills and universities, but also in traditional professions, particularly the craftsmen trades.
Lifelong learning, as such, is often seen only as a necessary regeneration of the workforce.
It should, however, be a fundamental right of every citizen, leading not just to improved professional skills, but also to human growth, happiness and understanding.
The facilities modern technology offers for learning can be brought within everybody' s reach.
That opportunity must be taken.
Mr President, paragraph 16 of Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines' excellent report calls for training designed to correct school failures.
It would be far better if we could avoid that sort of failure.
The saddest case of all is a school leaver with no qualifications to his credit descending into hopelessness.
A situation which becomes sadder and sadder as the occupations available to those with no qualifications become scarcer and scarcer.
The reason is often that the young teenager is discouraged from learning by the rigidities of an education system that sticks to established lines and tries to fit square pegs into round holes.
I appeal to the Commission to look favourably on a research programme into the use and development of aptitude tests to identify at an early stage - 12 or 13 years old at the latest - what a young person is going to be good at, no matter what that profession, occupation or job may be.
Schools have to respond by providing courses at which young people will succeed.
Success encourages further ambition.
It means satisfied, enthusiastic teenagers instead of discouraged troublemakers.
It means school-leavers with light in their eyes, with excitement about the future, able to contribute to society.
It means school-leavers with a passport to a better and more fulfilling life.
Nothing is more vital to the future of Europe than the young people who are going to build that Europe.
There is not one young person who cannot play his part.
We have to enable this sadly wasted potential to be mobilised and to succeed.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Explanations of vote
Mr President, I voted for this important document, and its importance has been stressed by all the speakers, particularly by Mrs Echerer who said: 'You are never too old to learn', by Mr Posselt, who is so eager to support the elderly that I could give him a Pensioners' Party membership card, and by Commissioner Barnier himself, who has assured us of his strong commitment in this area.
However, Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party to the European Parliament, I call for words to be translated into action.
The elderly in the Member States have no opportunity learn, have no help from national states and are not even allowed to use school buildings, which accommodate children in the morning and could accommodate old people in the afternoon.
Mr President, my reference to Communist dictatorships has clearly triggered feelings of great agitation in an MEP from the extreme left.
I should therefore like to say that today' s vote has been very important.
The people in his party, the PDS, are clearly determined not to learn anything new for the rest of their lives.
I am therefore very pleased that we have adopted this report by a large majority.
Mr President, lifelong learning must be a responsibility not only of the European Commission and the European institutions but also, and especially, of the Member States.
I voted in favour because I believe that tax advantages for professional and private education must be placed centre-stage so that educational sponsorship, in particular, becomes a possibility, too.
Incentives must be created so that, in order to take some of the pressure off the system, foundations can take over educational establishments and sponsorship can be broadly based.
I also believe, however, that we ought to set an example at European level.
Every year, we ought to devise and evaluate training and further education syllabuses for our officials and politicians to enable us to measure how we are meeting our own needs for professional development.
Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece is in favour of a state lifelong learning system, since it will give workers the chance to improve their knowledge and professional skills as well as their contribution to society as a whole and their standard of living.
However, the model being promoted by the European Union merely attempts to patch over the shortcomings in an education system which turns out disposable workers who are unable to keep up with developments in the productive process.
Workers are forced to pass their entire lives in a vicious circle of work, unemployment, training and so on and so forth.
Despite identifying certain shortcomings in the system, Mr GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines' report fails to go far enough in analysing the causes or suggesting remedies, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote.
.
(FR) I should like to begin by stressing that access to a good level of education and training is the right of every individual in order to develop his potential and ability to fit into the economic, social and cultural environment.
This fundamental fact has fuelled debates at the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira.
We further acknowledged that this right must be adapted to cater for the advent of the information society.
New information and communications technology do indeed have serious repercussions on teaching methodology.
It is now acknowledged that education and training should be a lifelong process and so, throughout these summit meetings, the Commission and the Member States have been encouraged to define coherent strategies and practical measures in order to make lifelong education and training accessible to all.
Some parties had, however, begun to consider this subject well before that, since, even in 1996, the Commission proposed to the Council and to Parliament that the year 1996 be declared the 'European Year of Lifelong Learning' .
The purpose of this year was to make European citizens aware of new concepts in academic and vocational education and to conduct joint discussions with all the operators involved in the role and the stakes of education and training at the dawn of the twenty-first century.
Given the high stakes involved, I can only, like our rapporteur, deplore the fact that the budget for the European Year of Lifelong Learning was limited to EUR 8.4 million for the fifteen Member States and their three partners in the EEA.
By the same token, we must deplore the flagrant lack of qualitative data in the Commission report.
The Commission should therefore improve the quality of its reports in future.
In future programmes, their work should concentrate on defining with greater precision the various concepts and aspects of vocational and lifelong training.
They should also speedily implement action programmes and specific measures in the context of a lifelong education and training strategy.
The implementation of such measures must be coordinated with the Socrates II and Leonardo programmes.
It is up to us to ensure that all citizens can benefit from this training in new technologies, as there is a great danger of seeing a 'digital divide' being established between the men and women who have the means to access this technology and those who do not.
The entire debate on the place of universal public service in new telecommunications networks is also involved.
Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 10.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 8 September 2000.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Madam President, sadly, there was another incident of violence in Italy yesterday: a teacher who is Christian by religion but of Jewish origin was attacked and beaten up by a group of skinheads in Verona.
Incidents of this nature must be condemned immediately by Parliament and others, for it is unthinkable that any hint of anti-Semitism and xenophobia should still be allowed to exist within our Union.
I therefore feel that, laying aside political differences, this House should send a signal, a message expressing our solidarity, to the teacher who was attacked simply because he is of the Jewish race.
Madam President, I would like to thank you, and indeed all the Members of Parliament, in advance, for your message of solidarity.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
We shall consider the best way of passing on this entirely justified protest.
Madam President, I asked for the floor to raise the same point.
I would be grateful if you could pass on Parliament' s concerns, its fierce condemnation of this act and its sympathy to the young Catholic teacher who was so brutally attacked because of his Jewish origins.
I shall be very happy to do that.
Madam President, I too would like to support Mr Tajani and all the other Members who have spoken on the subject in their condemnation of the racist attack on a Christian teacher of Jewish origin which has taken place in my country, in Verona to be precise.
These incidents are incomprehensible, and not only must they be condemned but the perpetrators severely punished.
Madam President, I too would like to support Mr Tajani' s statement, which has been echoed in speeches from a number of different quarters and parties.
On behalf of the party which I represent, the Alleanza Nazionale, I therefore join you all with the utmost solidarity in severely condemning incidents which make us ashamed to be European.
I feel that the sensitivity of this Parliament, in which right and left are united on this matter, will contribute to combating such shameful incidents and eradicating them once and for all.
I would like to raise as a point of order the fact that the Quaestors have made a recommendation that during constituency weeks next year MEPs should be allowed a daily allowance if they are in Brussels.
I would like to urge you, Madam President and the Bureau members - I understand this is coming on your agenda very soon - to think very carefully before taking this decision because constituency weeks are a very good idea.
There is a desperate need for MEPs to communicate with the electorate in a much more effective way.
The fact that we had such a poor turnout in the European elections proves that this is the case and, if we allow people to sign in during constituency weeks, we are undermining the whole point of them.
We are giving fuel to the Eurosceptics who think that we are pumping up our own expenses and we look like hypocrites at a time when we are asking the Commission to reform.
Madam President, I urge you and the Bureau members to consider this issue very carefully and turn down the request by the Quaestors.
I have not yet received this recommendation by the Quaestors.
That is why it has not yet been placed on our Bureau' s agenda.
Once I have received it, the Bureau will, of course, examine it very carefully indeed.
I wish to draw our fellow MEPs' attention to a demonstration which is leaving Brussels today for Paris and to ask them to exercise the utmost vigilance where this is concerned.
