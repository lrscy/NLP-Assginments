(DE) Madam President, it has never happened to me before that my name was so well pronounced by the British interpreters.
I just wanted to take the opportunity to express my warm gratitude.
That is the first time since I entered this Parliament that it has been pronounced absolutely correctly.
Thank you very much.
Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate)
The next item is the report by Bogdan Golik, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries - C6-0203/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Golik, for his excellent report on the Commission proposal for a single Council regulation for the promotion of agricultural products on the internal as well as the external markets.
The aim of the present proposal is to merge two existing Council regulations on internal and external promotion into one single regulation.
The overall goal of this exercise is totally in line with our simplification exercise and is intended to increase the transparency of the European Union's promotion scheme for agricultural products.
The objective is not to fundamentally change the information and promotion policies.
The amendments proposed by Mr Golik and his colleagues address several important issues regarding the EU promotion scheme, such as, firstly, more importance and a larger budget for promotion programmes in third countries; secondly, a higher Community share of promotion measures and, thirdly, a lower share of financial contribution by the proposing organisations.
As regards the sharing of contribution between the different partners, you know that the standard Community contribution is 50%, and that the other 50% is shared between the Member States and the proposing organisations, with the latter paying at least 20%.
This sharing of the financial burden between the different partners is based on a very long experience with the promotion programmes.
If all partners contribute and become financially involved, the chances for an efficient and well-targeted programme clearly increase.
For exceptional cases, such as the recent case of fruit and vegetables for schoolchildren, it is possible to increase the Community's share to 60%.
Regarding your idea to emphasise more programmes for promotion in third countries, I am, in principle, sympathetic towards the idea, but it has to be put into the right context.
This proposal is simply about merging two regulations; it is not about policy discussions or more money, so the right moment to have this discussion would be when we consider the future of our common agricultural policy, where our priorities should be well reflected in our budget allocation.
However, this does not mean that I am pushing promotion into the background.
As you possibly know, in our two recent reforms - the first on food and vegetables, and the one we will, hopefully, finalise at the beginning of next week, namely the wine reform - we have been focusing and underlining the importance of promoting programmes.
To take the example of wine, we have allocated EUR 120 million every year specifically for promoting our excellent European wines in third countries.
I think we are on the right track, but let us come back to this at a later stage - this is simply a merging of the two regulations.
rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, effectively, this proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries is intended to harmonise and achieve technical consolidation of two regulations currently in force.
This is all part of the broader process of simplifying Community legislation and making it more transparent.
I should like to emphasise, however, that in this case simplification is understood exclusively as a technical process.
The draft regulation before us does not, unfortunately, refer to the key principles of promotion and information laid down in the European Commission's implementing provisions.
Despite these constraints, I adopted a considerably broader and more strategic approach to the promotion of agricultural products within the European Union in my report.
The European Parliament must be able to refer to the key issues linked to such an important mechanism.
This is particularly relevant if we consider the progress of multilateral negotiations at WTO level, and also the changes in the common agricultural policy's operating conditions.
Export subsidies of all kinds are to cease by 2013. This includes Community export refunds.
A reduction in customs duties is planned.
Under these circumstances, increased action in the area of promotion and information is the only way to maintain the export competitiveness of EU agricultural products.
Such action will also help to secure new markets in third countries and increase customer awareness of the benefits of European products, thus stimulating demand.
At the same time, none of this will affect market competition conditions.
It will not have a negative impact on world trade either.
That is why we cannot allow promotion and information action to be sidelined.
On the contrary, we should accept them as a European Union priority.
Under the current system, the European Commission draws up a list of specific third-country products on which campaigns may be conducted.
This list can be reviewed every two years, whereas the programmes themselves may only be submitted once a year.
Furthermore, it is for the European Commission to make the final decision on whether a particular programme will be adopted and on the extent of the financial support it will receive.
The 2007 budget for promotion activities only amounts to EUR 45 million, and is decreasing year on year.
This is a particularly surprising trend if we consider that the number of countries in the European Union has increased, and that there has been a marked increase in the actions discussed.
Such a policy cannot effectively strengthen the Community's position and increase awareness of European quality standards, notably on third-country markets.
Appropriate financial resources are required if these ambitious aims are to be achieved.
I therefore believe that the threshold of the Community's financial involvement must be raised from 50% of the real cost of programmes to 60%.
I also propose that the minimum contribution by sectoral organisations to financing programmes should be lowered to 10%, precisely so as to enable smaller organisations to become involved.
In addition, the Community's participation could reach 70% in the case of organic farming and programmes relating to action following crisis situations such as avian influenza and BSE, for example.
Programmes should be universally accessible and more flexible.
Including all products and all countries and also allowing organisations to submit programmes at least twice a year will allow swift responses to any opportunities that might arise on the markets, and to any possibilities for producers to expand in third countries.
Returning to those aspects of the regulation pertaining to simplification, it would be sensible to include promotion actions in the Regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets.
This would improve legislative transparency.
It should be emphasised that there is a reference to the Community promotion instrument in the Regulation on the market in fruit and vegetables and also in the draft wine reform you referred to, Madam President.
Every effort should be made to avoid a situation in which provisions on resources for promotion are unduly dispersed.
In conclusion, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture who unanimously adopted this report, the European Commission representatives I met with repeatedly, the 24 Agriculture Ministers from whom I received letters on this subject, and also the relevant national and European sectoral organisations.
I should like to express my appreciation for their active cooperation and sensible comments.
These consultations enabled me to assess the existing system and also to familiarise myself with the wishes of these countries and organisations so as to incorporate them.
Finally, I believe that if a suitably larger budget is made available, promotion and information action will allow European producers and farmers to acquire new markets.
The 'Made in Europe' label will also become better recognised at world level, which is as it should be.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Golik, on his fine work, and also thank him for his splendid cooperation with us as shadow rapporteurs.
Today, as you rightly pointed out, Commissioner, the Commission is proposing a single legal framework to merge two existing Council regulations into a single regulation for the promotion of agricultural products.
The aim is to reduce and simplify procedures to allow this policy to be applied while retaining the specific nature of the action involved, depending on the location at which it is to be implemented.
This is an extremely important proposal, as acknowledged in the two proposals adopted and to be adopted on the common organisation of the market in wine.
The proposal considers it is important to promote agricultural products.
In addition, it does not merely consider promotion inside and outside the EU, but achieves a multiplier effect through national action and private action within sectors.
Courses of action have been implemented since the year 2000 to promote the virtues of European foodstuffs to consumers, their high-quality nutritional value, food safety, production processes, animal welfare and so on.
The current rules regulating promotion, however - and I mention this because I was in charge of these two regulations at the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture - have a tendency to jeopardise the system, and they must be revised with a view to simplification to allow them to function more efficiently in terms of proper use of funds.
The promotion policy must be a modern, flexible and ambitious tool if it is to meet the aspirations of operators.
I feel that is the intention of the Commission's proposal, and that is the precise intention of the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I wish to specifically mention the amendments on the purpose and scope, since it would be beneficial for promotion to be carried out in relation to trade marks and not focus solely on generic promotion.
I hope the Council and the Commission will take this report into account, and I thank them for their attention.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, this report reminds me of Alice in Wonderland and, Madam President, it is irresistible to challenge the interpreters by exclaiming '"Curiouser and Curiouser!â cried Alice'.
What is going on?
Does it really make sense for the EU to use European taxpayers' money for advertising campaigns seeking to persuade the same taxpayers that they should buy goods they have already financed through subsidies.
Of course not.
One of the EU's aims in the common agricultural policy is to guarantee consumers reasonable prices.
But, when this is done by financing from taxes instead of by productivity increases, the consumers pay just as much for their food in any case, only by different means.
On top of that, the incentive to increase productivity is weakened.
So food becomes more expensive in the long run because of this agricultural policy.
The committee advocates restrictions on competition.
When tariffs are abolished, production in the Member States is threatened by cheaper products from third countries; and the report proposes increased spending on campaigns aimed at strengthening the Union's brand and boosting consumption in the Union.
The proposal reeks of covert protectionism!
We have seen many examples of EU advertising campaigns before.
In 1997 advertising campaigns were run to promote cut flowers produced in the EU when imports became cheaper thanks to the abolition of tariffs.
The eminent Swedish columnist, Johan Hakelius, wrote as follows in a leading Swedish newspaper: 'When EU citizens buy the same kind of flowers all across Europe, of course cohesion and European harmony increase.
Tulips are vital to peace'.
In this House, it is perhaps necessary to point out that this was intended as irony ...
In 2000 the EU had 450 000 tonnes of olive oil in storage, and the EU decided to run advertising campaigns in the northern countries to inform us how good and beneficial olive oil was.
In 2007 the European Parliament voted money for advertising in the milk sector in order to protect it from increased market liberalisation.
A reform of the common agricultural policy is actually taking place.
It is making slow progress, but it is making progress.
However, the rapporteur's proposals take several steps backwards.
They seek to replace the reforms which are finally taking place with increased sales promotion measures and information campaigns.
The rapporteur puts the blame on the WTO and wants to increase the number of products which should get this support.
This is nothing more than unfair competition with agricultural producers in countries outside the EU.
The common agricultural policy must eventually be abolished and prices and production be determined by supply and demand, just as happens in all other sectors.
We are stuck with an unreasonable system because of unfortunate decisions in the past.
Hence it is all the more important that we move in the right direction.
The recommendation here is, regrettably, that we should take the wrong direction.
The money which can now be released to benefit the population of Europe through tariff reductions, removal of export restitutions and reduced national support must not be frittered away in more appropriations for sales promotion measures and information campaigns.
Promotion campaigns and advertising for goods and services must be paid for by the producers, not by hard-pressed taxpayers.
Europe is on quite the wrong track in this area, as in so many others.
The EU must be a Europe of freedom, in which people and businesses compete for the favour of consumers and not for that of the protectionists.
For Europe's sake I wish that I could be optimistic, but unfortunately I cannot.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contribution to this very important debate.
I hope that we can all agree on the fact that it is important that we have a budget available to explain to consumers the high quality of European products, both within the European Union and on the overseas markets.
I must say that I am a bit surprised that this should be considered a protectionist approach, because we are in a situation where all Member States within the European Union and all other players in the agricultural commodity market are promoting their products to the consumer.
On this, we within the European Union have completely clear stands, because we have high-quality products, with regard to the environment, with regard to animal welfare and with regard to the high level of veterinary standards.
On the point of underspending of the budget or the fact that the budget has been decreasing, it has not been possible to spend the money, because there has been no interest on the overseas markets from producer organisations.
I hope that this problem will be solved when we merge those two different regulations, so that it is much easier, much more flexible, to handle.
I would be open to having a discussion, maybe within the health check, on how we set goalposts for the future of our promotion campaigns for our agricultural products.
I think, at the very least, a proper time to have this discussion would be when we have the discussion on the budget for the future, meaning after 2013.
However, I think we have sent some clear signals, both within the fruit and vegetable reform and within the wine reform, on the importance of promotion for our production.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 12 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - With the recent common agricultural policy reforms and possible future developments in World Trade Organisation negotiations, there is clearly a genuine need to enhance Community promotion mechanisms concerning agricultural production.
Moreover, the implementation of the Action Plan on Simplification calls indeed for the design of a single legal framework on the promotion of agricultural products for both internal and external markets.
Promotion instruments and campaigns should be given the utmost importance when bearing in mind the foreseen tariff cuts, the elimination of export refunds and the Community domestic support cuts.
In this respect, it is obvious that we ought to increase the scope and the budget for the promotion of our agricultural production to ensure viable competitiveness for our products on both internal and external markets.
As a matter of fact, it is essential to increase the budgetary means to ensure quality promotion instruments and transparent measures within a single and simplified legal framework.
More specifically, this morning debate on the wine common market organisation reform is an extremely good example of the urgent necessity to sufficiently invest in efficient promotion instruments and marketing measures within and outside the Union.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, we all agree that information actions and promotion of agricultural products on both the internal and the external markets are essential.
We also agree on the need to simplify and harmonise provisions and to limit administrative procedures relating to implementation of the information policy.
In addition, we realise that appropriate information and promotion stimulate trade and help to secure markets for products.
We all agree too that the sum of EUR 45 840 000 expressed as the level of appropriations for 2007 is far too low.
How should we respond to this situation?
What should we focus on in particular?
I believe we should concentrate on promoting healthy organic agricultural products, free from GMOs.
We should start with young people and educational institutions.
Special promotions for schoolchildren should include a range of healthy organic products in addition to fruit.
A labelling system providing important information for the consumer, for example on the origin, quality, production method, safety and nutritional value of the product, is vital to success.
This information should be provided on the packaging in the consumer's local language.
Appropriate changes must be made to trade and labelling in supermarkets, especially in the new Member States.
The following action is essential if the desired results are to be achieved: research into new markets, improving the entire control system and good cooperation between all the Member States.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the report we are today discussing on the promotion of agricultural products should contain the word organic in its title.
After all, society can only consume a certain amount of food, so we are not so much concerned with consuming more, as with healthy eating and good-quality food.
Many mass catering establishments in the territory of the European Union provide food containing so many chemicals and fertilisers that it is hardly surprising each generation of Europeans is fatter than the previous one.
I do not wish to promote that type of food, which has caused European society to be more susceptible to illness and obesity.
If we begin to provide our citizens with healthy food, our produce will become renowned the world over.
We need to convince the world that Europe produces and sells high-quality food.
I fully support those parts of the report advocating regional self-sufficiency in the production of traditional foods for each area.
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Golik for a good report.
Legal protection of designs (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs - C6-0119/2004 -.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, firstly I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the hard and excellent work he has carried out in the preparation of his report on the proposal to amend the Design Directive.
I welcome the fact that this work has eventually allowed the committee to pave the way for liberalising the spare parts aftermarket in the whole Community.
Currently, there is a situation of different, opposed regimes of design protection, where 10 Member States have liberalised and 17 Member States extend design protection to spare parts.
This situation is entirely unsatisfactory for the internal market.
In the automotive sector, which is the sector most affected, there is a single market for cars but no single market for their spare parts.
This leads to distortion of prices and obstacles to trade.
The proposed exclusion of design protection in the aftermarket for spare parts is the right and only effective way to achieve a single market in this area.
The Commission's Extended Impact Assessment analysing the options to solve the problem demonstrates this.
The Commission's figures suggest that, currently, consumers are paying a 6% to 10% premium for these spare parts in Member States which provide for design protection.
With the liberalisation, consumers will benefit directly from the increased competition and the completion of the internal market.
The independent distribution sector will be in a position to put a larger spectrum of parts on offer, including parts from original equipment suppliers, as well as the normally cheaper parts from independent producers.
This will lead to more choice and lower prices for spare parts.
Liberalisation will also open business opportunities to independent spare parts producers, mostly SMEs, and create a European market of sufficient scale allowing new entrants to emerge.
The essential purpose of design protection is to foster competition of forms through design innovation.
This can, however, not apply to spare parts which have to be identical in design to the original parts if they are to serve a purpose.
The consumer pays for the design when buying a new car or other product; he should not be forced to pay again each time he needs a spare part.
The proposed repairs clause strikes a fair and correct balance between protecting innovation where appropriate and maintaining free trade and competition where necessary.
European citizens and businesses today need a single market for spare parts which allows for more competition.
With this directive we can provide the market with the right key to achieve this.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we come today to the provisional end of a discussion that has lasted for 17 years.
I recall that, when I was first elected to this House in 1994, we were already trying to get our heads around this issue.
We did not reach a conclusion then.
All we managed to do in the conciliation procedure was put the matter on ice.
A few years ago the Commission presented a new proposal, which has again taken quite some time to deal with, but it can finally be brought to an end now, at least at first reading.
What is being proposed here and what is on the table is essentially what the Commission has put forward, namely liberalisation of the market in spare parts, albeit with a five-year transitional period for Member States in which spare parts are covered by design protection.
For 17 years I have been listening to arguments for and against. Most of them are unconvincing.
Allow me to cite a number of examples.
First of all, there was the argument that consumer prices would be lower if the repair clause were introduced.
There is no empirical evidence at all for that claim - quite the contrary.
Comparative data on spare-part prices in Britain, where the market is liberalised, and Germany, where it is not, show that, paradoxically, prices for spare parts are higher in Britain than in Germany.
Besides, it is not rocket science: vehicle manufacturers must recoup their design costs somewhere.
If they cannot recoup some of them from the sale of spare parts, it is logical that they will have to pass them on through the price of new cars, and so cars will become more expensive.
In that case too, the consumer is the one who pays.
The same applies, by the way, to insurance premiums.
Some of the cost of buying new cars, as we know, is covered by insurance policies.
If premiums rise, that does not help consumers either.
One way or another, they always have to foot the bill.
Nor am I really convinced by the argument that the motor industry needs design protection to fend off competitors from the Far East that are threatening its markets, for in no time at all we shall see how the industry finds other ways to protect its spare parts: patenting intelligent car bonnets and intelligent wing mirrors, protecting other parts through trade mark legislation by simply incorporating particular logos into them, imposing conditions of warranty and other practices.
The safety argument, as our impact assessment has demonstrated, is not ultimately watertight either, because safety, as we well know, can be ensured by means of type testing.
I cite these because I believe that all the arguments that have been advanced are ultimately spurious and have not provided clear answers to the fundamental question.
When all is said and done, there remain two key arguments which I recognise.
One of them is the copyright argument, which says that exemplary protection must be given in Europe to intellectual property rights, and indeed I take the view that what we are about to adopt here will probably send the wrong signal to China and India and that our task as Europeans is actually to defend the rights attaching to intellectual property.
I shall come straight in with the counterargument, however.
We have a single European market and - as Commissioner McCreevy quite rightly observed - a situation in which two-thirds of the Member States have liberalised their aftermarkets and therefore do not protect the design of spare parts, while the other third do.
The fact is that the creation of a single market in Europe entails the creation of common legal rules, and it is not unusual in such cases to follow the majority principle.
In my view there has always been a compromise solution, for which I canvassed together with Commissioner Monti back in the nineties.
That was the idea of the compulsory licence, which would have meant that any manufacturer could reproduce parts subject to payment of a licence fee to the owner of the design rights.
Incidentally, we have a very similar arrangement in the realm of copyright, so no one can tell me that it is not an option.
It would have served both to protect the design and to create a market.
Regrettably, it did not attract majority support in the House or in the Council.
We were thus left to draw the conclusion that we should liberalise and that we should create a transitional period to protect Member States that needed some time to adapt.
Then there remained the issue as to whether five or eight years' grace should be allowed.
My Group, like the Committee on Legal Affairs, opted for five years; I have heard that the Socialist Group favours eight years.
The crux of the matter is that, when Parliament votes tomorrow on the question of whether five or eight years should appear in the text, it will be signalling that the Council needs to agree on a transitional period.
I know from talks with the Slovenian Presidency that their proposals will tend to aim for a longer rather than a shorter grace period.
I certainly wish the Slovenian Presidency good fortune in its efforts.
There is one thing, I believe, that we should bear in mind for the second reading.
Should the Council actually arrive at an agreement, we in Parliament should resolve not to complicate matters at second reading.
The issue does not merit protracted wrangling, and it is high time it was brought to a conclusion.
The present draft is our contribution to the pursuit of that aim.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after lengthy debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs came out in favour of complete liberalisation of the secondary market in visible spare parts.
As we have just heard, the compromise that was reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs provides for a free market after a grace period of five years.
I warmly welcome this step, although I personally consider the transitional period to be too long rather than too short.
It is a long-overdue step.
We have just heard from Mr Lehne that this issue has been under discussion for 17 years.
Two and a half years ago, in 2005, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I called for early liberalisation.
Unfortunately, the original rapporteur for the lead committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs, kept delaying the process.
I do not know whether he had some personal doubts about the point of the project or whether he was unable to resist the heavy pressure from vehicle manufacturers in his own federal state.
Whatever the reason, it is irrational that we should have a single market for new vehicles but not for spare parts.
Liberalisation of the aftermarket will strengthen competition, will tend to exert downward pressure on prices and will widen consumer choice.
It will not hamper innovation; on the contrary, it could actually stimulate innovative activity, since vehicle manufacturers will try to design their products in such a way that makes them more difficult for independent parts manufacturers to reproduce.
I naturally support the right to intellectual property and its protection - no doubt about that - but that right is no barrier to market liberalisation.
There has, after all, been only one case in which a vehicle manufacturer has brought an action against another manufacturer for design-right infringement in the primary market, despite the fact that there have actually been some very striking similarities between models produced by different manufacturers.
Small and medium-sized businesses will also benefit from liberalisation through new market opportunities, which ought to boost employment in the EU and provide substitutes for a number of imports.
Lastly, individual consumers will henceforth be able to choose freely between several suppliers. I am sure they will be glad to have that opportunity.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (ES) Madam President, as the rapporteur Mr Lehne mentioned, this issue has concerned the House for 17 years.
I have had the privilege of following it from the very beginning, since I worked as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs on the Directive on industrial designs and models.
I was subsequently draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the same issue, and have also followed its progress as the representative of the Socialist Group on the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I wish to start by congratulating Mr Lehne on his balanced approach.
I feel he has given a magnificent account of the difficulties involved.
This is no easy subject, not simple at all; it has both legal complications and economic consequences.
I agree with him.
I recall the long night of discussions with the Council on the Conciliation Committee as to the final formula - at that time we were considering the possibility of some kind of compulsory licence, although this was rejected - but I think that both the rapporteur and myself, and also Mr Klinz, who spoke before me, are in favour of defending intellectual property rights.
From the legal standpoint, however, the problem in relation to models and to industrial designs in general lies in the fact that the protection we have to give is for the product as a whole.
The most important feature is the aesthetic value of the product overall, in other words the design, and the case arising most frequently is car design.
Repair parts, in other words, parts which have broken or come loose after an accident or for any other reason, have to be replaced and, as Commissioner McCreevy said, the normal format is a part equivalent to the part replaced.
When someone repairs a part and replaces it with an identical part, with no prejudice to the overall design, obviously this person is not committing any kind of plagiarism, but merely carrying out repairs to an object that it must fit.
This is the famous 'must fit/must match' concept.
I feel the formula suggested by the rapporteur is the proper solution, but he has also addressed another issue: there is, of course, another aspect, which is the economic side of the matter.
In other words, at present there are a number of countries where the car industry needs this additional income generated by intellectual property rights.
As the Commissioner said, however, in order to secure the internal market we must unify the law within the entire European Union, and the crux of the matter is how to reconcile one thing with another.
The only way to do this is by means of a transitional period.
This means we must give the industry the chance to make preparations over a long period of time in order to take account of the compensating extra income from property rights on ready-made parts, a concept which makes no sense at the present time since we operate on the basis that property refers to the design as a whole.
The main issue is this period, as Mr Lehne stated.
Some feel the period should be five years - two plus three, we might say - while others think it ought to be longer, a period of eight years.
Tomorrow we will find out the positions of all the political groups, and also the various national delegations and individual Members.
It occurs to me that this is an issue which will not be discussed along the lines of political parties but rather in accordance with national preferences, individual preferences, or protection preferences by sectors.

In any case, I feel the fact that we have been discussing this matter between the Council and the Commission for 17 years is no bad thing, because there is a general tendency to use the legislative instrument to solve occasional problems, and here the two co-legislators, the Council and Parliament, have been working for some time now to find a balanced solution, a solution that acknowledges the right to protection of intellectual property, the interests of car manufacturers, the interests of consumers and also - why not? - the interests of small repair outlets or even insurance companies.
I feel the formula proposed here by the rapporteur is the proper solution.
As I have already said, the only item to be determined - and we will learn this through the results - is the right period of time.
I think, however, that, under these circumstances, Parliament is giving the Commission the chance to draw up a new legal formula within a short space of time, a legal formula that would save us the customary recourse to the Court of Justice for matters relating to litigation.
I therefore feel that Parliament should basically adopt the report, without prejudice to any minor difficulties that might be posed by certain amendments.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I would like to start, like many other colleagues today, by stressing the importance of intellectual property rights and the protection of design in general.
We need these rights if we want to continue to be competitive, dynamic and innovative and develop our societies.
However, we also need to make sure that our markets are functioning in an efficient way.
The Commission's proposal could not be more timely.
As many have stressed, we have already waited for 17 years, and we have to wait five more.
I think the grace period of five years is already long enough, and it certainly gives the automotive industry time to adjust their industry in a proper way.
This is a good balance between intellectual property rights and the rights of consumers.
We have 260 million vehicle owners in Europe, who are waiting to get a 'spare parts and repair' clause which is well functioning.
This proposal for a directive, and the compromise made by the Committee on Legal Affairs, ensure that all those parts that are attached to the end product when the product is made - which are not really traditional spare parts - can still have full protection under the design directive.
I am confident that the directive will benefit European consumers.
The scaremongering by the automotive industry that this would result in the loss of 50 000 employees from the automotive sector or EUR 2 billion losses to vehicle manufacturers is absolute nonsense.
I think that it will bring business opportunities for a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and create new jobs for Europeans.
It remains to be seen, and we definitely want to see the results in five years and not eight years.
I hope this will be the compromise tomorrow.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, the proposal for a directive on legal protection of industrial designs concerns liberalisation of the market in spare parts for the automotive industry.
It is estimated that, within the Union, the value of the latter is EUR 10 billion.
The common internal market currently only covers the sale of new motor vehicles and most Member States retain provisions protecting designs and must-match spare parts in their national legal systems.
This means that the production and trade of parts such as bonnet lids, doors, bumpers and mudguards is not unrestricted.
Various national provisions relating to the sector are disrupting competition.
In countries applying total design protection such as Austria, France, Germany and the Czech Republic, spare part prices are between 6% and 10% higher on average.
The main losers are European consumers and SMEs that would like to enter into the market and engage in fair competition with authorised agents.
The opponents of liberalisation are mainly the large motor manufacturers, who argue that independent producers will sell parts more cheaply, as they do not have to bear the cost of designing and developing new products.
The Commission's proposal represents a further step towards complete liberalisation of the motor vehicle market in Europe.
The repair clause is beneficial to consumers.
It attacks the monopoly in the spare parts market and promotes competition between producers.
Consequently, spare parts will be cheaper and of better quality.
It should be highlighted that 11 Member States of the European Union have already implemented the repair clause, with beneficial consequences for consumers.
The countries in question are characterised by high competitiveness and fast economic growth.
They include Ireland, the United Kingdom and new Member States such as Latvia, Hungary and Poland.
In fact, packaging is generally the only difference between parts produced by independent producers and parts bearing the company's logo.
Independent producers account for 80% of the parts produced, and only 20% are produced directly by the large companies.
Design protection has nothing to do with the safety of the parts, because it only concerns their appearance, as was confirmed by reliable studies conducted across the whole of Europe.
In conclusion, I should like to say that a five-year period is the maximum to which European consumers can agree.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the market in visible vehicle spare parts is to be welcomed for three reasons.
The first is that consumers will benefit from more choice and competition.
The second is that we might perhaps see a fall in prices and that we can certainly expect pricing to become transparent, for design costs should be factored into the cost of new vehicles and not recouped through a downstream monopoly in the market for spare parts.
The third reason is that the job market in the European Union will benefit, as European parts manufacturers will also be able to produce spare parts for vehicles imported into the EU.
So far that has only been possible for manufacturers outside Europe.
During the 2004 election campaign I visited a parts factory near GÃŒtersloh.
That company will be pleased with these new rules.
I also welcome the fact that important elements of the Commission's proposal, such as the repair clause, are contained in the draft adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
As shadow rapporteur for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had advocated the retention of that clause.
I believe the draft brings us another step closer to a genuine single market.
There are two major defects, to which some of my fellow Members have already referred.
One of them is the fact that the former rapporteur delayed the report.
In so doing, Mr Radwan did not act as the representative of the European people but as the representative of the Bavarian Motor Works - BMW for short.
That was a rather unsavoury episode.
The second defect is that the grace period of five years creates rather a long delay.
Five years until liberalisation takes effect is a long time; it will delay competition and the beneficial effects of liberalisation.
I have heard that the German Government intends to keep stonewalling.
That is anti-competitive stupidity.
The sad thing is that it has become a trade mark of the German Government.
I hope they will desist from such action in the Council.
The bottom line is that we have a compromise with which we can live and which we ought to adopt.
I can only echo the words spoken by Mr Lehne, who I wish to thank at this point for all his work: we should bring this matter to a conclusion now and avoid any further delay at second reading.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the subject of today's debate is liberalisation of the market in spare parts.
This would involve authorising producers, other than motor vehicle manufacturers, to manufacture these parts.
The report by Mr Lehne is certainly a step in the right direction.
I should like to express support for the report's conclusions, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
As a supporter of a liberal economy, I realise, as I am sure we all do, that there are two essential prerequisites to a sound and effective liberal economy.
These are, on the one hand, the freedom to produce and sell a range of products and, on the other, protection of the original producer's intellectual property, which is equivalent to protecting his or her copyright.
The point is that complete economic freedom will not be effective if we fail to respect the property of the person who had the original idea.
Essentially, that person has a moral right to the product he or she devised and owned first.
On the other hand, there can be no economic freedom either if copyright results in monopoly of the market and restricts economic freedom.
I am convinced that in this sector, namely the spare parts sector, the situation to date in countries where the original producer's copyright restrictions applied was de facto economic restriction.
Product prices were higher and the intellectual property owner, namely the motor manufacturer, exercised a monopoly.
If we wish to achieve a balance between free market legislation on the one hand, and the right to intellectual property on the other, we must nonetheless curtail intellectual property rights to a certain extent.
I believe this report is a step in that direction.
I therefore support it and congratulate its author, Mr Lehne.
In so doing I am basing myself on economic liberalism, which is the system generating the most efficient, effective and best quality production, provided certain guidelines are observed.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am not an old hand who has been dealing with this matter for 17 years, but I am none the less delighted that this compromise worked out by the Committee on Legal Affairs - and our thanks are due to the rapporteur for that - will finally enable us to move into a new phase.
No one should underestimate how important it is to consumers whether there is a repair clause, for example, and it is also important whether or not consumers in some Member States remain at the mercy of the monopolistic policies of major manufacturers.
It does actually seem that some companies are using high prices for spare parts to compensate themselves for the impact of fierce price competition and are then citing design protection to justify this policy.
Naturally enough, many of the lobbyists who have made representations to us have no wish to be deprived of that option, but anyone who goes on to assert that we must save the motor industry by preserving the parts monopoly has failed to understand the economy in all its complexity.
The motor industry whinges about the measures it has to implement to combat climate change, and it whinges about insufficient protection of its designs.
I do believe, however, that innovative parts of that industry are not whinging but are getting on with their innovation.
After all, it is only a matter of protecting designs, not patents.
It is high time we learned to distinguish rather more sharply between the two.
The safety argument that was also advanced by the major manufacturers was ultimately refuted in the impact assessment, and it should also be noted that the European consumer bodies have delivered a favourable response to the present compromise.
Now comes a new attempt to extend the grace period to eight years for countries where high levels of protection are currently in force.
I appeal to you that five years is more than enough.
I would not like to see this compromise package being unwrapped again.
We Greens shall stand by this compromise, and I consider it very important and very desirable that the House as a whole should do likewise.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my fundamental disagreement with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs.
My disagreement concerns the proposal as a whole, not just some minor problems with the Commission's proposal.
The proposal aims to deal with competition problems in the automotive industry by an unprecedented curtailment of the legal protection that industrial design rights afford to spare parts.
Such an approach flies in the face not only of the Lisbon Strategy but also of the universally accepted and frequently evoked trend towards a greater protection of intellectual property rights, including their enforcement.
It is a proven fact that there are no reasons, either economic or legal or with regard to employment, for restricting the rights of design right holders.
I should also like to point out the fact that every economy benefits from the monopoly allowed by the legal protection of designs as this promotes more growth.
In addition, account should be taken of the principle that intellectual property rights, including design rights, can only be restricted under exceptional circumstances in matters of public interest, which is certainly note the case here.
The negative consequences of this directive, if adopted, would be felt most strongly in the European automotive industry.
There are ample arguments to suggest that liberalisation of the spare parts aftermarket as proposed by the Commission would actually harm the consumer by introducing low quality and dangerous parts into the market.
If the so-called independent producers were to produce standard parts of high quality, thereby requiring advanced technology, such production would not be economically attractive to them.
The excessive nature of the proposed directive can be illustrated by the curious and incomprehensible opinion expressed by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which on the one hand supports the proposal as a whole in the name of the sacred slogan of liberalisation of the internal aftermarket, while on the other it says that 'the abolition of design protection is contrary to internationally recognised principles of intellectual property protection and would constitute a dangerous precedent for the protection of intellectual property rights in other areas as well at a time when the European Union has undertaken, in particular within the WTO, to press for the acceptance by third countries of a protection regime for intellectual property rights which would put an end to imitation and counterfeiting'.
That really needs no further comment.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this revision of the Design Directive revolves around the question of whether or not the protection that is rightly afforded to the design of car bodies should be extended to matching visible spare parts, such as wing mirrors and headlights.
The consequence of extending - in my opinion overextending - the protection of designs would be to give vehicle manufacturers a monopoly in a market valued at EUR 13 billion.
Design protection for spare parts would exempt about 25% of the entire market in spare parts from the scope of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation.
The repair clause proposed by the European Commission ensures that the Block Exemption Regulation, which is the basic law governing the motor vehicle sector, will apply to the entire spare parts and repair market, as is the case at the present time in only Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.
The transitional period of five years proposed by the PPE-DE Group for the entry into force of the directive is adequate and, in my opinion, more than generous.
Let me sound a warning, however, against further delays, including any that might be caused by the Council, because consumers have been waiting quite a long time now for lower repair bills and cheaper insurance premiums while these lengthy discussions have been taking place here in the House and among the Member States.
Moreover, we should not leave it to the European Court of Justice to determine the inevitable consequence of further inaction but should be creative in our role as legislators.
On the basis of the standards we set tomorrow, the Council should endeavour to reach a decision too.
(PL) Madam President, legal protection of industrial design is intended to protect the benefits of product design, but it must not be allowed to restrict competition and result in unjustifiably high prices.
The introduction of the repair clause achieves a fair balance between legal protection of intellectual property and the need for freedom of competition.
It also protects 260 million European drivers against a monopoly in the purchase of must-match spare parts for the repair of motor vehicles.
I support Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 which have been tabled.
I am opposed to Amendments 6, 7, and 9.
These changes are beneficial for the single market, SMEs and consumers.
I should like to thank Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, for all his work and for the compromises he brokered regarding amendment of the Directive on design protection.
Madam President, I think this is a historic day, as we are finally going to deal with this vexed question and this anomaly in the internal market.
I think we should remember briefly how we come to be here.
I was involved, before I came into this Parliament, with the issue that has given rise to these discrepancies in the market.
Frankly, intellectual property and its sanctity are not an issue here.
In fact, this is actually a much more fundamental issue.
Intellectual property is, after all, a right granted to producers, but it is a right that they must not abuse in an anti-competitive way.
In a number of countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, where this movement started, it was quite clear to the Monopolies Commission at the time that the car manufacturers were abusing that monopoly, and that is why it was removed.
Now, that does not in any way undermine the importance of intellectual property protection.
I just want to make that clear to a number of colleagues who have made that point.
The second point I want to make is to draw the attention of colleagues to an important measure that the Internal Market Committee introduced a few months ago - and I was privileged to be rapporteur - on motor vehicle type approval.
For the first time, we now have a regime in which independently manufactured parts that are a critical part of the safety and environmental systems of vehicles have to be tested independently to the same standards as the vehicle manufacturer's own parts.
That new proposal effectively completely removes the argument about safety that I heard Mr StroÅŸ repeat yet again.
That is gone: this Parliament has made sure it is gone.
So, we have dealt with the two crucial issues, and I think it is about time we moved forward.
I am pleased that the car manufacturers have finally accepted the fact that you cannot re-regulate a market.
Colleagues, you know we cannot re-regulate a market.
This is an extraordinary anomaly.
It has been allowed to go on for a long time.
It is something that we want to do to complete the internal market.
I think we are being very generous in offering a five-year transition period.
I hope the Council will accept that.
Let us put this issue to rest and let us go on and tackle the real issue, which is how we have a thriving car industry in the future.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a number of amendments, Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the proposal for a directive on the legal protection of designs or models.
I regret that the text adopted makes provision in the short term for the elimination of protection of designs and models of visible car body panels.
If this decision is upheld, it will have negative repercussions on car manufacturers in the EU, with no real advantage for consumers.
The EU regularly issues reminders as to the decisive role of the protection of intellectual property in business competitiveness.
For many years the institutions and the Member States have worked hard to secure Community regulations governing intellectual property rights on the internal market.
The current proposal totally contradicts this policy and will do substantial damage to Community protection of intellectual property rights.
Protection must not be refused for spare car parts, or for many other complex products which are the result of original artistic creativity and major investment packages.
Contrary to what has been claimed, although never established, removing protection for spare car parts would not lead to any gains by consumers.
End user gains are not demonstrated by the quality-price ratio.
It even emerges in a study requested by the European Commission that full liberalisation of the spare car part market would not necessarily benefit consumers in terms of price, due to the number of intermediaries between the suppliers of spare parts and the end user.
Removing protection would actually only benefit economic operators who will not be compelled to cover the costs of creation and who, unlike manufacturers who have to preserve their image, will be less concerned with respecting the characteristics that buyers may expect from the product.
The Commission proposal could therefore lead to the emergence of parts of poorer quality, or it could at least encourage forgery.
For all these reasons, I regret the position adopted by the Commission. I have stated this and I continue to support the two amendments that I have tabled in plenary, along with fifty of my fellow Members, in favour of a transitional period of eight years to protect designs and models.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about design protection of visible spare parts has indeed been going on for almost an entire generation of Members of this House.
We have been discussing this for 17 years, but up to now we have not managed to reach a final agreement on this important economic law or to harmonise the laws of the Member States to a sufficient degree.
It is now three years since the launch of the present Commission proposal and finally we are going to vote on a first reading tomorrow.
Mr Lehne's report points us in the right direction.
It has respect for the intellectual property of the design of the complex product as a whole and at the same time it gives us the scope for an internal market in spare parts to operate properly.
The present fragmentation of the internal market is no longer defensible.
It deprives the producer of the parts - by which I mean the independent producer - of the opportunity afforded by the benefits of scale of the internal market.
It deprives independent repair companies of the opportunity to choose their own suppliers, and it deprives the consumer of the opportunity or advantage of the downward pressure on prices that can normally be taken for granted when a competitive market is operating properly.
Now, with the new directive - Malcolm Harbour pointed this out just now too, the new directive on the type approval of vehicles - we have also removed the last obstacle, that of safety.
It is therefore time to take the plunge and make a final decision.
As far as I am concerned, we do not even need this five-year transitional arrangement any more, but as, throughout all these years - 16 of the 17 years of the debate - I too have learned that politics is the art of the possible, I can live with those five years, with that compromise.
To postpone it any longer, Madam President, really would not be acceptable.
Let us here choose the internal market.
This is an aspect of the internal market which we can very clearly demonstrate is to the advantage of the consumer.
Let us make a choice for the consumer.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal intends to allow companies other than manufacturers to produce spare parts, on the basis that this will reduce the price of parts and insurance.
This is the idyllic presentation we have heard from the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services.
There is nothing to show that there will be any real benefit to consumers.
The countries that have already removed protection have not observed any obvious progress.
The Commission's own surveys confirm this, as our rapporteur Klaus-Heiner Lehne has just told us.
Removal of intellectual property for designs and models in many industries, not just in the car industry, however, conflicts directly with EU economic and commercial strategy.
This means opening the door to forgeries, and offering the chance to dangerous competitors such as China or India to embark on furious production of these items.
This is the total opposite of the Lisbon Strategy which wanted to make intellectual property the weapon of competitiveness and innovation.
We would certainly be giving our competitors the wrong message with this strategy, and it would be contrary to EU interests within the context of globalisation.
Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal is outdated.
It is inspired by an ideological attitude which, in 2007, is precariously balanced, since we are now engaged in a crucial battle with new economic giants in order to ensure the survival of our industry.
It is hardly the time to throw down our weapons.
Commissioner Mandelson goes to Beijing to force the Chinese to respect intellectual property, while over here we are now calling this into question.
This proposal ought to be simply abandoned as unrealistic and irresponsible.
Now that we are debating the issue, we must behave as good legislators.
That is why, at the very least, we lend our support to the rapporteur's compromise and call on the House to vote for the amendment as signed by 53 Members for a transitional period of eight years.
(DA) Madam President, we have witnessed how the liberalisation of old monopolies in Europe has created stimulating competition within trade and industry as regards better products and lower prices for consumers.
The market in spare car parts is no exception.
For many years, car manufacturers have had a strong monopoly on spare parts; this is a significant element of car design.
In practice, we are talking about approximately 20% of all spare parts sold in a very large EU market.
The total annual turnover is around EUR 42 billion, or DKK 300 billion, according to the Commission's estimates.
According to an EU directive adopted nearly 10 years ago, the Member States still have the opportunity to maintain monopolies that protect the automobile industry to an unreasonable extent.
The Commission proposal, which will mean the welcome liberalisation of this market, will have at least three major advantages.
Firstly, industry will be stimulated to invest in the manufacture of spare parts, which typically requires large amounts of fixed capital.
There is currently no such stimulation, as much of the EU market is covered by monopolies and is therefore closed to non-original after-market spare parts.
Secondly, consumers will experience falling prices for spare car parts because there will be more competition between manufacturers.
Thirdly and finally, the full implementation of the repair clause should result in falling car insurance premiums.
An extremely significant proportion of the spare parts market that is covered by design protection originates from claims that are covered by insurance policies.
I must mention Mr Harbour's remarks on safety in connection with the manufacture of critically important spare parts from all manufacturers.
Mr Lehne deserves a great deal of praise for the work that he has done in connection with the report, which I fully support.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all MEPs who have contributed to this debate.
I have listened carefully, not only to this discussion, but to other commentary on this proposal for some considerable time.
So, in closing, let me stress a few key points.
The current situation with a mixed design protection regime is creating trade distortions, which is bad for the internal market, bad for business and bad for consumers.
The full liberalisation of the spare parts aftermarket promises net benefits in many respects.
It would allow for more competition and access and participation of SMEs in the market.
Consumers would benefit from more choice and lower prices.
Besides the legal certainty, it would also simplify the daily lives of administrations, courts, companies - especially SMEs - and consumers.
Lastly, the proposed repair clause is derived from and is in full accord with the principles of intellectual property protection.
I therefore ask the European Parliament for its support and repeat what many speakers here have said - but particularly what Mr Lehne and Mr Harbour have said - that the European Parliament will send out a strong signal in favour of a solution that the Community so urgently needs.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 12 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, very much for his work on this document.
I believe we should support the report before us today, as the so-called repair clause achieves a balance between legal protection of intellectual property and free competition and consumer protection.
This clause aims to prevent the emergence of unjustified monopolies, and its introduction represents a further step towards the creation of a single market.
I agree with my fellow Member that in the present global context it is best to prevent a situation arising that would be detrimental to the European Union's internal market.
Pursuant to the Directive now in force, different legal practices exist in different Member States.
Research shows that in those Member States that retained design protection for spare parts in their legislation, spare parts cost between 6.4% and 10.3% more than in countries where the market has been liberalised.
Finally, I should like to point out that the market concerned has been completely liberalised in Poland.

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)
Preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 December 2007) (debate)
As the next item we have the Council and Commission statements on preparations for the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 13 and 14 December 2007.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council will first note with satisfaction the signing of the Lisbon Treaty, which is to take place in the Portuguese capital tomorrow, and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will take place here today in a little while.
It will also call for the process of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty to be concluded swiftly so that the Treaty can enter into force on 1 January 2009.
The Lisbon Treaty, as I have said, will provide the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework that will allow it to fully concentrate on the political challenges ahead, including globalisation and climate change, as clearly underlined at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government on 19 April.
In this context, the European Council will adopt a Declaration on Globalisation.
The Declaration will make it clear that, in view of the global challenges that confront us, the European Union has both an opportunity and a responsibility to act.
The Union's internal and external policies need to be harnessed to that end.
I am thinking of delivery on the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, fulfilment of the ambitious commitments on climate change and energy agreed at the Spring 2007 European Council, definition of a global response to the recent turbulence in the financial markets, promotion of free trade and openness, work with our partners to pursue vigorous and coherent development strategies, development of a comprehensive European migration policy and efficient use of instruments and development of capabilities of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Security and Defence Policy, so as to allow the Union to play a growing part in building a safer world.
Finally, the European Union will help to ensure that globalisation is a source of opportunity rather than a threat and that it contributes to the prosperity of the individual.
We also hope to establish at the forthcoming European Council a Reflection Group, to help the Union anticipate and meet challenges more effectively in the next twenty to thirty years.
The European Council will review the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice.
We should mention, first, the abolition of controls at the internal borders of the new Member States, a measure of great significance and great importance for the daily lives of our citizens.
The implementation of the policy on migration will also be examined and, in particular, the progress made in the implementation of the Global Approach to Migration with regard to Africa and the Mediterranean, as well as the Global Approach to the Eastern and South-Eastern neighbouring regions.
There will be a report, in this context, on the organisation of the first Euro-Med Ministerial meeting on Migration, which will be taken into account in preparing the Joint Strategy and Action Plan for the second Africa/EU Summit, as reported here yesterday.
Other aspects to be examined in the area of freedom, security and justice will include the work to be undertaken to combat terrorism, notably as regards radicalisation and recruitment, and the progress in judicial cooperation.
On economic, social and environmental issues, the European Council will review the work that has been done in the relevant areas with a view to the preparation of the next cycle of the Renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, to be approved at the European Council in Spring 2008.
The discussion at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in October sought to strengthen the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy and confirmed that the Renewed Lisbon Strategy is still the right framework to meet the principal challenges that confront us, in particular the challenge of globalisation.
It also confirmed that Europe is making progress and that the objectives set are still appropriate, and the main focus of the new cycle will therefore be to maintain the necessary stability to consolidate gains and press on with reforms.
The European Council will emphasise the need to strengthen European competitiveness with the advantages of the single market combined with a sustainable industrial policy and promotion of innovation and skills.
Development of the external dimension and improvement of the conditions in which consumers and undertakings, particularly small and medium-sized undertakings, operate will also be emphasised.
In the employment and social policy area, the European Council will endorse the agreement on the common principles of flexicurity, underlining the role of the social partners in the design, implementation and monitoring of the relevant policies.
The European Council will also report the results of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and invite Member States to strengthen efforts to prevent and combat discrimination.
I must also stress the importance of carrying forward the Energy Policy for Europe established by the Spring European Council.
The progress achieved in the discussions on the third internal market package for gas and electricity and the debate on the Strategic Energy Technology Plan will also be noted.
The European Council will then review the implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy and it is expected to agree that the objectives and priorities under the seven key challenges contained in that strategy remain fully valid.
It will also welcome the Commission Communication on an integrated maritime policy and invite the Commission to come forward with the initiatives and proposals contained in the Action Plan.
On external relations, the European Council is expected, on the basis of Ministers' discussions at the latest General Affairs and External Relations Council held last Monday, to concentrate on the process of defining the future status of Kosovo, in particular, in an assessment of the period of negotiation.
Since, as you know, Belgrade and Pristina failed to reach an agreement, it is hoped that the European Council will also discuss the role that the European Union may play in the process in future and the course of action to be taken in this connection with a view to resolving the issue, strengthening stability in the region and helping to bring it closer to the Union.
The European Council will stress the importance of the various summits held in the past six months, in particular the summits with Brazil and Africa.
The summit with Brazil was, as you know, an unprecedented and brilliant initiative and the EU-Africa Summit achieved some very encouraging results, which I had occasion to mention in the Assembly yesterday.
Lastly, attention will be drawn to the progress recorded in relations with other regions, notably the Mediterranean, and in the area of cooperation for development.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council's conclusions reflect the results of the intense work done in the past six months and show that the main objectives of the Portuguese Presidency have been achieved.
The European Union will still have a highly ambitious agenda of work before it.
We believe that under future presidencies it will continue to proceed in the direction of a Europe of high growth, social prosperity and sustainable development, strengthening its role in global terms and in its relations with its partners at bilateral and also at multilateral level.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(Applause)
President of the Commission. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the last European Council in Lisbon in October we were able not only to reach political agreement on a new Treaty but also to launch a debate at Head of State or Government level on Europe's interest and the best way to promote that interest in the era of globalisation.
The Lisbon Treaty will be signed tomorrow, and on Friday the European Council will start on its task of seeking concrete results for a Europe at the service of citizens in the age of globalisation.
I think it is important to stress the link between these two facts.
Europe is solving its institutional problems but it is doing so primarily because it takes the interests of its citizens into account and also because it seeks to project its interests and values at global level.
Both ways are, ultimately, ways of achieving the same objectives.
The signing of the Lisbon Treaty is no mere formality.
It signals 27 States' agreement on a Treaty and it marks their acceptance of a common commitment to Europe.
It is, without doubt, a highly potent symbol of the long way we have come since the deadlocks of 2005.
Similarly, the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the President of the Council, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission, which will take place in this House in a few hours' time, is proof positive that the European Union intends to keep the rights of citizens at the heart of its activities.
On Friday, the European Council will give us another opportunity to show a European Union that is seeking to define its position in the light of globalisation.
This positioning is partly to do with the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
The truth of the matter is that what we are consolidating today is simply the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy, essentially the idea that Europe's response to globalisation must be pro-active and confident, not negative and passive.
Only yesterday the Commission adopted an important package of communications and decisions preparing a new cycle of the Strategy for the period 2008-2010.
Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is working: it is creating growth and jobs.
We now have the best figures since the 1980s in terms of job creation.
The Lisbon Strategy is helping to position Europe and European citizens to succeed in the age of globalisation.
The Lisbon Strategy has given Europe a common, pragmatic economic agenda, fully respecting national differences.
However, complacency would be fatal to Europe's prospects of shaping globalisation.
Much more remains to be done: progress is uneven between policy areas, and some Member States are moving much faster than others.
Yesterday's package responds to the need for Europe to act, to face up to growing uncertainties in the global economy, and to the need for an even higher priority for the social dimension, education and skills, but also information and communication technologies, flexicurity, the need to have a common energy policy and to fight climate change.
The declaration on globalisation that the European Council is about to adopt fully acknowledges the role of the Lisbon Strategy.
The declaration should set out our conviction that the Union has every reason to feel confident about its future.
Today's European Union is showing how the preservation of European political, economic and social values and the defence of European interests are fully compatible with a proactive approach to globalisation.
Today we are well placed to continue the internal reforms, to reinforce our ability to compete at global level and, at the same time, to maintain our values of economic and social cohesion and solidarity.
Today, we are well placed to provide the global vision that the world needs for a multilateral order, a system of collective security, open and fair trade and sustainable development, which respects the environmental balance of our planet.
Today, we are well placed to pursue European interests in the partnerships and in the relations with our allies and the world's other great powers.
Two weeks ago, together with the President of the European Council, I was in China and India for the summits between the European Union and these two emerging powers.
It was fascinating to see the pace of economic development in that part of the world.
We need to be attentive to what is going on in Asia.
It is true that economic development has helped to take millions of human beings out of poverty.
I have no doubts their progress will have a direct impact on future generations of Europeans.
The crucial question is: what are we going to do in the face of such a structural transformation?
We should have no illusions: globalisation also means deep changes in the world balance of power.
The truth is that, not many years ago, here in Europe, when people spoke about globalisation, they were thinking mainly about Westernisation or, sometimes, Americanisation.
Today, when we in Europe speak about globalisation, many people think, above all, of the growing, emerging economic powers in Asia.
So the world is changing, and I believe this is also making the need to adapt our common European project to the new challenges more obvious.
That is why, today, there are conditions for accepting the declaration on globalisation that European Union leaders will adopt this week.
It is more obvious than ever that even the greatest powers of Europe cannot tackle the challenges of globalisation alone.
It is obvious that, more than ever, we need a strong European Union.
I believe that the rise of the powers of Asia on one hand and the awareness about the climate change challenge on the other are, in fact, two very important driving forces for the European Union, because they show us that there is a challenge called globalisation and that there is also an opportunity to grasp.
Therefore, I think that this week's European Council will have a very important meaning and a great significance.
Some years ago it would have been impossible for European leaders to agree on the declaration on globalisation they are about to support.
Now it is quite clear that the goals of the European Union are not just internal: the goals of the European Union are also global.
We need to promote our interests and to promote our values in the new global order that is emerging.
That is why I think we can take very important decisions this week. We should do that with full confidence in our capacities, above all trusting the ability of European societies to rise to the circumstances.
In particular, we should not forget that, in Europe, we have impressive human skills, great traditions of knowledge and critical knowledge, the capacity to adapt.
We have sophisticated scientific and technological knowledge.
More importantly, we have free societies organised under the rule of law, and this gives us a great advantage in a world that is changing - and changing fast.
This is the European way of life.
To preserve it and to improve it is our best investment.
With the right policy agenda, we can face globalisation with confidence.
Globalisation poses specific challenges.
One of these is mass migration, which is, to some extent, a new phenomenon in Europe - at least with the dimension it has taken recently.
Last week the Commission adopted a communication on migration, which will be discussed in the European Council.
It stresses the need to see the issue in an overall perspective.
It is, of course, central to our border controls and security, but it also has huge economic and social implications, and demands to be a central theme in our relations with partners worldwide.
Migration is close to the concerns and interests of citizens.
It cannot be tackled by any individual Member State on its own.
As I have said several times, also in this House, it is completely absurd in a European Union of 27 Member States, where we have freedom of circulation of people, to have 27 policies of immigration.
We need to have a common approach to immigration, and we need to recognise that the problems some of our Member States are facing should also be considered as European problems.
(Applause)
We need an integrated policy, one which makes sense to European citizens, to immigrants and to international partners.
The goal of our document presented to this Council is to spark debate, first at the European Council, but also in European societies, including, of course, this Parliament, and launch a process leading to a comprehensive policy.
By addressing an issue that is a central concern of European citizens, just a day after the signature of the Lisbon Treaty, the Union continues its approach, one which is based on concrete results for Europe and concrete results for our citizens.
This is the right way to move forward, and I think this week's European summit can take us a step further in our wish and our will to shape globalisation and shape it with our values.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon European Council marks a return to a Europe of achievements and added value.
For the people of Europe, this Council sets the seal on greater freedom of movement and closer integration.
Many institutional problems have been resolved and two years of stalling and uncertainty are drawing to a close.
Tomorrow in Lisbon, 27 signatures on the Reform Treaty will confirm our shared destiny in a European 21st century based on our common values, our prosperity, security and solidarity.
From January 2009 we aim to apply our new method of operation.
This is important because the Lisbon Treaty provisions will have an impact on the next European elections and thus on the appointment of the President of the Commission.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the major innovation in the Lisbon Treaty because it delivers a clear response to two basic questions: who are we and what is the nature of our joint endeavour?
The Charter embodies our sharing of values and, at the same time, reflects a consensus on our unity in diversity.
If we neglect either one of those elements we will incur opposition and reluctance on the part of our peoples.
I hope that both the spirit and the letter of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights will apply across the widest possible area of Europe, for this Charter truly does enshrine our individual identification with the European Union and our connection to a European Community of shared values.
The Reform Treaty also extends the scope of democracy by enhancing the power of the European Parliament, establishing a fairer voting system in the Council, giving the national parliaments a bigger role as guarantors of subsidiarity and bringing the Union closer to ordinary people, who will now be entitled to initiate legislation.
The European Parliament will have more duties and more responsibilities to Europe's citizens.
Our Assembly must therefore be more rigorous, and it needs a higher profile.
My group is ready to contribute both in the legislative process and in bringing forward new ideas.
I also support the proposal to set up a Reflection Group.
It will have a crucially important role to play in charting our course over the next 20 or 30 years.
If we intend to build a Europe founded on prosperity and security, as well as values and a shared sense of solidarity, we need the capacity to reflect on the future of the European social model.
Once the treaty has been ratified we shall be able to focus on those policy areas where people want Europe to do more.
Issues like climate change, energy, immigration and security need to be tackled at European level.
Ladies and gentlemen, the second decision anticipated in Lisbon is of more than symbolic significance.
It concerns extension of the Schengen acquis to those Member States which joined the Union in 2004.
Freedom of movement is a sensitive issue, particularly for people who have borne the yoke of occupation and have been deprived of freedom.
Living in a Community of shared values cannot be reconciled with the imposition of distinctions between people on the move inside the European Union.
Having said that, equal treatment also implies equality before the law.
If those principles fall by the wayside, we will never achieve social cohesion, and the people we represent will turn their backs on Europe.
I also welcome the extension of police and judicial cooperation among the Member States.
In an open Europe, it offers an effective means of combating the scourges of trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration.
Ladies and gentlemen, Thursday's European Council brings us one step nearer to achieving a more open, more democratic Europe and one with a capacity to act.
And remember, too, that a Europe which guarantees unity in diversity contributes not only to stability within its own borders but also to peace throughout the world.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission rightly referred to one of the core challenges of the present time, namely the question of how we should organise home-affairs policy in Europe on the basis of the Treaty that is to be signed tomorrow, on the basis of the new legal structures of the European Union.
He cited the problem of mass immigration into Europe as an example of the way in which an internal European area, by which I mean a legal area that has external borders but no longer has internal borders, can be organised.
We do that on an intergovernmental level.
No one should be under any illusions - the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement is not the law of the European Union; it is not Community law, but an intergovernmental instrument.
That in itself shows that we still have a structural defect, for intergovernmental instruments are primarily a form of law that focuses on national sovereignty rather than on the creation of an effective European framework.
This is a fundamental distinction.
The fact is that law based on national sovereignty enables every manifestation of national particularism and every individual reservation to block the progress of the Union.
In view of the challenges facing us in the field of migration policy, that is something we cannot afford.
To that extent, President Barroso is perfectly correct, for it is wrong that some - in southern Europe, for example - should be under intense migratory pressure, while those at the other geographical ends of Europe wash their hands of the problem.
That cannot go on indefinitely.
The step we are now taking in relaunching the integration process on the basis of a new Treaty is therefore a first step that must be followed by more, by which I mean closer integration in other areas, including those of the common home-affairs policy, the common security policy and the common justice policy.
This brings me to my second point, which is of particular importance to us at the present moment.
We shall be formally signing the Charter of Fundamental Rights today.
Splendid!
An exquisite table, magnificent chairs, a congenial atmosphere, as always.
(Interjection by Daniel Cohn-Bendit: And magnificent Members of Parliament!)
Yes, wonderful Members of Parliament too.
Some Members, however, are nicer than others, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
(Laughter)
The setting will be marvellous, as always.
Yet it all reminds me of a close friend of mine who has been married several times in his life and has also filed for divorce several times.
And every time I attended his wedding and was about to go home after the solemn celebration and the magnificent function that had been laid on, I would say to him, 'You gave us a great day, as always'.
I feel a bit like that today.
I was in Rome - along with you, Mr PÃ¶ttering, and a number of other Members who are here today.
We experienced that in Rome.
It was like a wedding - celebratory, fine food, a wonderful ceremony, great music,
(Interjection by Daniel Cohn-Bendit: Beautiful city!)
a beautiful city, a splendid atmosphere, no Cohn-Bendit there, so just magnificent!
(Laughter)
We went home afterwards and experienced the divorce.
And today we are off to the next wedding, this time in Lisbon: splendid atmosphere, wonderful city, no Cohn-Bendit - everything just as it should be.
I only hope that another petition for divorce will not follow in Ireland.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, we have no reason to celebrate until the Treaty has actually been ratified in all 27 countries.
It makes sense to ratify the Treaty.
Those anti-Europeans who wanted to scupper the constitution because they believed they could halt the integration process that way have certainly been taught a lesson by this Treaty.
It is true that the Lisbon Treaty does not satisfy all our wishes, but it is better than destroying Europe by constantly opposing integration.
(Applause)
And those who rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty because they believed it was short on social policy and needed a stronger social element will not find that extra element in this new Treaty, but the proclamation of the Charter of Human Rights and its integration into the Treaty have made it possible to realise a number of fundamental social rights.
There were no doubt reasons for the rejection of the draft constitution by extremists on both sides.
I can sympathise more with those who rejected it on social grounds than with the anti-Europeans, who reject the Treaty on principle because they do not want this Union.
One thing, however, is quite clear: this Treaty can only be a stepping stone.
It is a step forward, but it does not take us far enough.
Nevertheless, it is a step that must be taken now in any event.
I hope that this marriage is for life and that the divorce lawyers will stay at home, for none of the challenges of the coming years - and my honourable colleague Mr Swoboda will shortly be speaking about Kosovo - will be surmountable unless we set Europe on firm institutional foundations.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Mr Schulz is perfectly correct that this is a week of celebration, solemnly proclaiming the Charter protecting our citizens from abuse of the great power vested inside the Union, and the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon strengthening our capacity to act and improving dramatically the quality of our democracy.
I am delighted that Prime Minister Brown has finally decided to show up, although, unfortunately, to show up late.
I am afraid that is par for the course for British participation in the EU.
Please be careful that Mr Brown signs in pen rather than in pencil!
(Laughter)
The European Council is our first chance to step forward decisively from this introspective period of reflection and start to do some serious politics.
First up is Kosovo, and here the Union is about to supervise the independence of a country without the approval of the UN Security Council.
It is crucial for the future of Kosovo and the rest of us that those who fear that such a bold step will create a precedent choose the wise path of constructive abstention and do not seek to block the self-determination of Kosovans.
The European Council should also begin to take some firm decisions on the size and shape of the ESDP mission to Kosovo as a signal of its intention.
We should also, moreover, reiterate our refusal to sign a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia before the delivery of its war criminals to the ICC.
It is in this context that the Sarkozy-inspired groupe des sages could be put to some serious work to build up some alternative scenarios for the future of the Balkans, but it must not mess up our current commitments.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the EU's leaders are assembled in Brussels for a European Council meeting on the day after the signing of the new Reform Treaty.
Ireland is one of the countries where the provisions of the Treaty will be put to a referendum; if the campaign in support of the Treaty is run on a visibly professional footing, I believe that the referendum will prove to be a great success.
And, further to what Mr Schulz said about the dangers of a negative coming from Europe, it behoves me, as a representative from Ireland, speaking at this round of the debate on the future of Lisbon, to point out a number of home truths.
Firstly, to congratulate all those who have been involved in bringing about the final agreement on the Lisbon Treaty.
But that is only the written document, and we ask ourselves - and often in this Parliament we ask ourselves - what does Europe want to see?
What do the people and citizens of Europe want to know about?
Yes, the citizens of Europe want more Europe.
But more Europe, to them, does not mean what a lot of us inside this room might think.
It does not mean new regulations, new laws - new restrictions, as they would see it.
It means a cleverer Europe, a Europe that delivers a response to their everyday needs.
That is why the Lisbon Strategy - the continuation and the improvement of the Lisbon Strategy - is so important as regards what would be happening within the Lisbon Council meeting.
Secondly, the whole issue of migration, which was touched on by many Members, is putting enormous pressure on resources, not just in financial terms as regards the cost to countries, especially those in the southern Mediterranean who are forced to expend huge amounts of money on tackling this problem, but on the social cohesion within those countries as well.
It is creating enormous problems and drawing on the goodwill and efforts that will be there.
Thirdly, and most importantly of all, the whole issue with regard to the kind of development of a European vision that we want to see around the world as is now being played out in Bali at the Climate Change Conference, as will be played out in the future at some other conferences in New York in the coming months, and, most importantly, that we have to tell our citizens and inform them properly of what comes before them.
Finally, could I say to President Barroso and to Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, as we are having a referendum in Ireland: no tax, no tax, no tax.
The Treaties do not give you the power to come up with tax proposals.
The Commission should stay away from it.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a wonderful gathering here.
The President-in-Office and the Council have been diligent, and the summary they delivered here was marvellous.
What exactly they were summarising escaped me, but the headings were certainly right.
The head manager of the Commission emphasised to us that the Commission has taken up the challenges of globalisation.
He said 'globalisation' 87 times and 'challenges' 82 times, so it must be true.
And so to the wedding that Martin was so keen to describe.
It is indeed an interesting state of affairs, for the bridegroom is marrying the same bride for a second time.
That is unusual, even for the weddings you frequent, Martin.
The only thing is that the bride is now a little older, a little more old-fashioned and less sexy than she was in Rome.
But this wedding is necessary.
Today we are all invited.
Because I am attending today and was not there the last time, it will go well.
That makes all the difference.
Before I say something on two important problems, let me refer to the surreal performance of the British Prime Minister in Lisbon.
He had discovered that a subcommittee of a committee of a subcommission was meeting in the House of Commons, and so he could not be present at the signing of the thing he did not want to sign but intended to sign nevertheless, but then later, at the meal, he signed it after all.
It was surreal, but that is Britain today.
It is your problem, not mine!
Now, however, I would like to address two serious matters.
The first is Kosovo.
There is an old Jewish joke which says that, if you have two options, always choose the third.
We have two options.
If we do not recognise Kosovo's independence, we shall have a conflict on our hands.
If we do recognise it, we shall have a conflict on our hands.
Both options lead to conflict, whether with Kosovo or Serbia.
We in the European Union must now be resolute in showing how we can act, not just how we can talk.
We must develop an Agenda 2020 with a view to bolstering the rule of law in that region, and that agenda must be developed together with Kosovo, with Serbia and with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We must reinforce the rule of law throughout that region.
We must develop an environment and climate pact.
We must devise a regional development plan with components such as trans-Balkan route networks, giving the region the prospect of accelerated convergence with the European Union with the aim of simultaneous integration of all these countries into the European Union.
The only means we have of preventing conflict is to ensure here that these countries are not only offered the European bonding agent but help to develop it too.
Then we shall see whether the 27 will be able not only to wed their brides but also to bring difficult children into the family so that peace can finally advance in that region.
I am actually talking about the wedding night now.
The second point is just as critical, namely Iran.
The Council will have to take a decision there too.
In this case we can say that the threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb has apparently subsided, if we can believe the US intelligence service.
We are all like little children, always believing what we want to believe.
If people tell us something that does not suit us, we say they are lying.
It they tell us something that suits us, we say they are right.
I do not know who is right, but it would suit me if they were right this time.
In Iran, however, the possibility of a nuclear bomb is not the only problem.
There is also the problem of freedom or, more precisely, the suppression of freedom.
The past few years have seen an incredible upsurge in the oppression of people in Iran.
I believe Europe also has a job to do there.
It is not just about averting the threat of a nuclear bomb.
It is also about the freedom of people in Iran and about how we help civil society to win that freedom.
There are heads of government who think they are clever because they give wise advice and do great and clever things for Europe.
Those who believe, however, that they can sell nuclear reactors in all parts of the world, whether to Libya - a terrorist dictatorship - or to Tunisia, Algeria or Morocco, only to discover at some later date that these nations all want a nuclear bomb, are being hypocritical.
Yesterday's New York Times wrote something that we have all been saying for the last 30 years, namely that anyone who uses nuclear power for civilian purposes will ultimately use it for military purposes too if there is no alternative.
And we sell nuclear reactors to all African, American and other countries and think we are clever.
We are stupid to do such a thing, That needs to be said.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, the forthcoming European Council will take place in the context of the signature of a new treaty, immediately after a particularly important EU-Africa summit and also - let us not forget - during the first phase of implementation of the Annapolis process.
On the treaty, I believe the Union would be seriously misreading the situation if it thought that this summit agreement marked the end of the crisis of confidence which has dislocated entire sections of our societies from the current thrust of Union economic and social policies.
That problem remains intact. We would do better to recognise it and prepare responses to it.
A similar reality check seems necessary in terms of our relations with Africa.
The Chair of the African Union Commission, Alpha KonarÃ©, has called on Europe to break with paternalism.
He emphasised that Africa 'could not remain a hunting ground or become a new territory to be conquered'.
He lambasted - and I quote again - 'the logic of the Economic Partnership Agreements with their dramatic costs for the African people'.
Significantly, seven Latin American countries created the Bank of the South almost on the same day as the summit, as a means of emancipating themselves from the IMF and of lessening inequalities in their region.
The European Union needs to learn from that and take the measure of this general and growing demand for a fairer, more dignified partnership, including in its way of treating migrants.
Finally, the Middle East, which is apparently missing from the Council agenda: how could the Union agree in Annapolis to be completely sidelined from the structure responsible for implementation of the Roadmap?
Does it intend to stand by and passively watch the agreement being violated - as was the case last week with the affair of the East Jerusalem settlements?
Generally speaking, what are our true aspirations for Europe and what resources are we prepared to invest in realising them?
This is a priority question for the next European Council.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. the Prime Ministers will sign a final Treaty none of them have read.
They are signing a bundle of amendments they cannot even understand.
Yesterday the Danish Parliament refused a referendum on a Treaty they have not read.
They breached the Danish Constitution and may be taken to court so we can have a referendum.
A few of them may have read a full draft; I doubt it.
The final edition is still impossible to read for one simple reason: it is not consolidated.
The IGC has decided that readable versions will only be printed when the Treaty is ratified by all 27 Member States.
Do not read, sign, is a cynical moral.
All negotiations in the IGC and the linguistic lawyers' group have been kept absolutely secret so far as many Members in this Parliament are concerned.
The numbering system has been changed three times to make any comparison technically impossible before the signing.
There is not even a table for comparison with the October published edition.
First they undo two referendums rejecting the Constitution.
Then they negotiate in secret and keep the content under a new name.
I still offer a good bottle of wine for just one example of a law which can be approved under the Constitution and not under the Lisbon Treaty.
Even the most experienced legal expert in the Danish Foreign Office has admitted there is not one.
In an expert hearing in the Danish Parliament, I asked three times to have some examples of national law areas where the Lisbon Treaty, with its horizontal clauses and fundamental principles, cannot reach.
I did not get one valid example.
The Lisbon Treaty will dissolve the existing EU, establish a new state with joint citizenship, legal personality and all the tools of nation states.
Most laws will be adopted by civil servants in secret.
The democratic deficit will grow.
My group proposes the signing should be cancelled until you have read the final text.
(Applause)
Mr President, again today many talk grandly about European values of democracy.
Today we will have a pretentious affirmation of a belief in human rights yet, at the same time, the EU elite are preparing to celebrate their greatest stroke of arrogance to date as they make ready to sign the repackaged Constitution without a backward glance towards their people and what they want or what they think.
The 2005 referendums showed Europe to be out of touch, but the lesson learned was not to abandon what the people did not want but to circumvent their opposition by determining this time not to ask them.
Hence the scandal that, across this continent, national powers will be stripped away, superstate structures will be established, a new EU citizenship will be created, legal personality will be bestowed on the EU and only a handful of citizens will ever be asked.
Why?
Because in most states, my own included, the leaders fear the verdict of their people, adding cowardice to their arrogance.
So on a day when there is much talk of human rights, I say: Give the people of Europe the basic political and human right to say 'yes' or 'no' to this Constitution, the right to say 'yes' or 'no' in a referendum.
(Applause)
(PT) President-in-Office, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency is coming to an end and it has a number of remarkable successes to its credit.
I am not among those who place undue emphasis on the diplomatic initiatives in connection with the Brazil and Africa summits, among others: only time will tell whether they produce concrete measures or whether they were just great events with high media visibility.
But I would stress the structural measures that have been taken, for the benefit of Europe, in these six months.
Three spring to mind: the end of the institutional crisis with the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, which will be signed tomorrow, the proclamation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be binding, the historic enlargement of the Schengen area with the integration of nine new Member States and almost 4 million square kilometres, the achievement of strategic viability and the important GALILEO programme, which some people would rather not have, preferring to leave all that to the United States, Russia and China.
I should also like to stress the useful legislative work in cooperation with the European Parliament, and the excellent understanding with the Commission and its President, Dr DurÃ£o Barroso.
The interinstitutional cooperation worked well and produced good results.
President-in-Office, I wish you every success at the Council meeting on 14 December.
We expect further important decisions, both in the area of foreign policy, with special reference to Kosovo, and with regard to Europe's response to the challenges of globalisation.
I should especially like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on including the question of Europe's immigration policy on the agenda for the Council, where President Barroso will be able to underline the European Commission's timely initiatives in this connection.
There are problems and challenges that are clearly beyond the scope of individual Member States and that call for a common approach, this being especially obvious, as already said, in an area without internal borders.
Mr President, allow me to conclude with a national reference.
Portugal has always done its best to serve the common interest when it held the Presidency of the Council.
This was the case in 1992 with Prime Minister Cavaco Silva and with JoÃ£o de Deus Pinheiro, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and now a Member of the European Parliament.
It was the case in 2000 with Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Guterres, and it is the case today in the third Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the Union.
Allow me, Secretary of State, to draw attention to your personal commitment, the commitment of Minister LuÃ­s Amado and Prime Minister SÃ³crates, and the commitment of all those who have been actively engaged here, in Brussels and in Lisbon, in ensuring the success of the Presidency.
I should like to draw attention to the work of REPER, to mention the skills of Ambassador MendonÃ§a e Moura and to express thanks for the effective liaison with the European Parliament provided by Dr Alexandre LeitÃ£o.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, it is the crowning achievement of the Portuguese Presidency that the Treaty of Lisbon is now ready to be signed, and many Members of this Parliament have certainly played their part too.
One of the functions of the Treaty of Lisbon is to strengthen the common foreign and security policy of the EU and to create an institutional basis for it.
A treaty, however, can only create the right conditions, and the will and vigour to pursue a common foreign and security policy are essential too.
It is correct, as some speakers have said, that at this particular juncture, when the Treaty is being signed, Kosovo will be a test of the Member States' resolve to pursue a common foreign and security policy.
Whatever we decide with regard to Kosovo will pose problems in that region.
There is no new third option, as Mr Cohn-Bendit suggested, because a third option, namely devoting a great deal of money and initiative to that region, has already been pursued for some time.
There is only the option of independence for Kosovo, which will then give rise to a number of problems in the region, or else we could decide not to recognise an independent Kosovo, which would also give rise to a number of problems in the region.
It is quite clear, in my view, that we must abide by the principle that every step which is taken in the coming weeks and months must come from within the region and be taken together with the European Union.
That cannot happen, however, unless the European Union has a common position on this issue.
On the basis of my own experience - and I have been working in that region on behalf of the European Parliament for ten years now - I see only one feasible option, which is to move in the immediate future towards limited, restricted and supervised independence.
I firmly believe, however, that it would be absolutely intolerable and unacceptable if Kosovo declared its independence unilaterally and we more or less acquiesced.
Many politicians from Kosovo are also saying that this process can be jointly pursued.
I saw that at first hand during the recent elections there.
The process can be brought to fruition if the European Union opts for a joint approach.
In the closing days of this Presidency, may I also ask the Council to ensure that there is a common European line, that the common responsibility for that region is exercised by all parties and that all steps that are taken in the coming weeks and months are accompanied by an EU presence in Kosovo.
That is the main requirement.
The decisive factor will not be recognition of Kosovo's independence but energetic representation of EU security policy in Kosovo, and the Portuguese President of the Council must play his part in making that a reality.
(Applause)
(NL) Mr President, the new Treaty is being signed at last after years of stalemate, but the parties to it must also at last act as the owners, the real leaders of Europe.
It is high time they stopped simply crowing on the national stage about what they have achieved and started actively canvassing support for this Treaty and pushing for its ratification, so that it can come into force on 1 January 2009.
The biggest change is in police and justice cooperation.
We need to be clear, and quickly, on how we are going to handle the relevant issues in 2008, during the transitional period.
Where does the Council stand on Commissioner Frattini's suggestions about applying the new procedures now, in anticipation of the new rules?
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is also being formally proclaimed today.
And it is shameful that Member States have weakened the Charter by taking it out of the Treaty and especially by endorsing two opt-outs.
They must now prove in practice that they really mean business on fundamental rights, rather than just paying lip service to them.
Lastly, Mr President, the European Union is being made a bit more democratic and a bit more effective.
But a mature democracy must not only be vigorous, it must also scrutinise the exercise of power, and it must be responsible.
It is time for democracy, time to show responsibility - in the fight against terrorism too - so can we please have an explanation from the Council of the part Europe has played in the illegal activities of the CIA.
(PL) Mr President, history tends to repeat itself.
Three years ago the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed.
The leaders of the EU Member States were greatly pleased and sure that the document would enter into force.
However, two nations expressed determined opposition in referendums.
The Heads of Government are now signing an almost identical text and count on being able to avoid referendums this time round.
Clearly, they underestimate this fundamental instrument of democracy.
The time publicly designated as a period of reflection was wasted.
Instead of being devoted to consultation, social dialogue and discussion, it was spent in devising machinery for manipulation.
It must be emphasised that the so-called Reform Treaty is a very high-ranking document, since it leads in fact to restrictions on the sovereignty of the Member States.
It transfers many of the prerogatives hitherto reserved for nation states to EU institutions that are not subject to real democratic control.
I am convinced that if the nations of Europe were given a voice, the treaty being signed tomorrow would share the fate of its predecessor.
(ES) Mr President, a few months ago I telephoned the Ombudsman in my country and while I was hanging on they played 'Let it be', which offered little grounds for optimism as regards the complaint being processed by the Office, as indeed proved to be the case.
This is a frequent sensation for those of us who still cannot see that the European Union is doing anything to incorporate the regional issue or stateless nations into its institutional structure and politics.
Every time, unfortunately, there are more people who believe that that day will never come, and the truth is that we are not given many alternatives.
As far as Kosovo is concerned, we hear about the problems here but I have not heard anyone raise the question which to me is the crucial one: what do the Kosovans want?
With regard to the Lisbon Strategy, we think that there is too much complacency and that this complacency is due, in large measure, to the fact that the indicators for evaluating that strategy are based essentially on growth of GDP.
When are we going to have some indicators of social and environmental progress so that we can evaluate the Lisbon results meaningfully?
(PT) We are attending yet another rehearsal of the basic tenets of the neo-liberal policy which has been pursued during the Portuguese Presidency.
The signing tomorrow of the Lisbon Treaty, containing the essentials of the so-called 'European Constitution', is undoubtedly the more serious issue representing a qualitative advance in the neo-liberal integration that increasingly aggravates social problems and inequalities.
Instead of responses designed to improve working conditions, they rely on flexicurity to make work even more precarious.
Instead of responses designed to improve living conditions and address the problem of poverty which affects more than 80 million people, they present an even more neo-liberal version of the Lisbon Strategy designed to pursue the liberalisation and privatisation of public services.
So, as with the events of 18 October and the demonstration in Lisbon, the workers and the people will continue the battle against this Treaty and these policies and the campaign for binding referendums on the Treaty after properly conducted, pluralist debates.
(NL) Mr President, when Venezuela voted recently in a referendum, rejecting Chavez's plans for a radical change to the constitution by a very narrow majority, the would-be dictator of Venezuela bowed to the will of the people, as leaders ought to in a more or less free country.
I think that we in Europe might learn a lot from his example.
We are seeing a 'European Constitution', democratically rejected in two Member States by a large majority of the electorate, dished up to us afresh.
Virtually unaltered, apart from a few cosmetic changes.
There is no room for any more real debate and certainly not for a referendum in countries likely to be critical of it or to vote no.
The European Constitution - sorry, the Reform Treaty - is being signed in Lisbon amid much pomp and ceremony and will then be rushed through the parliaments that support it with indecent haste.
Europe is a sham democracy.
And the way in which the Eurocrats treat the voice of the people was again apparent very recently in what Commissioner Rehn told us about the possibility of Turkish accession.
He is on record as saying that national agreements or specific election pledges must not stand in the way of Turkish accession.
The European mandarins don't give two hoots about the election promises made to voters about Turkey's accession.
In Venezuela there is still democracy for the time being, but sadly a lot less of it in Europe.
Mr President, there are some important issues on the agenda of the forthcoming European Council.
I look forward to hearing about improving Europe's competitiveness, about progress towards Europe's ambitious goals for tackling climate change and about Europe's commitment to working with the developing nations to alleviate poverty.
Yet the focus this week will inevitably be on the signing of the Reform Treaty in Lisbon.
As we British Conservatives have consistently said, there was no substantive requirement for this far-reaching Treaty and, just this week, one of Europe's leading academic experts published a report on the effects of enlargement of the EU.
She has stated clearly what we have been saying for some time, namely that the EU has been operating perfectly well without this Reform Treaty.
She says, and I quote, 'The evidence of practice since May 2004 suggests that the EU's institutional processes and practice have stood up rather robustly to the impact of enlargement'.
This is important bearing in mind all we have been told - that the EU could not cope with enlargement without institutional upheaval or even log-jam.
All of this reinforces our view that this Treaty is all about political symbolism rather than any objective assessment of what Europe needs.
In addition to challenging the rationale for this Treaty, we have also been very critical of the process that brought us to this stage.
It beggars belief to claim that this Treaty is not in substance the selfsame European Constitution that was so emphatically rejected when it was put to the vote in France and the Netherlands.
Alone among his fellow leaders, the British Prime Minister persists in perpetuating this myth that the Treaty and the Constitution are different.
The British people do not believe him and the vast majority have repeatedly expressed their view that there should be a referendum.
Mr Brown has ignored their wishes and this has done much to undermine his Government and the European Union more generally.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, in 1981 one per cent of Europe's population possessed 8% of its overall wealth.
Twenty-five years on, the wealthiest one per cent has 17% of total income in the European Union.
Meanwhile, one person in six - a total of 74 million Europeans - lives below the poverty line as defined in the individual Member States.
Were it not for social transfers, around 185 million Europeans - almost 4% of the population - would slide into poverty.
Hence the need for an active social policy: a policy to redistribute wealth.
The Union's effort on the social front is, however, particularly puny.
The vision that the Commission has just outlined, of a more socially orientated Europe in the 21st century, is conceptually flawless but bereft of any actual legislative initiative.
Commission President Barroso has just told us that the Lisbon Strategy is bearing fruit.
He is right.
Yet, at the same time, the economic upturn in Europe is threatened by a particularly treacherous version of globalisation, in the shape of financial markets without frontiers.
The so-called 'subprime' lending crisis had its origins in frenetic consumerism in the United States.
The global financial industry went in for 'special vehicles' funded through unsound mortgages, and the cream of the banking, insurance and pensions sector treated us to yet another triumph of greed over intelligence.
The financial sector itself, of course, risks nothing: it is 'too big to fail'.
National central banks and taxpayers will ensure a safe landing for the golden parachutists, and that will not come cheap.
Economic activity in Europe has already slowed down.
Recession is looming in the United States.
The dollar is sinking and prices of raw materials, including basic foodstuffs, are soaring.
The credit crunch is already affecting small and medium-sized companies and would-be home buyers.
Reading the draft conclusion of the Lisbon Council, I find no prospect of Europe bouncing back, and I find that bitterly regrettable.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start with the apparently small victory that French President Sarkozy won by getting rid of the word accession from the negotiations under way with Turkey.
It changes nothing of course, the negotiations will continue; however, Sarkozy, who is currently the strongest and the most political of the European Heads of State, as borne out by the speech that he gave to this House, then comes to talk to us about Europe's borders and the Mediterranean Union and people say rather dismissively 'he doesn't know what he is talking about, what is this Mediterranean Union, he doesn't know what game he is playing'.
In my view, the game he is playing is very clear and concerns Europe's borders: the Mediterranean Union is the strategy of the Europe of nations.
In practice, if the approach were solely one of a relationship between nations, a Mediterranean Union could well be a reasonable way of solving economic, trade, and environmental problems.
It is not reasonable, however, and an alternative needs to be found, if we want something else, if we want a Europe of law, of individual rights in particular, a Europe of citizens rather than a Europe of states.
That is the alternative that the Heads of State, the Commission and the European Union must use to counter Sarkozy's French strategy of a Europe of nations.
We have to decide whether we want the Charter of Fundamental Rights, one day in the future, to be the Charter of Rights of Turkish citizens, the Charter of Rights of Moroccan citizens, the Charter of Rights of Israeli and Palestinian citizens; we have to decide whether or not we want to give our Europe such a future, as otherwise the Europe of nations and states will prevail.
To conclude, some people are wearing 'referendum on Europe' tee-shirts: yes to a European referendum, no to national referendums, because referendums bring out all the populism, extremism, nationalism and communism of our Europe.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fortunately there are still patriots in Europe and obviously we shall call for a national referendum.
We shall continue to call for referendums, because we believe in a Europe of peoples, not in a Europe of high finance which supports and funds that whole technocratic policy, that whole way of running the bedlam of the European institutions.
That is precisely the picture that emerges from the restyling of your Treaty - the confirmation of an institution dominated by a techno-bureaucracy answerable only to itself and feeding only itself.
Where in this new version is there anything, for instance, reflecting the strong call to defend the European social model which emerged from the popular referendums; what answer have you given?
On the borders, no answer and continuing generic waffle about enlargement, without raising the geopolitical problem of Europe's borders which, for us, is the key issue.
An edifice such as Europe, which has its historic roots in the public law of the Holy Roman Empire, is not built by taking the value of the euro against the dollar as its spiritual horizon.
There are other points of reference, especially, in our view, Europe's Christian roots.
You will not solve the crucial problems facing Europe through your legal subterfuges or by letting yourselves be guided by the judgments of the European Court of Justice.
States cannot be governed in that way, and nor can Europe's future, Europe's history.
Long live the Europe of peoples, the Europe of Christian roots!
(PT) Tomorrow the Prime Ministers and Heads of State will sign the Lisbon Treaty in Lisbon.
After that they will call for ratification.
The difference is not in the text, which is a replica of the Constitution rejected by the French and Dutch.
The difference is in the method.
Now they are asking for rapid ratification without referendums.
A few days ago, Mr Zapatero expressed here in this House his wish to see the citizens of the various Member States pronounce that very day on the Treaty that will determine our common future.
At the summit on Friday, the governments will have an opportunity to dispel the suspicion that hangs over each and every one of them, the suspicion that they want the new Treaty to be approved behind the people's backs.
Let them seize Mr Zapatero's suggestion with both hands.
Let them set the day.
Today, the Lisbon Treaty is not really your Treaty.
It will never be the Europeans' Treaty while its viability depends on not holding referendums.
Let them have the courage to meet the demand for democracy, because Europe itself depends on democracy!
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, we often discuss how to bring the EU closer to the citizens and make it more democratic without acting upon it.
Tomorrow the heads of state or government will sign the Reform Treaty and they have already been announcing in advance that they do not want referenda to take place.
It is sad that this Parliament has for most part applauded this.
It is an expression of the highest arrogance and disregard for the citizens' voice.
I have the impression that the politicians are either too lazy to explain the new Treaty or - worse still - they are afraid of the citizens.
The politicians do not want to have to explain how the new Treaty will change the Member States' share in decision-making within the EU.
The politicians do not want to have to explain to the citizens that they will not have 'their' Commissioner in the Commission.
They do not want to have to defend the fact that issues such as migration, energy and transport will not be dealt with in the individual states but in Brussels.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not win the citizens over for the rules governing the new configuration of the EU, if we do not explain to them, on the one hand, the advantages of integration and, on the other, the issues of loss of national sovereignty, which the Treaty clearly implies in some areas, the gap between the political elite and the citizens will continue to grow wider and wider.
This is why I consider referenda to be a key aspect of the Treaty ratification process.
Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty will have a significant impact on the foreign policy of the European Union in the coming future.
Our discussions in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in this House allow me to pronounce a very positive view on the new Treaty for a number of reasons.
A single framework greatly enhances the coherence of the EU's external action: the new Treaty implies a major step forward when compared to the existing arrangements.
It provides an explicitly legal basis for the Neighbourhood Policy, establishes a single legal personality of the Union as a whole and obliges Member States to consult one another and to demonstrate mutual solidarity.
In the institutional aspect, major improvements are made by enhancing the powers of the double-hatted High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security who is at the same time Vice-President of the European Commission and by establishing the European external action service.
Most importantly, the new Treaty enhances the budgetary powers of Parliament over EU foreign policy spending, putting the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council.
Moreover, the new legal basis for instruments or policies related to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) are also established, for instance the sanctions against non-state entities, space policy and energy security, combating climate change, prevention of international terrorism and protection of personal data.
In fact, the greatest improvements refer to the European security and defence policy (ESDP), since the Lisbon Treaty provides in particular for a permanent structured cooperation in defence between those Member States with the military capability.
From our point of view, however, the new Treaty also suffers from a few shortcomings: the European Parliament should be consulted on the nomination of the new High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, not only for the first person to take office on 1 January 2009, but also in the case of the interim appointment afterwards and, obviously, when appointing the whole Commission, including its Vice-President for Foreign Affairs.
Let me also highlight the need for the new, newly-elected High Representative and Vice-President to effectively consult Parliament ex ante on the main aspects of the basic choices of CFSP and ESDP.
To sum up: the Lisbon Treaty constitutes a milestone in the institutional development of the European Union in foreign affairs and, as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to warmly welcome its pending signature.
(PL) Mr President, three years after the end of the Second World War the United Nations Organisation proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which remains the standard text in this field.
Almost 60 years later the European Union codified human rights in its Charter of Fundamental Rights, a document meeting the needs and expectations of Europeans on the threshold of the 21st century.
Why then have two States, Poland and the United Kingdom - so committed to the codification of human rights at international level - objected to the Charter?
Why do they not wish to give it to their own citizens?
My disappointment as a Pole is all the greater as both Poland and the United Kingdom had previously accepted the Charter.
Their prime ministers and ministers of foreign affairs signed it as the second part of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome on 29 October 2004.
Their signatures not only obligated them vis-Ã -vis their European partners, but also constituted a signal to the citizens of their own states and a promise that they would abide by the Charter.
The content of the Charter has not changed since 2004.
What has changed is the attitude of Poland and the United Kingdom.
My question is: why are the successors to Tony Blair and Marek Belka objecting to the Charter and depriving their fellow citizens of its benefits?
I would also request the Chairman of the Council of Europe to ask the present prime ministers of Poland and the United Kingdom why they are not honouring the signatures of their predecessors.
In foreign policy the principle of continuity is fundamental, and we citizens - I refer to the Poles - need the rights embodied in the Charter.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said here on the substance of the Treaty.
We German Liberals have always attached vital importance to certain key points.
Firstly, the institutional compromise had to be preserved.
Secondly, we wanted an EU foreign minister, not as an embellishment but as a genuine mouthpiece of the European Union.
We agree entirely with what Jacek Saryusz-Wolski said a few moments ago about institutional improvements.
We still believe, however, that the Common Foreign and Security Policy will continue for the foreseeable future to stand or fall by the political will of the Member States, and that is regrettable.
The third point to which we attached particular importance was firm protection of fundamental rights, and for this reason we look forward eagerly to the proclamation of the Charter.
On the whole, it must be said that the Treaty of Lisbon is a success for German-Portuguese cooperation, for which both Presidencies deserve to be congratulated.
A real fly in the ointment, however, is the lack of progress in bringing decision-making processes closer to the people.
The Council's decision not to present a consolidated text is what we would call Realsatire in German, meaning a real-life situation which is more absurd than anything a satirist could dream up.
This decision will soon be overtaken by events, however.
I am sure that the public and the parliaments will obtain copies of the consolidated text for themselves and read up on what the Treaty is really all about.
We must now enter a phase in which the European Union reverts from institutional navel-gazing to the adoption of a global outlook.
We must discharge our international economic responsibility.
The general state of the world economy raises the spectre of slower growth and job losses in Europe.
In many Member States, including my own, I am aware of a reversion to complacency and a weakening of the will to enact reforms.
That has to change.
My second point is that we must play our role in international politics responsibly.
People want the European Union to have a strong global role.
The responsibility is ours.
(PL) Mr President, Europe is not only an agreement among elites.
It is not only the European institutions.
Europe is above all a matter of trust.
Yesterday, however, Udo Voigt, the chairman of the National Democratic Party of Germany, declared on Germany's public television channel that Poland must immediately return Silesia to the Germans - that Poland should immediately give Pomerania, GdaÅsk, WrocÅaw and other cities back to the Germans.
At the same time he questioned the figures regarding the number of victims of the Holocaust.
I ask myself today, when the spirit of Europe moves upon the face of the waters and above this Parliament, why Mr Schulz has lost his revolutionary sensitivity.
Why did the German Government not speak out strongly?
This is the kind of thing that led to the Third Reich.
We demand a sharp reprimand and delegalisation of the fascist party in question, which is doing something that can inflict the greatest harm on Europe: it is destroying trust between European nations that are striving for the common good.
Germany, as a leading European state, should be especially sensitive to this kind of activity and take action immediately for the good of the European Communities.
(FR) Mr President, I too should like to join in congratulating the Portuguese Presidency.
The signing of the Lisbon Treaty and the EU-Africa summit will take their place as landmarks in European history.
However, we cannot allow these tremendous successes to be overshadowed by coming events, and on that subject I must mention two concerns.
The first is about ratification of the forthcoming treaty.
The fact of abandoning the draft Constitution and replacing it by an ordinary treaty means there is now no impediment in any of the Member States - except Ireland - to ratification by a vote in parliament.
That is a key feature of the political agreement concluded at the June and October European Councils.
If, since then, any government has had a change of heart, the least it should do, in the interests of fairness to its partners, is to inform them before signature of the treaty and not afterwards.
Mr President of the Council, I am confident the Portuguese Presidency will ensure that basic fairness prevails here.
My second concern - and it has already been mentioned by a number of my colleagues - is the situation in the western Balkans.
For eight years now we have known that Kosovan independence must come sooner or later.
Yet today, despite the considerable efforts invested by Javier Solana and the Commission, we are no less disconcerted by the situation than we were eight years ago.
We have said repeatedly that the western Balkan region is destined to become part of the Union, and we claim to be embarking on a common foreign policy.
Yet successive Presidencies of the Union have done no more than pass the hot potato to the next in line.
Things have changed since 1991.
Sixteen years and 300 000 deaths have intervened and it is time for the EU countries to show they have learned the lessons of that sad past.
The future of the Balkans will not be decided in Washington or Moscow, or even in New York: it will be decided here in Europe, among the peoples who are directly affected and their European neighbours, friends and partners.
Mr President, I shall speak first about Kosovo.
In the Balkans and the Caucasus, we see a conflict between European values and nationalist tendencies, between European integration and movements and ideas that are supported by Russia.
If, in the future, we look back, I am quite sure that we will never regret the efforts we can make today in order to support European integration with all the different means we have, but we might very well, in the future, regret the efforts we have not made.
I think it is important to discuss that at the European Council at the end of this week.
I wish, secondly, to speak about globalisation.
I think it is important to remember that it is globalisation that has made Europe into a leading world economy and that globalisation is a necessity if we are to be the world's leading knowledge economy, because we will never be world leaders if we are only the best in Europe.
We can never achieve results by protectionist measures.
In the long term that will undermine the opportunities for jobs and prosperity, but it will not give us the opportunity to be a world-leading economy as well as defending European values.
That leads us to the conclusion that it is important that the European Council underlines all the efforts that are needed regarding energy legislation, telecom legislation, the internal market, trade and competition.
Competition is not a fight between different personalities or identities.
It is an opportunity for all to participate and to move Europe ahead.
That is the way we should choose, and that is how we can use the Treaty in the absolute best way to respond to the global challenge.
That opportunity has been given to us this week and we should use it.
(ES) Mr President, President of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I feel it right that we should start by publicly recognising the work of the Portuguese Presidency on a date which is very significant for the European Parliament, as exemplified by the ornamental front to the Presidency podium depicting the solemn declaration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Portuguese Presidency received - and I say this as a representative of the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference - a draft in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights was only declaration No 11.
It is also right to point out - as the President of the Council told me personally at the beginning - that it was virtually impossible to change that status, and I believe that in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference we jointly managed to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights was a legally binding charter.
The Member States did not want to include it in the Treaty, but it is a Charter and has a constitutional status.
I think we should remember the efforts made by many men and women over the years in the European Parliament in order to achieve that Charter.
I think we ought to remember the woman who embodies the tragedy and the power to overcome of 20th century Europe, Simone Weil, not to mention men such as Altiero Spinelli, Fernand Herman and many others who worked for so many years so that, finally, we could have a declaration of rights which would express our identity.
