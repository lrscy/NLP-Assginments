Â Â  The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Councilâs annual report on human rights.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Presidency warmly welcomes this debate.
It emphasises the high priority which all EU institutions attach to the promotion and protection of human rights. It also recognises the immense importance of communicating the EUâs policies and actions in support of human rights clearly and confidently to the outside world.
The then General Affairs Council decided in December 1998, on the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that the European Union should enhance its actions on human rights, and that it should draw up an annual report on human rights.
This yearâs report â covering the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 â is the seventh such annual report.
Its purpose is to provide an overview of the work of the European Union, through its institutions, in promoting human rights.
It is, obviously, only able to highlight those areas where EU action has been particularly significant during the reporting period.
It does not seek to be fully comprehensive and it does not try to duplicate information which is already available from, for example, EU websites, or to provide an account of action taken by individual Member States.
But it does provide European Union citizens, civil society partners and governments and human rights defenders in third countries with a regular, accessible overview of EU concerns, priorities and actions.
Much of the report focuses on the European Unionâs promotion of human rights and democratisation as part of its common foreign and security policy.
But, domestically, the European Union must also be consistent and coherent with the policies that it promotes abroad.
We all recognise that, while much has been done to promote human rights within the European Union, there is still scope to improve.
The report therefore sets out significant internal developments, including the continuing work to establish an EU Fundamental Rights Agency.
And the chapters on thematic priorities, such as the human rights of women or human rights and business, include developments within the European Union, as well as those abroad and in multilateral organisations.
The report also provides information on EU instruments and initiatives in third countries, for example, the EUâs human rights dialogues with China and Iran, and the new human rights consultations established during 2005 with Russia.
It includes information on the wide range of activities implemented by the European Commission through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
The report highlights that the EIDHR was created at Parliamentâs initiative, and that Parliament has used its budgetary powers to increase substantially the resources earmarked for the protection of human rights and democracy.
There is also information about policy development and specific action in relation to 17Â thematic issues.
These include areas where the EU has adopted human rights guidelines such as on the death penalty, torture, human rights defenders and the rights of children, including their involvement in armed conflict, as well as on other issues, ranging from human rights and terrorism to democracy and elections and the International Criminal Court.
The report provides an overview of EU action in the key international organisations: the United Nations Commission for Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee, the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
It also provides a country-focused perspective, with an account of EU action in its immediate neighbourhood, in Africa, in the Americas, in Asia and in the Middle East.
The Council will continue to look for ways to improve its report.
There were a number of innovations in 2005.
The first â which, I am sure you will agree, was welcome, and perhaps overdue â was the inclusion of a substantive chapter outlining the extensive work that the European Parliament has done in support of human rights and democratisation.
Everyone recognises that Parliament adopts its own annual report and resolution on human rights in the world and on the European Unionâs policy.
However, I think it is both right and helpful that readers of this report get a sense of how the Council, Commission and Parliament all contribute together to the common EU goal of promoting and protecting human rights around the world.
I would like to repeat, at this point, the Councilâs warm welcome for the re-establishment of Parliamentâs Subcommittee on Human Rights last year.
I know how much the Council, and in particular its Working Group on Human Rights, values the contact and cooperation which is being established with that subcommittee.
This yearâs report also sets out, for the first time, to provide readers with practical examples of the EU in action.
For example, the chapter on racism, xenophobia and non-discrimination includes information on an EIDHR project to combat discrimination against Dalits in Nepal.
The chapter on the rights of the child includes a project to promote the rights of children in the New Independent States.
We believe that these specific examples will help readers make the connection between EU policy and our ability to deliver real changes to the lives of real people right around the world.
A further innovation this year was the introduction of some analysis of where EU action has worked well and, indeed, where there were gaps in our performance.
A short analysis is provided at the end of each main chapter.
It will always be the case that some internal reflection must remain internal, if the EU is to act effectively in, for example, UN negotiations or in its relations with certain third countries.
But it is also important for NGOs and other key partners to have a sense of where we are content with our performance and where we ourselves want to do more.
This analysis is a modest but useful step in that direction.
Like any annual report, this one has its limits.
Agreed by the Council in early October, it provides information on EU action up to June 2005.
Events have obviously moved on since then.
Our Presidency has sought to use the six months since June to build on the broad range of existing EU commitments.
We have taken forward efforts to mainstream human rights throughout the European Unionâs work.
We have, for example, sought to implement the EUâs human rights guidelines, with a particular focus on freedom of expression, by action in support of those who defend human rights where they have suffered for exercising their freedom of expression.
Within the United Nations, the EU is actively involved in negotiations in New York to establish a new UN Human Rights Council.
There have also been many specific human rights issues and concerns which have been taken up over the past six months.
We will look today, for example, at the situation in Tunisia.
Many of these issues could be the subject for next yearâs annual report.
In conclusion, I look forward to hearing the views of the European Parliament and those of the Commission on the report itself, and on the various issues that it covers.
We want to work to ensure that this report is right.
But, more importantly we need to continue to work together to get EU policies and actions right, to ensure that we have real gains in human rights protection around the world to report in years to come.
Â Â  . Madam President, I very much welcome the latest edition of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights covering the Unionâs human rights activities for the period of June 2004 to June 2005.
The special thing about this report is that, for the first time, it has been drawn up jointly by the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
The Council and the Commission have been doing so in recent years, but, for the first time, Parliament is also associated with it.
That gives valuable credit to the report.
The EU Annual Report on Human Rights is a very important expression of the crucial importance of human rights policy in the overall policy setting of the European Union.
It covers both the EU internal policy developments in the human rights dimension, in particular in the external and international dimensions.
Its broad coverage of all major thematic and geographic human rights issues underscores the European Unionâs strong attachment to the protection and promotion of human rights as defining principles of the Union across the board: as a community of shared values, founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.
Let me briefly touch upon some of these items.
I have six points to make.
This year is a crucial year for the future of the UN human rights system, with the ongoing negotiations on the creation of a new institution, the Human Rights Council, as a successor to the existing, widely contested Human Rights Commission.
In pursuit of the UN Summit conclusions in September, it is without exaggeration the rarest of opportunities for the international community to club together to improve on the ability of the UN to monitor, improve and act decisively on critical human rights situations throughout the world.
Had it not been for the European Union, it would not have worked.
I was there at the start of the Millennium Summit.
I know how difficult it was to come to an agreement, but there, the EU made the difference.
Our expectations remain high as to the expected result, and our capacity to influence the world community positively should have a favourable bearing upon the negotiating process.
However, we should be under no illusions as to the resistance many countries are putting up to improving effectively the current UN human rights system.
We will need to mobilise all our energies and outreach efforts if we are to bring the current, rather difficult negotiations to a successful conclusion.
The human rights dimension impacts increasingly on the European Unionâs external relations with a range of countries around the world: the human rights dialogue with China; the dialogue with Iran â though, regrettably, we have not had a dialogue round for more than a year, but we hope to have one again; the human rights consultations with Russia; the local human rights dialogues at the level of the heads of missions of the European Union in numerous other countries; and, specifically, our developments under the European Neighbourhood Policy and its human rights related agenda under the various action plans, where a great deal is always concentrated and reserved for human rights.
All this amply demonstrates that the European Union is not alone in actively pursuing its agenda of human rights promotion in its external policy: we are also seeing an increasing willingness by our partners to acknowledge that human rights protection is an essential feature of their own countriesâ development.
Still, much has to be done.
In this context, I am often asked what these dialogues or consultations really achieve.
My answer to that is as follows: as each round is completed, so another opportunity has been taken not only to exchange ideas â so important to our dialogue partners who do not wish to be preached to â but above all, for us, also to explain from our own hard-won experience how we, in the European Union, have adapted legislation and administrative practices in order to respect fundamental rights and how we expect our partners to take a similar path.
I am convinced that, little by little, the message gets through.
The dialogues and consultations allow the EU to raise and discuss individual cases of political prisoners or other persons suffering human rights abuses.
On the basis of the European Communityâs association agreements or partnership and cooperation agreements with third countries, the Commission regularly reviews the partner countriesâ respect for international human rights standards.
Indeed, the policy dialogues with many of our partners under these agreements include substantial discussions on relevant human rights and democracy related issues in partner countries.
Our colleague has already mentioned some very concrete issues.
The Commission has taken the initiative to establish â with some of those policy dialogues â working groups on human rights and good governance, within the framework of the regular Joint Committee consultations, for example, with Vietnam, Jordan or Morocco.
I would like to draw your attention, in particular, to the five-year work programme on Barcelona, where important goals on human rights are indeed included.
Moreover, as you are aware, all Community agreements now contain a specific human rights clause as an essential element.
In this respect, the Commission is keen to ensure that the clauses are used as a positive tool to improve the human rights situation in partner countries.
It is my belief that these structured exchanges on human rights offer a very promising way of realising the goals for which the human rights clauses have been included.
Indeed, there will be times, in cases of widespread, egregious human rights violations, when sanctions need to be imposed or even an agreement suspended, such as in the case of Zimbabwe or Togo.
However, generally speaking, we should avoid putting too much emphasis on a âmechanicalâ approach to sanctions or suspension.
Rather, it seems to me, the crucial point is to scrutinise systematically the human rights records of our partners and to induce them through political and assistance means to live up to their obligations under the human rights clause of the agreement.
In that context, I am very grateful for the draft report on the human rights clauses prepared so assiduously by the honourable Member, Mr Agnoletto.
His report will oblige all human rights actors within the European Union, and particularly within its institutions, to reflect further on their value and on the most appropriate way of using them.
The EU Annual Human Rights Report also reflects the re-casting of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the 2005-06 period.
The modifications to the programming under that initiative have been based on the result of a careful assessment and designed to respond in the first place to the demands of the potential beneficiaries of the initiative.
As a consequence, four campaigns have been designed with a more flexible geographic coverage and integrating actions at global, regional and country level.
Two elements are particularly dear to me: the stronger commitment to mainstreaming the rights of women and children, as well as the enhanced incentive for the effective participation of civil society organisations from partner countries in the developing world.
At the moment, while the last contracts under the 2004 budget of this initiative are being awarded, the publication of the important calls for proposals for the 2005-06 budgets is imminent; indeed, they should be published any day now.
At the same time, country-specific calls for proposals are going ahead, and the next annual report will give details of this exercise.
The key point here is that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, in its present and future forms, is an essential and integral part of the European Unionâs overall human rights policy.
The European Union derives great strength in its relations with third countries from unified positions on many human rights issues of strategic importance.
I need think only of the guidelines we have agreed on the death penalty, torture, children in armed conflict and human rights defenders.
These, used well, are excellent tools of great influence.
I would therefore like to salute the efforts undertaken under the Luxembourg and UK Presidencies this year in orchestrating very effective campaigns under these guidelines.
I would also like to salute the work of the many Commission delegations which contributed so effectively to the respective Troika demarches in the target countries.
The same teamwork is true for the outreach campaign on the subject of the envisaged Human Rights Council â which I mentioned at the beginning â which was conducted in 77Â countries.
The more that the Union, its Member States and its institutions speak with one voice on human rights matters, the greater the political impact is.
Therefore, we should not cease in our efforts, in the Council, in Parliament and in the Commission, to work together as closely and efficiently as possible.
In that sense, we present this annual report and hopefully this is a stark reminder of the enormous challenges still lying ahead and the good work that has been done in the past.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am glad to make a brief contribution to this debate.
The Councilâs 2005 report on human rights is a good summary of human rights activity and aspirations within the EU and the impact that such activity is having outside the Union.
As the author of Parliamentâs most recent human rights report, I was pleased to see almost all of the thematic issues raised in Parliamentâs report dealt with in this document too, reflecting consistency of thought and priority.
The death penalty, childrenâs rights â and, in particular, children in armed conflict â womenâs rights and gender equality, the role of international business in human rights, human rights in the fight against terrorism and the role of the ICC in the fight against impunity are all issues that need to be given continued priority by consecutive Council presidencies and the Commission.
I believe, if possible, we should be moving towards the creation of one substantial human rights annual report for the EU in future, representing the views of the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
It makes no sense for Parliament to duplicate the work of the Council.
Our separate role should be to analyse critically the performance of the Council and the Commission in relation to meeting targets set out in key areas outlined in an EU annual human rights report.
Parliament needs to be actively involved in drafting this report in future years and not merely presented with the finished article before it is published.
Finally, while we are debating human rights in the EU for 2005, I cannot let the occasion pass without registering my concern regarding the need for clarity on the so-called CIA rendition flights issue.
I am one of many Members in this House from EU countries that have facilitated the landing and refuelling of US aircraft â military and CIA â in recent years.
As a spokesman on human rights, I would be a hypocrite not to demand clarity as to whether or not detainees have been transferred through EU countries to third countries where they may be at risk of torture.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the UK Presidency for agreeing to present the annual human rights report to Parliament today, the first time this has been done since the Finnish Presidency in 1999.
As this yearâs parliamentary rapporteur on the annual human rights report, the President-in-Office is aware that it is my intention, rather than duplicating the Councilâs work in this area â as Mr Coveney has already indicated â to strengthen collaboration between the Council and Parliament so that the European Union can send a stronger and more coherent message in favour of human rights to the wider world.
I thank the President-in-Office for his support for Parliamentâs subcommittee in his speech this afternoon.
However, I invite him to indicate the Councilâs willingness to enter into a debate with Parliament on our closer collaboration in relation to the annual report itself when he replies to this debate.
The annual human rights report this year should be welcomed for its scope and honesty.
In a year when the Council has evaluated the human rights dialogues with specific countries, the finding that the dialogue with China has had little, if any, impact is indeed a very important one.
The report overall is stronger at stating actions rather than evaluating their effectiveness and I hope we will see greater use of human rights impact assessments in future years.
At a time when the European Union has to stand firm in New York in seeking to strengthen support for a strong Human Rights Council in the United Nations, all of us could reflect on whether the European Union itself gives sufficient priority to human rights vis-Ã -vis the importance we give to trade and development in our own external relations.
I remind the Commissioner that, despite her comments this afternoon, Parliament is still looking for her support to retain a separate legal base on the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
I hope we will hear from her too.
Finally, let us take one of the bloodiest events of 2005: the massacre of hundreds of people in Andijan on 13Â May and the subsequent arrest and torture by the Uzbek authorities of seemingly anyone who might be a witness.
The EU suspension of parts of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the arms embargo and visa restrictions represent and categorically show to the world that this European Union can and will uphold human rights.
Â Â  Madam President, the EUâs foreign policy is based on the defence of peace, democracy, human rights and the state governed by law, and that is why we attach such importance to the political dimension of the Copenhagen criteria when we negotiate with the new Member States.
In this area, the EU too has, of course, been extremely successful in disseminating these values.
It is naturally more difficult when it comes to other countries.
Even though human rights are always included in theory, it is difficult to achieve our objectives through dialogue.
We have clauses but, as you know, Parliament has recommended that they be compulsory and be activated.
We cannot be content merely to protest vaguely at events such as those in Tunisia in which fundamental human rights are grossly violated.
Tunisia is a country closely associated with the EU.
As we know, the human rights dialogues with China and Iran are going badly.
Nor is such dialogue making any progress in Russia.
Today, we have seen how our Sakharov Prize winners â the ladies from Cuba â are not being given permission to come here.
I hope that the Council and the Commission can step up their protests against the dictator in Havana, who continues to mock the whole world.
There is a lot more to do when it comes to Zimbabwe, Belarus, Burma, Saudi Arabia etc.
We know, of course, that the EU, as a soft power, is fantastically powerful.
We are the only international actor that really can bring about great things if we are agreed on the defence of human rights and values.
Those around us expect us to have a common foreign policy through which we can play a role on the international stage and speak with one voice.
This foreign policy, which takes the form of trade, aid and political and economic cooperation, must always be guided by respect for human rights.
As democrats, we have a responsibility for making sure we combat lack of freedom and spread democracy and human rights as far afield as the villages of Colombia, Zimbabwe and North Korea.
That is why this report is an important and constructive tool.
I only hope that, in the future, it may become somewhat more strategic so that we obtain a still more cohesive human rights policy.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, I, like my fellow Members, am delighted that we should be holding this debate today on the annual report on human rights.
I am especially delighted by a new chapter focused on analysing the effectiveness of the European Unionâs instruments and initiatives.
This is precisely the angle chosen by the European Parliament to draft, in full cooperation with the political groups, its report for this year. This outcome demonstrates that, in over the next few years, we â the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament â will, in the long run, finally be in a position to draft a genuine joint report together.
To reach this stage, it is important that a continual flow of information circulate between our institutions.
I should like to emphasise, for example, the Council conclusions of 12Â December, which informed us that the Council â we had no doubts about this â had, on behalf of human rights defenders, launched active lobbying campaigns under the leadership of the Heads of Mission in third countries.
Well, it is very useful for MEPs to know to whom, when and how the Council and the ambassadors in third countries provide their support under the guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders.
Another example: the Council compiles fact sheets evaluating the human rights situations in the various countries.
Here too, the Council should pass on these fact sheets to Parliament so that the various delegations and committees might refer to them in the context of their everyday work.
Another example: I read in this report that, for the first time ever, Chinese representatives had participated in the structured dialogue on human rights between the Union and China.
In these conditions, I do not understand why Members themselves were not involved in this dialogue, and Members are, moreover, requesting that all representatives be involved in all of the dialogues, irrespective of the structure of these dialogues.
As regards the Commission, finally, we are aware of the shortcomings of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, but I must say to you, Commissioner, that I have the gravest reservations and concerns in the face of the document currently being examined by the European Commission on the implementation of the horizontal programme for human rights.
This document in no way meets the European Parliamentâs expectations, any more than it meets those of the NGOs, as you will see âŠ
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very much to be welcomed that the EU has published an annual report on human rights for the past seven years.
It is also right and proper to have adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
At the same time, however, we should be wary of an attitude that was all too common in Communist times, namely that an office or agency should be set up every time a problem arises.
This leads me on to something the Council representative mentioned a few moments ago.
I refer to the question of whether there is in fact any need for a Fundamental Rights Agency.
We have yet to see convincing proof that such a need exists.
It is good news that the EU is cooperating with various bodies in the field of human rights, such as the OSCE and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
It is bad news, however, that the EUâs actions sometimes amount to a acceptance of double standards.
We consistently stand up for human rights in small and weak countries, but we fail to do the same in the case of large and strong countries. The reason for this is that we like to do business with the latter.
We defend human rights in enemy and neutral countries, but we are not bold enough to speak out when human rights are violated in countries that are our allies.
In addition, there are times when CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldner fails to speak out, especially when it comes to regions and countries that are seen as strategic partners for the EU.
I would call for some consistency in this regard, and for human rights, which belong to the EUâs fundamental values, no longer to be observed selectively.
Â Â  Madam President, the reason why the EU is accepted throughout the world as the voice of human rights is that, more than other institutions, it backs its words up with deeds.
The Commissioner was quite right to describe as a key point the clause that is making human rights an essential component in trade and cooperation agreements with third countries.
To date, 120 agreements of this kind have been concluded.
The Report on Human Rights lists the major successes that were achieved in 2005, including such things as tighter export controls on material capable of being misused for the purposes of torture, or the campaign against child abusers who use the Internet for their own purposes, and the campaign for the recognition of the International Criminal Court.
The report also, though, records such setbacks as the events in African countries â Sudan, Zimbabwe, Congo or Rwanda, for example â or in such Asian countries as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Iran, and Burma.
As before, China comes in for particular criticism; its attitude towards the freedom of opinion, religion, and assembly is not acceptable; critical journalists and lawyers are harassed, human rights activists persecuted, the accused denied fair trials and subjected to torture.
Every year, it executes thousands of people.
The situation in Tibet remains a horror of tragic proportions.
The day after tomorrow, we will be having a debate in which we will be responding to the Chinese military interventions in a Tibetan monastery as a matter of topical and urgent importance.
The EUâs Member States must at last stir themselves into action, rather than always abstaining as they have done hitherto in Geneva.
Chinaâs violations of human rights need to be on the agenda for the Human Rights Convention when it meets there.

Terrorism, alongside civil rights, was the priority for 2005, and wholly justifiably, yet the maintenance of the rule of law is an absolute necessity, and not least as regards the CIAâs transporting of prisoners across Europe, about which we will be having a debate tomorrow afternoon.
The absolute intolerability of any breach of the Human Rights Convention is but one of the messages from the report on human rights.
Â Â  Madam President, we are grateful that, for the first time, the Councilâs report mentions Parliamentâs actions in the field of human rights, because this Parliament does a lot.
We are also grateful that you have come here to present it to this House.
The Socialist Group had asked for this on many occasions.
Thus, our report can be better geared towards the monitoring and evaluation of its commitments.
We have had enough fine words and great speeches, because there are specific situations that require action and compliance with the commitments we have made, such as the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy, which has already been mentioned.
What does the Council do with the resolutions that are adopted in this Parliament?
We have adopted three, with the one that we will adopt this week on Ethiopia.
We have not received any response.
What has happened about GuantÃ¡namo?
What action has it taken?
The lack of action is leading to many problems, despite the serious violations of human rights that are taking place.
I could mention other cases.
It is better to say less and to do more, because if we say too much people will stop believing us.
This Parliament works extremely hard to ensure that its voice is heard, but in order for its voice to be heeded, we need you, and we need you to renew your commitment to European human rights policy, which is supposed to be a fundamental pillar of our external action.
We are still awaiting many replies.
Â Â  Madam President, today we again debate human rights across the world and point out the deficiencies of others.
However, I want to focus this debate on a flagrant breach of human rights perpetuated within this European Union specifically within the United Kingdom.
Council Directive 2000/78/EC rightly prohibits religious discrimination in employment.
Yet pursuant to a derogation under ArticleÂ 15 of that directive, the United Kingdom Government is permitted to practise discrimination against Protestants in Northern Ireland who apply to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland, solely because they are Protestants.
In consequence, hundreds of exceptionally qualified young Protestant applicants have been refused admission to the police, not on merit, but because there is not a matching quantity of applicants from the Catholic community.
So before this House and the EU parade their human rights credentials, I say: let it set about righting that wrong, implementing the directive on employment in its entirety and ending the outrageous discrimination against the majority community in my country.
Â Â  Madam President, I am responsible in the Committee on International Trade for the proposed revision of the human rights clauses in partnership and trade agreements.
Words are not enough; we need action.
Far too often, the Council and Commission are not prepared to trigger the use of these clauses to pressurise third countries to address legitimate concerns.
Can the Council and Commission look at the step-by-step ratcheting-up of pressure that can be built into a new, revised human rights clause?
The second point is that sometimes process failures interfere with product outcomes.
We welcome the human rights dialogue with China and Iran.
For two years the EU was the only place in the world that had a human rights dialogue with a deeply unloved regime in North Korea.
Then the Council sponsored a resolution condemning North Korean human rights in Geneva without informing either the North Koreans or the Commission.
As a result the dialogue was suspended.
This year, we sponsored a new resolution on the ground that we have to have a resolution: we have no dialogue; we fail to recognise that we have no dialogue because we had a resolution.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, 10Â December was International Human Rights Day, and recent events, in particular, have made it clear that much remains to be done.
For example, the USA, too, should feel bound by minimum human rights standards and not circumvent them by means of secret prisons abroad.
Within the EU, too, however, human rights violations continue to occur, particularly in the form of domestic violence, honour killings, polygamy and widespread discrimination against women, which we indirectly tolerate if we accept these as part of Islam in Europe.
In Turkey itself, almost 80% of all women in rural areas are living in forced marriages.
Discrimination against minorities and members of other religions continues.
Given that, in 2004, more applications for asylum were received throughout the EU from people of Turkish than of Iraqi nationality and that, even inÂ 2005, Turkey remains the second most common country of origin of asylum seekers in Germany, for example, it can in no way be assumed that human rights have actually been implemented in Turkish society; and this in a country that is negotiating accession to the EU.
Â Â  â Madam President, the future of the European Union, as a democratic community of principles and values, is linked to the consistent stand of the institutions and of the Member States in defending human rights, minority rights and democratic freedoms.
The European Union needs, firstly, to take initiatives to shape a new, effective, institutional framework to defend human rights within the framework of the UN.
Secondly, it needs to make the issue of the ratification and implementation of all the international conventions on the protection of human rights and abolition of torture chambers a high priority in its relations with third countries.
Thirdly, it needs to help to shape an open and democratic global system of governance of the information society and to combat the digital divide which is creating new relations of dependence and hegemony between the developed and developing countries.
Fourthly, it needs, without selective discrimination and expediencies in the Member States, to apply all the cooperation and association agreements and to implement the mechanisms provided for.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commission and all the honourable Members who contributed to an impressive debate.
I am always impressed by the range of human rights issues on which Members of the European Parliament are active.
I am certainly encouraged by the commitment, not only that shown today but throughout, on these issues.
I would like to deal with one or two of the specific points that have been raised.
First of all, I welcome Richard Howittâs suggestion, and Simon Coveneyâs as well, that we should act on todayâs useful exchange and hold further discussions on our two reports.
A number of honourable Members have expressed a wish for a more active role for the European Parliament in the EUâs annual report on human rights.
As reflected in the conclusions reached at its meeting yesterday, the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomes the cooperation with the Parliament in developing and delivering its human rights policy during 2005 and looks forward to building on that relationship further.
I will ensure that we give very serious reflection to the specific ideas that have been put forward and I am sure that we can find ways to deepen our dialogue.
I want to emphasise that one of the EUâs great strengths lies in its variety of different institutions: they have different and complementary roles.
The Troika often works to promote human rights in an intergovernmental framework.
Parliament can bring its weight and views to bear in different ways and often with much greater flexibility.
We greatly welcome such opportunities to share views and ideas.
We particularly value our regular and open exchanges with the Subcommittee on Human Rights.
We need to make sure our work is well coordinated and coherent, but we must also capitalise on our respective strengths.
It is important to keep some distinction between the roles the different institutions can play in promoting human rights and democratisation.
Glyn Ford raised an important issue about the way in which we use human rights clauses.
The Council will look seriously at any issues put forward by the European Parliament.
It is worth noting that their primary purpose is to provide a constructive platform for engagement with third countries on human rights.
Suspension of any agreement is a last resort and is therefore very rarely used.
Human rights clauses have been invoked in at least 12Â cases since 1995 as a basis for consultation, suspension of aid or other measures involving 10Â ACP countries.
So obviously that is a weapon we are prepared to use.
It has to be used discreetly and effectively if it is to bring results.
I conclude by welcoming once again the strong commitment the EU institutions have shown to promoting human rights and to providing an effective report on EU policy and actions in this area.
It is extremely valuable to have these opportunities to review collectively how we are doing and how we can do better.
We look forward to continued close cooperation with the European Parliament as we take our human rights work forward in the months ahead.
I am very grateful to all those who have contributed to what has been an extremely good debate.
Â Â  . Madam President, let me try to round up this important debate, to which I personally attach great importance.
Of course, there are still many challenges, otherwise we need not have this debate.
However, the Commission uses specific instruments and I would like to give you a few concrete examples, because it sometimes seems that we are only using words.
This is not true, we have many possibilities and we try to use them, but still much has to be done and we have not reached the end.
For instance, we have an instrument through which EURÂ 180Â million is used for promotion of justice and the rule of law, fostering a culture of human rights, promoting the democratic process, advancing equality, tolerance and peace.
Secondly, we have country-specific cooperation programmes, to which a total of EURÂ 35Â million has been allocated.
Thirdly, grants of EURÂ 14Â million have been awarded to international organisations, and we use these for campaigns.
We also have a very important instrument for the EU election observation missions.
Many Members know of it and its importance because they have been chief observers in different countries, although the chief observer does have a certain amount of independence.
This instrument is allocated EURÂ 13Â million.
The Commission has been involved in presidential and parliamentary election missions. It has completed EU election observation missions to Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Burundi, the West Bank and Gaza, also to Lebanon, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Liberia.
Other missions are currently under way, such as those in Venezuela, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and again for the parliamentary elections in the West Bank and Gaza.
The Neighbourhood Policy is my specific responsibility.
There is now an instrument that provides a positive incentive.
I can give 10% to 15% more if a country in the region, for instance Morocco or Jordan, is introducing more reforms in the human rights sector.
I think this is important.
With regard to the CIA, in general we are clearly of the conviction that terrorism can be fought only with full respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Human rights are valid in every situation.
We know that this is a difficult challenge.
It is a challenge to maintain the right balance between improving the right to privacy and combating terrorism.
We have to protect our people but we also have to protect the principles on which our society is based.
Finally, with regard to the democracy and human rights instrument, I have often stated that for us the EIDHR is a flagship policy.
Although it will no longer have a separate legal base, we have proposed a thematic programme for democracy and human rights, with global coverage and with visibility and unified programming, including a separate budget line.
The proposed thematic programme would be identified within each of the proposed external action instruments.
There will be a specific communication on this thematic programme, setting out the scope, objectives and political priorities, which will be presented at the end of January.
I hope there is a chance of agreeing a complete overall package, which will enable the Council, Commission and Parliament to look forward.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia and evaluation of the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis.
Â Â  . Madam President, I shall begin by thanking the European Parliament for proposing this timely debate on Tunisia.
I would like to record our appreciation of Tunisiaâs recent hosting of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society from 16 to 18 November.
We welcome the summitâs agreement to the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, an important contribution to the global effort needed to bridge what is known as the digital divide.
At the same time, it is right for us to consider more generally the issues of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia.
The Council shares the concerns of Members of this House about the human rights situation in Tunisia and is well aware of the shortcomings in Tunisiaâs performance, particularly with respect to acts of intimidation and harassment by the authorities against civil society and human rights activists.
The meeting convened on Thursday, 1Â December, involving MEPs, certain committees and other EU institutions involved in the summit, specifically to discuss human rights concerns in Tunisia, further highlighted the importance of these issues.
Human rights is an essential element in the EUâs relationship with Tunisia, as set out in the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, which came into force on 1Â March 1998, and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan which came into force on 4Â July this year.
Under its action plan, Tunisia has signed up to commitments in the area of democracy, good governance and human rights.
Implementing these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations.
They include, for example, the establishment of an EU-Tunisia subcommittee on human rights.
To this end we continue to urge the Tunisians to establish and hold a first session of a human rights subcommittee as soon as possible.
In addition to this, the EuroMed tenth anniversary summit on 27 and 28Â November in Barcelona represented an important opportunity to help the EUâs Mediterranean partners, including Tunisia, to address the challenges of the 21st century, including in relation to good governance.
At the EuroMed Summit, leaders endorsed an outcome-oriented five-year work plan.
That plan included the creation of a governance facility to help those countries that make progress on good governance, allowing them access to additional funds to spend on their priorities.
Tunisia is a state party to the six core United Nations human rights treaties.
Tunisia scores well on most socio-economic indexes of multilateral institutions, and social and economic rights are recognised and protected.
Tunisia plays an active role within international human rights institutions and was elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April 2004.
Tunisia has not yet, however, signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
The EU welcomes Tunisiaâs record of promoting reform in the Arab world, notably on the position of women and the right to education.
However, the EU remains concerned about the human rights situation in Tunisia, particularly in relation to freedom of expression and assembly and the independence of the judiciary.
This debate has raised in particular the issue of the freedom of the press in Tunisia.
All books and publications, with the exception of newspapers, are still subject to censorship.
Until May 2005, all newspapers had to clear articles with the Ministry of the Interior in advance of publication.
Whilst this is no longer the case, we remain concerned that the fear of reprisals appears to have resulted in some self-censorship, as no newspaper offers any political criticism or opinion on domestic issues contrary to the governmentâs view.
Access to foreign television, however, is common, as most Tunisian households have access to satellite television.
As I already made clear, the EU welcomes the agreement on the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society reached at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis.
The EU looks forward to working with all stakeholders to ensure the full and effective implementation of both stages of the summit process, both on substance and on follow-up.
A number of incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were reported in the run-up to and during the summit itself.
The Tunisian Human Rights League, the oldest human rights body in Tunisia, claimed police harassment of its activists and says that it has been prevented from functioning properly.
A court decision in September 2005 postponed its Congress.
The EU consequently made representations to the Tunisian authorities and issued a statement reminding the Tunisians of the EUâs expectations of its human rights responsibilities.
During the summit itself, the EU Troika made representations to the Tunisian authorities following an incident at the Goethe Institute, where NGOs were prevented from meeting to discuss plans for an alternative âCitizensâ Summitâ.
The EU is also concerned about a number of other incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, also reported during the summit.
These include the disruption of the activities of a Belgian TV crew, as well as the disruption of the European Commission workshop for MEPs to meet members of civil society in the summitâs conference centre.
Tunisiaâs Constitution provides for freedom of association, but within certain defined limits.
The law provides for freedom of assembly, as long as a permit is obtained from the Minister of Interior.
However, some NGOs experience difficulties in renting space and the control of funding.
A number of associations have applied for legal status and have been refused, for example the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia.
NGOs also report that Internet access is routinely blocked and e-mails addressed to certain e-mail accounts never reach the intended recipient.
During the presidential campaign of October 2004, the electoral code prohibited Tunisians from discussing politics in the international press, and opposition parties were given little opportunity to campaign.
Whilst recognising that the election law safeguards female representation in parliament as well as the representation of minority views, we noted that the overall process leading to the elections did not provide a level playing field for contenders.
We therefore encourage the Tunisian authorities to continue to improve the framework for elections and to take the necessary steps to ensure that the next elections fully meet international standards.
The EU is also concerned by reports from NGOs, including Amnesty International, about prison conditions in Tunisia.
These reports state that overcrowding in prisons and discriminatory treatment of political prisoners continue as well as a lack of basic medical care, poor hygiene, torture and ill-treatment.
We therefore welcome the fact that since June 2005 Tunisiaâs authorities have allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross access to prisons.
Earlier this year, the Tunisian authorities announced their intention to allow Human Rights Watch representatives access to prisons in a similar way to that of the International Committee of the Red Cross, although no timeframe was specified.
The Minister for Justice and Human Rights also announced that the practice of detaining prisoners in solitary confinement beyond 10Â days, the maximum allowed under the Constitution, would cease.
The EU welcomes these announcements and hopes that both undertakings will be put into practice.
I should also like to say a few words about the judiciary in Tunisia.
Under its Constitution, it is independent.
However, Amnesty International and others report that the authorities interfere in the judicial process.
The trial in April 2005 of a lawyer and member of the National Council for Civil Liberties in Tunisia, Mohamed Abou, who wrote an article criticising Tunisiaâs President Ben Ali, seems to support this contention.
The Tunisian Magistratesâ Association has complained of increased intimidation by the Government after its board issued a communiquÃ© criticising the attack on Abou.
The Public Prosecutor closed the Tunisian Magistratesâ Associationâs office in August.
A law passed on 12Â August 2005 making provision for the statute of magistrates does not take into consideration earlier calls by the Tunisian Magistratesâ Association concerning terms and conditions of service and would appear to weaken its position.
We also note that despite several requests to visit, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers has yet to receive an invitation from the Tunisian Government.
The EU wishes to work with Tunisia to support the modernisation of its judiciary.
The EU has provided money through MEDA to fund a project that will support this work and hopes to see progress on this.
I am sure that the Commission will want to say something about this.
In conclusion, the EU welcomes the agreements reached at the World Summit on the Information Society as an important contribution to the global effort to bridge the digital divide.
In terms of the EUâs relationship with Tunisia itself, we wish to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and prosperity.
We regret the serious restrictions on freedom of expression and association and the incidents which occurred prior to and during the World Summit on the Information Society.
The Council should like to assure honourable Members that the EU will continue to express its concern over specific human rights violations and to impress on the Tunisian authorities the need for full respect for human rights and democratic principles.
It is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali on democracy, good governance and human rights set out in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.
Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the situation of human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia.
What brings me to Parliament today is a series of incidents that occurred at the recent World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, an event in which both Members of Parliament and the Commission were present.
I must admit that I refer to those incidents with great regret, since we have to recognise that the host country made an enormous effort in organising the summit, which itself brought about a very positive outcome for the EU in the important field of the future of internet governance.
The summit outcome is a success for the EU and it bears the âmade in Europeâ stamp.
The active participation of the Commission and the continuous coordination of the position of the 25Â Member States, together with the UK Presidency, since the June Telecom Council, had a positive impact on the final agreement.
We managed to push through our ideas, showing that the Europe which speaks with one voice is a Europe that wins.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has spoken with one and the same voice throughout the negotiations and has exerted a real influence on the debates.
As regards Internet governance, the results of the Summit bestow on the world an agreement that covers such crucial aspects as freedom of expression and of access to information, security, and the fight against spamming.
As regards the key functions of the Internet, it has been decided, consistent with the proposals made by Europe, to create two fora and two processes.
On the one hand, the Internet Governance Forum, already known by the acronym IGF and, on the other, the process organising enhanced cooperation between governments on the political principles related to Internet governance.
Governments have political responsibilities to fulfil.
It is clear that they must not intervene either in the technical management of the Internet or in that of ICANN.
The Commission is in favour of the Internet being managed by the private sector, as was demonstrated, for that matter, by the implementation of the â.euâ domain.
As regards the funding for combating the digital divide, an agreement has been finalised on the funding mechanisms, and priorities have been set in terms of promoting the importance of information and communication technologies in the context of the existing funding mechanisms.
In other words, information and communication technologies will be an important tool in the future for our development policy.
In the first quarter of 2006, the Commission will adopt a communication, the aim of which is to evaluate the results of the Summit and to show how the European policies will take account of them.
In March 2006, the United Nations intends to start a wide-ranging consultation with a view to the preparation of the Internet Governance Forum.
We, for our part, will actively consult with industry, as we have done in the past, and I believe that the European Parliament will be in a position to take responsibility for a substantial part of the consultation of civil society.
As regards enhanced cooperation between governments â the second process â MrÂ Annan wanted first of all to know what the intentions of the United States and the European Union were.
I confirmed that it was our intention to prepare an initial position statement at European level by mid-February.
Together with the Member States, we must now define the process that will enable political principles in relation to Internet governance and the transparent and responsible implementation of these principles to be attained.
Mr President, unfortunately, the summit was overshadowed by events that prompted the Commission to mark its strong disagreement as to the way the Tunisian authorities interfered with civil society events, creating difficulties even for the European Parliament-Commission Joint Workshop on Human Rights, not to mention the restrictions on expression experienced both before and during the summit.
On behalf of the Commission, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has already expressed our concerns to the Tunisian Government, and we have pointed out that it was difficult for us to believe that the incidents were just the result of an âunfortunateâ misunderstanding.
We also explained that in the absence of positive reactions it will be more and more difficult for the Commission to continue its constructive approach.
Secondly, an EU demarche on human rights is being considered by Member States, and the Commission will participate fully.
The intention is to express our regrets vis-Ã -vis the recent events and reiterate our demands of last October: first, to unblock EU-funded civil society projects; second, to make progress on the implementation of the judicial reform programme; and, third, to create a subcommittee on human rights.
The reaction to the Tunis summit was brought up by PresidentÂ Barroso in his speech at the Barcelona summit.
He expressed his deep regret at the attempts to stifle freedom of expression during the event.
He stressed that âa society which cannot trust its own people is a weak and fragile one with little prospect of meaningful developmentâ.
These demarches represent our first steps.
We have asked for specific gestures from the Tunisian side.
At the beginning of next year, we will re-evaluate the situation with Member States and decide, in the absence of progress, whether further measures should be taken.
I should like firmly to reassure you that the European Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that the provisions of the association agreement and of the EU-Tunisia Action Plan with regard to respect for human rights are duly implemented.
We now have a new and more effective framework to tackle human rights questions: the neighbourhood policy.
It is our firm intention, shared with the Council, to put the neighbourhood instruments at the service of improving the situation in the field of human rights.
Finally, I welcome the good dialogue that we have had with Parliament on this issue.
Our efforts in promoting democracy and respect for human rights in Tunisia will be all the more effective if we are able to send consistent and coherent messages.
Â Â  Mr President, Tunisia is a country that has an important relationship with the European Union.
It is the first country in its region to sign an association agreement with the EU.
However, the conditions and events which surrounded the recent World Summit on the Information Society have significantly increased existing concerns relating to human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia.
In the build-up to the summit, advocates for freedom of expression and association in Tunisia experienced increased harassment.
There are also reports of summit delegates being harassed, assaults on Tunisian and international journalists, denial of entry into the country, the monitoring and blocking of certain websites, the censorship of certain documents and speeches and the prevention and disruption of meetings.
Even MEPs and representatives of the European Commission reportedly experienced intimidation and verbal aggression.
While we recognise that Tunisia faces a certain threat from extremist elements and is trying to deal with that threat, it must do so in a way that respects human rights standards and democratic standards.
The European Union has a special responsibility to insist on that through dialogue.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as the head of our parliamentary delegation at the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis, I should like to testify to the leading role played by the Union in terms of the progress made in the international negotiations.
The enhanced cooperation of the Member States has enabled progress to be made with regard not only to the introduction of an Internet Governance Forum, which will meet for the first time in Athens, but also to the democratic balance between the Member States, to pluralism and to the involvement of civil society.
Human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute the essential foundations of Internet governance and of the action plan.
It is on the basis of the proposals made by the Union and, more specifically, by the Commission, that an agreement was reached in Tunis, not least with the United States.
I should like to pay tribute to the Commissionâs negotiators and to sincerely thank the Commissioner for having involved the European Parliament in this process.
Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the only shadow cast over this Summit should have come from Tunisia itself.
The serious incidents that surrounded the Summit and that undermined not only the freedom of the press and freedom of expression and of assembly, but also the people are, in my opinion, unacceptable, as are the events targeted at our delegation including, in particular, the sabotage of the Workshop on Human Rights in relation to Internet governance.
They run counter to the commitments made by Tunisia in the Summit conclusions and in the Association Agreement, thus violating the reciprocal character of these commitments.
These events call for a swift and firm response from the Union, and I call on my fellow Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution, which demands that practical measures be taken immediately.
I thank the Commissioner for the very precise remarks she made just now along these lines.
Â Â  Mr President, as Commissioner Reding reminded us, the fact that Tunisia undertook to organise what must have been one of the biggest ever global summits cannot go unheeded.
You acknowledged yourself, Commissioner, that the World Summit on the Information Society produced valuable results; it also had a spin-off, a focusing effect.
It is not possible to accredit 30Â 000 people and hundreds of journalists without attracting the attention of public opinion.
As Tunisia came under this spotlight, we became acutely aware of the imbalance that exists there between the treatment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the undeniable progress that Tunisia has been making in the fields of economic and social development, education and training and equality between men and women.
The Union has long been monitoring these things, because Tunisia is a partner of ours and was one of the first countries to conclude an association agreement with us.
In our opinion, its development has been exemplary, and we reiterate the wish expressed in our last resolution, adopted in September, that the development of respect for human rights should keep pace with the observable progress in other areas.
All we are asking, in other words, is that Tunisia honour the contractual commitments it has made.
It is not in our interests to hurl invective, nor would we wish to do so. We simply seek to guarantee instruments of dialogue, as Mrs Reding emphasised.
We are prepared to help in the realm of justice through the MEDA programme; in the spirit of the resolution that will be adopted by our Parliament and on the basis of the values we seek to share, we want to have access to instruments of dialogue such as the Association Council and the Subcommittee on Human Rights, so as to ensure that our Tunisian partners are aware of the message â still a restrained message â that this House is about to convey to them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased that we are holding this debate today.
It comes in the wake of the numerous violations of human rights that accompanied the World Summit on the Information Society which, as we know, took place in Tunis.
Let me recall them briefly: human-rights activists and journalists were harassed, action was taken to prevent the convening of a citizensâ summit, telephone connections were cut off, e-mails and Internet access were blocked, the speech delivered by the President of Switzerland was censored, other international figures were deported, among them our Sakharov Prize winner Robert MÃ©nard, and so on.
Let us remember that these violations are not isolated, one-off occurrences but routine everyday practice in Tunisia.
The human-rights situation in Tunisia is deteriorating â as we noted, by the way, in our resolution of 29Â September.
These latest incidents, I believe, are a direct challenge to the policy of the European Union on democracy and human rights in that country, which was the first signatory of an association agreement containing the famous ArticleÂ 2, and we must rise to that challenge.
The Council has certainly made representations on several occasions, but it is truly regrettable that no public move has been made to denounce the violations of human rights that have taken place and to lend essential support to the incredible mobilisation of civil society, parts of which, incidentally, are represented today in the European Parliament.
We consider it important that the Commission and the Council undertake, firstly, to convene a meeting of the Association Council as soon as possible in order to discuss the human-rights situation and the practical consequences of the observed violations and, secondly, to initiate discussions, in the true spirit of the action plan, on a timetable of reforms in the areas already referred to, a precise timetable with deadlines for measurable results: result number one is the reform of the judicial system; in this context, we must demand the release of the lawyer Mohammed Abou and of all political prisoners in Tunisia as well as an end to the harassment of the Tunisian Magistratesâ Association; result number two is the removal of restrictions on the activities of civil society; number three is cooperation with UN mechanisms.
These are the minimum requirements if we are to meet the challenge confronting us.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy is effectively a complex process and one which not even our own governments have ever achieved fully.
However, as far as the Tunisian Government is concerned, I believe that the level of non-achievement is particularly significant and that very specific action has to be taken.
We are in fact seeing the symptoms of a virtual police state, where democratic rights and principles are denied.
For months, European funds intended for the Tunisian League for Human Rights and other associations have been frozen.
The defenders of human rights, whom I applaud today because they are here with us in Parliament, have described to us the political intimidation and physical threats to which they are subjected.
Freedom of the press, as we have seen at this latest conference, is non-existent and torture is practised in Tunisian jails.
The opposition has no way of making its voice heard and all demands for democracy and reform are suppressed.
We therefore ask the Commission, which has shown courage in its informal contacts, to do much more and take steps to have the EU-Tunisia Association Council convened without delay.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we shall be voting against this so-called compromise resolution, which I am rather inclined to call the âFlautre resolutionâ since it seems to be so closely aligned with the text presented by the honourable Member.
The manifest aim of the resolution is to make an issue of minor incidents, and I do mean minor incidents, that occurred during the World Summit on the Information Society, a summit which took place in what we â and we are not alone in this â considered to be entirely satisfactory conditions.
Why should Tunisia be hounded like this when so many states around the world with which the European Union has better relations and which, in some cases, it is preparing to welcome into the fold, display far less respect for fundamental freedoms than the Tunisian Government? Why Tunisia?
The answer is simple.
It is because Tunisia is succeeding only too well and, in the eyes of certain powers â and, alas, of some simple souls they manipulate â Tunisia poses a risk on three counts.
First of all, Tunisia is a model of development, and one wonders whether certain superpowers are not out to destroy any Arab country that is on the way to development.
Secondly, Tunisia is a model of Mediterranean cooperation.
It is no coincidence that it was the first country in that part of the world to sign an association agreement with the Union, and there are some who, in the name of the well-known theory of the clash of civilisations, might have an interest in setting one side of the Mediterranean against the other, given that unity in the Mediterranean region would allow the wider Euro-African area to prosper.
Lastly, Tunisia is a model of cooperation in the French-speaking world.
French is the language of its development, but, as we saw at a meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Rabat only a few days ago, some would prefer French to give way to English as the one and only international language.
By rallying round the systematic detractors of Tunisia, such as MrsÂ Flautre, and by attacking a country which, I repeat, has been exemplary, this House will convey the impression that it seeks, under cover of cooperation and respect for human rights, to harden positions on both sides, which will ultimately foster Islamic fundamentalism.
This is what is currently happening in Iraq through the agency of the West â or, to be more precise, Washington and its accomplices â and it is a process which first Egypt then the Maghreb countries might experience too.
Our involvement in that would not serve the interests of the European powers; on the contrary, it would expose our peoples to the effects of terrible divisions in our common maritime region.
Â Â  Mr President, I was privileged to be part of the European Parliamentâs delegation in Tunis.
Indeed I was also at the Geneva Summit and was able to follow the project through.
I share the regret expressed by Mrs Reding and my colleague Mrs Trautmann about what I regarded as the entirely unnecessary disruption of our meetings in a country that clearly has embraced many aspects of the digital revolution, as the previous speaker said.
I could not understand why it was felt necessary to do that.
I want to concentrate on some of the achievements of the summit and, in particular, the policy that I called for after the Geneva Summit, which relates to how we can spread the capacity for computer science and research to the developing world so that they can develop their own products.
We in the European Union have been hugely successful in the way that we have offered the benefits of our own networking technology through spreading the GÃ©ant Network to the developing world and also encouraging the development of open competitive markets to deliver high-quality services at competitive cost.
That is a major achievement.
It was sad that, even so, this was a workshop full of professors and university researchers where the Tunisians chose to restrict attendance.
It was unnecessary and took the shine off it.
I admire Mrs Trautmann for the robust way in which she stood up to the interventions at our meeting.
It was a pleasure to watch her.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Minister, Commissioner, if there is one cause for rejoicing in the aftermath of the recent Tunis summit, it is the beneficial effect the summit has had in convincing the world of something too many people refused to accept â and still refuse to accept, in fact, judging by what I have just heard â namely that democracy is flouted in Tunisia on a daily basis.
When I questioned the Commission and the Council on my return from a mission to Tunisia, I was indeed astonished at the timidity of their responses to what can only be described as a violation of the partnership agreement between the European Union and Tunisia, at least of the clauses relating to human rights.
I trust that this timidity is not directly linked to other objectives, such as the organisation by the Maghreb countries, as some would wish, of a kind of policing system for our borders to curb illegal immigration.
I am nevertheless pleased with the statements I have heard today, especially those from the Commission.
Beyond these statements and the resolution we must surely adopt on this subject, I hope that we shall have the opportunity to see the establishment and rapid adoption of specific mechanisms in the form of an Association Council and a Subcommittee on Human Rights.
I shall close, MrÂ President, by simply asking that civil society in Tunisia, which is treated with utter contempt today, be associated with this human-rights committee.
It would be useful to give it the opportunity to express its views to this recently created body.
Â Â  ( Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can draw two lessons from the Tunis Summit.
First and foremost, an assessment of what happened: this was a summit focusing on the issue of a knowledge-based society, debating how new technology and services can be used to develop a high-technology society that seeks to spread greater freedom, give opportunities to all and ensure access to information and knowledge â just look at the computer designed for the so-called developing world â and to expand areas of freedom.
With a summit of this sort and goals of this nature, the events in Tunis appear even more discordant, more unpleasant and more serious.
In the middle of a discussion on ways of increasing freedom and respect for rights, we actually found ourselves facing behaviour that clearly curtailed freedom, showed intolerance and prevented debate.
That was a serious matter.
We ask the Commission and Council â which have already done so â to take a firm stand against what occurred, and point out that our association agreement with Tunisia also includes a section on human rights.
Finally, I should like to give my assessment of the negotiations and the next phase.
Commissioner, we believe that significant progress was made, thanks to the role played by Europe, but we ask â and believe â that more should be done in relation to the commitments given and the forum to be held in Athens.
We must be increasingly aware that Internet governance also requires Europe to find greater strength and cohesion in order to resist â if I may use the term â or in any event to respond in a positive manner to those who are today in dominant positions and try to trample on our European notion of balanced development and pluralist governance, with its respect for diversity, which, even in societies based on knowledge and technology, allows democratic principles to prevail.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me to use the debate to reveal certain unhealthy trends in EU policy towards the Middle East.
We all know that Tunisia has a secure constitution.
Women have rights to possess, inherit, vote and divorce.
Islam belongs to everyone and cannot be used as a political monopoly for one political party.
We all know that on the occasion of the World Summit on the Information Society, journalists, defenders of human rights and lawyers were intimidated and heavily beaten by security forces.
We all know about President Ben Aliâs long and complicated struggle with An-Nahda â an extremist, radical, pro-terrorist movement which combines its influence with the far left and quite clearly threatens the regime and democracy in Tunisia.
Nevertheless, we should use this opportunity to send a clear message not only to President Ali, but to many other rulers in the Middle East.
We must firmly support every possible means to struggle and fight against Islamic radicalism, extremism and abuse of power to explain and present the general truth to everyone.
But we must not allow friendly countries, friendly presidents and friendly regimes to misuse our support to wipe out, kill and destroy a diverse, democratic and secular opposition.
The drive for democracy must be based on local ownership and respect for local sensitivities.
No respect should be paid to undemocratic practices in which human rights are abused, particularly the right of freedom of expression and criticism, the freedom to gather and to obtain information.
We cannot deal with the threat of terrorism, with abuse of the right to explain the truth to everyone and with frustration until we say very clearly that every man and woman should be free to express himself or herself clearly, openly and democratically, be they Tunisian, European journalists or Tunisian human rights activists or lawyers.
State monopolies on newspapers, state monopolies on financing all newspapers, radio and TV channels clearly contradict what we call the âinformation societyâ.
This should be our friendly message to our friend President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to pre-empt certain criticisms and reassure MrÂ CoÃ»teaux that the media will not engage in a systematic lynching of Tunisia.
On the contrary, we socialists believe that, with regard to a country that has undoubtedly made impressive advances in the socio-economic sphere, it is important to welcome a veritable democratic outcry on the part of the trade unions, the human-rights organisations, the judicial authorities and lawyers. The momentum they have generated can surely lead to the realisation of freedom of expression, association and assembly.
This renewal is epitomised by the 18Â October Movement and its intention to set up a permanent forum, with which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wish to be associated.
It has often been said that the Barcelona process was a partial failure, and it is true that we were timorous.
Europe is struggling to propagate its ideal of democratic pluralism.
In this respect, Tunisia is a gift to us, almost a model.
The Tunisians are not calling for our help, but they do want more democracy.
Can we support these people who have been striving, and sometimes waging fierce struggles â as social struggles always are â to open up and relax a regime that tends to close in on itself, a regime which, in the name of the fight against terrorism, stigmatises all defenders of human rights and prevents judges, prosecutors and lawyers from holding meetings and forming associations?
Can we fight to ensure that no socialist regime is able to invoke its membership of the Socialist International in order to trample on human rights?
I have only one request: that the issue of human rights and the rule of law in Tunisia play a key role in the deliberations of the Association Council which is due to meet in JanuaryÂ 2006 and that no one beat about the bush.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin with a reference to Commissioner Redingâs final comment, calling for coherence.
I believe that this is the key: the key question and the key issue.
The case of Tunisia is not just any case.
A few days ago we expressed our regret â as has already been said â that, in the assessment of the Barcelona Conference on the Euro-Mediterranean process, insufficient progress has been made in terms of moving forward on the construction of a European area of respect for human rights and promotion of peace.
In the case of Tunisia, we are not dealing with an absence of civil society. The problem is that civil society is not being allowed to express itself with complete freedom.
And to me this is the fundamental aspect.
If the European Union wants its message, its debate and its Euro-Mediterranean policy to be coherent, it should not send out the message that the situations we have witnessed over recent days are being ignored, in particular during the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia and the arrests of several leaders of human rights organisations.
To me, therefore, coherence is a fundamental issue which we must not leave out of this debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can sum up this debate fairly briefly and, I hope, at a reasonable pace.
The European Union wishes to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity.
We welcome Tunisiaâs record of promoting economic and social reform, notably on the position of women and the right to education, but we need to continue to work with Tunisia on a number of human rights issues and see progress made, particularly in the areas of the right to expression and association.
We will continue to work with the Tunisian authorities to implement the commitments on democracy, good governance and human rights that it signed up to in its European neighbourhood policy action plan.
As I made clear earlier, implementing those commitments will be an important element in developing EU-Tunisia relations.
I thank the Commission for its contribution and, indeed, each of the Members of the European Parliament who have spoken in this debate.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the honourable Members of this House for their staunch support in respect of two issues on the agenda â their positive backing of the quest for Internet governance and their critical stance on the human-rights situation in Tunisia.
It must be recognised, as some Members have said, that economic and social reforms have been a Tunisian success story, but there is also a need for Tunisians to rise to the challenge of a trailblazing role in the field of human rights, and there is still a long way to go on that score.
The Association Committee will meet at the start of next year.
A meeting of the Association Council will follow, and we fully intend to put human-rights problems on the agenda.
As for the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Tunisia has accepted its creation.
Informal agreement has been reached on all points other than the individual cases, and I believe this is important in the light of the discussion we have had.
Following the debates that are currently taking place within the Council, we shall make a formal proposal to Tunisia.
May I thank all the European Members of Parliament who have demonstrated their solidarity with all those in the Council, the Commission and Parliament who are committed to ensuring that human rights and freedom of expression become a reality and not a political football for the governments of this world.
In spite of the very deplorable events that occurred in Tunis with regard to human rights, the summit had a gratifying outcome.
In future, the two processes â the stakeholdersâ forum and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation â will enable us at any time to put on the agenda issues relating to the freedom that can emanate from information and communication technology and to make that freedom a reality in every country of the world.
Â Â  Six motions for a resolution(1) have been submitted by the following groups: the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left â Nordic Green Left, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  ( Tunisia is a critically important partner for the dialogue between Europe and the Arab world.
A fundamental premise of this cooperation is respect for human rights, as enshrined in the EU-Tunisia Agreement, which entered into force in 1998, and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan inaugurated this year.
The Tunisian Government has always shown itself to be particularly open and willing to accept its commitments towards the international community in the field of human rights, democracy and governance, as shown by the recent establishment of the EU-Tunisia Human Rights Subcommittee and the countryâs willingness to agree to organise the World Summit on the Information Society.
Tunisia is actively party to the six main United Nations treaties and, compared with other Arab countries, it makes a point of maintaining a secular state and of protecting its citizensâ social and economic rights.
Greater efforts are, of course, still needed to achieve a level of freedom worthy of a fully democratic country â episodes like those that have just occurred are proof of that â but we must in any event acknowledge the efforts and the progress made so far and assure Tunisia that it has our full support.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the preparation of the White Paper regarding the new directive on audiovisual content.
Â Â  Mr President, after two and a half years of consultations, discussions and conferences, we have reached the point today when the Commission can table a new directive to replace the Television Without Frontiers Directive.
Why is this directive necessary?
Quite simply because of multimedia convergence.
There are a multitude of platforms, wavebands, cables, satellites, ADSLs and mobiles delivering the same content, whether it be traditional scheduled television or on-demand services.
The problem is that this extremely rapid development has not been followed by development of the law.
It is unjust, and it distorts competition, to regulate some operators and not others.
It is unacceptable to provide some with legal protection and deny it to others.
It is not right to allow some to benefit from the advantages of the single market and deny those advantages to others.
The aim of the new directive is therefore to compare like with like and afford them equal treatment.
We are currently observing a veritable explosion of platforms and content.
You may remember that, when the Television Without Frontiers Directive was first adopted in 1989, there were 10 satellite channels; today, there are 2Â 500.
After digitisation there will certainly be an explosion in the range of available content.
The new services, of which there are 50 at the present time, are growing fast.
Even though video on demand still plays a relatively minor role, experts tell us that, if the rules permit the development of that type of service, 22 million households will be connected to a video-on-demand service by 2010, generating an annual turnover in excess of EURÂ 2 billion.
We are at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy here, with the opportunity to strengthen our European content industry, with all its implications for growth and employment.
The directive I wish to present to you today does not focus on the media through which information is transmitted but on content; it deals with audiovisual services, whatever medium is used to deliver them to the public.
How, then, shall we regulate this range of content?
First of all, there will be a distinction between two types of content.
The first is the type we know, the service to which we are accustomed, namely our traditional scheduled television content, a menu which others have put together.
We have no option but to accept what they provide or switch off.
The second type of content is non-linear (on-demand) content, where consumers search for, select and retrieve what they regard as important and interesting.
These two means of bringing content to people, linear and non-linear, will be regulated differently.
But â and this is a big âbutâ â although there are two types of content, a balance must be maintained between the industrial dimension â I have already referred to the creation of European content â the European values that must not be sacrificed to this new type of content, the protection of consumers, particularly minors, which is important whatever the type of content, and, of course, the cultural diversity to which we are committed.
We must therefore strike a balance between these factors while applying the principle of better regulation.
We shall achieve this by what I call the âlight-touch approachâ.
What do I mean by âlight-touchâ?
First of all, there will be a set of minimum requirements for all types of content.
These requirements include the identification of the provider; in other words, people must know who put the message on the medium.
They also include identifiable advertising: no surreptitious advertising but strict rules governing the advertising that appears with content.
Then there is the protection of human dignity.
It would be unacceptable, for example, for particular types of content to be immune to measures designed to combat incitement to racial or religious hatred.
Similarly, it would be unacceptable if the protection of minors did not apply to all types of content.
Moreover, Parliament and all the other defenders of European culture could not accept a situation in which the European identity and European cultural diversity were promoted in one type of content but not in another.
These, then, are the common rules for both linear and non-linear content.
So what about the specific rules that apply to conventional scheduled television, which needs to be more rigorously regulated, given its powerful influence and the absence of consumer choice?
The rules that will remain in place cover quotas, the right of reply and access to events of major importance.
The rules that will be altered in part and preserved in part relate to the way we deal with advertising.
First of all, the rules governing the quality of advertising will be the same as in the current directive.
The rules governing the volume of advertising will change, partly because simplified and updated rules are needed in this new multimedia world and partly because it is not up to the Commission to do the work of programme planners.
This is why there will no longer be daily limits, why commercial breaks will not be so heavily regulated as they are today and why isolated commercials will be permitted in sports programmes, though not in other programmes.
On the other hand, we have no wish to see television programmes awash with advertising, and for this reason we are maintaining some important ground rules.
The first of these rules is the twelve-minute limit.
The advertising explosion that is sometimes depicted in the press will not take place: commercial breaks will remain limited to a total of twelve minutes in any hour.
There will also be safeguards relating to the interruption of films, TV movies, childrenâs programmes and news programmes, which will be subject to a limit of one break in each 35-minute segment. This is very important.
For example, the fact that children will be better protected in future than is presently the case with traditional television programmes and that they will also be protected in the case of non-linear services is a major advance.
It may therefore be said that, while relaxing the rules for adults, we are also tightening them for the protection of young people.
Another important element that was conceived from the perspective of the funding of content is the authorisation, subject to very restrictive and strict conditions, of product placement.
In Europe today, we actually have conflicting rules on product placement.
In one country there are no rules, in another the rules relate only to national content, and in a third there is a total ban.
In future, so that the rules are the same for everyone and so that consumers are well informed, which is not the case under the present system, product placement must comply with very strict rules.
It will be authorised if there is a guarantee that the viewer will be made aware of the placement.
The rules should guarantee legal certainty and equality of treatment for all content.
Importantly, however, there will also be major restrictions: no placement of childrenâs products and no product placement in news and current-affairs programmes or in documentaries.
The purpose of these rules is to safeguard our children and protect the editorial freedom of journalists.
This directive contains a vast number of new features, and it would take too long for me to list them all, but I know Parliament, and I know that these matters will be revisited in the course of the next few months.
There are, however, three new elements I should like to highlight.
The first is the non-discriminatory right to use short extracts for the purposes of general news programming.
Secondly, this is the first European directive that explicitly authorises the use of coregulation and self-regulation at the national level.
The third new feature which I believe to be of great importance with regard to the implementation of this directive is the establishment of national audiovisual regulators who will be independent of their respective governments.
Â Â  Mr President, I warmly welcome the release of this new proposal.
I would like the Commissioner to confirm that it will continue to be called the Television Without Frontiers Directive, in modernised form.
I believe the original proposal for a name was very confusing.
I should like ask the Commissioner whether she thinks she is being radical enough, given the pace of technology.
Having seen a number of developments â including when we were together in Tunis recently â it is my view that that the distinction between linear and non-linear is getting more and more blurred and that more and more consumers are going to access what were traditional broadcast programmes at whatever time they want, as they will be stored automatically on their digital video recorders.
Indeed, we will be carrying them to Parliament in our iPods or whatever other digital mechanism we use.
So does the Commissioner really think that this is radical enough?
Secondly, I noted that she said she was looking for a light-touch approach, a lack of red tape and technological neutrality, all of which are principles of the excellent Communications Framework Directive we have now, which is vitally important.
Does the Commissioner believe that she has the right balance of these in this directive and that it will stand the test of time in the way that the Communications Framework Directive already has?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I have a quick question relating to product placement.
It is indeed very striking that you should put a few fresh requirements forward in this respect.
You give product placement the green light, and I understand that that is the only way forward.
Also, you state that it does not apply to childrenâs or youth programmes, but I am at a loss as to know, on the basis of the communication, whether it includes on-demand content.
Should that loophole be closed or does the ban on product replacement apply across the range of childrenâs and youth programmes, including on-demand content?
I should like to have a clear response to this clear and concise question.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, having always known the Commissioner to be an experienced journalist â something that she keeps pointing out â I should like to ask her whether she thinks that the quality of television really gains from more product placement and more advertisements interrupting broadcasts.
In addition, I should like to put the specific question to her as to why she now also wants to allow news programmes of less than 30Â minutes to continue to be interrupted by advertising?
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to say to Mr Harbour that the official title is the âaudiovisual and media servicesâ directive.
However, I think it will become âaudiovisual without frontiersâ.
The linear and non-linear division is fairly clear.
We will have an opportunity to discuss these definitions later in our various committee meetings, as I made very clear in the text of the proposal.
I chose to use a light-touch approach to provide an opportunity for these media to develop.
I shall give you a very simple example.
Today video on demand is not developing very quickly for the simple reason that there are 25Â regulations for that kind of service.
Therefore, if you are developing this service in one country and would like to export it to another, you have to develop a new service for the new country, which means that the internal market is not functioning any more.
I want to provide this opportunity for these services to operate in the internal market and develop, because I believe that video on demand will offer an extraordinary chance not only for new entrants on the VOD market but also in bringing our European content and films to the consumer.
It is evident that the European film industry has distribution problems and difficulties in getting its products seen by the public â either there is no cinema or the cinema does not carry the European content.
Video on demand is a real opportunity to bring the European product to the consumer.
Mr Belet, product placement is part of the basic set of common requirements, which means that the rules governing product placement, including those relating to young people, apply to both linear and non-linear programming.
If you analyse the new directive, you will see very clearly that I have done my utmost to protect our young people, because the availability of so much content on so many platforms makes them vulnerable and they therefore need protection.
This is also a matter I hope to discuss with the Members of this House.
How far should we go to protect our young people?
Have I done too much, or have I not done enough?
This is a question for us to discuss.
MrsÂ Harms asked whether more product placement adds something as regards content; well, yes, I believe it does.
Nowadays, we have the problem that product placement is almost everywhere, but is illegal in some countries.
In others, it is illegal only in respect of domestic products, not those from neighbouring countries.
Product placement for US products is everywhere, and thus product placement now appears on our television screens â even if it is prohibited at national level â without the consumer realising.
Firstly, the new legislation will introduce horizontal Europe-wide legislation that permits product placement where this is important, namely for the purpose of funding our European content industry, our films, so that they have the same opportunities, including with regard to funding, as films from other continents.
Secondly, there are currently no rules to the effect that product placement â for children, for example â must be prohibited in various kinds of content.
It is unbelievable that such a thing is happening across the board in childrenâs programmes.
Children, unlike adults, are defenceless against this.
That is why it is important to have horizontal prohibition of product placement for children.
As a former journalist â since you mention it â I have discussed the influence of product placement on information and on information-type programmes at length with my journalist colleagues and have come to the conclusion that a full ban on product placement for information and in information-type programmes is desirable.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to express my sincere thanks and congratulations to the Commissioner on the presentation of the draft revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive.
Over recent years, Parliament has campaigned continuously for this and called for equivalent content to be subject to equivalent legislation, even in the digital age.
In this respect, the Commissionerâs proposal is, in my view, a âfitness programmeâ for the introduction of digital television in Europe.
My questions today relate to just two issues.
Firstly, the Commissioner has said that she intends to provide for increased self-control and co-regulation.
Could she elaborate on this for us?
Secondly, what are the consequences of product placement for public service broadcasting in Europe?
Are there any implications as regards financial aid?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we particularly welcome today's Commission communication, but we note the fact that this important issue was put on the agenda for plenary at the last minute, without first notifying the competent Committee on Culture and Education about the individual provisions you are announcing.
We also welcome the fact that the proposal for a directive refers mainly to the audiovisual content of television.
I should like to comment on certain points.
The review of the directive and the enlargement of its scope to non-linear media must not result in the watering down of its regulatory arrangements.
The safeguarding of the principle of cultural diversity and pluralism is necessary, irrespective of the medium by which the audiovisual content is transmitted.
Compliance with the quotas for European works and works by independent producers must remain at the epicentre of the directive.
We need to strengthen the arrangements in the directive relating to advertising and the protection of minors.
It more or less says that the existing regime will remain.
We cannot put the interests of the industry before viewers' rights and the quality of television, nor can we expect the market to regulate these important issues on its own.
The title of 'audiovisual without frontiers' is correct.
In brief, we need a directive which will give European television the necessary balance between quality and ratings.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Reding, historically, every time this directive has been discussed in the European Parliament, since 1984, there has been a struggle between Parliament and the Commission.
Parliament has asked that the issue of pluralism be dealt with within the scope of this directive and on numerous occasions the Commission has said: this is a very delicate matter and we dare not â to put it in a simplified fashion â deal with it.
In relation to this directive, in the preparations for the discussion we are going to hold from now on in Liverpool, an issues paper was entirely dedicated to the issue of pluralism, an issue that causes great concern.
The Commissionâs view has always been, âlook, when industry is liberalised, pluralism will follow automaticallyâ.
But that is not true.
It is not true because in the world of radio and the world of television we are subject to a system of administrative franchises and there is interference by public powers.
Mrs Reding, I am going to tell you about something that is happening in our country and which has no precedent in the European Union: 500Â 000 Spanish citizens, more than half a million Spanish citizens â something which has never before happened in the European Union, in any of its institutions â are supporting an initiative to prevent a public power, the Government of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, from closing a radio station.
Surely that is important and is of interest to the public.
In view of this precedent, I would ask you: Mrs Reding, is the issue of pluralism going to be dealt with in this directive?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all, I should like to thank MrsÂ Hieronymi, not only for the assessment that she achieved in a few minutes here, but also for her monitoring activities during the two-and-a-half year preparation of the new legislation that is now on the table.
I would also thank her for the lovely phrase âa fitness programme for the audiovisual mediaâ.
I think that that will become a popular quotation in the coming months.
Increasing self-regulation is a means of implementing the directive, which itself constitutes a legal framework that the national authorities must transpose into national law.
As regards implementation, however, they have the opportunity of either going still further than this framework or â provided there is the necessary acceptance among stakeholders â doing so by means of controlled self-regulation.
It is correct that this is the first time that this terminology has appeared in a European legislative text.
I believe that placing trust in the experts working in the field is an important step in the right direction.
Mr Sifunakis, the chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, asked me why he had not been informed until the last minute.
MrÂ Sifunakis, I myself was only told early this afternoon that the Commission had accepted my proposals.
Today it has been a matter of informing Parliament, not of debating the issue.
I am sure that the debate itself will be very intensive; it will be long, and I imagine it will begin next year in the relevant committees, namely the Committee on Culture and Education and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
Everything that worked well in the Television Without Frontiers Directive has been reproduced in the new directive.
I have not compromised the quotas â quite the contrary.
As far as online services are concerned, I have imposed an obligation to promote European works, an instrument that does not exist at the present time.
The percentage provided by independent producers remains in place, and consumer protection is reinforced, because we need well-informed consumers who know what awaits them.
In short, consumer information and the protection of consumers against abuses are maintained, and not only in the sphere of traditional television, because these principles also apply to the new services.
MrÂ Herrero wondered whether the pluralism of the media was still guaranteed in a world where changes took place every day.
One need only read the newspapers from all parts of Europe for reassurance on that score: new mergers take place, existing groups break up, and new media services are created.
Digitisation will generate an explosion of channels available to the public, not to mention the new forms of video on demand.
What other inventions are set to appear in the near future?
The consumer will be faced with an enormously wide choice, which is a good way to develop pluralism. The more choice available to the consumer, the more pluralism will develop.
For this reason, we must do everything we can to foster consumer choice.
Cultural diversity is also a very important aspect of pluralism, and the extension of such diversity to the new services is an important step towards pluralism.
At the beginning of next year, my departments will publish a document on the national rules relating to media concentrations.
I had promised you such a document to enable us â the Commission and Parliament â to take a joint look at the direction in which we are heading.
It will be on the table at the start of next year.
We shall then have the opportunity to debate its content and any action that needs to be taken at European level.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Commissioner: it is nice that she is introducing the draft to Parliament after the press is already familiar with it.
The enhancement of European content will meet with ample support, and two readings will give us sufficient time to then discuss this in detail.
Variety is Europeâs strength â we cannot compete with the US market there, nor do we want to â but it is of course also its weakness.
In my opinion, we cannot have product placement in films in the same way as the US.
After all, the market always determines the way products are represented in films.
There are no objections to a person driving a car, but when it comes to a situation where product placement is only available to those with the fattest wallets, something has gone wrong.
We also agree that advertising has no place in childrenâs programmes.
It is only the boundaries that are blurred; that much is clear.
Where should the boundaries be drawn?
I think that, once the door is opened to this, it will no longer be possible to contain it.
Therefore, there will be very great resistance to product placement and the blurred boundaries.
We shall have to discuss that further at the two readings.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I, too, have to say that, during the Commissionerâs presentation today, I was surprised that so little attention has been paid to the potential risk to editorial independence.
She had mentioned that news and childrenâs programmes are to be protected against product placement and, just now, she also mentioned programmes of an informative character.
The term âinformation programmesâ, referring to programmes intended to inform the population, constitutes a broad concept.
Where do magazines providing information on financial services fit in, for example?
Are they able to advertise such services?
What about health magazines?
Is it forbidden for there to be any advertising of certain health products or services on those?
I would therefore ask you to clarify once more what you understand by âinformation programmesâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I repeat my question.
I was the rapporteur on this subject for the Committee on Culture and Education.
I am on the list of speakers.
I am asking why you are not giving me leave to speak.
Â Â  I did hear you.
Commissioner, the floor is yours.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to point out to MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner that the draft has been posted on the Internet, and is therefore accessible to MEPs and the public alike.
MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner is absolutely right, there will of course be two readings, and so we shall have plenty more opportunities to exchange views on the content of my draft.
Variety is very important, and because it is important, and because I should like to see European films and European television broadcasts shown off to their best advantage on our TV screens, mobile phones and computers, I shall do everything possible to promote it.
In fact, some Member States are already doing this.
Let me take as an example the Austrian law on product placement: that is a very sensible law, and it is working very well.
MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner mentioned advertising during childrenâs programmes.
Perhaps I did not make it sufficiently clear that product placement during childrenâs programmes will be prohibited.
That is going one step further than is currently possible in very many Member States.
I wish to protect children in particular.
MrsÂ TrÃŒpel spoke about editorial independence.
This is very important to me, and that is why I have made particular reference to the subject.
Accordingly, product placement is prohibited in information programmes and in what are known in English as âcurrent affairsâ programmes.
Consequently, health information is included in this definition.
Â Â  MrÂ Weber, I have called three members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, three members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and two members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
In other words, MrÂ Weber, a perfect balance has been maintained.
That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0343/2005).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission:
Â Â  . The case began in 2002 and there have been ebbs and flows in the workload over that time.
During that time, there has been one primary case handler working on the case part-time while carrying out other work in the Directorate-General.
The case has also involved the hierarchy of DG Competition and the Cabinet at appropriate stages.
The Commission does not accept the suggestion that this was not a genuine competition case.
Football is an extremely popular sport, as we all know, and the way in which its media rights are sold can have significant long-term effects on the development of the media markets.
The importance of this case is shown by the number of companies, free-to-air and pay-TV broadcasters, internet operators, mobile operators and potential new entrants who have expressed their concerns to the Commission and, on occasion, to the relevant national authorities in the course of this case.
In addition, both the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Communications strongly supported both the existence of the Commissionâs investigation and its focus.
Finally, the UK Consumersâ Association published its own report into these issues, concluding that there was a genuine consumer problem and that the cause of that problem lay in the manner in which the English Football Association Premier League jointly sold the rights to Premier League games.
The Commission does not agree, therefore, that it would have been more efficient or appropriate to investigate the broadcasting market for potential abuse of a dominant position.
Where there are concerns about dominance, it is appropriate for a competition authority to look closely at the causes of that dominance.
Where dominance exists on a downstream market, at least in part as a result of upstream agreements that potentially infringe ArticleÂ 81, the most efficient and effective course of action is to look at those upstream agreements.
The joint selling of football rights risks creating a seller with market power and the consequent transfer of that market power downstream.
The joint selling can cause competition problems downstream and therefore deserves close examination.
To treat only the downstream dominance without looking at the upstream rights contracts would be to treat the symptom of the competition problem rather than one of the causes.
Â Â  As ever, the Commission never really answers the question because it was a 3Âœ-year run of resources.
I have to say we are not just talking about Commission resources; we are talking about millions of pounds spent on lawyersâ fees by people involved in this action.
I have to ask the question again: does the Commission believe that is proportionate to the outcome of having achieved that one extra package will go to an operator other than Sky, with no guarantee that will be a free-to-air provider.
It may well be another cable operator and, potentially, that will have a cost to the consumer.
Will the Commission now, more importantly, allow this current agreement to run without interfering, so that we see whether it delivers for the public interest and allow the football clubs, particularly, to be able to have legal certainty in managing their own resources, especially when investing in community finance in their local areas?
Â Â  . Mr President, I understand the message from honourable Members, but I strongly disagree that we have not answered the question; indeed, we have.
If the answer is not convenient for the honourable Member, that is something else, but I have answered and I will answer again.
The Premier League sells rights to its matches to media operators throughout the world, including a large number of EU countries.
Premier League football is very popular, for example, in Ireland, and the Premier League has changed its rights policies as regards Ireland as a result of the Commissionâs intervention.
To put it plainly, there is a clear cross-border element, which the Commission was well placed to address when the case began in 2002.
Whether there are a couple of lawyers or far more than a couple, that is up to them; we are willing and able to deal with this case and have had some success, for we have solved a problem in which competition was harmed.
Â Â  â Mr President, does the Commission agree that important international sporting events should be broadcast solely by subscriber, in other words, pay-per-view television networks?
Have you wondered if all the citizens have this facility, even if certain international federations have complied with this and allow these international events to be broadcast free to air?
Why do you not take measures against the Member States of the European Union which have not sent lists of sports to be broadcast free to air for about the last twelve years, as they should have done?
Â Â  . Competition law is not interested in pure sporting rules, only the economic activities connected with sporting events.
I am the referee of the game of competition and not of the game itself.
Pure sporting rules are rules inherent to a sport or necessary for its organisation or for the organisation of a competition.
These are not subject to the application of competition rules.
As the Commissionâs decision regarding the UEFA and DFB shows, it is perfectly possible to operate collective selling mechanisms that help provide solidarity payments and are compatible with competition rules.
However, that means that collective selling must work to benefit fans and not just the clubs.
Many leagues seem to think their first responsibility is to find different ways to make their fans pay ever higher sums.
That cannot be right.
Â Â  . The honourable Member suggests that there is a connection between a meeting between the President of the Commission and the Spanish Prime Minister and the postponement of the Commissionâs decision on whether there was a Community dimension to the proposed merger between Gas Natural and Endesa from the agenda of 9Â November.
I can give the House a categorical assurance that there was no such link.
In fact, given the highly complex legal, economic and accountancy issues raised by this case, the Commission simply had not finished its analysis of the case in time for its meeting on 9Â November.
That was the reason, nothing more and nothing less.
Indeed, further information from the parties continued to be received by the Commission over the weekend preceding the 9Â November meeting of the College.
Honourable Members will recall that the Gas Natural-Endesa case was notified to the Spanish competition authority.
On 19Â September, Endesa referred the case to the Commission for a decision on whether the case had a Community dimension.
On 15Â November, the Commission decided to reject Endesaâs claim in favour of the Community dimension of the proposed takeover bid.
Having respected essential due process requirements by allowing the two sides sufficient time to comment on each otherâs submissions and having considered all the arguments put forward, the Commission concluded that, under existing EU merger control rules and on the basis of Endesaâs 2004 audited annual accounts, the proposed concentration does not have a Community dimension and therefore falls outside the Commissionâs competence.
The Commission considers that its objectivity and its neutrality cannot be questioned by the fact that the Spanish Prime Minister may have touched upon the issue of Gas Naturalâs bid for Endesa during a meeting with the President of the Commission.
I was not at the meeting.
The President of the Commission meets regularly with many EU Heads of Government, including the Spanish Prime Minister, and discusses, as he told me, a wide range of issues with them.
The Commission is entitled and indeed required to listen to any opinion by interested parties from the private or public sector and examine all the aspects of a case before adopting any decision.
The existence of different drafts is in no way exceptional or unique to this case.
Instead, it can simply be seen as part of the internal discussions carried out within the Commission in order to assess the issues at stake from all relevant perspectives.
Â Â  Mr President, I am grateful for the Commissionerâs reply, but, having listened to her, I have the impression that, with regard to this matter, only technical issues have been dealt with, when the reality is that this decision has been the subject of many statements and positions prior to the meeting of the two Presidents which are far from normal.
You have not referred to the statement of the ministers of the Spanish Government, nor the position of certain Commissioners who are not competent in this field, nor even the request for exclusion from the Socialist Group a week before the decision so that you would not be competent in relation to these issues.
Against this extremely unusual background, on the Sunday before the week of the decision, the meeting that previously only you have mentioned took place.
A meeting that was not public, which was opaque, which was made public by means of subsequent leaks, thanks to which we found out that the OPA was dealt with.
Commissioner, correct procedures are of the greatest importance in our democracy, and you know the saying: âCaesarâs wife must not just be honourable, but must appear to be soâ.
A government of the Union must comply with Community rules, but the foremost rule is common sense in the way this decision is made.
The Commission cannot be strong with the weak and weak with the strong.
You must not give the impression that you are nothing more than top officials of national governments; your strength is based on the independence and common sense of your decisions.
I wonder whether you have obeyed those rules.
Â Â  . That was an interesting last sentence from the honourable Member â that you need to take decisions based on common sense.
As Commissioner for competition, I am used to taking decisions based on facts and figures, nothing more and nothing less; not common sense: just facts and figures.
It was my responsibility to deal with this case and it is my responsibility to deal with any case if the facts and figures show that it is a case for the Commission.
I did not deny that the President of the Commission and the Prime Minister of Spain held a meeting. But I repeat that I was not influenced.
In accordance with ArticleÂ 213 of the EC Treaty, the Members of the Commission acted independently and in the general interests of the Community in the performance of their duties.
They neither sought nor took instruction from any government or any other body.
I swore that I would behave like that and I swear that I will behave like that.
I do my duty based on facts and figures and whatever the surrounding emotion, you can be sure that I will stick to my line.
Â Â  Madam Commissioner, please do not worry, what you have said is absolutely correct.
You have shown that you tell the truth and I am very sorry that a compatriot of mine has called your honour into question.
Â Â  Madam Commissioner, without going into detail, the facts are as follows: you asked the College of Commissioners for support, which is an exceptional situation.
The President of the Commission went to Madrid on a secret trip and shortly afterwards you withdrew that point from the agenda of the College of Commissioners.
The following week you made the College of Commissioners decide on an issue with hardly any debate.
In the mean time, a colleague of yours from the European Commission keeps making statements in Spain stating in advance what the European Commissionâs position was going to be.
And I am wondering, and I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are aware that, in one Member State, these events have led to a loss of credibility for the European Commission as a guardian of the Community interest.
Â Â  . My credibility is not affected by a working dinner or whatever.
I repeat that my duty is to make proposals to the Commission based on facts and figures.
That is what happened in this case.
I was not asking the Commission for support.
I just presented my decision based on the facts and figures.
The Commission has a duty to make its decisions on an informed basis and that is particularly the case in the competition portfolio.
Again, I repeat that when I went to the College I stated the facts and figures.
Standard EU rules in this case meant that we could not deal with it and proposed that it should be dealt with in Spain, by the national competition authority.
Â Â  . Community assistance under the Ignalina programme is delivered in two ways.
The first is directly to the beneficiary country using a mechanism based on one of the European Communityâs pre-accession financial instruments, PHARE.
The second, covering the bulk of assistance, is delivered through an international fund managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the EBRD.
The Community is the main, but not sole, contributor to that fund.
The commissioning of a nuclear power plant is a long process, often spanning decades, and involves the planning and construction of large complex facilities.
Related projects will often only be commissioned several years after a contract has been signed.
For the specific case of EBRD-managed projects, the rules of the Ignalina decommissioning support fund require that before contracts can be concluded on any project sufficient funds must be available on the EBRDâs account.
That is normal project management practice.
That situation leads to contracts being awarded that will not be completed for several years and, clearly, do not require disbursement of all budget costs.
As a consequence, the annual appropriations for the Ignalina programme will not necessarily match payments in any one year.
Payments in any given year may even exceed the actual annual Community commitment to the fund.
Â Â  I am quite disappointed by the Commissioner's answer, because he has probably heard about the rows about the so-called accumulated appropriations that have still not been paid.
What surprised me is that 50% of the total amount foreseen in the 2005 budget was not used, so the problem is not about using the funds in the future, but rather about why we have to accumulate such large amounts of money and appropriations in advance.
Â Â  . Only 50% of the funds earmarked have been spent so far under the Ignalina International Decommissioning Support Fund.
This is not to say that the remaining funds allocated to this important aid programme will not be disbursed.
As already stated, the EBRD fund covers projects that are realised over a long period.
The funds are disbursed as necessary and the Commission will follow the implementation of the use of Community money, because the Commission entrusts its contribution to the care of the EBRD, an internationally recognised and respected financial institution.
Commission departments chair the assemblies of contributors, at which the major financial decisions are made, and periodically seek additional information from the EBRD and reserve the right to audit as necessary.
I believe that all commitments from the EBRD side will be fulfilled.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is a pleasure for me to answer MrsÂ Panayotopoulos-Cassiotouâs first question.
Several initiatives taken by the Commission in the realm of transport and energy demonstrate the importance we attach to people with special needs.
In terms of the public-service requirement, the Commission has undertaken to create a suitable legal basis on which the Member States can guarantee users high-quality transport services at affordable prices.
In 2005, the Commission stepped up its efforts by defining the elementary principles of its policy on passenger rights.
This time the Commission focused on fair treatment for passengers with reduced mobility.
It proposed a regulation on the rights of rail passengers, which is currently under discussion by the European Parliament and the Council, the latter having arrived at a political agreement on 5Â December.
For example, the proposed legislation requires operators to respect the right to fair access to rail services and the right to be informed of the accessibility conditions.
It requires rail companies and station administrators to provide assistance free of charge to passengers with reduced mobility, both in stations and on trains.
In a parallel effort, the Commission is dealing with the accessibility of trains and stations.
In connection with the implementation of the Directive on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system, the Commission is compiling a set of technical specifications designed to improve the accessibility of the public areas of the rail infrastructure for people with reduced mobility.
Special attention has been devoted to problems in boarding and alighting from trains and to obligations relating to evacuation in emergencies.
In response to specific transport-related needs expressed by the general public, Member States could also go beyond the requirements of Community legislation.
As far as public services are concerned, it is Community legislation that lays down detailed rules governing public intervention.
On the other hand, the establishment of a system of concessionary fares for certain passenger categories, such as members of large families, remains a matter for the Member States.
All initiatives of this type are underpinned by the strategy of the European Union to improve the active inclusion of people with disabilities.
The priority objective of the second phase of the 2006-2007 action plan is the promotion of access to transport services and non-discrimination, in accordance with the communication recently adopted by the Commission on the situation of disabled people in the enlarged European Union.
These are the points I wished to make to the honourable Member in reply to her question.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for all the information you have given and congratulations on the programme on which you have already decided.
I wanted to ask you, by way of a supplementary question, if children, young people and short people in general are included in the people who need special protection under the legislation proposed by the Commission.
Â Â  Yes, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I did indeed say that we had put in place a European action for persons with reduced mobility, and so far as the other categories are concerned, I mentioned large families, but I could just as well have spoken of young persons and children.
Member States obviously have some discretion in the matter because they are able to introduce benefits for these categories in their laws.
You will understand that we need to target Community interventions on the major issues.
The accessibility of transport to persons with reduced mobility is a really important issue for the European Union at present.
Â Â  Everywhere in Europe, people are increasingly seeing mobility as a right.
Cities are very much affected by the growth in mobility.
Urban transport has become a major problem.
While respecting the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission is trying to play a significant part in the development of an urban transport policy by promoting an exchange of good practice.
The Civitas programme is an innovative initiative combining transport, energy and environmental aspects.
The LIFE programme and the STEER programme are two other examples of financial support for a number of citiesâ projects to encourage sustainable urban transport.
We need to go even further than that, Mr Hegyi, and that is why the Commission has developed new initiatives.
For example, sustainable urban transport will be one of the priorities of the research axis of the seventh framework programme for research and development.
The forthcoming financial perspectives for 2007-2013 should open up the possibility of financing from the Cohesion Fund.
Moreover, to give fresh impetus to the organisation of public transport, the Commission has adopted a revised proposal for a regulation on land-based public passenger transport services.
Fleet renewal can also make an effective contribution to reducing the effects on urban air quality, and public contracts could set an example.
I am preparing a proposal for a directive to oblige public bodies to acquire a minimum quota of clean vehicles when renewing their fleets.
Finally, in its communication on air quality adopted on 21Â September, the Commission announced its intention to establish a common framework for designating low-emission zones.
The next thematic strategy on the urban environment will encourage an integrated approach to the management of our cities, including urban transport.
This strategy, which will be published in January 2006, will recommend that Member States and local and regional authorities draw up plans for sustainable urban transport.
Finally, we will be taking advantage of the updating of the transport policy White Paper to mention all these problems: the space given over to the car in our cities, passengersâ rights, future applications of the Galileo project, accessibility to public transport and the improvement of road safety, especially for cyclists and pedestrians.
As you see, Mr Hegyi, I share your concerns.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I am more or less satisfied with your answer, but I should like you to be more specific.
How does the Commission plan to discourage individual car driving and in the meantime encourage the environmentally friendly means of transport: cycling, public transport and rail?
As you mentioned cohesion funds, I will ask what may appear to be a simplistic question.
Could you say approximately how much money we spend on the development of public transport infrastructure in our cities?
I think people are interested in hearing how much money will be spent and not just our ideas.
Â Â  I would prefer not to give you too precise a figure, Mr Hegyi, because up to now some EUR 100 million have been invested through the framework programme for research and development, and the programme will continue with the seventh framework programme for research.
I can also tell you that the Civitas programme has received a great deal of financial support from the Commission to encourage the exchange of good practice.
We will see what policy for greater support we are able to adopt when the White Paper is revised.
Â Â  Commissioner, the suburban railway network is vital to sustainable urban transport in the majority of European cities.
Do you not believe, however, that the liberalisation of the railways, if an international passenger service is allowed to drop off and pick up passengers in two stations within a single Member State, could affect the economic balance and viability of the suburban railway network?
Â Â  The revised proposal put forward by the Commission on public service obligations answers your question, Mr Larrea, because it will indeed be necessary to ensure that the opening up of international passenger transport to competition respects the public service tasks recognised by the public authority.
There is a link between the text on the liberalisation of international passenger transport and the one on public service obligations, which will avoid some members of the public being in a difficult situation because they cannot have the means of transport they need, as you have just indicated in your question.
Thank you for your question; I shall be very careful to ensure that this liberalisation respects all services that are considered public services.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply and ask him if he would give particular attention to integrated ticketing on urban transport.
In Dublin, for example, we have a commuter train, a rail network, a Luas tram and public buses.
So far, there is no integrated ticketing system to be used on all four.
Would he consider making Dublin a study and promoting the whole question of integrated ticketing, so that people would use public transport more often and it would become more efficient?
Â Â  This is a very pertinent question, Mr Mitchell; there really should be integrated ticketing.
However, urban and interurban transport is really a question of subsidiarity.
What we need to do is to encourage the exchange of good practice between our European cities in order to find the best solutions.
Thank you for raising this issue, which is very important for our citizens.
Â Â  Questions Nos. 61 to 72 will be answered in writing(1).
As the author is not present, Question No 73 lapses.
Â Â  . The Commission is aware that Turkey has blocked applications by the Republic of Cyprus for membership of a number of international organisations, as was clearly mentioned in the 2005 Progress Report on Turkey, which we published in November.
The Commission fully shares the position set out in the document defining the framework for accession negotiations, in other words the negotiating mandate of the Union that Turkey should progressively align positions within international organisations with those of the EU, including in relation to membership of all Member States in relevant organisations.
This position is reflected in the Commissionâs proposal for a revised accession partnership with Turkey, in which one of the short-term priorities is that Turkey should âprogressively align policies towards third countries and positions within international organisations with those of the EU and its Member States, including in relation to the membership by all EU Member States of relevant organisations and arrangements such as Wassenaar.
The Commission will use all the instruments at its disposal, in particular the negotiating framework and the association agreement, as well as the accession partnership in order to ensure that Turkey aligns progressively with the Community also in this regard.
I remind you that this was one of the key issues that was discussed on 3Â October when the decision on the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey was taken.
I would also like to point out that the EU Presidency has just made a demarche to Turkey concerning the Cyprus application for membership in the Wassenaar agreement.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to extend my special thanks to Commissioner Rehn for his reply.
I would, however, like to point out that we all know the institutional framework which now governs relations between Turkey and the European Union.
The question is: how will Turkey be persuaded to apply and respect the and the legitimacy of Europe?
On 23 November, the Commissioner said, in his speech before the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, 'the time for celebration is over, now comes the time for delivery'.
What is this 'delivery', Commissioner?
Will the Commission propose the activation of the negotiation suspension clause if Turkey continues next year, over the next two years, not to respect and not to be bound by paragraph 7 of the negotiating framework?
Â Â  . This is a very pertinent question and we raise this issue regularly both in formal meetings of the Association Council and in other bilateral meetings.
I have raised it myself on several occasions with the members of the Turkish Government.
One should also bear in mind that there are several international organisations of which both Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus are members, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
It is clear to me and to the Commission that we cannot have the same kind of progress report in 2006 as in 2005.
This means that Turkey will need to make serious and significant progress both on the reforms related to the Copenhagen political criteria and concerning the normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus, in accordance with the EU declaration and the negotiating framework.
The safeguard clause, or the emergency brake as it is called, is a very serious policy tool, but it is not appropriate to speculate further on this before concrete negotiations on the chapters have really started.
However, in the case of a serious and persistent breach of human rights, the rule of law or political criteria, the Commission would not hesitate to propose using this safeguard clause, provided for by the negotiating framework.
Let us not tempt fate.
Let us work in order to solve these problems.
I expect that Turkey will comply with its commitments to support Cypriot membership of international organisations.
Â Â  . First, concerning Mr Posseltâs question, the Commissionâs position on the possible referendum on independence in Montenegro is as follows: firstly, the Constitutional Charter must be respected and the international standards complied with.
I refer in particular to the Venice Commission whose recommendations should be observed when the preparations are made for the possible referendum on independence.
Moreover, we have underlined that in both Serbia and Montenegro it is now essential for us to focus our energy on the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and not let other issues interrupt that process.
The Commission is following closely the situation in SandÅŸak, notably with a view to the possible independence of Montenegro, should there be a referendum along the lines I described.
We note that the Bosniak communities living in the Serbian part and in the Montenegrin part of SandÅŸak have differing attitudes towards this issue.
As regards the Serbian part, the local Bosniak leaders are concerned about the potential adverse implications of Montenegrin independence, in particular on trade flows and the movement of people.
As regards the Montenegrin part of SandÅŸak, the Bosniak political leaders seem to be in favour of Montenegroâs independence.
However, a large part of the non-Bosniak population in the Montenegrin part of SandÅŸak declares itself Serb and is against Montenegroâs independence.
Hence, there is a risk of inter-ethnic tension and it is a very complex situation, a reflection of the ethnic and political patchwork of the western Balkans.
For the Commission and for the European Union it is essential that both in Serbia and in Montenegro the rights of the minorities, including the Bosniak community, are duly protected.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his very good, very detailed answer.
Knowing the region as I do, I can say that his answer really was very precise.
I should like to put just two brief supplementary questions.
Could the Commissioner envisage more intensive development of the local infrastructure?
I ask because the region is extremely isolated.
Furthermore, can he envisage a cross-border Euro-region as a solution to achieve cooperation between the SandÅŸak people in Montenegro and Serbia?
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member for this important question.
I will start with the earlier one related to the question of the Euro Region.
Should Montenegro use the constitutional possibility of withdrawing from the State union, then the Serbian and Montenegrin authorities will need to ensure adequate bilateral cooperation, which is in the mutual interests of their citizens.
That is particularly important for those living in the border areas such as SandÅŸak, where the establishment of an international border could exacerbate the difficult economic situation.
We have to contemplate different alternatives if there is either a referendum or a process that will lead to the independence of Montenegro.
The time is not yet right to answer this question more precisely.
Concerning your first question relating to investment and economic development, previous experience shows that there is significant capacity in SandÅŸak for the implementation of projects that are geared towards peaceful conflict settlement and cross-border cooperation.
The European Agency for Reconstruction will initiate, through a project to be implemented by UNDP, a set of mediators and associations in the region of SandÅŸak, based on the already successful model implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That project is part of the overall framework in support of an anti-discrimination framework in Serbia and Montenegro and will be carried out under the Cards 2006 Programme for the State union.
Â Â  Questions Nos. 76 to 82 will be answered in writing(2).
Â Â  Mr President, in view of my lack of experience in this Parliament, I would like to know, purely by way of information, on what the written reply you have mentioned is based, because one of the questions is by myself.
Is this a decision by the Commission, or is it something laid down in the Rules of Procedure?
Â Â  I am happy to satisfy your legitimate curiosity, Mr YÃ¡Ã±ez.
We are applying the Rules of Procedure strictly.
When the questions to a Commissioner exceed the time allotted, we move on to the next bloc and all the others have to be replied to in writing.
Â Â  . I am standing in for MrÂ Verheugen on this issue, but I know something about this because of my previous responsibilities in this field.
The problem of a black market in medicinal products is very closely related to counterfeiting activities.
Counterfeit medicinal products, inside and outside the Union, are a subject of ongoing concern in the EU, the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation.
Part of the overall problem is that, recently, antiviral drugs have potentially been at risk in counterfeiting activities.
The possibility that such drugs could be in short supply has become a concern for many people.
The situation is naturally attractive to counterfeiters.
Over recent years, the Commission has taken action to address this problem at a horizontal level, as regards intellectual property and customs actions.
The legal framework has been changed, and indeed several times, in order to improve the enforcement of intellectual property rights and customs action.
In September this year the Council of Europe published a survey report that provides an update on the extent of counterfeiting in the pharmaceutical sector.
It is currently evaluating the possibility of further action based on that report.
At the same time, the WHO has proposed a framework convention to combat counterfeit medicinal products at global level.
The Member States are responsible for the enforcement of any activities against counterfeiters.
Therefore, the Member States are currently evaluating the results of a survey with the aim of identifying the extent of the problem of counterfeit medicines and the development of an anti-counterfeit strategy.
While the above-mentioned actions of the Commission and the Member States are far reaching, the Commission continuously monitors and analyses the situation for possible legal implications within the European Union and opportunities for future international cooperation.
Â Â  The Commissioner has very accurately described the illegal activities that underpin the black market in antivirals and medicines in general.
These activities manifest themselves in the following ways: firstly, the purchase and subsequent sale of antivirals on the black market at greatly inflated prices; secondly, the sale of counterfeit medicines with no effect whatsoever on influenza â medicines with the so-called âplacebo effectâ; thirdly, the production of generic influenza medicines with inadequate guarantees of effectiveness against ordinary influenza; and fourthly, the trade in precursors.
I thank you for your reply and your interest.
I believe that what you have said will contribute towards reducing the size of this black market, bringing it under control and eventually eradicating it.
Â Â  . I take due note of the point made by the honourable Member.
This is a very important issue which indeed has to be tackled both at EU level and at global level.
I will convey your message to Vice-President Verheugen, who is responsible for this in the Commission.
Â Â  Questions Nos 84 to 126 will be replied to in writing(3).
Â Â  â Mr President, I understand that you are applying the Rules of Procedure, and quite rightly so, but Commissioner Rehn has only been given 12 of the 20 minutes allocated to him for his replies.
I have the 76th question and you have prevented the Commissioner from replying to my question, which was the next question, even though you only allowed 12 of the 20 minutes to which he was entitled.
Â Â  I am afraid that that is not possible, Mr Matsis.
It is gone 8.00 p.m. and the Commissioner is going to be late for an unavoidable commitment.
That, therefore, concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0377/2005), by MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (9856/2005 â C6-0274/2005 â 2003/0175(COD)).
Â Â  . Commissioner Barrot, Mr Twigg, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Eurovignette Directive is a top priority on the European transport agenda, because tolling and/or road charging is at risk of getting out of hand, and there is too much confusion as to what rules Member States should abide by.
Since it is crucial that European rules be laid down for this internationally operating sector as a matter of urgency, I am delighted with the agreement reached with the Council.
It was a long time in coming and was preceded by much discussion.
It was equally the subject of intense debating in this House.
As rapporteur, I should like to convey my gratitude particularly to the shadow rapporteurs, for the good cooperation, thanks to which, and to the confidence that has been put in me, I am able to present this agreement to this House, and one that enjoys the broad support of the groups in the House at that.
There was no lack of hitches in the process whereby the agreement came about; the particularly hectic voting in the Committee on Transport and Tourism springs to mind, and the fierce negotiations we held with the Council were gripping to the very last moment.
On behalf of Parliament, I should like to thank the British Presidency, and particularly Mr Twigg, for his successful commitment.
Indeed, he has managed to convince the Council that important concessions to Parliament were necessary.
I should also like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his constructive contribution to this agreement.
Thanks to this agreement, Parliament has made considerable progress in key areas from first reading.
I am pleased that Parliament has opted in favour of steering a realistic course in this.
The agreement only provides for the possibility of Member States passing on infrastructural costs and not, or rather not yet, external costs, because a clear and transparent calculation model is lacking as yet.
The agreement does, though, considerably reinforce the environmental elements in the directive.
For example, as of 2010, Member States will be required to vary the toll charges according to euro class.
Toll variation is an ideal tool to promote clean road transport.
Additionally, from 2012 onwards, Member States will be required to impose toll charges from 3.5 tonnes upwards, with exceptions, because excessive administrative costs and a negative impact on the environment should, of course, be prevented.
Parliament regards it as essential that the agreement should contain a clear and explicit road map for passing on external costs for all transport modes, as well as an impact assessment.
I can tell Commissioner Barrot that it is crucial that we gain more insight into this impact before we reach a decision.
After all, we would like a positive impact on the environment and on the shift in the modes of transport.
I am picking up many contrasting signals in this respect.
We should also remain sensitive to the economic importance of the transport sector, which is already dealing with the effects of the enlargement and high fuel prices.
I should like to ask Commissioner Barrot to confirm here in this House that the Commission will be presenting a model and an impact assessment in two yearsâ time.
This will enable us to revisit this topic during our term in office.
Perhaps he could also confirm that the Commission, as soon as the report and model are ready, namely in five yearsâ time, will present a proposal for the directiveâs revision, for that, too, is vital.
The proposal goes on to make statements about the future.
I should like to single out two of them.
First of all, the consumer must pay, but it is, of course, not the intention for the consumer to pay twice.
Secondly, the money that the consumer pays should be invested in infrastructure and sustainable transport.
