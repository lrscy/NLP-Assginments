We all know that.
It is clear that that sector has to make a major effort to achieve the agreed standards for 2020.
It is also clear that we have to be ambitious and set the bar high.
It is clear, too, that car manufacturers will not be able to do that alone.
An integrated approach is needed; they should not have to take sole responsibility.
Flanking measures therefore have to be taken.
Better air conditioning, better roads and a change in driver behaviour - in other words, all of us.
The sector deserves support from the government because the motor industry employs a large number of people, directly or indirectly.
First of all, I am therefore appealing to national governments to modify their motor taxes as a matter of urgency, so that consumers switch to environmentally friendly cars of their own accord.
Secondly, I appeal to the Commissioner, the Commission and Europe to conduct an assessment of the 2009 multiannual budget in order to invest even more research funding in new research technologies for low CO2 cars.
I know you recently announced an ambitious programme to invest EUR 500 million in hydrogen technology.
Of course that is fantastic, but it is medium-term.
Obviously solutions have to be found for the new engine technology in the short term as well.
I am sure that, whether it is by 2012 or a little later, smart car manufacturers will reach the goal of 120g much more quickly than planned. Simply because - and I do not want to be naÃ¯ve - the market demands it.
In that sense the context has changed completely in the past couple of years.
It is therefore important that we approve the compromise proposals by Mr Callanan on marketing and advertising, because they are transparent.
It is a question of giving consumers clear information.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for the quality of this evening's debate.
I would like to comment, time permitting, on three of the issues you have addressed.
Regarding the ambitious level of the strategy, the Commission has proposed its strategy on the basis of a thorough impact assessment.
We have analysed the various options of a level to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, taking into account measurability, monitorability and accountability.
On this basis we have proposed to deliver the 120 g of CO2 per kilometre objective through an integrated approach.
One hundred and thirty grams will be delivered through passenger car technology and ten additional grams will be provided through complementary measures, including fuel efficiency targets for light commercial vehicles and an increased use of biofuels.
This approach towards achieving the 120 g target is, in our view, the most cost-effective combination of options, and we will thus propose legislation accordingly.
Secondly, the legislative framework implementing the integrated approach will be the central pillar of our revised strategy, but it is not the only one.
As underlined in your report, finding ways to encourage consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars will enable us significantly to reduce their environmental impact, along with the fuel bill of drivers in the European Union.
In the context of the review in the Car Labelling Directive, we will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament in the field of consumer information.
Thirdly, the Commission agrees that a longer-term strategy should be considered, in order to provide predictability to car makers.
We will thus consider the potential for progress beyond 2012, and the 120 g objective, on the basis of an impact assessment.
In this context, the Commission will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament concerning future emission targets.
I believe I have addressed some of the main concerns that have been voiced, and I hope that Plenary will adopt a resolution which strongly supports the approach proposed by the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October.
Conventional energy sources and energy technology (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Reul on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on conventional energy sources and energy technology [http://www.europarl.eu.int/oeil/FindByProcnum.do?lang=2&procnum=INI/2007/2091" ].
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since I have a few extra minutes, let me begin by thanking the Commission, the Secretariat of our Committee and the other rapporteurs.
It was not such an easy task, and I am grateful that we managed to cooperate in an objective manner and to seek out the widest possible common ground on what is not an entirely straightforward issue.
Our work was based on three communications from the Commission, and our aim in this report was to provide answers in the three areas covered by those communications, which we managed to do by a large majority in the responsible committee.
The starting point was a generally accepted principle that is restated in every debate on energy policy, namely the view shared by the Commission and Parliament that energy policy has three major goals - competitiveness, in other words affordable prices, protection of the environment and security of supply.
The conclusion that the solution lay in the continuing development of new and existing energy technology was certainly the easiest part of the report to deal with.
Technology is the key to the pursuit of these three goals.
In a world in which demand for energy is constantly growing while the supply of fossil fuels is steadily dwindling, it is therefore crucial that we invest in research and innovation and try to make progress in these areas.
We need only look at the potential for increasing the generation efficiency of coal-fired power stations, which averages 34% at the present time but could be raised to 55% through the use of state-of-the-art technology.
If a third of old plants were replaced by cutting-edge facilities, fuel consumption could be reduced by 30%.
That is just a small example of the opportunities offered by new technology.
We also spoke about two energy sources which are very different from each other but which share the distinction of provoking the greatest political controversy.
No one doubts that the share of fossil fuels, which accounted for 79% of gross domestic fuel consumption in the European Union in 2004, will remain high in the foreseeable future.
However long this may continue, the fact is that we will certainly have to operate with fossil fuels for some time to come.
Coal is a major factor that plays an important role - one reason, of course, being that it is one of the few energy sources, or indeed the main energy source, that we possess in Europe, even if its availability varies between Member States.
This is a significant advantage, particularly in terms of the security of our energy supplies.
This means - and this was an important point in our discussions - that when we say coal has a future, which the Commission has thankfully described, we must ensure that the critical aspects of coal use are addressed.
One of these critical aspects is the emission of carbon dioxide.
One option is greater efficiency and better technology, and the other option is to try to use new technology to separate CO2 and store it underground - the famous carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.
That is easier said than done of course, but there are indications that it works.
We have acknowledged that in this report and have advocated promoting the development of CCS technology, because it gives us a chance to go on benefiting from coal, which is a very reliable source of energy for us in Europe.
This is why we have also stressed that we need to tread warily, that carbon capture can reduce generation efficiency and that it is therefore difficult to estimate when CCS technology could come on stream.
Above all, we must do our homework and formulate the appropriate legal provisions.
The third and most controversial part of the report relates to the issue of nuclear energy.
Nuclear plants account for more than 30% of power generation in Europe, and nuclear power has advantages that are undeniable, whatever our political views.
It is there, it is affordable, and it makes a major contribution to security of supply.
In terms of reducing CO2 emissions, it is an extremely exciting and interesting option, and I do believe it would be reckless if we simply pushed this form of energy aside and did not even consider it.
We succeeded - not without difficulty - in finding formulas to which a large majority could subscribe and which conveyed the message that airing these ideas is part and parcel of a full debate but that the decision to adopt or reject them is a matter for the Member States.
That is quite an important point, but our intention is to contribute to the area for which Europe bears some responsibility, namely security of supply.
In this respect it is a wise move to establish the High-Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management and the European Nuclear Energy Forum, and it is undoubtedly right, as postulated in the Illustrative Nuclear Programme for the Community (the PINC paper), to carry this debate forward and, when we discuss investments in new technology, not to turn our backs on any potential solution.
In short, an energy mix does not mean sifting out particular sources of energy but taking all sources into consideration.
I hope we shall manage to adopt this resolution tomorrow in the form in which it was approved by a large majority in committee.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Reul on his report.
It comes as the last report from the European Parliament in the follow-up of the energy and climate change package from 10 January.
The other two reports, by Mr Vidal-Quadras and Ms Thomsen, have given the Commission valuable input for further formulation of the proposals.
The first concerns our preparation of the internal market package, and the second, the continuing work on the Directive on Renewable Energy.
I am also very grateful for the timely input Mr Reul and this House will provide in the area of energy innovation, clean fossil fuel and nuclear energy.
On many accounts, the Commission is already in line with the calls of Parliament and is working on a number of outstanding issues identified in the report.
Europe needs to achieve the important goal of combating climate change.
For that, and also for security of supply, we need low-carbon, highly efficient energy technologies.
We also need to use fossil fuels in a more sustainable way.
And it will be difficult to achieve our climate change goals without the use of nuclear energy.
Let me start by addressing the issue of energy innovation.
The Commission intends to present the European Strategic Technology Plan at the end of November.
Europe has proven to be successful in setting a regulatory framework in support of low-carbon technologies.
Targets have been agreed for energy savings and for renewable energy.
We are also building a truly internal market.
There is no doubt that these are the basis for the third Industrial Revolution.
However, this is far from enough.
If we only depend upon imported low-carbon technologies, we will fail our security of supply and competitiveness objectives.
The analyses currently under way in the Commission show that Europe is falling short in the development of low-carbon technologies.
In essence, we are not able to convert the high quality, basic research that is done in the EU into world leading technologies.
Today, we do not focus sufficiently on matching research to business developments, by building pilot and demonstration plants to get up to full commercial scale.
For Europe to lead the world in innovation for climate change and energy security, it is essential to be more efficient in the management of the resources invested in energy innovation.
We therefore need better, joint strategic planning at EU level, as well as more effective implementation of energy technology programmes and measures.
Furthermore, and as was stated in Mr Reul's report, we have to mobilise additional financial and human resources for energy technology research and demonstration.
We have already increased the budget for energy in the seventh Framework Programme by 50% and for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme by 100%.
This could not have been achieved without strong support from the European Parliament.
Member States are also going down this road, and I am convinced that the private sector will do the same, once the framework conditions are right.
This applies in particular to industrial-scale demonstration projects and early market deployment, as well as to the fundamental role of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
I will now turn to the second part of the report: the challenges associated with conventional sources of energy.
We must recognise that these energy sources will play a substantial role in the energy mix for years to come.
We share the same view: that we need to make the transition from traditional to sustainable fossil fuels.
Before the end of the year, the Commission will take further steps to address the use of modern technologies in power generation from fossil fuels.
In particular, the Commission will address the issue of the legal framework for the capture of carbon dioxide and its geological storage.
We will table a legislative proposal which aims at establishing the regulatory framework in order to provide legal certainty, and to ensure public confidence in the safety of carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment.
I am also currently preparing a communication to set the political framework in support of CCS.
I agree that CCS will require significant research efforts before it can be commercially viable.
This is why CCS will be included among the strategic energy technologies in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan.
This is also why we are singling it out for communication in connection with the legislative proposal.
In parallel with continuous research and development efforts, the EU needs to move on demonstration plants.
Such projects will provide invaluable experience.
They will allow us to optimise existing technologies, and to identify and respond to the remaining challenges.
The goal is clear: to see several large-scale demonstration plants operational in the EU by 2015, and to bring the technology to the market by 2020.
This will not happen unless there is strong commitment from the European private sector and strong, supportive government policies.
The Commission is ready to lead, but it will be necessary to get the full support of Member States and of the European Parliament.
I will now come to nuclear energy.
I am pleased to note that your message regarding nuclear energy is fully in line with our conclusions in the communication on a Nuclear Illustrative Programme, as widely supported by the Economic and Social Committee.
I am also glad that the first meeting of the High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management took place on 12 October.
The group has a mandate to progressively develop common understanding and, eventually, a higher level of nuclear safety.
I share the report's view that an open dialogue on nuclear energy is essential.
For this reason, the Commission has set up a nuclear forum, on the lines of the other energy forums.
The aim of the Nuclear Forum is to enlarge the debate on nuclear energy, and to involve all the relevant players.
On 26-27 November, the first meeting of that forum, also called the Bratislava/Prague Forum, will take place.
I trust it will mean more transparency in allowing for consultation with, and between, all stakeholders.
I am pleased that the European Parliament will also participate.
I would like, once again, to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent report.
I thank the European Parliament for its support and cooperation.
We will use this report in our further work, and I definitely look forward to the debate.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DA) Mr President, excuse me, but this report is not good, and neither has the work process in connection with it been good.
Why has the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy not listened to the statements from other committees?
On behalf of the Committee on Development I regret the fact that we have only been asked for a statement on the Commission's carbon emissions.
Energy efficiency and savings and our most important criticisms are far too weak.
In addition, they are otherwise entirely decisive for the developing nations.
There is a huge amount of energy to be obtained through savings, and there are known technologies available, and for the developing nations at least it is much, much more important than CSS.
In general, this also applies to the industrialised nations.
In addition, why is oil being forgotten completely?
The high oil prices are a major burden for the developing nations, particularly within the transport sector, where oil is dominant.
In addition to improving efficiency, there is a need for other transport models.
However, renewable energy is crucial if the developing nations are to develop, and it is grotesque that this is barely mentioned in the report.
The proposal is blunt, and the views of the Committee on Development are not included in any way.
I would therefore like to urge everyone to address this tomorrow.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (PL) Mr President, I would agree with the opinion of Herbert Reul as regards diversification in electricity generation, diversification of supply and improvements in energy efficiency and usage.
The fact that natural resources are continually dwindling is nothing new to scientists working in the area of energy supply.
For years, leading research centres have been observing the level of usage of natural resources and have published alarming reports.
The findings of these reports show unequivocally that continued reliance solely on conventional methods of generating energy could, in future, lead the global economy to an energy crisis.
Dwindling natural resources means that Europe will increasingly have to import from neighbouring countries, which can result in a gradual dependence on suppliers.
We have already seen the negative consequences of such a policy on a number of occasions in neighbouring countries.
For this reason one of the principal challenges facing the European Union is diversification of energy sources as well as to work on creating new energy generation technologies.
Positive policies in this area will be beneficial not just to society and the economy, but also to the natural environment.
At this point, however, I would like to emphasise that not all countries will be able to pursue this policy in the short term.
This is linked to historical conditions that resulted in the power sector, for many years, being backward in comparison with the countries of the old EU.
For this reason, from the perspective of a citizen of such a country, I would like to point out that, as I said, Poland or the other countries in this geographical area will have to cover more ground than the countries of western Europe in modernising the power sector.
Please consider this particular point.
Taking climate change into account, the EU should become more involved in work on clean coal technology as the optimal solution for the natural environment, especially in those countries where the power sector in largely dependent on the use of coal.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us makes no secret of the fact that there are major arguments against conventional forms of energy.
The issue most talked about nowadays in this connection is that of climate change.
Not only do fossil energy sources contribute to global climate change, however; they also make Europe more dependent on external suppliers.
Allow me to cite one example from Hungary to illustrate my point.
In a country where raw materials are in short supply, gas comprises 50% of the energy mix, 80% of this deriving from a single external source, namely Russia.
This results in a degree of dependency that not only has far-reaching social and economic consequences, but can also exert considerable influence on Hungary's international relations.
At the same time, however, these figures and others like them show that conventional energy sources are inevitably going to play a major role in Europe's energy supply in the decades ahead, even if renewable energies gain ground.
To state the contrary would be tantamount to sticking our heads in the sand.
Ladies and gentlemen, the contradiction between the necessity of conventional sources and the risks associated with them must, however, be resolved.
I believe Mr Reul's report presents the necessary toolkit for doing just this.
I agree with the rapporteur that the European Union needs to focus on three fundamental objectives when establishing policy on conventional energy sources: increasing efficiency, and, connected to this, exploiting the potential of research and development, and reducing dependency on external sources.
The best example of this last point is the Nabucco project; construction of this gas pipeline would represent a significant step towards diversification and so it is in the Community's interests to make it happen.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, energy is a crucial factor as regards market competitiveness as well as quality of life for EU inhabitants.
For this reason, therefore, the fundamental political and economic goals must be effectiveness in the sustainable generation of energy, efficiency in terms of reductions in overall usage, as well as reliability and safety of energy supplies.
Achieving these goals will also result in a safe society.
We cannot forget how much our citizens pay, either directly or indirectly, for every unit of energy.
The competitiveness of the EU Member State's economies depends, among other factors, on better use of regional resources in the form of fossil fuels.
This will only happen, however, when the Commission provides guarantees that the emission trading system will not hamper the replacement of existing power stations, e.g. coal-fired power stations, by more modern systems with lower CO2 emissions.
Poland has already reduced emissions by 32% since 1988 while, over the same period, the countries of the old EU have done considerably less.
The present figure for emissions per inhabitant in Poland stands at 7 tonnes per annum, while in the old EU countries this is up to two times higher.
In these circumstances it would not be right for Poland to reduce CO2 emissions drastically by a further 30% from next year.
This is a Commission decision that would have highly unfavourable social consequences.
My country cannot be sacrificed to the politics of climate hysteria.
It is well known that the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change and that we have to counteract the consequences of these changes, i.e. droughts, floods and shortages of drinking water.
Justice, however, demands that reductions in CO2 emissions be linked to a per capita figure in EU countries.
It is important that emission costs should not be decided arbitrarily on the basis of reductions and unclear principles.
Competitiveness cannot be a function of false market incentives, and the price of energy has to reflect its real cost.
It would seem sensible to use all possible methods that have been tested to absorb carbon dioxide, including biological methods, and to absorb methane.
At present, however, priority should definitely be given to methods that improve the efficiency of converting primary energy into other forms based on pilot technological installations for the gasification and liquefaction of coal, as well as for the creation of hydrogen.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Reul sincerely for the fruitful cooperation in preparing this report, which demonstrates a comprehensive, balanced and long-term approach to the problems of fossil fuels and atomic energy.
First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Reul, and my other fellow Members, who have come up with valid amendments, on their well-balanced report and all the hard work they have put into it.
All the energy sources covered in the report have been given a sufficient amount of attention, while at the same time, the importance of alternative energy sources and new energy technologies was duly pointed out.
Energy diversification is of great importance in ensuring energy security, which happens to be vital to my country, Lithuania.
This area is definitely vulnerable, as my country is fully dependant on one supplier, without any other alternative so far.
A possible solution could be the construction of a safe, modern nuclear power plant.
It would be the basis for both our political security and economic stability.
Discussions on this report involved sharing different views on the future of nuclear energy.
Although we should fully recognise the importance of alternative energy sources and their possible dominating role in the future, we should nevertheless develop a down-to-earth approach to nuclear energy and face the fact that 30% of the energy produced in the EU is produced by nuclear power plants.
This energy contributes to the implementation of the Kyoto objectives as well as to increasing the security of energy supply.
I consider the amendments so energetically presented by the 'green' politicians who condemn nuclear power in the name of the security of European citizens to be hypocritical, as it could contribute to the increased insecurity of other European citizens.
I would like to encourage my fellow Members to be tolerant and to support the provisions enabling each nation to decide whether it is for or against the use of safe nuclear energy.
Only by sharing our views and listening to different opinions will we be able to come to the right decision.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in this debate on conventional energy sources and energy technology, I would like to thank Herbert Reul for preparing a comprehensive report on this issue.
First of all, the author of the report is right to note that the most important issue, also in terms of the future of energy generated from conventional fuels, is for the countries of the European Union to work together in this area.
Secondly, with regard to the fact that the European Union's dependence on fossil fuel imports will rise to about 70% by 2030, and, in the case of oil imports, to as much as 94%, it is essential to make maximum use of fossil fuel resources within the countries of the European Union.
Thirdly, coal is just such a resource, with Germany holding as much as 7% of the world's reserves and Poland 2% of these reserves.
It is important not to call into question the extraction of this fuel and the generation of energy from it, since electricity generated from fossil fuels is still half the price of electricity generated from renewable sources.
Fourthly, because of the ecological risks associated with the generation of electricity from coal, joint European investment is needed into research in new technologies in this area, financed from funds from the European Union budget.
Fifthly and finally, support is needed for European Union countries investing in atomic energy.
In this context I would like to draw your attention to the agreement that has been drawn up for the construction of a modern nuclear power station in Ignalin, which is a joint project between Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, may I say to Mr Reul that, since it has been more or less announced that the Greens do not approve of this report, I intend to focus on the points that I found most disturbing.
These are also reflected in the amendments we have tabled.
During the drafting of this report it was impossible to engage in any critical reflection on nuclear energy.
All the problems in Europe associated with the demise of the safety culture in our nuclear plants were off-limits, even though the incidents in Germany involving reactors operated by the Vattenfall company had just provided a glaring cautionary example.
Discussion of the difficulty of funding waste disposal was likewise off-limits, as was the increasing threat of nuclear material being misused to build bombs or possibly for terrorist purposes.
I must tell you, Mr Reul, that there is one thing which has truly driven me to distraction, and I shall say this before we meet in Bratislava.
It is the fact that in Slovakia now, in 2007, the Italian ENEL company is planning to complete a nuclear plant that was developed in the Soviet Union before Chernobyl.
Construction began in Czechoslovakia in the early eighties, and two thirds of the construction work was completed.
Now ENEL intends to finish building the plant without new planning permission and without having the plans checked for compliance with European standards.
It is a disgrace.
People who sing the praises of nuclear energy have no right to go on disregarding that disgrace.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, crude oil is more expensive than ever.
This also has an effect on the price of other fossil fuels.
The cost of all forms of energy is rising, as four fifths of the EU's entire energy consumption is fossil fuel-based.
People are not prepared to reduce consumption, so there is a need for new technologies, greater energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and new nuclear technology, including research into nuclear fusion.
After the vote in the Committee's report, the hopes and dreams for the main alternatives are linked to CCS technology and nuclear power.
There are no guarantees, however, that liquefied carbon dioxide can be stored safely in perpetuity.
There are no signs that there might be investment in the hydrogen economy within the context of the transport infrastructure, let alone the use of electric cars running on carbon dioxide-free electricity, as is called for in the report.
It will probably take half a century to tame nuclear fusion.
All in all, the Commission's proposal that by 2020 20% of the energy consumed in the EU should be produced with renewable fuels is just not credible.
That will not be possible, at least not with renewable fuels produced in the EU's own territory or in the EU's big Member States.
The report under discussion presents far too optimistic a view because it suggests that fossil fuels will continue to be used, without any real alternatives and with no restraints at all.
They will only stop being used if something forces the situation.
We will be forced into this if natural resources run out before 2020, but it will not happen as a result of any systematic effort on the part of the EU Member States or an EU declaration.
In fact, it will take not only volition, fine words and pious hopes, but also genuine action which challenges our present lifestyle.
Furthermore, the pricing system for electricity, where wholesale prices for electric power are determined by the power exchanges, should be rethought.
The price is always set by electricity produced at the most expensive production costs as well as that produced based on the most expensive allowances.
This is the price which all the producers get.
Unfortunately, there are no guarantees that companies will spend the excessive profits they make this way on research into energy, as it is in the spirit of the times we live in that they distribute their profits in the form of dividends to their shareholders.
Emission allowance trading is also a way to increase the profits of the electricity companies rather than reduce emissions.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur is right to make the point that conventional sources of energy will remain indispensable for several decades to come.
He is also right to call for diversification of energy sources and supplies, for safer and more environmentally conscious energy production and for more efficient energy use.
We are somewhat sceptical, however, about the grounds on which these measures are urged.
In the first place, the stated reasons are largely a repetition of the myth that climate change is due to carbon dioxide emissions from human activity.
Yet growing numbers of scientists, while not disputing the fact of climate change, for the climate is constantly changing, are calling into question the notion of global warming, the culpability of CO2 and the idea that the human race is behind it all.
That being the case, the famous CCS (carbon capture and storage) technology - to which the report devotes much space but the long-term risks of which are unclear - sounds like a dodgy 'quick fix'.
Secondly, and despite the customary allusions to the Member States having primary responsibility for their energy choices, the rapporteur cannot help trying to steer them in a certain direction.
Consider the space that his report devotes to the nuclear option - which remains entirely a matter of sovereign choice for each Member State and which cannot be considered solely from the perspective of CO2 emissions.
Finally, no mention whatever is made of globalisation as contributing to the over-use of fossil fuels.
The promotion of international exchanges of goods at the expense of shorter, local and national, supply circuits is by no means irrelevant here.
What the Commission has been doing for years through its ultra-liberal trade policy and the opening of our markets to global competition without a scrap of protection for our economies - whatever its underlying rationale - is very largely responsible for creating the problems that the Commission now claims it wants to resolve.
Mr President, there is much to commend in this report.
Of course it makes the ritual genuflection to climate change hysteria, despite the increasing doubts over the supposed link between CO2 and climate.
However, it also recognises the importance of diversifying energy supplies and of using fossil fuels, including coal, in the energy mix.
It emphasises the need for energy security, and in this context rightly points to the need for energy efficiency, for continuing use of domestic resources, including coal, and for nuclear energy - both the current use of fission and the vital research on fusion, which is the great hope for the future.
The most remarkable factor in the energy debate is the way that the Greens and their fellow travellers agonise over carbon emissions but oppose the only mainstream low-carbon-generation technology.
With oil at USD 90 a barrel, it is time for Ms Harms to recognise that nuclear power is the cheapest, safest, cleanest, most sustainable and most predictable base-load-generating technology available.
As my colleague Mr Vidal-Quadras has said, nuclear waste disposal is simply a technical problem which has now been solved.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to acknowledge the work of the rapporteur, who prepared a well-balanced and realistic report, which reflects the latest developments.
I also appreciate this initiative by Parliament, as it is one of the few reports dealing with conventional energy sources.
I am convinced that in the next few decades fossil fuels will continue to be irreplaceable in the energy mix: they should therefore be given due consideration.
Renewable energy sources are important, though they cannot replace conventional sources.
As stated in this report, our efforts should aim at developing new technologies which allow for energy production with less environmental impact, such as clean coal technology.
Nowadays, when we are experiencing ever-growing energy consumption on the one hand, and a lack of technologies to replace the existing energy sources on the other, an overly unidirectional orientation towards renewable sources could paradoxically accelerate the growth of Member States' dependency on energy imports from other countries.
Because energy has become the most strategic of commodities, the debates on complete replacing conventional sources may be popular but are very irresponsible.
I regard as a triumph of common sense the fact that this report devotes sufficient attention to nuclear energy.
If we are serious about the strategy for reducing the levels of CO2 emissions close to zero, we cannot reject nuclear energy, which is without question one of the cleanest energy sources.
We should not remain alone in our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, but strive to convince other superpowers to join us.
Unless countries such as the US, China and India take similar measures, the measures we take will not have any real impact on a global scale because they can influence roughly only one seventh of global CO2 production.
In conclusion, I would like to suggest that the rapporteur study more carefully the differences between nuclear reactors.
There is no comparison between the reactor that exploded in Chernobyl and those installed in the Czech Republic.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Reul's report begs the important question of what direction Europe and the world are going in on the energy question.
The conflicts continue.
For how long can we contain them?
There is no easy alternative to fossil energy, given current conditions, not even if we did what we could to save far more energy than we do now.
Oil accounts for around 37% of the energy we use, gas 24% and coal 16%.
Fossil fuels thus account for 77% of all our energy.
We know that the International Energy Agency predicts that world energy consumption will grow by more than one and a half times each year.
Consumption of fossil energy is expected to increase by even more than that because the large developing countries have little faith in wind power stations.
The developing countries account for 70% of growth in energy consumption, and China alone represents 30% of that growth.
The reserves of fossil fuels are therefore running out and are concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.
It will take decades to change the energy system.
Time is running out; this is actually a race against time.
Unless we can sort out the environmental and energy problems we cannot guarantee peace.
If I could mention some areas of action: we need intensive research, product development and new technologies, and we also need to change our behaviour.
In Europe we do not even conduct intensive research, even though we are heading for greater dependence, higher prices and conflict.
I just heard that the United States of America spends five times more money on environmental research than the Union.
How is it that the Lisbon knowledge-based economy works in this way?
Finally, it needs to be said that energy has its social dimension.
Prices have risen by 50% in just a few years.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Reul's report is a very good and thorough report and I congratulate him on it.
I am astonished, however, at the space it devotes to coal.
Coal is undoubtedly an abundant energy source.
It is also the world's most widespread source of fossil energy.
I am concerned, however, at its increasingly predominant role in electricity generation.
The impression is given that carbon capture and storage technology will solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations, but I must confess that I am sceptical.
There are coal-fired power stations all over the world: is it possible to equip them all with carbon capture systems?
How will we manage to prevent CO2 emissions from the so-called 'clean' coal-fired plants?
Is there not a risk that, having already experienced the eras of wood burning, coal burning and oil burning, we might now be taking a backward step into another coal burning era?
To conclude on a more optimistic note, the report's strength lies, in my opinion, in its proposal for the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan.
The plan needs to address the necessary diversification of energy sources by 2020, 2030 and 2050 and it must also reflect the importance of resource use at regional level.
(PL) Mr President, of the energy sources listed in the report, it is only coal, whether it be hard coal or brown coal, that is available in large amounts within the European Union.
By and large, we have to import the other energy fuels.
Energy requirements will increase in line with growth.
At present it is not clear how successful we will be in developing production from renewable energy sources or from hydrogen batteries, but these too need energy supplies.
For this reason, despite enormous efforts, we should not give up on coal too quickly as an accessible source of energy.
We are not doing enough to develop clean energy from coal.
More resources should be put into processing coal and into improving the efficiency of boilers and generators.
We must maintain energy security and one of the elements of this is the coal that is available in nearly all EU countries.
We cannot afford to dislike our natural riches.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Herbert Reul and his colleagues for an excellent and balanced report, which I fully support.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is good to see you burning the midnight oil along with us.
In Europe, we have a vast renewable energy potential.
In Scotland, we know that better than most.
As Ms Harms has said, my Group has a number of difficulties with the pro-nuclear aspects of this report.
But my own view is that we must also make sure that we do research into other, non-nuclear sources of power and research into ways to make them better.
In paragraph 47, carbon-capture is experimental but it is promising, and in paragraph 47 we call on the Commission to lay down, as soon as possible, clear political guidelines for the promotion of research into carbon capture and storage.
Commissioner, I am delighted to hear you are going to do that.
It is important because, left to their own devices, the Member States will not come up with it.
In Scotland, we had at Peterhead a world-leading proposal for a demonstrator site.
Because of political uncertainty entirely caused by the London Government not making it a priority, the project is going ahead - and it is going ahead in California.
Europe can have a lead in this; we can be globally significant in the research potential that we have, but we must have real action.
I am glad to hear that this report has some ideas which the Commission is taking forward.
(CS) I would like to make 10 points regarding the report by Mr Reul.
It is an excellent and well-balanced report, which, in my opinion, is written in the spirit of Antoine de Saint ExupÃ©ry's words about our future: our task is not to foresee it, but to enable it.
The report lists practically all the conventional energy sources, except perhaps, to please the Green Members here, for ebonite sticks and fox tails.
Jokes aside, I recognise the exhaustive manner with which the report encompasses the general regulations governing the energy sector.
As Professor Semjonov's historical findings confirm, since prehistoric and ancient times the same basic laws have applied: on the one hand humans have tried to lower the energy intensity of technologies, while on the other hand they have strived to produce more energy.
In my opinion, today an effective combination of energy sources and diversification of gas imports is vital.
The weight of the European single market should be increased as a factor for guaranteeing the stability and reliability of supplies.
There are of course environmental risks involved, which would need to be carefully assessed.
The rapporteur, Mr Reul, refers for example to the Arctic shelves, which, according to some estimates, account for up to 25% of new gas and oil sources.
The Commission will undoubtedly be asked to take measures to reduce the energy intensity per unit of GDP.
Another essential task is drawing up a reasonable technology transfer policy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(SK) Allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Reul, on his excellent report.
This reports captures the status quo in the area of conventional energy sources and technologies, and at the same time draws attention, in a complex way, towards many aspects of their further use in the context of both securing energy supplies and the need to continuously increase emissions.
Since there is an increasing need for energy on a global scale, the European Union cannot afford to completely eliminate fossil fuels since they play an important part in overall energy production although their reserves keep diminishing.
In spite of the fact that the European Union is on average relatively effective in producing energies from these conventional sources, some Member States could do still much more in the area of introducing and supporting new, more effective technologies and developing new, more effective cooperation units.
Nor should the Member States create needless obstacles to new investments in the use of fossil reserves through the most advanced technologies available.
Another issue I want to concentrate on is nuclear energy.
As we know, nuclear energy generates practically no CO2 emissions and I am convinced that sooner or later it will find its place even in those Member States that so far have been against it for ideological rather than pragmatic reasons.
Since new technologies, such as fourth-generation reactors, are constantly developing (even in Russia, Mrs Harms), there are now options in place for further improvements to their operating safety and for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel.
To conclude, I would like to say that I appreciate that the work of the Commission shows a tangible tilt towards more a open and objective view and evaluation of the benefits of nuclear energy, resulting in initiatives such as the European Nuclear Energy Forum, the inaugural meeting of which will be held in Bratislava in November later this year, as mentioned in this House.
Europe has long been lacking such a permanent platform for discussion, contributing to the exchange of knowledge, information and opinion.
Such exchange will be useful both to the experts and the public in general, and I assume that it will be useful to the Greens as well.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to touch on two points.
The first is one on which I hope and believe we are firmly united, namely the view that conventional sources and forms of energy and technology will continue to play a major role in the future.
The idea that we can replace everything with energy from alternative sources is illusory.
We must, however, make conventional technology environment-friendlier - that is absolutely essential - and we must also ensure that conventional forms of technology become more efficient.
These are the views we share, and in these respects the report can be strongly endorsed.
The situation is perhaps somewhat different with regard to nuclear technology.
It must be absolutely clear, with no ifs or buts, that every country can choose its own forms of technology, in other words it can opt for nuclear technology or choose to get by without recourse to the nuclear option.
Another principle that must be common to all of us is the primacy of safety - not only safety in the energy production process but also, of course, safe final disposal and, what is very important in today's world, where the significance of the global dimension is constantly growing, the non-proliferation of nuclear technology that can be used for military purposes.
I would have liked to see the report focus rather more sharply on these issues.
We have, admittedly, addressed them in other reports, and I believe Europe must set the best of examples in this field.
Regardless of what might be called the ideological stance - whether we are for or against nuclear technology - safety must be absolutely paramount.
I hope that we in this Parliament and, of course, the Commission will be increasingly vigilant so as to ensure that all safety issues, including non-proliferation, remain in the foreground, otherwise we shall be failing in our responsibility for mankind and for peace in the world.
I hope that this message might yet come across more clearly tomorrow in some amendments than it does in Mr Reul's report.
(BG) Geopolitical interests and the striking of balances, the level of technological development and its impact on the economy create the necessary conditions for a second chance to nuclear energy as an important element of the energy mix.
This theme is very important and topical against the backdrop of the heated debate on the climate change, the security of energy supplies and the alternative power generation solution.
In my country Bulgaria, Kozlodui Nuclear Power Plant acounted for 43 % of the total power generation in the country, contributing to the sustainable development of the economy in 2006.
Of course, these figures pertain to the period before the closing down of units three and four of the nuclear power plant on 31 December 2006.
Analyses reveal that in the next few decades to come the consumption of electricity will double globally.
All over the world, 31 reactors are under construction and others are in the planning phase.
This dynamic process comes to show that active efforts are being made to seek solutions in order to overcome the challenges facing modern economies, to provide inexpensive and clean energy, to cope with the climate change, to observe the greenhouse emission quotas under the Kyoto Protocol, to safeguard the security of supplies and to reduce the dependence on imported gas and oil.
And if I recall yeat another fact, i.e. currently nuclear power plants generate one-third of the elecrticity in the European Union, then I would conclude that perhaps the time for a nuclear Renaissance has come.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the report should be commended for including all sectors of the energy mix while looking at conventional sources in particular.
We certainly need to step up the effectiveness of fossil fuel use.
I am convinced, however, that there are several reasons why we cannot do without nuclear energy.
Sustainable development, preservation of competitiveness in the broadest sense, true environmental protection and emission reductions are just some of these reasons.
We are finally beginning to discuss nuclear energy without letting unhelpful feelings and emotions guide us, although some of the amendments tabled and even some of the contributions still do not bear witness to this.
I am therefore glad to hear realistic voices from the Commission and other EU institutions saying that we need to incorporate nuclear energy even in the future.
In many countries nuclear energy already represents a key source, and is a guarantee of the much-discussed notion of energy independence and security.
It seems at last that by pursuing quotas and percentages we will not end up doing what a Czech proverb describes in a colourful way as 'throwing the baby out with the bath water'.
(ES) Mr President, the own-initiative report we shall be voting on tomorrow is the third and final such report drafted by this House and concludes Parliament's response to the energy review submitted by the Commission at the beginning of the year.
Our colleague Herbert Reul has done a magnificent job throughout the debate in committee and has produced a sound, consistent text which fully encompasses the concerns of the majority of MEPs.
For a long time, fossil fuels and nuclear energy will continue to be the nub of our energy mix and despite the ambitious targets we have set ourselves for renewables, the contribution that they make will not be truly significant for several decades.
Therefore, we must not temper efforts to research, develop and innovate in conventional sources since fulfilling our commitments in relation to climate change, security of supply and competitiveness involves achieving a more sustainable use of these sources.
The result of the committee vote was excellent as it highlighted the progress made in controlling the capture of carbon dioxide, in improving energy efficiency in the generation of electricity, in the contribution which synthetic fuels for transport can make, and in the competitiveness of the nuclear sector.
One Group in this House has tabled almost 40 amendments to the nuclear section seeking to change all objective and realistic references to nuclear fuels to references to renewable sources.
I would like to remind them that this matter has already been voted on at a previous plenary sitting and, allow me please to tell the Group concerned, that it is free to live in a world divorced from reality, but that we will all suffer the consequences if their obsessions ultimately mean that their arguments prevail.
The majority of the members of this House prefer to work with facts and to use those facts to draft sensible policies which do not lead our society into collective breakdown.
(BG) Allow me, first and foremost, to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Reul on his objective and balanced report.
A major distinctive feature of the report is the clear outline of the role of conventional energy sources, the need for their increasingly efficient use through new technologies to achieve the energy security of the European Union with maximum compliance with the sustainable development goals and the combat against climate changes.
I would like to support the conclusion that the increased investment in energy technologies at the European and national levels would not only contribute to the attainment of the EU energy goals but it would also enhance its capabilities to export facilities in compliance with the higher efficiency and security standards.
I would like to single out that section of the report which deals with nuclear energy not only because of its leading place in the generation of power from conventional sources but also because of the vital importance for nuclear energy to observe the highest nuclear safety standards.
In this sense, the support to the appeal of the Commission to introduce common nuclear safety reference levels in the European Union is a crucial aspect of the report.
I would like to specially emphasize the fact that Bulgaria, which intends to build a new nuclear power plant, takes great interest in the enhanced role of the European Union in the observance of high nuclear safety standards, as well as in the creation of favourable investment conditions for these large-scale projects that call for big financial, material and intellectual resource input.
The work of the European Union, including the High-level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management and the existing Nuclear Energy Forum, will contribute to the incorporation of nuclear energy into the EU policies in a more objective manner.
(DE) Mr President, necessary though it is to enact measures to combat climate change and promote renewables, it is extremely important that Parliament should also deal with the future of conventional energy sources.
The Reul report emphasises the huge importance of coal and nuclear power to the regional economy.
We have 300 000 European jobs in coalmining alone.
Additional economic strength is provided by the power stations and through tax revenue.
Some 60% of our electricity generation is based on European coal or nuclear power.
Of course we must increase the efficiency and safety of these energy sources.
Of course we must also seek to protect the environment by developing additional legal provisions governing matters such as carbon emissions.
On the other hand, we must not turn the legislative screw so tight that coal loses its international competitiveness.
The fact is that renewable energy sources will not be able to grow as quickly as we would wish.
We face the threat of restrictions on our independence in the field of foreign policy and arbitrary actions on the part of our energy suppliers.
The only way to avoid that threat in future is with a strategic energy mix which also includes coal and nuclear power.
(ET) If climate change is to be brought under control it is important to reduce carbon emissions from combustion of fossil fuels to near zero.
However, in order to prevent and mitigate the unwanted effects of climate change action must be taken now.
Clean coal technology may prove to be possible, but we cannot pin all our hopes on it at present.
The European Union must significantly reduce current greenhouse gas emissions and that must remain the cornerstone of our climate policy.
I am pleased that the European Parliament Temporary Committee on Climate Change has recently approved a strong line for our negotiations at the Bali Climate Conference in December.
Where clean coal technology is concerned, the funds currently available for the necessary research can of course be increased because the matter must be researched.
However, we cannot spend decades waiting for research findings without doing anything else and therefore we must now concentrate on measures which must be implemented immediately, namely reducing CO2 emissions, energy-saving measures and a general transition to renewable sources of energy.
The vote of the ITRE committee has resulted in too great an emphasis on nuclear energy in the Reul report and there has been too little discussion of renewables.
Therefore I fully support the amendments tabled in the House, as they help to balance the report.
In particular I call upon you to support the proposed amendments recommending that the European Commission make renewables the central focus of its own European Strategic Energy Technology Plan.
Mr President, first I must commend Mr Reul for skilfully steering his report through about 200 committee-stage amendments to provide this House with a very balanced, consistent and honest report that is highly relevant to the challenges we face today and in the future.
Many of those defeated amendments have reappeared at the last minute, and we in plenary must throw them out again.
These amendments damage not only the report: in the end, they damage the environment that some of the proposals claim to represent.
I use the word 'honest' most deliberately, because Mr Reul has used real words like 'coal' and 'nuclear', rather than hiding behind the generalities of what might or might not be sustainable or renewable, and it is clear that we will continue to rely on burning fossil fuels for generations to come.
Of course we support renewables. We do so because they provide necessary, clean energy.
However, in most Member States, renewable energy can meet neither our environmental targets, nor our accelerated energy demands, nor our need to remain competitive in global markets.
As responsible politicians, we must discard the dogmas of the past and recognise that all clean technologies have their role to play.
Quite simply, we must retain and advance the nuclear share - and we will still not be doing enough.
In my country, Bulgaria, we were needlessly required to close 2 000 MW of safe, clean nuclear power.
(ES) Mr President, despite the ambitious targets we have set ourselves, it would appear that we all agree that conventional sources of energy will continue to be an important part of our energy mix.
Therefore, nuclear energy will also continue to play an important role as it is still necessary in order to ensure security and stability of supply in many countries.
To that end it is reasonable for research to be carried out in areas where nuclear energy's weaknesses are more apparent such as safety or treatment of waste, but we should note that the report clearly endorses the idea that the nuclear option falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States, as Mr Reul noted at the outset.
However, it would appear that some people intend Europe to entrust its future almost exclusively to nuclear energy, making the development of renewables, increased efficiency or research subordinate to it.
There is one small detail which we should ponder: what are the public's views on this?
We have very much taken the reality of the situation into account but, of course, we must have clear priorities and in that regard it should be noted that the importance of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan which the Commission is due to submit to us soon is one very important aspect of this.
We believe that the main objective should be to reduce the cost of renewables, to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, industry and transport, and to make progress in low carbon technologies.
Europe and the Member States should make these objectives their political priority and the focus of their efforts to build a future energy policy.
(RO) The gross energy production in the European Union is achieved based on various energy sources: 31% nuclear energy, 29% coal, 19% gas, 14% sources of renewable energy and 5% oil.
Romania produces 13.5% of its energy from oil, 15.3% from coal and coke and 5.9% is hydroelectric and nuclear-electrical energy.
As regards nuclear energy, it is essential to ensure its security and, especially, adequate waste treatment.
Generation IV nuclear energy systems will allow better nuclear waste management and decrease its quantity.
Nevertheless, an extremely important element for environmental protection should refer to the treatment of water used to cool reactors.
For this reason, the investments in the security and treatment of radioactive waste should be a priority for the countries that generate nuclear energy.
The Black Sea region is extremely important for diversifying the European Union's sources of energy.
The region has a strategic importance, not only for the transportation of hydrocarbons from the Caspian Sea region to the European Union, but also for the coal resources existing in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia.
It is important for the coal industry to provide work safety and health conditions.
As long as coal is a source of energy, it is important to have the necessary investments in order to provide workplace safety.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs.
It is a particular achievement of this report that the European Parliament has realised beyond any shadow of a doubt, and accepted, that ideological concerns cannot override environmental and economic necessity.
Some of the current Member States have attempted to do just this over the past half-century but, as we know, were unsuccessful.
It was in 1956 that Hungary abandoned the vain political notion that it could be a country of iron and steel.
Fortunately the European Union has not had to go to such extremes to realise and acknowledge that we will need all our knowledge and all our resources if we are to meet our energy requirements securely in the 21st century.
This calls for the maximum possible diversification in terms of both sources and technologies.
Ideology cannot decide what sort of footing Europe's energy supply will rest on in 10, 20 or 50 years' time; science must decide.
The politicians' role is to demand safety, coordinate sources, and increase public acceptance.
For this task I wish all of us - as Hungarian miners would say - 'jÃ³ szerencsÃ©t', may we come out safely at the end of the day!
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as was mentioned, this is the third report on the Commission decision and the later decision of the European Council.
The Vidal-Quadras report has helped us formulate the internal market package.
The Thomsen report will have a huge influence on our proposals on renewables.
I can also promise that we will follow the vote on the Reul report very carefully, because the outcome of that report will influence the approach to CCS - first of all the legal proposal and also the report - and also our Strategic Energy Technology Plan and our future policy, as far as the Euratom Treaty gives us a mandate for nuclear energy.
That is why this vote will be very carefully followed by the Commission.
At the same time I would like to emphasise a couple of points.
It was mentioned that we need to modernise the energy sector.
If I recall - now, in 2007 - the first debate in 2004, I believe we have achieved a lot.
Definitely, security of supply and climate change are closely related, with perhaps just one major difference at this stage, which is the cost for carbon sequestration, but I believe oil price developments will help.
At the same time, weather challenges were mentioned.
We do not invest in sufficient resources.
We should really decide on priorities.
Without massive investment in research and development in the energy sector, we will not succeed.
I believe the three-year debate was very helpful to prepare the ground. But now it is really time to address the issues.
How can one claim, for example, that some Member States are dependent on third countries when the Structural Funds are not being used for energy at all, or practically not at all!
I would say also the part in national budgets for research and development is small.
So these are the crucial issues to deal with.
I am afraid that not much time is left until we have some serious perturbation in the market.
So, we need to act, and to act now, on the basis on which Parliament has worked so far.
There was also mention of one particular issue: that we need sufficient energy resources.
Sufficient resources need energy demand management.
Here again, Parliament has moved and the Commission has moved, and at the same time I needed to start 12 infringement cases for not communicating energy efficiency action plans, the basis for action on energy demand.
With regard to demand and dependence on third countries, this is also something that we should overcome.
I think the Saryusz-Wolski report was a courageous attempt to go for it.
If one Member State is being blackmailed by a supplier, it should speak out.
Because the basic reason is that we have a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) that could give the necessary grounds for common action, and I believe that any country that has enough courage to blackmail any of the EU countries will think twice, or never again blackmail, if this is spoken of and discussed in the Council.
The last part of my intervention will be on nuclear energy.
It is very clear that, under the Reform Treaty, the energy mix comes under national decision-making.
That means that the decision on nuclear energy is to be made by each and every Member State.
But it should also be understood that conditions now definitely demand that the legislation in place should guarantee transparency and predictability, because it is a very long-term investment.
Mr Swoboda also mentioned non-proliferation issues.
We are looking at these, but in my opinion, it is very clear that the CFSP has priority and Euratom should fill in and help.
It is definitely the CFSP that should lead our activities on non-proliferation.
Two very concrete responses.
First of all, Mochovce.
SlovenskÃ© ElektrÃ¡rne has indeed notified its intention to construct a nuclear power plant.
It is for a VVR reactor 440/213 but it is not of the Chernobyl type.
The Commission, in accordance with Article 41 of the Euratom Treaty, will prepare an opinion, taking full account of all the challenges this decision poses.
This will take time, but you can be assured that the Commission will perform the correct assessment and will not hesitate if we have any doubts about the safety of this equipment.
On the issue of coming here to talk about the closure of some of the nuclear units, a debate on this issue would not be productive.
This issue was agreed by the experts who prepared the ground.
It was discussed at a political level and it was agreed at government level and sealed by a referendum in all the Member States, including the countries where these reactors are.
Please do not return to this, because it distracts us from future developments.
There is no way these reactors will get the green light for prolonging their work time.
This is a dead end.
Please understand that there will be no development.
I know, perhaps, you have personal views on it, but there will definitely not be developed, at least from the European Commission.
The opinion has been formed.
It was democratically agreed, and let us keep and honour the commitment.
I greatly appreciate the report that has been drawn up.
It is a very difficult report and I believe it has got the accent right.
I hope that the vote will definitely help us finalise the paper that we are to prepare by the end of the year.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October.
European Statistical Governance Advisory Board - European Statistical Advisory Council (debate)
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005 the Commission, with the support of the Council and Parliament, embarked on a process to reform statistical governance in the European Union with the aim of strengthening the independence, integrity and responsibility of the national statistics institutes of all the Member States of the Union and, of course, of Eurostat, the European Statistical Office.
The first aspect of this process was the adoption in May 2005 of a European Statistics Code of Practice.
Implementation of that code resulted in closer cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistics institutes and in improved reliability of statistical data gathered for many purposes; in particular, however, I would like to refer to one objective which has been the subject of debate here over the years, namely the excessive public deficit procedure.
When it proposed the Code of Practice, the Commission also recommended that the self-regulatory focus should be counter-balanced by the establishment of a reporting system to monitor adherence to the code.
That gave rise to the idea of establishing an independent external advisory body to play an active role in monitoring implementation of the Code of Practice in the European statistical system as a whole.
At the same time the Commission noted that it was appropriate to review the operation and composition of the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres, with the aim of making it more efficient and allowing it to play a more strategic role.
The ECOFIN Council and, more generally, the national statistics authorities welcomed both recommendations and the Commission implemented them in a dual proposal in October last year; we are debating those proposals today with the prospect that, and I hope we will be able to confirm whether you agree with me here, they will be adopted at first reading.
To that end I would especially like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Bowles and Mrs Van den Burg, on their work and the quality of their reports.
This process of strengthening European statistical governance is supplemented by a new Commission proposal adopted on 16 October, only a few days ago, to review the Regulation on the production of European statistics.
That proposal is also subject to Council and Parliamentary approval under the codecision procedure and we will therefore have the opportunity to debate it again here in the coming months.
This set of initiatives will provide the Union with a modern, reliable, efficient European statistical system capable of improving public confidence in official statistical data.
I refer once again to the debates we have often had in this House in recent years on the importance of reliable budget data, or reliable data for other national public accounts, GDP etc., or the need to have a price index upon which the public can fully rely.
As regards the reports we are debating tonight, allow me to point out simply that from our point of view it would have been preferable if there were greater respect for the institutional balance, as envisaged, in our view, in the initial proposal, in relation to the appointment of members of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board and the drafting and transmission of that Board's reports.
In any event, the Commission acknowledges that the amendments to the original proposals are unquestionably important, they have the support of the Council and Parliament and they do not alter the substance of our original proposals.
In view of this, Mr President, before I close I would like to reiterate my thanks to the rapporteurs, and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work and for the continuous support for the Commission's work to modernise our statistical system and make it more reliable and more robust.
rapporteur. - Mr President, this decision concerns the setting up of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board.
Statistics are used by Member States, by the EU, internationally and by many other stakeholders for a variety of purposes.
They are used, for example, by the European Central Bank, for economic analysis; the Commission, through Eurostat, produces statistics that are compiled from data produced by Member States.
A few years ago questions arose over the credibility of statistics being provided by some Member States to the EU institutions, and it was clear that some kind of quality control was needed.
As the Commissioner has said, in response, a Code of Conduct on statistical procedures was compiled.
In order to provide a check for consistency and adherence to the Code of Practice, each national statistical office is checked by peer review which involves another Member State and Eurostat.
As a further check, it was also proposed to introduce an independent, high-level advisory board.
It is that board, now called the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, which is the subject of this proposal.
It is fair to say that there is a high degree of sensitivity on all sides about how intrusive the role of the Board can be.
I am grateful to the current Portuguese Presidency, and, before them, the German Presidency, and also to the Commission for being frank with me about these sensitivities.
Parliament, of course, was determined that the Board had to be more than a rubber stamp for the Commission's report.
However, we have achieved agreement around a balanced and workable proposal which includes most of Parliament's amendments in some form or another.
I am particularly pleased that we have been able to agree with the Council that dialogue should be encouraged, not only between the Board and this Statistical Programme Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, but also with Member States' stakeholder bodies.
The Board will report to Parliament and the Council and will include in its report an assessment of their implementation of the Code of Practice in the European Statistical System as a whole.
The Board will also advise the Commission on appropriate measures to facilitate implementation of the Code of Practice as it relates to Eurostat and to the European Statistical System as a whole.
It will further advise on communicating the Code of Practice to users and data providers and on updating the Code of Practice.
Measures to ensure the independence of the Board and involving the Parliament in the appointments have also been included.
So, after consulting the Commission, the Council selects and the European Parliament approves the nomination of the chairperson of the Board.
Parliament and the Council each appoint three members of the Board.
The chairperson is not to be a current member of a national statistical office, or of the Commission, or to have held such a post within the last two years.
We considered similar exclusions on all members but that is not really practical.
However, we have added a requirement that the Board provide a range of complementary skills and experience.
Just in case we have not got the balance right, the Board itself should be in a position to know whether it has been frustrated or not, so there is a review clause after three years.
This will give sufficient time for the Board and others to be able to indicate whether the procedures are working and effective or whether there are changes that are necessary, and this must be a serous review.
Parliament, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission have had a very effective dialogue on this dossier, and I thank them.
I am pleased to be in a position to be able to lead this proposal through in a single reading with the support from shadow rapporteurs, whom I also thank.
rapporteur. - Mr President, let me first make two preliminary remarks.
One is that, obviously, this subject of statistics is not a very sexy subject and is always placed at the end of the agenda.
But what concerns me a bit is that there are politicians, MEPs and others who often like to complain about the provision of statistics.
But then, if there is an opportunity to really improve something, they are not really actively involved in making the situation better.
The second remark is that I hope the Commissioner, at least, will appreciate that we are having this debate.
Ms Bowles and I have said that, for us, it is not really necessary to have the debate.
But it is important to underline the fact that you have done something on statistics, and that issue deserves some attention.
So I hope you will not blame us for keeping you here at this hour.
Let me, then, congratulate you on the very concrete measures that you have taken vis-Ã -vis these problems with statistics, which have appeared several times in recent history.
I know that you had to do this in the political room for manoeuvre that is granted to you by the Council, because we are aware that the European Commission cannot oblige Member States to establish independent statistical offices and prescribe to them how to work and how to deal with figures and data.
Ministers and MEPs who are the loudest and firmest in complaining about the lack of reliability of the figures of others are also the ones who do not want you to mix in their business and infringe on their autonomy and their way of dealing with statistics.
This is the problem you have to deal with.
But, in this context, I think it was wise of you, Commissioner, to take a pragmatic, bottom-up approach, to focus on peer reviews and a code of practice, and to reform the governance structure of the statistics system by creating a new high level governance board, which Ms Bowles was speaking about, and by reforming the existing European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), which dealt with economic and social statistics, into a more streamlined and smaller advisory committee with a broader mandate.
In Ms Bowles' and my report we have tried to improve this even more, and to reinforce and strengthen the approach of the Commission.
At the same time, we have also made sure - in accordance with your proposal - that these two new bodies in the European family can function properly and with more independence from the Commission and Eurostat.
This may not have been completely in line with the Commission's intentions; however, I want to express my appreciation to the Director-General of Eurostat for very generously accepting the fact that we took away his voting rights in the system that we designed.
I also want to express my appreciation to the Portuguese Presidency, and to Ms Cordeiro, for the efficient way she chaired the Council working group and negotiated with us a first reading agreement on this issue.
This was a very efficient and very time- and bureaucracy-saving procedure.
So, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, who has also asked for the floor, can see an example of how we can deal in a very efficient way with this type of co-decision procedure.
Let me very briefly give some of the elements of the statistical board, which I will do in writing.
If you read the dossier, you can find where we made the changes, so I will not repeat this here but will stick to my wish that these two bodies will really bring some consciousness and some improvement in the way the statistics systems function, and will help us to really have reliable figures and base our economic activities on reliable data.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the European statistical system is part of the wider task of sound economic governance in the Union, particularly with regard to adjustment of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I share the wish expressed by both the Commission and the Member States to enhance the quality of statistical information.
As I see it, determining what constitutes an excessive deficit depends on the reliability of the data.
Unreliable data puts the entire Stability and Growth Pact in jeopardy.
In return for flexibility in implementation of the pact, which was introduced under the reform adopted by the March 2005 European Council, the necessary figures must be indisputable and verifiable.
Flexibility is important too in the current context of enlargement of the euro zone.
We need to learn the lessons of past experience!
The European Union has already been obliged to review the statistics relating to a Member State's budget deficit and level of debt; now several Member States want to join the euro zone, so the volume of statistical information to be processed will increase, as will the number of parties involved in the discussions.
The proposed improvement to the European statistical system aims to address legitimate concerns that have been raised concerning the validity of the data which Member States supply and the system for checking them.
We need to take care that doubt is not cast over the entire statistical system and over Eurostat's ability to verify the budget data which the Member States provide.
For these reasons I support the reform, which will result firstly in the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy and secondly in the creation of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board - both bodies capable of actively helping to monitor implementation of the code of conduct throughout the entire European statistical system.
I have no hesitation in supporting the proposals made by our two excellent rapporteurs.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have already pointed out, Commissioner, statistics are vitally important to both the European Union and the Member States in many policy areas.
If wrong decisions and unwelcome developments are to be avoided, statistics must be meaningful, reliable, open to only one interpretation and therefore comparable too.
That, unfortunately, has not always been the case.
I therefore welcome the establishment of the European Statistical Advisory Committee and the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board.
The amendments tabled by the European Parliament will, I hope, endow both bodies with the authority they will need.
Let me emphasise first of all that the Statistical Advisory Committee will be independent and that all stakeholder groups will be represented on it.
The Committee will have far fewer members than its predecessor, the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), and the reduction from 79 to 24 members will make it considerably more efficient.
I welcome the fact that the European Data Protection Supervisor is to be a voting member of the Advisory Committee, whereas the Director-General of Eurostat has only been granted non-voting membership.
This underlines the Committee's independence.
Secondly, the Statistical Governance Advisory Board is a useful complement to the Advisory Committee.
The Board will monitor and, I hope, actively encourage the application of the Code of Conduct in all European statistical matters.
One can only hope that, with the aid of these two bodies, the needs of users will have a greater impact on the statistical work programme and that the Code of Conduct will strike such firm roots that deliberately or mistakenly delivered misinformation or inaccurate data will become a thing of the past.
Let me conclude by thanking both rapporteurs for their work and for their willingness to discuss contentious points frankly and constructively.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation to Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den Burg for their reports.
We should be aware of the role played by the European statistical system, which may be the world's best system.
We are talking here not just about the clarity of lists of figures, tables or charts.
The most important issue is the reliability and completeness of statistical data at the level of the European Union, of the Member States, and also, and this I would like to emphasise, of the regions.
For that purpose it is vital to ensure continuity of information as well as access to it.
I would add here that only statistical data that have been collected and collated in the same way, in accordance with statistical principles, can be reliable and transparent, and will not be affected by short-term interests or passing priorities.
My experience in regional policy has shown clearly that such risks exist.
For this reason we should be pleased that we have an EU statistical programme for 2008-2012.
To make it work will, however, need appropriate funding and, above all, will require appropriate consultation, monitoring of the code of statistical procedures as well as statistics management.
This is very important in the light of the different systems used in Member States, the need to coordinate and unify them at the level of the 27 countries and statistical offices as well as Eurostat.
In this context I would like to support both the reports.
(DE) Mr President, there is general agreement as to how important statistics are, and not just among the people who have managed to come here at this late hour.
The question is whether the aim which I presume we are all pursuing will be achieved with the measures that are being initiated here.
It made me wonder, Commissioner, when you spoke of another new regulation that was to be negotiated with us.
Perhaps you can tell us whether its provisions will also affect these advisory bodies.
The second question is this: there is always a great inherent danger with advisory bodies that they will become a law unto themselves and drag everything out.
Would it not have made more sense at the end of the day to evaluate briefly, concisely and clearly, using external management consultants where necessary, the problems that have occurred with Eurostat and then come to a rapid agreement with Parliament rather than passing the buck again and shelving the issue?
When all is said and done, every one of us knows that the crux of the problem is the interface between Eurostat and the national statistical offices.
The best an advisory body can do is to put the problem back on the agenda, but it is certainly not going to establish real transparency and efficiency.
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, first, thank you all, especially the rapporteurs but also all the other people who have spoken in the debate for your involvement and cooperation in improving statistical governance in the European Union and, via the second committee reform, for improving users' involvement in the economic and social life of Europe with the aim of achieving a better statistical system, a more credible system.
What we are talking about here is a system and, as Mrs Van den Burg said, both the European Statistics Agency (Eurostat) and the national statistics agencies of the 27 Member States must be equal to the demands and hopes we are vesting in them; they must cooperate, they have to work in a coordinated fashion, they have to spur each other on; hence the code of practice and the way in which it is being applied is, from my point of view, a very positive thing.
I hope that this new body is able to assess its worth and to spur it on to work with the future in mind because it is very important in many fields to have access to good statistics.
Mr GauzÃšs referred to the Growth and Stability Pact.
I did so too in my initial speech.
It is very important for us to have reliable figures when monitoring budgetary discipline in this multilateral framework.
But it is also very important to have reliable figures on National Product to fund the European Union; it is also very important to have a reliable price index; similarly it is very important to have statistics on external trade; it is also very important to have statistics on external investment or on trade patterns or financial flows.
In all the aspects we were discussing, or listening to, in my case, in the previous item, energy, extraordinary importance is attached to energy statistics, as it is to statistics on immigration or on matters related to what has thus far been known as the third pillar.
There are many, so many areas of activity, practically all the areas of European Union activity, which need good statistics, that the importance of this debate, while not a very 'sexy' subject, as Mrs Van den Burg put it, is obvious and I hope that the two bodies are equal to what we are asking of them under these two regulations.
Another very important set of rules the 'Statistics law' is in the offing.
Given the combination of this package and the very worthy efforts being made both by Eurostat and all the officials at the European Statistical Office and the national statistics institutes of the 27 Member States, I hope that in the next few years any doubts as to the quality of European statistics will be dispelled, if possible, and that this will result in greater effectiveness and finer tuning of our policies and our decisions to the demands and aspirations of European citizens because that is essentially what we are dealing with when we talk about statistics.

Closure of sitting

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to come back to a decision that was made yesterday afternoon.
However, I must put on record that neither the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, nor the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or any of the other groups were informed about the wish for us to adopt a resolution on Russia this time, even though this has been repeatedly rejected in the Conference of Presidents.
We must, of course, take note of the decision.
However, I should like to record here - and we shall also inform the groups that have requested this, particularly the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - that we are not asking for this resolution to be adopted now, but at Parliament's next sitting instead.
I should simply like to record this here.
We must, of course, formally abide by the rules.
However, we do want to say here, out of fairness to the Greens and Liberals, that we are asking for this resolution to be adopted not this week, but at the next plenary session.
The Socialist Group will be voting on it in any case and I believe the EPP has a similar idea.
Mr President, actually I totally support Mr Swoboda, since we were not told and therefore have not prepared anything for this resolution this week.
Our group, like the PSE Group, did not know about this, and we ask you to postpone the vote to the next part-session.
Thank you, we take note of your request.
It will be passed on to the other groups as appropriate and we will see how the matter can be resolved.

Taxation and customs policies and the Lisbon Strategy (debate)
The next item is the report by Sahra Wagenknecht, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question as to whether the Member States' taxation policy actually helps to promote growth, employment and innovation at present can unfortunately be answered in very few words: it does not!
Growth is simply not promoted by abandoning to free fall the tax rates of highly profitable conglomerates in a Europe-wide dumping race and in return demanding cash increasingly forcefully from average wage earners, the unemployed and pensioners in their capacity as consumers.
Growth is not promoted by subjecting income from employment to a tax rate that is several times greater than that applied to income from assets, thereby making the gap between them ever wider.
Employment is not promoted when small investing enterprises are taxed disproportionately more than those tinkering speculatively in shares, bonds and financial derivatives.
Innovation is certainly not promoted as long as multinationals with gilt-edged balance sheets are able to stash away the best part of research and development funds in their accounts, while those who are actually targeted for this kind of benefit are left out in the rain.
In brief: a socially balanced perspective and development is certainly not being promoted in the EU, but is virtually being stalled while those rolling in money are being treated to more and more tax breaks and fattened up even more while those who already have little are having to dig ever deeper into their pockets.
This kind of taxation policy is fatal in terms of economic policy, counterproductive in terms of growth policy and catastrophic in terms of social policy.
I know that the structure of national taxation systems still lies, of course, within the sovereignty of the Member States on paper, but the reality is somewhat different.
The lack of EU-wide coordination actually means - even in the direct taxation sector - that national taxation systems are increasingly no longer designed at all on the basis of policy, but are formed and moulded by the ice-cold system of tax competition.
This system can involve a simple denominator: the more mobile a factor, the greater its potential for extortion against national fiscal services and the more sweeping the tax relief, of course, which it is able to enforce itself.
If government revenues are not to dry up and run out completely in this process, the sectors not able to escape taxation at all, or only with difficulty, must be taxed even more heavily almost as compensation.
Taxes are therefore shifted - from corporate profits to private income, and then from investment income to labour income, which is even less mobile, within income from highly paid employment to less well paid employees, who are also correspondingly less mobile, and generally from income and assets to consumption.
The fact that this process is in force - and has been for years and decades - can be very clearly demonstrated by the data on tax receipts and taxation rates in the EU.
Not only the legal tax rates but also the actual tax rates on corporate profits in the EU have fallen in the last decade by over 10 percentage points.
All the studies carried out on this subject confirm this.
The highest tax rates have been reduced virtually everywhere in the EU Member States.
In more and more Member States private investment income is given much greater preference over income from employment because of the transfer to dual tax systems.
Excise duty is increasing ever further - on the one hand because of 'eco-taxes', which often enough have no ecological steering effect at all even in the absence of alternatives, but which quite frankly fleece budgets, and on the other hand because of the fact that value added taxes are constantly increasing and in more and more countries are approaching the top end of the agreed range.
Such a development is no accident.
It is the direct result of unchecked tax competition on a uniform internal market.
It should already be leading us to believe that the upward trend of corporate taxes within the EU is broadly eclipsing those in the whole of the OECD.
This means that tax rates here have clearly fallen more than in the OECD as a whole.
This also clearly shows that the many pressures of globalisation much and happily complained about are not taking effect here, but that there are home-made pressures created within the EU and therefore also pressures that could very easily be discreetly overcome if there was a desire to do so.
Very appropriately my original report included the call not only for a common consolidated corporate tax base, which it does, of course, support, but also for EU-wide minimum tax rates on corporate profits, which should no longer be exceeded by any country thereafter.
Only minimum tax rates of this kind actually offer the opportunity to stop the upward trend in corporate taxes somewhere along the way.
My report included the call for stronger EU-wide taxation of assets and financial transactions, the call to relieve labour income explicitly in the lower and middle classes and finally the call to reverse the fatal trend of transferring direct taxes increasingly to indirect taxes and reinstigate the counter-trend.
Only a fraction of all these calls have unfortunately been retained after the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Instead, my report bursts into a song of praise for tax competition in complete ignorance of the fatal consequences of this supposedly healthy tax competition for the revenue side of EU budgets and therefore for the situations in which millions of Europeans also find themselves.
Such changes made to the report unfortunately show very clearly whose interests are in fact close to the heart of the majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and especially those of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, because it is very obvious who profits from the prevailing tax regimes in the EU.
We have now once again put forward our most important requests as amendments in plenary.
Should they fail to secure a majority there too, my group will vote against the report.
Another taxation policy in the EU that minimises the social contrasts instead of constantly reinforcing them - as the present taxation policy does - would indeed be possible and would be demanded as a matter of urgency.
This would, however, imply that the prevailing policy in the European Commission and also in the individual Member States does in fact consist of considering the interests of the majority of Europeans according to their guiding principle, instead of serving as they have done to date as executors of the interests of the Ã©lite of society.
It will simply give rise to even greater parliamentary and extra-parliamentary pressure.
We shall continue to strive precisely against this pressure so that eventually the inexpressible rhetoric of socially intolerable relationships - which characterises most reports and which also now characterises this report on taxation - is no longer capable of winning a majority in this House either.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really pleased to be able to discuss with you the contribution of taxation and customs policy to the Lisbon Strategy.
A major priority of the European Union is to improve its competitiveness while preserving its social model.
Taxation policy has a major role to play in helping to achieve growth and employment objectives.
I welcome the essential message of your report, which is one of support for the Commission's initiatives in the tax area.
In particular, it encourages increased efforts concerning the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), the home state taxation pilot scheme proposal, the strategy ensuring better coordination of Member States' tax systems particularly in the field of exit taxation and cross-border loss relief, the work undertaken by the joint transfer pricing forum, the strategy to combat tax fraud, the VAT package, the reduced VAT rates on labour intensive services and environmental taxation.
All these files are extremely important.
They are the core of the Commission's approach to tax policy and many of them have been discussed in several committees of the European Parliament.
It is clear that European companies deserve a system of corporate taxation adapted to the degree of their actual and potential economic integration at the scale of their cross-border activities in Europe.
This is one of the keys to their future competitiveness.
It is also essential that other direct tax obstacles find a solution by coordination and not only through costly litigation.
There is only one area where I cannot follow you.
This is in paragraph 17 of the Wagenknecht report, as it stands now, where it asks for the suppression of minimum rates for excise duties and the replacement of current Community legislation in this domain by a code of conduct.
We discussed these elements in this House when dealing with the proposal on alcohol taxation and, with all due respect, I have got to say that the Commission has not changed its mind.
Community legislation on excise duties in general has an important role to play in order to reduce distortion in the internal market, to protect public health and to gear consumption patterns towards more environmentally sustainable behaviour.
The Commission strongly believes that minimum rates are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market by providing a safety net for Member States which ensures that all Member States actually apply excise duties and that the levels are meaningful.
I hope that the tabled amendment which aims at changing paragraph 17 will be endorsed by a majority of Members.
I would like to conclude with three messages.
Firstly, you all know that my services are working very hard to table a legislative proposal on the CCCTB which I intend to present to you after the summer break in 2008.
Secondly, in the VAT field, the Commission fully supports the Portuguese Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the VAT package and also to advance substantially the broader debate on VAT rates before the end of the year.
We can also work to ensure adoption of the proposal for prolonging certain derogations in new Member States on reduced VAT rates.
In addition, we will continue our intense efforts to combat VAT fraud and we will soon come forward with a proposal on the VAT treatment of financial services that will provide the sector with more legal certainty and with modernised rules.
Thirdly, we remain committed to a system of minimum rates in excise duties in order to reduce distortion and to promote fair competition in the internal market to contribute to the protection of public health and to the environment.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, sometimes, in this Chamber, we cannot really see the political differences between groups, but, on this issue, the difference is very visible, because I could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned.
I respect the work she has done on this report, but on this issue we have totally different views on what should be done by the Commission.
First of all, this report is about the Lisbon Strategy and what we should do to restore Europe's global competitiveness.
This is really the only way to guarantee European welfare and the welfare of our citizens.
Without taxation, this is impossible.
Taxation has a crucial role to play in this respect, in bringing competitiveness to Europe.
We must remember that overall tax levels in Europe are still above the OECD average.
In order to achieve a lower level of taxation in Europe, we need to create an environment conducive to investment.
We need more investments, more growth, and more, flourishing businesses in Europe.
Healthy tax competition has a beneficial role in this respect.
This is an economic, market-based control mechanism against rampant political decisions.
If we have fruitful tax competition in Europe, governments cannot put obstacles in the way of the single market.
That is what we want: a genuine single market without tax-made obstacles.
On the other hand, there is no evidence that fruitful tax competition would erode tax bases.
The total tax revenue has remained remarkably stable, thanks to increased economic activity.
However, the existence of 27 different tax regimes creates problems, particularly for European SMEs, which are so important to this growth.
According to a 2004 EC taxation survey, compliance for small SMEs costs about 2.6% of their sales and 31% of taxes paid.
So, one third of all the tax goes to compliance.
The high proportionate amount of tax compliance for small companies is a big obstacle, and that is why we need to do our best to call for cross-border loss relief, simplified customs procedures, one-stop-shop schemes for VAT, home states taxation pilot projects and so on.
We support everything that the Commission has done in this respect.
Finally, industry wishes to see a well-managed and simple tax administration system.
We need to resolve the problems of transfer pricing, loss offsetting EU-wide and avoiding double taxation, and to lower our compliance costs.
We welcome the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) proposal, and the fact that the Commission is stable and brings us the proposal on CCCTB, because loss-relief is only a temporary thing.
In the end, we need a consolidated corporate tax base.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Wagenknecht had the initiative to draft a report, which is proof of the political courage it took to highlight the redistributive and social dimension of taxation policy.
This document is one of the more important pieces of evidence showing that the debate on taxation policy may become Europe-wide.
The commitment to meet the Lisbon targets, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the obligation to administer and redistribute tax revenue so that it meets cohesion and employment objectives, and the completion of the internal market - all these are proof enough of a political aim.
The taxation policies of Member States can no longer be based exclusively and solely on national criteria: dialogue on taxation is becoming necessary to promote greater tax coordination throughout Europe.
Given such a dialogue, which has enabled substantial cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups, we have concentrated on the following fundamental points.
Firstly, on the issue of tax competition, we do not believe that the object ought to be to curb the principle of tax competition, for this would be tantamount to censuring the policies of certain Member States.
Owing to the lack of common rules on tax policy issues, tax competition with its offers and counter-offers of low tax rates creates problems.
As is also the case for the other sectors of the internal market, however, tax competition can ensure competitiveness and improve the productivity of national economies, as well as that of Europe as a whole, provided that the rules curbing the growth of harmful competition obtain.
The second point we focused on was the relation between direct and indirect taxation.
A trend has recently been noticed in Member States to increase indirect taxation, in most cases to cover their fiscal deficits.
This is a burden for consumers, however, and the market remains unmonitored.
The aim of this report is to find safety measures facilitating a balanced combination of direct and indirect taxes.
We are in favour of a revision of the system of VAT and special consumption taxes.
This should not mean that it is replaced by a code of conduct not binding on all the Member States.
Commissioner, we are aware of the efforts of the Commission and the problems at Ecofin.
Nonetheless, we as members of the European Parliament must above all closely cooperate with national parliaments to debate this major fiscal policy.
I would also like to stress the importance of this report as the strategic line we should follow in making reforms in the economies of the European Union.
Regretfully, the representatives of Portugal are not with us today, when we are discussing this very important issue.
What are the main points of our report?
The main point is that in view of changes in the economic environment we must carry out an overhaul not only of our plants and enterprises, but also of the instruments of our fiscal policy.
When referring to the Lisbon Strategy, we usually speak about expenditure policy; very rarely do we consider taxation policy.
Without paying due attention to taxation policy we would not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
What issues are to be considered?
First of all, it is necessary to look into the ways of distributing the tax burden between the producer and the consumer.
Moreover, we cannot ignore the fact that there is one more group of people - those living on capital income.
This is known as private equity.
How do we distribute the tax burden?
This is one of the challenges presented by the new economic environment.
Another very important question is: how do we encourage structural reforms?
Structural reforms cannot be implemented without introducing new enterprises, as people are not able to leave their existing jobs for new work places, which could create grounds for social discontent.
New enterprises can be created only with beneficial taxation conditions.
This is one of the main points of our document.
The issue that needs to be considered is: what level of tax policy coordination is needed among the Member States?
We are in favour of competitive taxes and we do not support the idea of introducing minimum rates.
This is because each country has its own specific economic structure and national expenditure policy.
Taxation policy must be in line with expenditure policy, but we are definitely in favour of the coordination of tax base policy and support the Commission on that matter.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I emphatically agree with Mrs Kauppi.
The disagreements between the groups here in the European Parliament on the subject of taxation policy are becoming clearer and clearer.
We must give this debate much more serious attention over the next few months.
I should like to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for the significant effort they have made in order to bring this report to a good conclusion.
A good conclusion - but not for us.
As a Group we shall not be able to accept this report in its final form.
It has some pleasant aspects, for example it describes and demands the important step towards a consolidated tax base for corporate taxes.
This is an important first step.
However, this must be accompanied by similarly clear declarations as regards harmonising minimum tax rates, because otherwise it will lead to unchecked tax competition, specifically in this area.
We also see problems under Article 17, where the committee has unfortunately clearly stated that it is against minimum tax rates for excise duty.
This, too, is unfortunately in line with the votes of recent weeks and we greatly regret this.
We support the group here.
We believe that we have to achieve harmonisation in European excise duty and that this harmonisation must be strengthened, if anything, because otherwise we will have unchecked tax competition in excise duty.
We also think it is a problem that far too little is being said on the subjects of climate change and eco-taxes.
I, too, wish to disagree with the rapporteur here.
I believe that eco-taxes are an important instrument for meeting these challenges of climate change.
We have to do much more in this respect.
I do, however, think that the approach of focussing on nuclear energy here, or on 'clean' forms of energy, is wrong.
It is important that we focus clearly on energy saving and energy efficiency.
These are the important answers.
When we look at the challenges facing us in the refurbishment of buildings and in the field of transport, it seems that we can genuinely meet the Kyoto aim of energy saving if a great deal more is done here.
Tax policy can make an important contribution to achieving greater energy savings and, greater energy efficiency and to genuinely meeting the challenges of climate change.
Unfortunately, this report does not reflect this position.
As I have already announced, we shall therefore not be voting in favour of this report.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, our group endorses Mrs Wagenknecht's views in this matter, even if they are in conflict with the opinions of the majority on the Committee.
The European Union will not be the world's leading knowledge- and technology-based economy in 2010.
It is not, however, due to tax systems, which have continually been reformed in ways that favour big companies, that the target under the Lisbon Strategy is unrealisable.
Big companies choose transfer pricing and finding of a home for their capital as options enabling them to avoid tax.
In this they are aided by the tax havens and offshore financial centres operating in the Member States of the EU, both blots on the EU's moral landscape.
According to the rapporteur, the Commission in its communication does not consider the effects of taxation on income distribution.
The system of flat tax which some Member States apply favours those on large incomes, while progressive income tax promotes social equality.
The Lisbon Strategy cannot be implemented in a manner which would eat away at the financial basis of the welfare society and which would be grossly unfair.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, it says this is a contribution, but it is more like a recipe, a recipe for the harmonisation of yet more taxation, which I quote here and there from the report: '27 different tax systems' are an 'impediment'; 'coordination of Member States' fiscal policy'; 'calls on the Member States to ... ensure greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden'; 'supports' the Commission in gearing 'fiscal policy towards ... environmental objectives'; 'increase in fuel taxes'; 'establish a pan-European ... corporate tax base'.
In short, it is back to the failed policies of the 1970s.
In any case, even the British cannot get it right for all of our country.
North is not the same as the south, Wales and Scotland are different to the south-east - and that was under Gordon Brown as Chancellor for 10 years.
Surely you listened to him; after all, you did at Lisbon last week when, as Prime Minister, you let him keep the red lines, did you not?
Or did you?
Later in the report, it talks about 'EU-wide coordination' of 'direct taxation'.
In the UK, we thought we had been promised that harmonised taxes, especially income tax, would never come.
Now, here it is in a report.
It is a bit like the Reform Treaty.
Gordon Brown keeps on saying it is not a constitution, when all the EU leaders say it is: ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, JosÃ© Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Angela Merkel, even our own President of President said so in this Chamber a short while ago.
So why do you not get Gordon Brown to tell the truth to the British people?
Harmonise that message!
Now, that is harmonisation I would go along with.
But you dare not do that to the British people because, when they are told the plain unvarnished truth, they will vote with their feet, right out of the EU, taking their annual EU contributions of EUR 18 billion of their own taxpayers' money with them.
What price harmonised taxes then?
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (RO) The importance of reviewing the contribution that the fiscal and customs policies could bring to the development of the Lisbon Strategy cannot be questioned.
For this reason, but not only, the objective of the document we examine today, namely the Wagenknecht report, to evaluate the contribution of policies applied to the fields specified for achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives, is salutary.
It could not be otherwise, since the Lisbon Strategy proposes generous objectives, such as promoting economic growth and designing policies that would allow European companies to create more and better jobs.
Nevertheless, reading the report, I was surprised, as a citizen of a recently acceded country, at the impression that it addresses a Union made up only of countries with developed economies, or rather, with equally developed economies, which is not true.
It is very probable for some of the measures proposed not to have beneficial results for the less developed economies, taking into account that the general laws of the single competitive market favour strong economies, to the disadvantage of the weaker ones.
Due to lack of time, I will not expand on this subject, but I consider that, in order for the report's objectives to have beneficial results in the economies of all 27 countries, not 25, as specified in the text, it is necessary to perform the comparative review of their economies and, according to the results, to adopt a set of actions that would create equal conditions for developing the effects proposed by the project.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the report on the table today demonstrates, once again, the relentless attack on Member States that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes.
I do not accept that low corporation tax leads to unfair tax competition.
I believe that ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the tax policy mix of a fully functioning single market.
Where is the Commission's evidence to prove that CCCTB will not hamper EU competitiveness?
Where is the proof to say that it will benefit EU competitiveness?
Why is it that countries with low tax, low unemployment and high growth are being attacked by the Commission?
I do not understand it.
It is absolutely farcical for the Commission to say that setting a tax base will not eventually set a tax rate, because that is already what the larger Member States are saying.
It does not stand up to any kind of scrutiny.
Attempts by large Member States to giftwrap tax harmonisation in the flowery paper of CCCTB will not be accepted by Ireland or other Member States.
The fact of the matter is that it is not the right of Ireland, or any other Member State, to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State.
The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies; rather, the EU's competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies.
I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition, not tax harmonisation.
How is it that a country like Ireland, and other Member States, which changed radically their tax policies and became successful economies, are now under attack?
What is the attractiveness of a country like Ireland, Commissioner, if you bring in this system and eventually bring in tax harmonisation?
Because that is exactly what it is, and the only way tax will go is up.
It has already been said, by people within the Commission, that they want to see a tax regime more or less in the middle of what it is at the moment, which is approximately in the low 20%.
What would be the attractiveness of Ireland or other peripheral countries?
There would be not attractiveness, just high unemployment in the long...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, the report we have in front of Parliament today rightly states that tax competition in the EU has led, and continues to lead, to EU-wide economic gains by way of a dynamic corporate environment.
The CCCTB could just as easily lead to a less competitive EU and should not be supported, in my view.
The EU needs to be responsive to an ever-changing global economy.
Modern competitive economies need to be flexible to meet the changing requirements of new products and services.
The CCCTB will undermine this flexibility for a number of reasons.
An EU-wide corporation tax base will be inflexible and hinder an individual country's ability to decide its own legal fiscal strategy, based on its particular circumstances.
The CCCTB's proponents assert that each Member State will retain its autonomy to determine its national tax rate - but will they?
Is the CCCTB not the thin end of the wedge?
If the CCCTB is optional, it merely increases the number of bases available to companies and makes the system even more complex.
Domestic tax law offers certainty to business.
A system that is applied in a number of Member States may lead to differences over how the provisions are interpreted, bringing about uncertainty for business.
In the remaining time available to me, I can simply make some bullet points.
First, taxation is a matter of national sovereignty for each Member State.
The right to choose the level of public spending and the funding of such expenditure is a basic function of national democratic process.
It is necessary to protect the flexibility of tax policy in rewarding enterprise and the creation of jobs and growth in the economy.
A single base would do away with flexibility.
There is no evidence to suggest that a common consolidated corporate tax base will address issues such as competitiveness, compliance costs for companies, transfer pricing and so on.
It would not simplify EU tax issues, as the so-called 'optional system' proposed would add another layer, as I have just said.
The harmonisation of the tax base would lead to pressure on national tax rates.
Such harmonisation will only increase the attractiveness of non-EU corporate locations.
The Code of Conduct on business taxation addressed harmful tax competition.
Different tax rates in EU Member States are not harmful.
I would ask the Commissioner, when he brings forward these proposals, as he suggests, next year, to please bear this in mind.
Member States like Ireland have already given...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank our rapporteur here, for the quality of the work she has done and her efforts to come up with a text that, unfortunately, she does not seem totally satisfied with.
Taxation is clearly an essential complement to the construction of a true internal market, if you want the market to be more than just a free-trade area where any form of tax and social dumping is permitted.
The completion of the internal market therefore requires the harmonisation of certain rules on taxation and in the first place calls for the creation of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.
The report put before us today opens the door to this, and I am pleased about this.
I note that a number of fellow Members are very actively against this plan, in the name of what they describe as 'fair' competition.
Personally I believe that free, undistorted competition - and I am not a frenzied advocate of this type of competition - requires a certain amount of transparency as regards the rules.
I am surprised that countries that have benefited from massive contributions from the European Union, in the name of solidarity, are today rejecting this step, which would be an important step forward in terms of solidarity, competition and transparency.
Taxation is also a formidable tool that the EU must use if it is to implement its chosen strategies, because it does not have all that many tools.
It can have a positive impact on the cleanest energies or to achieve...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(SV) Mr President, this is a report that is heavily influenced by the compromise between the PPE-DE and the ALDE.
I believe it is largely a balanced report.
The Member States' responsibility for taxation policies is laid down, whilst there are a number of taxes that would benefit from greater EU coordination.
In the rapporteur's original proposal, there was thorough coordination with a strong emphasis on higher levels of redistribution.
That cannot be a way to make Europe grow or to create new jobs.
In the globalised world in which we live, it is not higher taxes that Europe needs.
Instead, I think that we who live in high-taxation countries should look at other models, such as a flatter tax.
In general, taxes should be lowered on work and raised on harmful consumption.
For example, specific environmental taxes should be introduced, as well as reasonable excise duties on alcohol and tobacco, for example, as the Commissioner says.
Here the EU must be able to act with greater accord.
This is a politically sensitive issue - we have heard that here and I am well aware of it - but it is nonetheless necessary, in my opinion.
If we are to resolve the major climate and energy challenges that we are facing, it would be irresponsible of us to rule out controlling fiscal instruments.
It is possible to achieve high growth, with high environmental and energy taxes, and at the same time reduce the overall tax burden.
Any doubters can look at the policy of the centre-right government in my home country, Sweden, if I can be allowed to be a little patriotic at the end of this debate.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in taking the floor in a debate devoted to the impact of taxation and customs policies on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that some of the suggestions relating to the Member States' tax systems that are contained in Mrs Wagenknecht's report will not have a positive impact on economic growth and employment in EU countries.
Firstly, moving away from tax competition and attempts to standardise solutions in the area of corporate income tax run counter to the principle of tax sovereignty for EU Member States.
Secondly, lowering corporate tax rates while simultaneously doing away with any associated tax relief will not just fail to bring about a reduction in budget income from this tax; it will, in fact, increase it substantially.
This is confirmed by the situation in my country, Poland, where the corporate tax rate has been substantially reduced, yet receipts from this tax are greater with each year that passes.
Thirdly and finally, in this situation I consider the report's suggestions relating to coordination and tax systems, including direct taxation, to be hazardous steps that will certainly not help to implement the Lisbon Strategy.
(HU) Thank you Mr President.
What are we talking about?
One of the key issues is whether we are a match - in terms of competitiveness - for the external tax competition, in other words for tax competition from outside the European Union, and we should not be looking for scapegoats within the European Union.
Otherwise, as several of my colleagues have stated, capital will leave the whole of the EU.
What do we agree with in this taxation policy?
We agree that it should facilitate job creation, in other words promote labour; we agree that we should help small and medium-sized enterprises, since these enable people to remain where they are, they help to reinforce families, and also to create jobs.
I also agree with its social policy measures, which will help tackle the demographic challenge in the European Union.
What do we disagree with?
We disagree with over-taxing ourselves in areas relating to health, the environment or social policy instead of pursuing an anti-inflationary policy and seeking to respond appropriately to the challenges of competition.
The other thing that we must bear in mind is that the European Union has expanded and become highly heterogeneous.
We expect everyone to maintain budgetary discipline in their independent fiscal policy, but at the same time we want to minimise the instruments for doing this.
If convergence is our primary goal, then in indirect taxation for example, such as excise duties, if we are to get anywhere, we should be obliging not only countries operating at around the minimum rate to achieve convergence, but also countries that apply much higher rates.
This is why in several instances we have proposed replacing the current approach based exclusively on a minimum rate of excise duty by some kind of 'code of conduct' steering Member States along the same path.
As regards common capital or the common tax base, I would like to say this: it would be a serious problem if this entailed punishing competitive countries, if the minimum rate were to be introduced.
I am also apprehensive about what will happen as regards movement of capital when the common tax base is established.
Will it not mean that profits from subsidiaries in the new Member States, for example, will constantly be reclassified in the accounts as profits of the parent company instead of being invested locally?
Combating fraud is also very important, and I wish the Commission good luck with this.
It is on the right track, since the most important thing is to regularise the black economy and take steps to combat crime.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(PL) Mr President, the main aim of the Lisbon Strategy is to increase the competitiveness of national economies.
A high level of competitiveness enables economic growth to be accelerated and new jobs to be created, and makes it possible to fund important social aims.
Unfortunately the current tax system in EU Member States does not favour implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
The burdens placed on employment law and economic activity are too great, tax rates are too differentiated, and the regulations are too complicated.
At the same time the tax system is burdened with an excessive number of functions and tasks - economic, fiscal, social or environmental.
For taxes to aid competitiveness, they must above all create incentives to work, to develop economic activities and to innovate.
To this end taxes, especially direct taxes, should be set at a moderate level, avoiding unnecessary differentiation of rates and excessive progression.
Since direct taxes exert a stronger, negative impact on production and employment, we must make greater use of indirect taxes when planning budgetary income.
In relation to the debate, Mr President, I wish to express my concern that there is too much ideology and politics, and too little real economic knowledge.
The best example is the concepts that are used here, such as fiscal dumping or social dumping.
There is no objective standard for taxation, and it is therefore not possible to accuse those states that apply low company taxation levels of fiscal dumping.
(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on a difficult and fundamentally successful operation to introduce the necessary amendments to the initial text, which was the original address.
Initially it was being suggested to us not only that the European Union should get involved in establishing the principles of corporation tax, but also that these taxes should be raised, against world trends.
It is a good thing that we have avoided this.
For similar reasons we should take a critical view of the support evinced in the text for tax base harmonisation.
A Community tax base is a blow to tax competition in the EU, with all the associated negative consequences.
Its introduction would limit Member States' efforts to optimise corporation taxation against the Lisbon targets.
In political terms this would burden the EU, which, in its own properly conceived interest, should refrain from trying to influence the shape of tax systems in Europe.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this debate has been very interesting and most of the contributions have been encouraging.
Like you, I am persuaded that our efforts to dismantle tax barriers in the internal market are worthwhile sustaining.
I am particularly grateful for your support concerning the important project of the CCCTB and I look forward to your forthcoming own-initiative report on the common base.
As far as some of the critical remarks are concerned, I intend to send a personal letter to those honourable Members of Parliament who have expressed their objection, which I appreciate.
It would be fair to answer them in written form as I do not want to take too much of your time.
I am pleased that most of you share my view that taxation policy has a major role to play in attaining many of the EU's policy objectives, and in particular growth, employment, competitiveness and sustainability.
Thank you for your attention and for your support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank many people for keeping within their time and also thank everyone, I hope, for their understanding, which has enabled us to close the debate five minutes early and therefore to be able to listen to everyone, instead of what happens on other occasions, when before an important debate or a vote we are unable to listen to what our colleagues have to say.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - We all ought to agree that the simultaneous existence of 27 national taxation systems seriously hampers the blooming of the full advantages of our single market.
Moreover, there is indeed a genuine opportunity to reinvigorate the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy through EU-wide taxation and customs measures that would make the Union a more attractive place to invest and work.
In extending and deepening more competitive markets, we should use all tools available, including more investment-friendly fiscal and custom policies, in order to boost employment, R&D investments and the development of environmentally friendly technologies.
In this respect, we warmly welcome the own-initiative report drawn up by Ms Wagenknecht, which aims at setting up the necessary fiscal framework to encourage risk and innovative investments in order to achieve the objectives of growth and employment.
The advantages of simplifying and harmonising the taxation systems in the Union as a whole are obvious as not only it will help reaching the Lisbon objectives - through greater tax incentives for investments - but, furthermore, it will help achieve EU market integration by lifting remaining obstacles to the completion of the single market.

Results of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lisbon, 18-19 October 2007) (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon.
May I give a warm welcome to the President of the EU Council and Prime Minister of Portugal, JosÃ© SÃ³crates.
A very warm welcome this morning to the European Parliament!
An equally warm welcome, of course, to the President of the European Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, and thank you to him for his work at the European summit.
Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the debate I should like - and I do not wish to jump ahead at all - to thank the Portuguese Presidency sincerely for its enormous input and for the success achieved on Thursday night at around 1 a.m. when it approved the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
This is a great result for the European Union and a great result for us all.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to add that without the European Parliament, we would not be where we are today.
This is also a great result for us all because the Treaty was and is the top priority for the European Parliament if we are to come out ahead and be victorious in this Treaty.
With these congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency, and also to the Commission - and I see Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m here, who has also made a significant contribution, next to the President of the Commission - it gives me great joy now to hand over to the President of the EU Council, JosÃ© SÃ³crates.
A warm welcome to the European Parliament!
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to dedicate my first words today to the memory of a friend of mine.
In memory of MEP Fausto Correia, who died a few days ago.
He died young.
His death is of course a great loss not only to the European Parliament but also to the Portuguese Socialist Party.
Fausto Correia was a man of fine political and human qualities.
You all had the opportunity to get to know him.
He was an intelligent politician, open and always committed to noble European ideals.
But I would like to lay special emphasis here on his human qualities of generosity, companionship and tolerance.
Indeed, it is our human qualities that give meaning to our political life.
His passing is a personal loss to me, the loss of an old friend, with whom I shared many moments of my life, and I will miss him very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, when I presented the programme of the Portuguese Presidency to this plenary three months ago, I stated very clearly what would be the main challenge - the top priority - of the Portuguese Presidency: to draw up and reach an agreement on the new Treaty, putting an end to the six years of impasse in the institutional debate in which the European Union was immersed.
Today, therefore, it is with great satisfaction that I address the house to present the agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Conference on 18 October.
This agreement was the basis for the new Treaty of Lisbon.
The Treaty will be signed on 13 December in the city whose name it will bear.
The Portuguese Presidency began with the task of transforming the mandate that we inherited from the German Presidency - which as I have said before was of exemplary clarity and precision - but to transform that mandate into a new Treaty.
That was our mission.
The agreement we have reached confirms that the method and timetable we set out at the start of our Presidency were right.
It was necessary - as I told you here at the start of the Presidency - to make the most of the June Council to endeavour to complete the Treaty not in December, as some advocated, but in October, at the informal Council, and we were right.
The truth is that we held the fastest Intergovernmental Conference in the history of the European Union on a treaty revision.
We began on 23 July and completed it on 18 October.
When the history of this Treaty is written we will understand better the importance of that political decision, of not leaving until the end of the year the task that we were able to complete earlier.
Europe needed a quick agreement and that is what it got.
Europe needed a sign of confidence and that is what it got.
Europe needed to turn towards the future and that is what it has done.
We worked speedily with all the Member States which, without exception, showed a constructive spirit and a will to overcome the remaining difficulties.
This enabled us to present a full text of the Treaty on 3 October, and brought us much closer to our goal.
The issues that remained for the Lisbon Summit were limited, though obviously politically sensitive.
In this context, our strategy was to try to reach an agreement on the first day of the summit.
This seemed to us not only possible but also highly desirable as it would send a strong signal to Europe.
The signal that the EU is capable of taking rapid decisions, even decisions that everyone acknowledges are difficult.
Moreover, it was very important that we should be able to resolve these institutional issues on the first day of the informal Council and, on the second day, right after that decision, to discuss globalisation and how Europe should tackle global issues.
In Lisbon it was therefore possible to reach agreement on the following issues, enabling us to finalise the agreement on the Treaty:
First the Ioannina clause, and in the agreement a solution was reached at two levels:
a declaration relating to the system for decision-making in the Council by a qualified majority that clarifies the actual Ioannina safeguard mechanism;
in addition a protocol that determines how this mechanism for consensus in the European Council may be amended or revoked.
As I have had the opportunity to say before, the Ioannina issue, as I saw it in the agreement at the last Council, required this clause to be mandatory by law, but not to be in the Treaty.
The solution that we adopted, a declaration plus a protocol guaranteeing that the decision on Ioannina can be amended only by consensus, seemed to us to be the solution that was most true to the spirit of the last agreement.
Thus we provided guarantees on the Ioannina compromise without undermining the integrity of the process of qualified-majority decision-making.
There was also a need to resolve a political issue regarding the number of Advocates-General in the Court of Justice.
A declaration was agreed to the effect that the Council would approve any request from the Court of Justice for the number of Advocates-General to be increased by three (eleven instead of eight).
In that case, Poland will have a permanent Advocate-General and no longer take part in the rotation system, while the existing rotation system will involve the rotation of five Advocates-General instead of the current three.
As for the appointment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, we agreed on a declaration to the effect that the European Parliament should take part in the appointment process even in the first stage, from January 2009, through appropriate contacts.
The Conference also approved a declaration clarifying the delimitation of competences between the Union and the Member States as provided for in the Treaties.
Finally, the issue of the composition of the European Parliament.
As you know, Article 9a of the Treaty on European Union has been amended to state that the number of MEPs shall not exceed seven hundred and fifty, plus the President, i.e. 751, maintaining degressive proportionality.
Two declarations were attached to that amendment:
one stating that the additional seat in the European Parliament will be attributed to Italy;
the other guaranteeing that the European Council will give its political agreement on the composition of the European Parliament, based on the proposal from Parliament itself.
The Council therefore accepted the criteria put forward by Parliament and went ahead with what it considered an acceptable adjustment, with a view to adapting the current framework during the 2009-2014 period.
Apart from the issues that I have mentioned, the concern of the Portuguese Presidency was also to build into the Treaty those rules and exception clauses that were in the mandate, naturally respecting the positions of the Member States that wanted to obtain them, but always concerned to avoid detracting from the Community decision-making process and the overall coherence of the Treaty.
Thus we have a new Treaty.
It is a new Treaty and a good Treaty.
A Treaty that resolves the crisis of the past and puts Europe in a position to set its eyes on the future.
