If you ask me, you would be shooting the Commission in the foot and, in my opinion, you would be shooting yourself in the foot more so than the Commission and this is not helpful.
In short, we are giving our wholehearted support to reform and we hope from the bottom of our hearts that the deadline is met.
Since Commissioner Kinnock is present today, I would appreciate it if he could confirm whether he is on target with his staff and people.
That is a mammoth task.
It is our task to give each other very critical guidance, and to ensure that reform is brought about.
We cannot see how these factual questions, which do not show up any defects, could contribute to this debate, unless there were ulterior motives towards the Commission from the start.
As I understand it, the salto mortale of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats could be interpreted as a declaration of support.
Mr President, Commissioner, it would naturally be rather difficult if Parliament were to take over the European Commission' s personnel policy.
In my opinion, we would then be far removed from the efficiency required by the Commission.
Because when you made your proposals back in January, and we studied them carefully, it was clear that the Commission' s appointment policy - and that is how we put it then - is a matter for the Commission and we should not interfere with it, unless there is obvious cause for this.
We continue to endorse the guidelines you gave at the time for this personnel and appointment policy.
First and foremost, appointments must be based on the candidate' s merits.
This is how it was described in your document and I think that this clause should be retained.
It is clear that we continue to support this.
A candidate' s aptitude for managing an office is one of the key aspects, and I heard you emphasise this in your reply a moment ago. You made it clear once again what procedures are followed when appointing top officials.
You have also already stated in your action plan that a geographical balance should be kept, which was, in fact, what the question was about.
This too seems logical to me, yet it would not be beneficial if we were to rely on this provision too much and be too strict about it. After all, if you were to do this, in other words, if you were to weigh it up extremely carefully, then I think personnel policy would become impossible in the long-run and you would be very far-removed from the efficiency required in this type of matter.
On behalf of my Group, I would say that this question was somewhat superfluous.
One can enter into a large-scale discussion on the decisions taken today with regard to the nationalities of the people who have been moved, appointed or who have left.
This discussion would be meaningless. The question which should be raised is whether or not this benefits the functioning of the Commission and have the procedures laid down by the Commission been followed?
This is the question we need to ask ourselves.
Whether the person involved is Dutch or of any other nationality is of little relevance in the great scheme of things.
What I do like, Commissioner, is that you, in your information, provide evidence of a transparent policy.
I also welcome the fact that, based on your information, it appears that there are no major imbalances.
I feel this should be acknowledged.
We have been given important information, in my opinion, and I would therefore like to say by way of conclusion: let us not stand in the way of the Commission' s reform process but support it instead.
We should not complicate matters - especially with regard to personnel policy, which is one of the most difficult topics - by asking questions which are not really relevant.
Mr President, in September the Commission adopted some excellent principles which were to be applied with regard to its staffing policy, and particularly in the appointment of senior officials, but let us now examine today' s appointments in the light of those fine principles.
I must enquire as to whether the panel actually interviewed the applicants, from whom the leader of the Institute for Future Studies was selected.
I somewhat doubt whether any lengthy interview process was involved in filling the post in which Mr Levi did so very well.
I would also like to mention that all the institutions should in fact adopt these rules concerning the appointment of senior officials, and we are finally able to say that the European Parliament has also adopted good principles regarding the appointment of senior officials, which must therefore take place very openly.
Let me make an observation regarding representation on a geographical basis. It is quite right that we should aim to move away from national quotas, but that should not mean we should have a hidden criterion that actually favours the notion of representatives of large Member States and major language groups in senior positions.
We must realise this.
Finally, let me say a word about equality. Commissioner Kinnock faithfully made a list of the Commission' s senior appointments and promotions, but, Commissioner, you did not say how many women were nominated for, or promoted to, these posts.
I would ask you to take a look at your list with your "gender policy spectacles" on and tell us the answer, because the Commission really has to set equality targets a lot higher than it has ever done before.
Vice-President Kinnock, there is a strange atmosphere in this Chamber.
The PPE Group' s question for an oral answer was to be one of the major debates of a part-session - and a passionate plea was made for the debate to be held in April - but, today, the PPE Group is I know not where, for it is certainly conspicuous by its absence from this Chamber.
It may be that the decisions you adopted this morning have in some way assuaged the Group' s thirst for knowledge, but this Chamber appears to be unusually empty for a debate on such a major issue.
I supported the submission of the question.
I have been wondering since September, Vice-President, how it could be that such objective, such perfect, such universally acceptable criteria of competence, merit and so forth were met solely, surprise surprise, by officials living in or originally from certain island countries, while these same qualities did not appear to be present in officials from other, more misshapen countries - boot-shaped countries, for example.
Let us forget the figures for a moment and focus on the functions.
The A1 grade covers a wide range of concepts: an official could hold an A1 post and have important duties, such as Director-General for Development, for the Press and the Media or other Directorate-Generals, or he could be an aide.
How can it be - and this is a question which I continue to ask - that these criteria of merit, surprise surprise, have only worked in favour of certain nationalities?
This is what is to be inferred from a careful examination which is not merely concerned with numbers.
I continue to ponder this question, Vice-President, as I ponder the question of the appointment of senior Commission officials - officials or chefs de cabinet - who then unexpectedly book a flight and, via some European airport, London rather than Malpensa, desert the Commission for the private sector.
I feel that this is also a question which, although it does not form part of our question for an oral answer, would merit a debate at another time in its own right.
Personally, I feel very strongly that there is a need for this.
Lastly, I feel that the Commission is making the mistake of giving Commission staff themselves too much say in the selection of new staff. It should retain its right to make such decisions and not delegate this task to its administrative staff.
Mr President, first of all Mr Dell' Alba is certainly right with the first part of his question.
The tone of the question when it was put seems very different from the tone that we are hearing now in the Chamber.
First of all, we have to say that the White Paper reforms are progressing.
They are progressing slowly but Rome was not built in a day and we must remember that.
We all know that there is a timetable - one that we have all agreed to and must be kept.
What I would like to address, before I look at the substance, is the question behind this question, - that is what we really have to look at here.
It strikes me - and I will not be quite as subtle as Mr van den Berg - that the tone of this question seems to be the same tone as the Stauner report, the original Stauner report that was comprehensively rejected within the Budget Control Committee - the same tone that was set in the explanatory statement which was rejected by Parliament as a whole.
We are all desperate to see reform but it will take time.
The new Commission has been in office for only seven months.
It was approved by the European Parliament by a huge majority.
The question we really have to ask here is not to the Commission but to the PPE Group as to the motivation behind the question.
It strikes me as being clearly politically motivated, trying to undermine the work done on reform, trying to shoot this new bird down before it has taken flight.
This is because there is an element within the PPE Group, and I do not include Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz in this, interested in wrecking the tactics of the Commission, wrecking Commission reform and wrecking the EU.
And the PPE Group is being hijacked by that element within the group.
I believe that this Commission is very open to taking on board some - I hope all - of Parliament' s concerns and criticisms, because we have criticisms too.
But there is a time and place for that and this will be when we look at Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz' response to the White Paper.
The PSE Group want to engage in a constructive debate because we are interested in the outcome of reform, not in scoring short-term political points that do nothing but damage the European Union.
Turning very quickly to the substance of the questions: in the Commission hearings the European Parliament asked for rotation of A1 and A2 posts and to end national flags on senior jobs.
The Commission has taken positive steps since they came into power, ensuring that appointments are made on the basis of merit.
Of course, in a multinational institution, we must be sensitive to national considerations but these must be seen within the medium and long term.
As the Commissioner said, you cannot take a snapshot halfway through.
We should be interested in checking systems and not checking individuals.
The role of the European Parliament is to keep the Commission on its toes.
We want to see appointments on merit but that does not mean interfering and questioning every single senior appointment.
I would like to make a quick point on improving the equal opportunities aspect of the Commission' s reform proposals.
Mrs Hautala' s question was very well put and we also would like an answer to that.
We do not currently think that the proposals go far enough in terms of gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities.
On parts 3 and 4 of this oral question I understand that the Conference of Presidents agreed on April 6 that these two questions should be removed.
That being the case, I would like to ask you, Mr President, to look into why the services had still not removed those parts today.
That is a serious problem.
The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead.
Mr Prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation.
Again, most of it looks at mobility but I would like to ask the Commissioner why the role of the new post, Director of the Economic and Political Council, was not advertised.
That is a post that we would like to have seen advertised.
Finally, I would like to ask the PPE Group to refrain from such politically motivated and unconstructive questions as we have here.
I am confident that Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz will not take that attitude when he responds to the White Paper, but please do not let your group be hijacked by a minority.
Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan.
I regret that I do not have any information on the question which you have addressed to the Presidency but, in any event, I will submit it so that you receive an adequate response.
Mr President, I also want to thank the Commissioner for his answer and, in common with other women, request the figures showing how posts are distributed between men and women.
Since the Commission delved into the details on 27 April, perhaps we can be told how many men and women there are in category A posts, not in category A posts generally, but broken down by grade, i.e. A1, A2, A3 and so on, for what is interesting is to see the figures broken down in that way.
More often than not, it turns out that there are no women at all in top posts.
And, in this connection, we could perhaps be informed about the composition of the panel - which should be an objective panel - in terms of gender. Perhaps in terms of country of origin, too, but in any case in terms of gender.
Who, in the end, is to evaluate the shortlist that has been mentioned?
More often than not, it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation.
Mr President, could I thank the honourable Members in all parts of the House for the constructive contributions they have made in the course of this debate.
Perhaps I could risk some superficiality, because of the time, by trying to answer the specific questions raised.
First of all Mr Harbour' s questions, which typically were perceptive and constructive, related to how far we thought that the commitment to the development of managerial skills and culture was being achieved.
I will just stipulate one or two points that are evidence of progress.
I would not claim they were perfect and this list is not exhaustive.
So far as training is concerned, which, as Mr Harbour knows, is fundamental to the kind of changes that we want to achieve, the comprehensive programme of training for all managers in the Commission which should continue over two years commences this month.
Secondly we are already embarked on the process of collecting mission statements from every Directorate-General.
Most have submitted theirs.
There is also the establishment of task assessments which we will do through a series of pilot schemes that will affect around one quarter of the Directorate-Generals in the first instance and then the compilation of job descriptions which will be undertaken over the period up to the end of July this year.
The process of evaluation of staff, and that of course includes managers at all levels, is being refined and will be introduced.
As Mr Harbour says, the role and activity of the Secretary-General in all of these activities and indeed in many others is crucial.
I believe that Mr O' Sullivan has a very strong commitment to the direction set out by the White Paper and will be a notable successor to his extremely talented and committed predecessor, Mr Trojan, who will take up a new post from the end of this month.
So far as empowering managers is concerned, the best instance we can give is that from May 1 we inaugurated the new internal audit service, the central financial service and we will shortly be having the first meeting of the Audit Progress Committee.
These are the first crucial steps in the decentralisation of financial control, which is of course critical to the empowerment of management at all levels in a money-handling institution.
Mr Harbour will be familiar with my view that as a consequence of making that central and measurable change, subject continually to examination, we will get a reverberating change of culture in the wider managerial style and operation of the House.
Finally, he is right to stipulate that team leadership, team working and team building are all critical to the effective operation of modern managerial skills.
We are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training, evaluation and the appointment system.
Obviously too, the consideration of probationary periods in contracts of appointment for managers will be a strong supplement to the direction which we want to take.
But to do that comprehensively will require amendments to the Staff Regulations and I am looking forward to the cooperation of Parliament and the Council in gaining the changes in Community legislation which are necessary to facilitate that further development.
Mr van den Berg was correct, and indeed kind and generous, in re-asserting the fact that the Commission must be responsible for its appointments and its personnel policies.
I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked.
I can only say that I welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information.
I am reminded that, in the hearings, correctly and forcefully, several Members of this House raised the question and indeed made assertive demands for de-flagging of senior posts, for the complete abandonment of formal or informal quotas and for the rotation of officials holding A1 and A2 posts.
Those are principles that I not only agreed with at the time, together with my colleagues in the Commission, but have actively been seeking to put into effect ever since.
If I can come to the point relating to new standards and outside posts, a point also raised absolutely correctly by Mr Dell' Alba, who has a question down on these matters and I am looking forward to answering it, I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the course of giving my attention to a specific case, which related to the departure of my own Chef de Cabinet, Mr Andrew Cahn, it became very obvious to me that the current arrangements relating to authorising the movement of permanent and temporary officials to outside employment do not have adequate clarity or consistency.
In practice, the course of action and rigorous scrutiny which I requested to be applied in the case of Mr Cahn meant that his case was dealt with very thoroughly and entirely properly.
I do not believe, however, that the Commission, or indeed other institutions, should have to rely on individual motivation by officials or by Commissioners and on rather ad hoc means of applying principles, which are, to say the least, rather generalised.
I therefore asked the Director-General of Administration and Personnel to produce a draft for rules that would take into account best practice in the administrations of Member States and of other international public bodies and to give precision to procedures.
Having such rules would obviously be the best means of ensuring transparency, consistency and practical guidance which would be in the interests of all parties, especially when, as Members have reminded us in the course of the debate, Member States and institutions are increasingly keen to encourage more exchange between national and EU administrations and between the public and private sectors.
Naturally, when I have a proposal to make for new and improved arrangements, I will put them to my colleagues in the Commission and subsequently report them to this House and the other institutions for consideration.
Can I take the opportunity of Mr Sterckx' s contribution to underline the point that I made earlier, a point which he wisely acknowledges, that no one, in consideration of the broad geographical balance to which the Commission is committed, should try to take a still-photograph of the profile of the staff at the Commission and represent that as in any way a permanent state of affairs.
A moving picture is the only one that tells the full story and the Commission is totally committed to ensuring that priority is given to merit and full and proper account is taken of geographical balance, which is essential in a multinational serving institution like the Commission.
On Mrs Hautala' s point, I would simply say that none of the appointments that have been announced today was the subject of a panel and there is a very straightforward legal reason for that.
Mr David O' Sullivan, for instance, will take up his post by rotation as provided for under the Staff Regulations and equally as provided for under the Staff Regulations, Mr Ricardo Levi is a temporary official and moves with his post to his new position.
So in legal, procedural and employment policy terms, the use of the panel system for promotion and appointment purposes was not required by the existing law in the case of appointments of that kind.
I think that also responds to the point raised by Mrs Morgan on that subject.
The question was also raised of women' s appointments.
Of the 25 very senior appointments that have been made by this Commission since last September, 4 have been of women officials.
That to me is modest.
Mrs Hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect.
I would only say that since that is nearly 20% of the total number of appointments, we are on target for this year' s commitment to ensure that we achieve at least a 20% advance in the number of women who are appointed.
In the course of the rest of the year I can say with certainty that velocity will at least be maintained.
Obviously, I would like to see it exceeded because there are a large number of highly capable women, as Mrs DybkjÃŠr pointed out to us, in the Commission, and we want to see that quality properly recognised.
So far as Mr Dell' Alba' s geographical excursion into islands and boot-shaped countries is concerned, as I say I am looking forward to answering his further question and doing so in great detail.
It is significant that the island country, the larger island country, secured in the course of these months under this Commission no additional appointments at A1 level by promotion.
The boot-shaped country obtained two such appointments - the boot-shaped country obtained 4 A2 promotions in this period and the big island obtained 5, of which, to the best of my knowledge, none came from Wales.
I hope that is of some reassurance to Mr Dell' Alba.
Mrs Morgan, inevitably asks from the wilds of Wales 'Why were there not any Welsh people?'
It is because, Mrs Morgan, whilst I am totally committed to geographical balance, this would mean in Wales having one North Walian and one South Walian or I would generate even more dissatisfaction in the country I love most.
But Mrs Morgan did raise intriguing questions about the questions which have been put down; doubtlessly they will be pursued.
I would like to say to Mrs DybkjÃŠr that in the comprehensive pursuit of our policy for equal opportunities, there will be evidence as the coming months and years pass, of us giving attention from the point of the invitation to applications, right through to initial appointment and promotions, to show that we are making serious efforts to secure substantial advances in the number of women of all ages and all grades who are employed in the Commission.
I can only ask honourable Members to wait until the physical evidence is available.
But if commitment and the strong and active dedication of members of the current College is anything to go by we will achieve success in all respects.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 17 May 2000.
Legal aspects of electronic commerce
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0106/2000) by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on certain legal aspects of Information Society services, in particular electronic commerce in the internal market ("Directive on electronic commerce") [14263/1/1999 - C5-0099/2000 - 1998/0325(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi)
Mr President, the recommendation which it is my honour to present, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, proposes that the plenary adopts the common position without amendments.
I have to say that this attitude has also been adopted by the various political groups.
Mr President, I would like to stress that, by approving the Council' s common position on electronic commerce tomorrow, this House will be showing a very great degree of political responsibility of great institutional significance.
Furthermore, by approving this directive, Parliament will be taking a decisive step in favour of the competitiveness of European businesses in the 'on line' economy and will be setting a milestone so that both consumers and companies will be able to operate in the internal market with the same guarantees and the same ease with which they operate in their domestic markets.
The directive ensures that companies and citizens are able to provide and receive information society services throughout the European Union, which will thereby become a genuinely border-free area.
European companies will be able to offer goods, services and information within the Union in accordance with the regulations of the Member State in which they are established and, therefore, in normalised circumstances, without being bound by 14 different sets of legislation.
In order to arrive at these results, the directive harmonises certain areas, in particular - to name the main ones - the place where the operators are established, their obligations in terms of transparency, the requirements for transparency in commercial communications, the conditions required for the conclusion and validity of electronic contracts, the responsibility of Internet intermediaries, the settlement of disputes, as well as the competences of national authorities.
In other areas, the directive is supported by the existing instruments intended to facilitate harmonisation and the mutual recognition of national legislations.
Mr President, the directive includes - and this is important - all information society services, both business to business and business to user services, such as those which allow electronic operations to take place - interactive telesales of goods and services, on-line 'shops' , for example; services which are offered free, such as those financed through advertising or sponsorship, the on-line press, on-line databases, on-line financial services, on-line professional services - lawyers, doctors or other professionals - leisure services such as video on demand, direct marketing and all services accessed via the Internet.
The directive is also - as I have already said - a great example of interinstitutional cooperation.
This directive is a magnificent example of teamwork by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Therefore, Parliament' s position on first reading, in particular its decisive support for the principle of the country of origin, was crucial to the Council in order to avoid the balance of the text being jeopardised.
In general, the common position follows the guidelines set by Parliament and, apart from some marginal cases, no significant amendments are added to the annex which provides for the exceptions relating to the principle I have mentioned. Balance is also maintained with regard to the provisions concerning consumer protection and the responsibility of intermediaries.
I would like to express my thanks, as rapporteur, for the cooperation of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the leaders of the various political groups - especially the support of Mrs Berger and Mr Harbour from my Group - and the other institutions.
The common position, therefore, maintains the balance between the various general objectives and the various interests, and we have not therefore tabled any amendments.
It is clearly not a perfect text, but we consider it to be a reasonable and acceptable one, and it is crucial that it is adopted as soon as possible.
I will not repeat - although it is true - that Internet time is much shorter than time as we have known it up to now.
We must also understand that this directive is a priority in terms of guaranteeing the development of electronic commerce.
We must take account of the globalisation of the economy and competition from US companies and the legal framework of the internal market which strives, as on the Internet, for a space with no internal boundaries.
All of these elements are Community assets as far as the competitiveness of European companies is concerned.
Lastly, the development of new technologies and market-related innovations make it essential that we establish a legal framework for the development of commerce, while, as this directive ensures, areas are set aside which are suitable for self-regulation and for the development of specific codes of conduct.
This directive, furthermore, will provide a significant stimulus to small- and medium-sized businesses so that they will embrace, without delay, this commerce without frontiers. They are currently not doing so because of the legal uncertainty involved in dealing with many different sets of legislation within Europe.
Lastly, several Member States are already legislating in this area and, without this directive, we could see a genuine fragmentation of the internal market.
This directive, furthermore, Mr President, is a milestone which will affect all Community initiatives which have an impact on electronic commerce.
The legal framework established by this directive will facilitate the adoption of other Community directives, such as the one on copyright, the distance marketing of financial services or the controversial Brussels Convention on jurisdiction, and will clearly help to remove the risk of incompatibility between these initiatives and the principles of the internal market.
Parliament intends to monitor closely the transposition and application of the directive in national legislations, and I have therefore included two recommendations, two reminders to the Commission, which I hope will be approved tomorrow, not within the framework of the directive, but within the framework of the legislative resolution; one on the procedures for the detection and withdrawal of illicit material, and another on the drafting of codes of conduct.
Lastly, Mr President - and with this I will end - it is symbolic that Parliament is approving this directive on the eve of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the declaration by Robert Schuman, in which he stated that Europe would not be created in an instant but through achieving specific objectives which would create genuine solidarity between citizens and businesses.
Fifty years ago, 'specific objectives' referred to the European Coal and Steel Community; today, as this directive points out, they refer to the information society.
For this reason, Mr President, I believe that tomorrow this Parliament will be worthy of congratulation, and this congratulation can also be extended to the other Community institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the rapporteur who, in my view, has done a quite excellent job on a very difficult subject.
The e-commerce directive is such a very difficult subject because it is a typical example of how runaway technological advances and market growth can outstrip legislation.
European legislative procedures happen to be particularly complex and the market is simply developing at a faster pace.
Another problem facing us when we had to consider this directive at both first and second reading was that we realised that in many areas EU harmonisation has not made enough progress yet, for much of what was said in the discussion of this draft directive in fact showed up serious weaknesses and major problems here.
By way of example let me just take the debate on the country of origin principle or, alternatively, the country of destination principle.
In both cases, both alternatives, we as the legislator looked rather like the Odysseus of ancient times negotiating his way between Scylla and Charybdis, quite simply because we will create injustices in either case, whether for the producer or for the recipient of the product or service.
We might also create other problems, which would later prove difficult to resolve in legal practice, for instance if a Portuguese judge suddenly has to apply German law, or indeed if a Spanish judge suddenly has to apply Italian law, in relation to a fairly simple case of secondary importance, simply because such combinations of circumstances could arise.
So I must admit that I am not entirely satisfied with all the points of the common position before us.
I still have criticisms about many of them.
On the other hand, at the moment we do not need a second reading consultation, and certainly not a conciliation procedure.
We must come to a rapid decision so that we can finally offer the users on this market a legal framework, even if, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, it may not be perfect in every way and may still have a number of weaknesses.
But that is why I also expect the European Commission to monitor the implementation of this directive carefully and, if this should prove necessary, to submit practical proposals for amending it during the current legislative term. I also believe that we may then have made further progress towards harmonising many areas of the law.
Let me just give you as an instance the forthcoming harmonisation of civil law.
Here the Commission has already given the appropriate instructions.
The Tampere Council called for reports and voted on them.
The European Parliament will also be considering this matter again in the near future and I think the decisions that emerge from this process could also serve as the basis for the further development of this e-commerce directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, first let me thank the rapporteur, on behalf also of my political group, for this report and for the strategy she proposes, namely to accept this common position as it stands.
We found this strategy convincing and we too can recommend that the plenary of the House adopt the Council' s common position on the e-commerce directive unamended.
We do so primarily because we believe that this key component of the European legal framework for the information society needs to be implemented swiftly.
Let me emphasise that another reason why we are able to adopt it unamended is because the Council - exceptionally, I am tempted to say - has incorporated many of the European Parliament' s amendments at first reading.
That does not mean, however, that we do not still see much room for improvement, as other speakers have pointed out as well, and some of our wishes have not been fulfilled.
But if we are prepared to set these wishes aside for now, for the sake of the speedy adoption and implementation of this directive, we also expect the Member States, when they implement it, with appropriate monitoring by the Commission, to resolve all the questions that are still not one hundred percent settled without this being at the expense of aspects that are important to us, in particular consumer protection.
Here I am thinking above all of the interpretation of Article 1(3), which is still worded in a very ambivalent way.
I hope that article will not be used to undermine national provisions on health protection, such as the ban on the mail order sales of certain medicines.
I think we are also entitled to expect that the proposed codes of conduct, which will give those involved in e-commerce a very wide margin for self-regulation, will be drawn up as soon as possible and that they will be very comprehensive, with the participation of consumer protection organisations, in such a manner as to be really binding and easy to implement.
I think we can also describe the rules that we adopted on provider liability as generous.
I can only hope that they stand the test of time and that we will not have to revise them again in three years' time in light of practical experience.
The adoption of the e-commerce directive does represent a very, very important step, yet a few other key building blocks for the e-Europe are still missing.
As the rapporteur pointed out, the Council is dragging its feet on the common position on the distance marketing of financial services, on copyright in the information society.
We also need to make more rapid progress in setting up out-of-court settlement procedures and the small claims procedure.
Finally, I hope that the directive we are to adopt will also serve as a good stepping-stone towards finding equally good global solutions.
Mr President, the passage of this directive at second reading has perhaps been historic.
No amendments!
I congratulate heartily our rapporteur on her original strategy and I hope what will be her achievement of obtaining continuing consensus.
I do not believe it has been easy for any of us as politicians to curb our natural instinct either to improve on or alter someone else' s text.
Yet it was a carefully considered decision.
We know the proposal is not absolutely perfect but the general feedback, both at a recent hearing in committee and from those who have lobbied Members has been: 'let' s have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all' .
Speed with certainty in this fast-moving new world is essential.
Now we have an initial road-map; a reference point for European businesses trading on the Web; a road-map that has clearly established the country of origin principle while still protecting consumer interest.
That is a good balance.
This should really open up the internal market to the many and increasing opportunities which e-commerce promises to businesses of all sizes, but particularly SMEs.
We must continually be aware that the Web is not limited to Europe.
It is, of course, global.
A large part of consumer transactions from Europe on the Web is directed at American sites and in future may well be directed at Asian sites.
European business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence.
We have to aspire to the establishment of the highest quality of e-businesses in Europe.
Companies setting up or changing to this way of doing business have to look carefully at the way they operate, at the information and the service they provide to customers if they are to survive.
We should also take care to provide coherent legislation.
Confidence is essential.
There are many opportunities but what of the threats?
Only this weekend we have seen in London the down-side of the communications and information revolution that the Web has created by putting elements in society in touch with one another, who have then wrought violence on the streets of London.
This may be extreme but there will be unscrupulous people who will set up scams on the Web.
One bad news story may blow confidence in e-trade for years.
E-commerce is in its early stages.
We need, as legislators, to be watchful, not necessarily interventionist, but wary of implications as the medium grows.
Our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis.
The ELDR Group will stick to her original 'no-amendment' line.
Mr President, there is a practice in this House of thanking and complimenting rapporteurs and sometimes I have to confess that I feel it can be overdone.
But on this occasion I wish to say that it would not be overdone if I, on behalf of myself and my Group, particularly thank and congratulate the rapporteur on her work.
Perhaps I might also, as a new Member of the House, and therefore of the committee, thank her for the marvellous job she does as the chairman of our committee - for the courtesy and kindness, but firmness with which she carries out its business.
I have some sympathy with Commissioner Bolkestein here today.
Parliamentary debates are not always marked by tremendous cut-and-thrust but today I fear it is a procession because we are all standing up and saying that we agree with each other.
Is this, we ask ourselves, the death of ideology?
I suppose we could excuse ourselves with the thought that we are debating more with the medium here than the message.
We are dealing with the creation of a new medium and therefore one which creates an urgent and acute need for regulation and for common regulation on a grand scale.
It is therefore, and I think we are all correct about this, vital that we get on with it and that we do not risk unnecessary delay in bringing this into effect.
Nevertheless, I was very grateful to my colleague, Mrs Ahern, also from the committee, for raising some points of continuing concern tonight and I would like to thank again the rapporteur for the device whereby she has introduced in an addendum to the resolution the points about the intermediate service providers and codes of conduct.
That is important and I hope that the Commission will be taking that on board.
Coming as I do from one of the very remote parts of Europe, it is exciting to speculate on the possibility that these new media will help to correct the apparently unstoppable drift to the centre and the decay of the outlying parts of all our countries and societies.
In these circumstances we should welcome the chance to bring in an effective regulation on e-commerce.
We must also remember that there is another kind of exclusion other than geographical. There is the lack of skill in these technologies.
We are also challenged - albeit outside the scope of this directive - to make sure that we do not have an exclusion of people by ignorance or the lack of access to the instruments of this medium of communication.
So let us be sure that we carry the directive but do not forget the other problems.
Mr President, can I join in the very warm welcome to my colleague, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s approach, and commend her on the drive and persistence with which she has advocated this directive and the approach that we have taken.
It is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation.
I would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation.
I am one of the few engineers in Parliament, certainly in the Legal Affairs Committee which is dominated by lawyers, and can put a rather different point of view sometimes.
It seems to me that this piece of legislation can be likened in the technological world to the operating system of the whole legal framework that we are putting in place in the European Union for electronic commerce.
It is this operating system within which a lot of other key legislation will be fitted, such as the copyright and information society and distance selling of financial services.
All of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive.
So essentially this is the core principle.
I hesitate to call it the Windows because that produces rather unfortunate competitive issues these days but those of you who are software experts will know what I mean when I use the word "Linux" .
For those of you that are not so technologically enabled, Linux is a competitor to Windows that is owned and updated by the users.
That essentially is what we have here.
We have a system that is going to be operated by the users and the point I want to make this evening in now thinking ahead, because we are confident we are going to get this directive through, is to say to the Commission that we need to have a very comprehensive and a very fast feedback from the users about the problems and issues that they are encountering in using this directive.
Clearly the Internet world is going to be highly suitable for the Commission to set that up.
We want to know about issues where Member Governments have blocked transactions.
We want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts.
We want to know where consumers have had problems and feel that their rights are not protected.
We want to know for some of the special cases which we have not been able to cover this time, like gambling - the effect on national lotteries - pharmaceuticals and books, the real problems that they are having.
All of those I suggest need to be covered by the feedback.
The final point I want to make is about speed.
Mrs Palacio referred in her introduction to Internet years and the speed of approach.
We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible.
I say to both of them, and in particular to representatives of the Council here, we have risen to that challenge and we now expect Member Governments to behave with the same speed to get this legislation transposed.
We encourage the Commission and the Council to get the remaining bits of that legislation to us as quickly as possible because that is what Europe needs.
Mr President, can I too add my congratulations to the rapporteur.
There can be no doubt that the job of the Parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously.
Commission, Parliament and Council have had ample time to discuss and debate at both first and second reading and, as the rapporteur said, most of Parliament' s views now feature in the Council common position.
It is therefore a balanced proposal.
Let us remind ourselves that the Lisbon special EU Summit in March set us new targets and deadlines to make better use of the Internet, strengthening Europe' s competitiveness in the knowledge economy.
This therefore means we need to create a clear and simple, predictable and consistent legal framework for electronic commerce.
It is now an economic and political imperative.
The directive will go a significant way towards creating the framework which is necessary to provide the confidence that both business and consumers desire to maximise the potential of e-business.
From the wealth of letters and comments that I have received as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee, I know it is not possible to please all interested parties.
Concerns still exist but I believe that Council, Commission and Parliament have struck the right balance between the need to protect public policy and consumers and at the same time promote and support the growth of e-business.
I therefore strongly recommend that Parliament endorses and adopts Mrs Palacio' s report, which represents a common position.
We do this in the full knowledge that the e-economy is evolving at a rapid pace.
We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution.
That means, as policymakers and institutions, we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain.
We need therefore to continue, as Mr Harbour said, to have a full consultation and debate on both the outstanding and arising issues for business and consumers.
In particular, this is the case given the global nature of e-commerce.
We have in this directive an article which allows us to do that.
Article 21 of the common position provides for a review and we should use the time until then to deepen and further our knowledge on this critical sector of the European economy.
I would warn against complacency.
We need to continue to consult with interested parties in this debate and we need to ensure that the result is a national legislation and that we produce clear, appropriate and speedy legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner, e-commerce offers the European Union a unique chance to stimulate economic growth, strengthen the industry' s competitiveness and create new jobs.
The legal framework of the internal market plays a crucial role in this.
The present proposal removes a whole raft of obstacles and uncertainties which businesses are still having to negotiate in the field of e-commerce.
These uncertainties have been there for far too long because the Council needed nearly a year to determine its positions.
Similarly, the copyright directive has been with the Council since February 1999, i.e. for over a year now.
In the light of the speed of developments, neither industry nor consumers benefit from such delays.
Parliament works significantly faster.
The country of origin principle is one of the internal market' s cornerstones.
It is therefore obvious that this should be extended to cross-border e-commerce.
One cause for concern in this respect, however, is that this principle will only apply to trade between businesses for the time being.
Revisions of private international law for the benefit of on-line trade with consumers are in the pipeline.
It is crucial in this respect that disputes are settled out of court as much as possible. After all, court proceedings are drawn-out and costly.
I would therefore call on the Commission to support initiatives to this effect.
It is unfortunate that the present directive is not being dealt with in conjunction with, and at the same time as, the copyright directive, because there are inconsistencies in terms of liability of service providers.
How does the Commissioner intend to create unambiguous and legally secure positions for service providers?
I would like a reply to this question.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
I was not one of those who agreed with the consensus in committee about the tabling of no amendments.
That does not mean I did not appreciate her very solid work and I would also like to thank her very warmly for taking to heart the concerns that I expressed in committee, particularly on the liability of intermediary service providers, codes of conduct and the participation of consumers.
Without consumer confidence, e-commerce is going nowhere.
This is fundamental, horizontal legislation that is going to be dealing with the whole Internet and its commercial viability.
Unless we have consumer confidence and can deal with illegal content speedily without resorting to lengthy court cases, we will not have the kind of ground rules which citizens and consumers need and require.
There has already been reference here tonight to the need for revision.
Even before we adopt the directive we are talking about revision and I think that is very wise.
Some of the concerns that have been expressed here tonight, particularly about dealing with illegal content and consumer acceptance, need to be being already pursued by the Commission before we adopt this fully as a European directive.
I would like finally to thank again the rapporteur for taking on board the serious concerns that we expressed in committee.
Mr President, with the adoption, without amendments, of the common position of the Council, the European Parliament is rising to the challenges of the current changes, to the demands of the new economy, at last setting rules in place governing the use of the Internet for trade and the provision of services.
I will not go into the technical and legal details, which were covered by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio with her usual competence, and I would like to thank her for the extremely skilful way in which she handled the legislative procedure for this directive.
A further point: the new economy is something which the European economic and social model will have to address, and it must exploit all the opportunities for development and new jobs it provides.
We are witnessing a new industrial revolution. Consequently, the structure of the European economy is in need of legal infrastructures and, tomorrow, we are going to meet that need.
The absence of legal infrastructures is holding back development.
The internal market has become a reality and the fundamental freedoms enshrined by the Treaty of Rome as objectives have indeed been achieved, but whilst in the past the creation of the internal market was an end in itself leading to economic development, now new challenges have arisen for a market which is being forced to compete with the rest of the world by the globalisation of the economy.
The European economic and social model, which is based on the social market economy, is quite capable of dealing with world-wide competition, provided that it succeeds in evolving, eliminating all the unnecessary rigid constraints which are responsible for its continuing weakness in some areas.
It is no longer good enough just to create any old market: the internal market must be competitive, regulated in such a way as to allow firms to produce and trade quality goods and services at costs which are compatible with those of competitors.
This constituted the historic change brought about by electronic commerce - a revolution whose scope and implications are still not fully understood.
We only need to think back to the issues we have worked on in the past: risk capital, highly skilled services, innovation tools and the protection of intellectual and industrial property.
All these areas will have to evolve, and, in many cases, change completely.
A malicious thought has come to me: what will become of the petty national protectionist behaviour which we have witnessed in recent years?
Now, at this time of revolution, a large number of issues dear to the European People' s Party must be reassessed.
The social market economy also means solidarity and paying due attention to the more vulnerable strata of society which, in the industrial revolution sparked off by the Internet, also now include those who do not know how to use a computer.
This potential for growth is our challenge for the future!
Mr President, I want to begin by cordially thanking the rapporteur and the Commission for the superb way in which they have handled this difficult but extremely important issue.
The new technology is in the process of transforming our lives and, together with the new currency, can create a completely new Europe.
However, we are not alone in the world; e-commerce means competition, not only for companies but also for politicians.
Faulty regulations and obstacles both old and new can mean our failing to make the most of our historic opportunity for new freedom and success.
The development of information technology provides new opportunities to communicate and to disseminate information simply and cheaply.
The increased flow of information through Bulletin Board Systems, electronic mail and the Internet ought not to be subject to greater restrictions than traditional information channels and communication facilities.
A guiding principle for the new technology ought to be that everyone should have considerable freedom to make use of it and exploit the advantages it has to offer and that everyone should also be responsible for what they do.
The basis of a democracy must be that freedom of expression should be protected, not restricted.
Communication using computers should be viewed in the same way as any medium of communication.
It is stated in one of the items, item 48, that the directive does not affect Member States' ability to prevent a certain amount of illegal activity by imposing demands upon service providers who store information from their clients.
I proposed that that sentence should be removed because it does not have anything to do with the criteria for being able to impose the restrictions concerned.
It is not appropriate for the Member States to decide this issue or to demand that service providers be held liable for the actual details of the information provided.
That would be as absurd as making a cafÃ© owner liable for monitoring what is said across the cafÃ© tables.
Is there anyone who wants to see a utilitarian nanny State?
I do not think so.
I therefore also support Amendment No 1, which I think is extremely important and deals precisely with this issue.
E-commerce crime, or cyber crime as it is called, should, in my view, be combated by means of better working methods on the part of the police and not by means of legislation which is in danger of compromising basic democratic values.
It is time to implement the decisions about quality labelling and, in cooperation with the service providers, to devise practical codes of conduct without thereby raising the cost levels for consumers or introducing costly bureaucracy.
Freedom with responsibility ought to be the motto for continued work on developing this area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report and her strategy.
I welcome her recommendation that we should not suggest any amendments to the common position.
All current surveys show the great economic potential of electronic business.
The previous speakers have already described that in graphic terms, so I need not go into the subject or this aspect of it again.
Europe continues to trail behind the USA in e-business.
Yet we have a real chance to catch up.
Europe is presently seeing a wave of Internet companies being set up.
We must give political support to this trend.
We must also encourage stronger competition on the local telephone markets to make Internet connection cheaper.
In this context, let me also give special thanks to the Commission, to Mr Bolkestein and his colleague, Mr Liikanen, who has also done an excellent job here with the TC package he forwarded to us in Parliament a few months ago.
Many thanks!
I think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well.
At European level, the creation of the European single market and the introduction of the euro are certainly decisive factors in the promotion of electronic business.
Furthermore, e-business will be encouraged tomorrow when we adopt a legal framework for electronic commerce in the European Union.
That will send out a clear signal.
It will show that Europe is open and is able to promote the Internet as a new form of communication and commerce.
I believe it is also a good signal in terms of attracting foreign investment.
On the content of the directive, I just want to emphasise one key point which some of the previous speakers have also addressed.
It is the question of the regulations that a web trader has to comply with for cross-border transactions.
Here the regulation provides that what is known as the principle of the country of origin should apply.
That means that a service provider is subject only to the control and the legal system of the Member State in which he is established.
The aim is to prevent him from having to comply with the different legal provisions of all the countries in which his clients may reside.
That saves him a considerable financial outlay in these transactions.
However, it also creates a new situation, to which industry and national legislators will have to adjust.
Divergent rules in the Member States, on advertising, for instance, will mean that Internet providers in the European Union are treated differently.
That is why we need changes to the law and more far-reaching harmonisation in some respects.
In Germany, for example, we may well have to abolish the law on discounts and the regulations on free gifts.
I am glad the directive also contains a review clause.
I would ask the Commission to take that very seriously.
We in Parliament will, of course, follow developments in e-business closely and give appropriate support to any Commission proposals for a revision of the directive in a few years' time.
Mr President, I would like to preface my few remarks by echoing comments made by other speakers in thanking Mrs Palacio for the work that she has done on this report.
It is not merely that she is not proposing any amendments - although that is an example that some rapporteurs might follow with advantage, rather it is because she has recognised the overriding importance of taking this legislation forward and putting it on the statute book.
As has been mentioned this evening, e-commerce and online business are developing very rapidly and it is very important that we put in place a legislative framework in Europe within which it can develop and flourish.
Indeed, as Mrs Wallis said, you must remember it is not only within Europe.
It is actually a global industry and it is around the world that we want to see a proper framework established.
It is always easy to be wise after the event and no doubt if we do proceed apace we may not achieve a 100% satisfactory outcome.
It is one of the interesting characteristics of the Community system of legislation that it is relatively easy to bring forward amending legislation.
This can be done quickly if necessary, as Mr Lehne pointed out.
So there is no reason to delay.
Speed on this occasion is of the essence.
It is important that we are not distracted from setting a framework within which e-commerce can develop for the benefit of both business and the consumer.
Professor MacCormick said that there seems to be a very great deal of agreement about the need to go forward without amending this proposal.
One of my colleagues in another parliament, of which I have the privilege to be a Member, always says 'the one way of identifying things when you are wrong is when everybody is in agreement about it' .
On this occasion I do not believe we are wrong to approach this matter in that way and I hope this Parliament will agree with me with a big majority.
Mr President, I would also like to express my gratitude and congratulations for the work carried out both by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, and by those who have worked on it in the Council and the Commission.
Of course, it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible.
However, I would like to make certain observations which may be useful in this second phase which is so necessary.
We should not forget that the Internet is international.
We are talking about a directive for the internal market, but, as its original name, the 'World Wide Web' , suggests, it is international and we should bear this in mind as a fundamental reference, above all because the Internet is going to determine Europe' s economic position in the future, as well as its political position and its ability to influence the global, social and cultural environment.
I therefore believe it is fundamental that we bear in mind that the bulk of this success stems from the creation of new companies, the creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Therefore, in the review which is carried out, it is essential that we remember not only the consumers - who in any event must make their own decisions and must use mechanisms for encrypting and protecting their data in accordance with laws and with technology - but also the SMEs, because otherwise there will soon be little electronic commerce in Europe.
It therefore seems essential to make a genuine effort to homogenise the rules of the internal market and, at the same time, work energetically to unify the principles applied on a global level with regard to electronic commerce.
There is no point in having sound regulations for our internal market if we lose sight of the bigger picture.
In order to achieve this, it is also important to bear in mind that the regulations of the country of origin are fundamental, since, without them, small- and medium-sized businesses would find it difficult to operate and would encounter obstacles to achieving their objectives, because they do not have access to the same resources as large companies.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, ladies and gentlemen, I say 'yes' to the directive and 'yes' to the rapporteur' s strategy, for it is thanks to that consistent approach that I too have withdrawn my amendment.
The electronic market is a prime market in terms of growth, employment and future prospects, and not just in Europe.
We must therefore exploit all its opportunities and it is important that this regulation on electronic commerce has removed the barriers created by divergent legislative provisions and the ensuing legal uncertainty.
The rapporteur analyses the common position in the spirit of constructive criticism.
Let me pick up on two points of detail that are very close to my heart and where I would have liked to see the common position worded more clearly.
First, there is the question of the sale of medicines and, secondly, the protection of books as a cultural asset in connection with the existing fixed book price agreements.
On the first point, let me say briefly that in my country, Austria, we have banned the sale of medicines by mail order.
So there is some concern that firms established in Member States where this is allowed could encourage Austrian patients to order and buy medicines through the Internet.
In view of the health risks alone, I once again ask for extra clarification in the common position, so as to ensure that advertising activities and agreements with a view to the mail order of medicines are excluded from the area coordinated by the directive.
My second point concerns cultural assets.
Article 1(6) is the only article in the directive that refers, and then only in very general terms, to the cultural area, to the protection and promotion of cultural diversity.
I think that is not good enough.
So I would ask for it to be made clear that the directive does not apply to the fixed book price schemes introduced via legislation or arrangement in some Member States.
Furthermore, operators established in Member States other than the countries concerned should not be allowed to undermine these schemes when selling to an end consumer.
As far as I am concerned, the question of e-commerce in medicines and the protection of cultural diversity will be an important issue in the review scheduled in three years' time, which I welcome.
I ask the Commission to devote special attention to these two points.
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I had to hurry when I noticed my electronic gadgetry up there in my office on the twelfth floor was telling me the list of speakers was being worked through at a rate of knots.
It seemed it was the representatives of our political group that were going at such a rate, and I did not notice.
I am a little out of breath.
Hopefully, however, it will not have an effect on the matter in hand.
It was easy to agree with the explanations given in section 6 by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, as to why Parliament wishes to adopt the Directive under discussion in accordance with the common position.
As so many have already said, the matter is urgent, and I agree.
Stressing the importance of the review clause is only prudent in such urgent legislative plans as these.
I am satisfied that, as in the directive on electronic money for which I was rapporteur, a review clause is to be included.
The directive in hand is immensely important as regards the competitiveness of the EU.
It is pointless to deny that a veritable race is going on between the various continents in the area of electronic commerce.
There is competition with regard to speed and innovation.
From the point of view of unemployment within Europe, which remains high, we should remember that it is the early bird that catches the worm.
New jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced.
We cannot watch from the wings while Europe consistently lags behind the United States and other global challengers.
On the other hand, Parliament will not solve the challenges of e-commerce by intervening itself in a big way or through regulation.
Wisdom is not always a characteristic of politicians, be they in the Commission, the Council, or in this Chamber.
Too much regulation will freeze commerce over the Internet and prevent it from adapting to new circumstances and technical developments.
This must also be borne in mind, especially in relation to the second reading of the copyright directive soon to take place here.
To derive maximum benefit from e-commerce we have to ensure there is real competition in the telecommunications networks.
Like Mrs Niebler, I would also like to thank Mr Liikanen, and express my gratitude for the work the Commission has done with such determination in this area.
Only through competition will we be able to reduce costs, and thus increase the length of time people use the Internet, as well as increase the volume of electronic commerce.
If we just sit here talking about details, we will not manage to lay down even elementary up-to-date standards for electronic commerce.
How do we imagine we will be prepared for the next stage, m-commerce, or wireless commerce, if we cannot meet the demands of e-commerce?
That is why I support the previous speakers regarding the adoption of the common position with no amendments.
Mr President, could I first of all convey my thanks and compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this matter.
She has taken into account the importance of, and urgent need for, this directive, and she has cleared the way for the prompt and final approval thereof.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my great appreciation for the crucial role which Parliament, and the rapporteur in particular, have played in the negotiations on this directive.
Mrs Palacio has spoken about a milestone in the development of the European Union.
I think that she is right and it is indeed a lucky coincidence that this milestone should be reached a few days short of the fiftieth anniversary of Europe Day which will take place next Tuesday.
Parliament' s approach to this directive and the effect Parliament has had on bringing about the common position could well serve as a model for future cooperation between the institutions.
I will return to this in a moment, but on behalf of my staff, I would very quickly like to thank those Members of this House who have carried out the Commission' s work.
I would like to thank those Members of this House who, in turn, have thanked the Commission for the work it has done.
Once again, this is something which my staff will greatly appreciate and I am grateful to the Members for their comments.
I probably do not need to stress the urgency with which clear and flexible legislation is needed for e-commerce within the European Union.
This is legislation which will offer legal certainty to industry and the consumer.
Rapid approval of this directive is vital in order to attain this goal.
In fact, heads of government stressed this recently at the Lisbon Summit, as was pointed out by Mrs McCarthy, among others.
The directive must ensure that the principles of the internal market also apply to the information society services and that small- and medium-sized businesses, in particular, can consider the entire European market as their home market.
Many in this House, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, have emphasised this aspect for the benefit of small- and medium-sized businesses.
The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the directive will stimulate European integration and will, consequently, lead to greater economic growth, more investments in innovation and more jobs in Europe.
It will also have a favourable effect on the European industry' s competitive position within the global market and this aspect too has been stressed by a number of Members in this House.
Furthermore, the directive strikes a very precise balance between all private and public interests involved.
This has also been acknowledged by various MEPs.
Mrs Wallis spoke of the right balance that has been struck and this was echoed by Mrs McCarthy.
Some Members are left feeling not completely satisfied.
This is understandable.
When the right balance is struck, this invariably means that one or other party cannot achieve its ambitions.
Mr Lehne mentioned that he was not 100% satisfied and Mrs Wallis too has said that it is better to have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all.
This is, of course, true.
As I said, I understand that not everybody can be happy when the right balance is struck.
The French language captures this sentiment rather beautifully with the expression: on ne peut pas contenter tout le monde et sa belle-mÃšre [You can' t please all of the people all of the time].
Parliament has not tabled any amendments and has thus paved the way for a swift approval.
This is a wise and much appreciated decision taken by all major political groups.
I too would like to express my appreciation for this.
Parliament has been extremely sensible, if I may say so.
The decision is justified, not only on account of the pressing nature of the directive, but also because the common position offers a sound and - I repeat - well-balanced compromise.
This compromise is in line with the internal market' s direct approach, which received huge support at first reading and which was supplemented by Parliament.
Parliament tabled a number of amendments at first reading which proved to make a positive contribution to the common position and which elucidated and reinforced the Commission' s original proposal.
Those amendments have been incorporated in the Commission' s amended proposal and subsequently in the common position.
It should also be stressed that Parliament' s rapid approval of this directive without any further amendments was made possible thanks to the excellent cooperation between the rapporteur, the Finnish Presidency and the European Commission.
This has also been highlighted by the rapporteur and the Commission is grateful for this.
In other words, the common position fully reflects the support which Parliament has given to the internal market approach at first reading.
I think that we should, and can, learn from this close cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency and the Commission in order to accelerate the decision-making process in policy areas which fall under the codecision procedure.
In my opinion, further consultation is necessary in order to find out how we can improve this approach in future.
As a necessary step following on from all these efforts, the Commission will now commit itself, at Parliament' s request, to a swift and accurate transposition of the directive, taking into consideration the balance which has been struck between all the different interests and which undertakes to ensure that the directive is implemented correctly.
This mainly applies to the country of origin principle which has been mentioned many times this evening, as well as the liability of intermediaries, which is also a very important aspect of this directive.
In this connection, the Commission will be happy to meet Parliament' s request to issue guidelines for codes of conduct and to stimulate the establishment of effective procedures for notification and removal.
I would like to say a few words regarding the specific questions which have been raised by Members of your House.
First of all, I would like to address a comment made by Mr Harbour regarding feedback.
In answer to Mr Harbour' s remarks, I would like to say that the Commission plans to monitor the implementation of a feedback structure by the various Member States very closely.
The Commission most definitely intends to encourage all interested parties to keep the Commission abreast of all the possible problems which could crop up.
The Commission will be setting up a website with this goal in mind, thus enabling interactive exchange with all parties, with the intention of taking these remarks on board when this directive is up for review in three years' time.
With regard to this review, Mr Lehne expressed the hope that it will take place under the mandate of this Commission.
This Commission will still be within its mandate, at least if Parliament so wishes, because, as you are aware, the Commission as a whole is, of course, reliant on assent from this Parliament.
I will now move on to a question raised by Mrs Plooij who spoke about the way in which the different directives have to be aligned with each other.
I would like to inform Mrs Plooij that the directive on copyright in the information society will be discussed during the forthcoming Internal Market Council, which will take place on 25 May.
The Portuguese Presidency will make every effort to reach a common position during that Internal Market Council.
One of the key topics which is still being discussed concerns the exemptions which can be made on copyright and, more specifically, exemptions for the benefit of technical copies, which are necessary to ensure that a free flow of data remains possible on the web.
Needless to say, this point is very closely linked to the provisions of the e-commerce directive which we are debating this evening, provisions which concern the liability of service providers.
I would like to assure Mrs Plooij that the Commission is absolutely determined to ensure that both directives are brought into line with each other with regard to this important matter, in order to create legal certainty, which is needed both by parties entitled and service providers in the information society.
Finally, I would like to address a comment from Mr Karas. He has spoken about the trade in pharmaceutics.
I would like to point out that the introduction onto the market of pharmaceutics by means of advertising and sale, etc. is bound by strict national and Community rules.
Distance selling, particularly of pharmaceutics, is greatly restricted or even banned in certain Member States.
Those restrictions also apply to selling via the Internet.
Given the Internet' s global dimension, there is indeed a risk that Community legislation on advertising and sales of pharmaceutics via the Internet could be by-passed by companies based outside the European Union.
The risk is there.
This is why the Commission is now working together with the Member States to find solutions to this problem and to examine whether and on which points Community legislation is necessary in this field.
This concludes the remarks which I would like to make on behalf of the Commission at the end of this debate.
I would once again like to convey my heartfelt thanks, first of all to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio, and also to all the others who have taken part in this debate for their constructive attitude, as a result of which no further amendments were tabled at second reading.
It has also facilitated the swift adoption of this directive, at least I assume so, because the vote is tomorrow, so that we can swiftly move on to the next stage and implement e-commerce for the benefit of all EU economies.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I feel I must thank you, on behalf of the House, for your exhaustive response to the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Food Aid 1999
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0105/2000) by Mrs Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion on behalf of the European Community on the Food Aid Convention 1999 [COM(1999) 308 - C5-0148/1999 - 1999/0131(CNS)]
. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to sincerely thank all those who helped me draft this report, and especially the committee members for adopting it unanimously.
Day after day, over the last few weeks, we have seen pictures of the dreadful famine in Ethiopia all over the media.
While we all sit at home, replete after a good supper, our TV screens show us depressing new evidence of the sufferings of a people plagued by drought and hunger.
This afternoon, in response to precisely that situation, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the famine in Ethiopia.
The European Parliament, one of the most important political institutions in the European Union, has a duty to take a stance on the matter and it is important that we do not remain silent in the face of such disasters but offer political, moral and financial support, given also that the EU is one of the biggest donor countries.
The international Food Aid Convention we are discussing in plenary today could not take place against a more topical background, and its importance and necessity could not be demonstrated more clearly.
The objective of this international convention is to contribute towards world food security, but also to make it possible to respond to acute food crises with different food requirements.
By and large, I welcome the new convention for I believe it incorporates some very good ideas and covers a wider range of products.
But let me add a few general comments.
Firstly, we must at all events continue to provide food for emergencies such as drought and other climatic disasters.
Here we need to ensure it is delivered rapidly and minus the bureaucracy, because aid can only save lives if it reaches the suffering people rapidly and in time.
A binding strategy for closer coordination between the donor countries will help ensure that the aid really is effective.
Secondly, we should set a long-term objective in our food policy, which is to create food security in every part of the world, so that the supply of food aid can be confined to emergencies.
Food aid consignments should gradually be replaced by measures to improve food security in these countries.
Thirdly, it is extremely important in food policy to take account of the repercussions on local food production and markets.
These repercussions must be monitored and, as I said, local production must not be jeopardised, for I believe that would be counterproductive.
Fourthly, the Commission has been asked to evaluate food aid to ensure that it is fully consistent with other development cooperation sectors and their principles.
Naturally, the findings will have to be incorporated in our future activities, otherwise the evaluation would presumably be pointless.
My fifth point is that we must be extremely careful to ensure that the aid actually reaches the target groups who are genuinely in need.
In this connection, I am particularly keen to see women involved in the planning and execution of the programmes, for I think that would be a good step in the right direction.
Allow me to mention another point, namely the problem of food aid on the basis of credit.
I welcome the restrictions in the new convention, for our long-term aim must be to abolish the credit system completely.
Instead, we should increase still further the share of food aid in the form of grants.
In that context, let me also say that I fully and wholeheartedly support the amendment Mr Fiori tabled for the plenary.
To finish, a word about the forthcoming WTO talks.
Let me express my very serious reservations about linking the liberalisation of world trade to food aid provision, for that would be at the cost of the starving people, which can be in nobody' s interest.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schierhuber, you have already mentioned the resolution on Ethiopia.
Well, it is an outstanding example of how topical and necessary food aid is, even today.
As such, we can hardly deny this Food Aid Convention review our approval.
But we will not only lend our approval for the sake of international solidarity to relieve famine, but because this review encompasses a number of improvements compared to previous versions.
After all, the nature and way in which food aid is being granted within the framework of this Convention to this day, has been, and is being, heavily criticised, and rightly so.
Under the terms of the Convention, cereal surpluses from Europe and the United States can be converted into cash and removed from our market.
In this way, local food production is often thrown off balance and deeply discouraged.
The Convention is used as a lubricant for commercial transactions and often clashes with social and cultural traditions.
For example, our rapporteur already mentioned the important role of women in the supply of food.
Big bucks are often made on the back of the poor by making huge charges for transport and operational services.
The European Union has codes of conduct which deviate from this and which it tries to apply to its own aid.
These rules are now also incorporated in this international food aid agreement.
The Convention has changed significantly for the better, in our view, due to the fact that not only cereals, but also other products, including local products, fish and vegetables, can qualify, transport and operational costs must be proportionate to the value and the least developed countries, in particular, will be able to apply for this aid.
In my view, the intention to promote local agricultural development is vital.
Despite this, there is still a blemish on the new Convention.
The European negotiators have succeeded in cutting mixed aid in the form of loans down to 20%.
But the United States remain determined to use this type of aid, which permanently saddles the most needy countries with a debt burden, even if this is at a reduced interest rate and if it does not have to be paid off for another 30 years.
But what is 30 years in the life of a nation?
We fully endorse the agreements which should prevent a great deal of malpractice, by detaching aid from commercial transactions, for example, and by warning against disrupting the local markets.
This can happen very easily, both in buying products and selling food aid within the local market, because speculations and price rises are just round the corner.
The example of Ethiopia illustrates that not only the purchase but also that the transport, distribution and preservation must be monitored very carefully and, Mr President, given that we were in Ethiopia, the orders had been placed, there were plenty of foodstocks, yet none of it was there at the right place or time of the famine, I do wonder whether we should not fine-tune our instruments.

Mr President, I warmly welcome the extension and modification of the Food Aid Convention and thank the rapporteur for her work on this report.
The Commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the Budgets Committee in that there is no complete financial statement.
I have to say, with the fluid nature of food aid it must be extremely difficult to project accurate financial figures.
Now that the scope of aid has been widened, quite rightly in my opinion, from just cereals, this would be even more difficult.
I am particularly pleased to read in the new Convention that least-developed countries and low-income countries will be given priority when food aid is being allocated.
I am also pleased to see stronger provisions for promoting local agricultural development and local purchases as this also assists local economies and encourages local agriculture.
There are now many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where, unless there is a dramatic climate change for the better, it is unlikely that food will ever grow again.
I am thinking particularly of areas where the desert is literally burying the productive land.
We are now seeing in Ethiopia an even more desperate situation, where food aid is being provided but there is no water to cook with.
This is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future.
Water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries.
It is also good news that the new Convention covers transport costs and associated operational costs.
Even if again this comes in for criticism from the Budgets Committee, it is not much good delivering food aid to a country' s ports if you cannot then distribute it to the remote areas by truck or by air to the people starving and in need.
There is no doubt that past programmes have had a beneficial effect where they can be carried out and the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has a steady and worryingly increasing problem probably reflects the instability in many of these countries caused by war.
This has increased the number of refugees dramatically and worsened the problem of providing food aid.
The continuous need for an international, legally binding framework which defines and provides the commitments and instruments for the delivery of food aid to the developing countries is obvious.
The extension of the Convention and the new rules that have been introduced must therefore be warmly welcomed.
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur.
Clearly from the comments that we have heard already, the global institutional arrangements intended to underpin food security, as recent experiences testify very clearly, need serious attention.
There is actually a loss of confidence in all forms of food aid except for emergency food aid.
Internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not, in my view, properly understood.
There is still an institutional resistance to radical reform of food aid policies.
This is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the re-negotiated Convention.
The institutional Treaty-based arrangements for food aid are, in my view, still somewhat outdated and created with a world in mind where food aid was assumed to be a major feature of development and of humanitarian assistance and relief.
The arguments have already been made here this evening for compensatory financing, for aid to agricultural development, for export credits and for local sourcing; all of these criteria, all of these priorities are very well understood.
Something people have not mentioned is that the European Union has actually gone further towards translating the understanding of these issues into action than any of the other donors, particularly for instance the United States.
We welcome the fact that in our food aid budget line we target food security issues and that budget provides financial assistance for food security.
That is very important indeed.
Clearly the challenge is to meet the needs of the hungry in the most locally sensitive way.
We need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency.
We need to have the knowledge of where the foodstocks are, we need to assess where they are and we need to access those foodstuffs when we have identified them.
We also need to monitor all foodstocks that are held in the world, both public foodstocks and private foodstocks.
Finally, in the context of the WTO debates, we also need to see a guarantee of the legal right of all human beings to access to food.
This will mean, and many of us said this in Seattle in the debates, that we would require inter alia a food security clause in any future WTO agreements on agriculture.
This would represent very real progress in the attempts that we make to tackle food security.
Mr President, this Convention will only be successful if, in time, it becomes redundant.
Needless to say, structural food aid will continue to be necessary as long as we have so many seriously undernourished people.
The aim of this prevention exercise is to secure the developing countries' own foodstocks and to phase out dependence on donor aid.
In other words, the intention is not to help Europe get rid of its agricultural surpluses or to promote rich countries' exports by means of soft loans.
Excess production within European agriculture must be drastically reformed in order to re-adjust the market, the world' s poorest regions should not be used as a dumping ground for products of stubborn European mismanagement, and our efforts to stimulate exports should not be aimed at the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world.
The Fiori amendment is preoccupied with Europe' s own interests and is therefore wide of the mark.
In fact, it promotes exactly the opposite of what is really needed, namely a strategy which leads to self-sufficiency.
This means that the focus should be on stimulating local production. If this does not happen, our aid will have the opposite effect.
The local producers will then be pushed out of the way from the outset by free or cheap products and the affected countries will remain dependent on the 'oh so generous' donors.
Another implication of a correct strategy is that soft loans would not be linked to compulsory purchases in the donor country.
Moreover, the permitted 20% credit is not really of any benefit because it can lead to unfair competition.
Despite what has been agreed, food aid must remain restricted to financial aid and a range of real food.
As such, vitamin tablets from Canada do not form part of this.
Mr President, does the Commission share my view that European food aid itself should be streamlined and should be stripped of time-consuming red tape?
Does the Commission think that this is feasible and could aid not be allocated via one development budget line?
Mr President, the food problem can, in principle, be solved, even in Africa, provided we have a cohesive development policy intended to reduce poverty there instead of increasing wealth over here.
Our aim should not be to fill the purses of a few but to fill the mouths of many.
Only when we manage to achieve this will aid no longer be necessary.
Mr President, I strongly support Mrs Schierhuber' s report on food aid.
Being myself a producer of food under the provisions of the Berlin decisions, which have already been widely discussed in public, I am aware how insane and inconsistent it is to use various methods to cut production in the EU while there is hunger in the world.
Nowhere is it written that sections of the world population that live in an environment that has been destroyed by natural disasters or wars must not be allowed to eat.
One euro a day is enough for survival and offers a chance for the future.
That is feasible, in any case.
In this regard, the European Union, the Member States, politicians, industry and science must take responsibility and break down the wall between prosperity and hunger once and for all.
How will future generations judge us, I ask myself?
By the flood of megamergers that lead to ever larger and more uncontrollable giant undertakings, or by whether we manage to adopt targeted measures in the next ten years to combat poverty by cancelling the debts of developing countries, as an initial but necessary step?
The report rightly refers to a whole range of guidelines on fighting poverty.
For reasons of time I cannot go into them in detail.
But the careful observer will notice that there are different weightings at work here.
They are reflected in phrases such as "priority to the least developed countries" when allocating food aid, or "alleviation of poverty and hunger of the most vulnerable groups" .
I am glad I am not one of those who have to distinguish on a daily basis between "a bit hungry" or "starving" , as it is currently presented in the media, while regrettably little is being done.
The main part of the report correctly makes reference to the fact that its aim, ultimately, should be to make food aid unnecessary.
But we cannot do that unless the politicians agree that hunger is not a political weapon and unless the responsible leaders in every area of society all realise that we only have the world on lease from our children.
We hold the goods of this earth on trust for our descendants.
If we take that approach, then I am convinced we really can combat poverty.
Mr President, I am, of course, in favour of food aid for starving people, despite the commercial operations that are hidden behind this aid and despite the conflicts of interest which divide rich countries on this issue.
First of all, I wish to condemn the derisory extent of this aid compared to what is actually needed.
The European Union prides itself on having given a commitment to supply 1.322 million tonnes of wheat equivalent, but, at the same time, the report states that there are 791 million people suffering from malnutrition in poor countries, 124 million of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa alone, where Europe is supposed to be particularly closely involved.
Work it out for yourself: European aid comes to around 7 kilos of wheat equivalent per person per year, which is less than twenty grammes per day, and the report is cynical enough to stress the fact that food aid must not discourage local production.
It is not food aid that has ruined agricultural production in many African countries, however. It is the iron grip of huge European and American industrial or agricultural concerns, which have imposed the cultivation of hevea, coffee, groundnut, cotton and even out-of-season fruit and vegetables for the European market, at the expense of their own food crops.
Even in terms of food production, habits have been foisted on the populations of these countries by forcing them to consume rice or wheat-based products, which they can only obtain on the world market, generating profit along the way for a handful of huge Western companies.
In places, the report smacks of "Lady Bountiful" and presents this aid as an act of charity on the part of Europe, but Europe, or rather its privileged class, is responsible for the ruin of Africa, and that includes the ruin of its self-sufficiency in food.
It is not charity, then, that Africa needs.
What it needs is the European and American multinationals to stop bleeding it dry. It needs Europe to provide the African people with simple machinery, such as water pumps and industrial products to compensate for what it plundered throughout colonial times and afterwards.
Africa will then be in a position to develop its agriculture to a level where it can produce the food to feed its people properly.
Of course, I am not naÃ¯ve enough to think that one decent resolution passed in the European Parliament will be enough to guarantee this.
It would require an end to capital' s dictatorship of Europe as well as of Africa, and the only reason why I have voted in favour of this report is in order not to stand in the way of this aid.
Mr President, in our work on food aid we must not forget that, even today, there are hundreds of millions of undernourished people in the world.
The endeavours of our predecessors in the Community institutions succeeded in reducing the total number of undernourished people by over 20% in the space of 30 years.
In recent years, the trend has been reversed, which is extremely odd considering the efforts made by the Western world: in certain areas of our planet, the number of undernourished people is constantly on the up and the problem is heightened by natural disasters or, even worse, wars, which have continued to hit the headlines recently.
We must therefore congratulate ourselves on the fact that this issue is still on the agenda of the European Parliament and the countries of the European Union.
I was very pleased to note that, as is the case in the Convention we are discussing now, the Community legislator has consistently striven to guarantee food security and not subsistence.
The ultimate purpose behind our aid is to bring about food security: with the passage of time, the aid must be gradually replaced by tangible measures and sustainable instruments for consolidating that security, eliminating, at last, the need for any form of aid or intervention.
I am sure that our fellow citizens fully approve and support any initiative undertaken by the Community institutions on the matter of aid, or, even better, support for those communities which are less fortunate than we are.
However, I cannot miss this opportunity to touch on an aspect, a principle which, I feel, is of paramount importance, precisely to our fellow citizens.
In my opinion, the correct weighting should be given to European production.
The Convention does not give any form of priority to European products, not even agricultural produce, which are intended for humanitarian aid.
Europe has always been one of the highest-producing continents in the agricultural sector.
For example, the European Union is one of the world's largest producers of starchy products, which are essential for nutrition.
This productivity must not be undervalued or underestimated in respect of the produce available on world markets, even in the provision of aid to the most disadvantaged communities.
For this reason, I have tabled an amendment, not to the draft Convention, which, I am aware, cannot be amended, but to Mrs Schierhuber' s resolution.
This amendment has been judged inadmissible, but my aim in tabling it was to provoke a debate of substance in this Chamber on a topic which, I feel, is of vital concern to our farmers, particularly at this difficult time for them in the aftermath of the reform of the common agricultural policy.
In conclusion, I would stress that the purpose of my amendment, and the purpose, now, of this speech, is to promote the cause of Community products, in particular, agricultural produce, at the time of the conclusion of international agreements, and to urge the European executive bodies not to disregard the millions of people whose livelihood depends on European produce, and I refer not to consumers but to producers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, for her report and her proposal to adopt the Council decision on the Food Aid Convention.
As you know, the International Wheat Agreement comprises two separate legislative texts, the Grains Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention.
The Grains Trade Convention was fundamentally amended as early as 1995, which meant there was no need to envisage amendments to the new convention.
And that is why the Commission requested extending the period of validity of that convention until 30 June 2001.
In the case of the Food Aid Convention, however, the Committee on Food Aid decided to renegotiate the agreement and in particular to take on board the recommendations of the Singapore Conference.
The purpose of the new 1999 Food Aid Convention is to contribute to creating food security in the world and to enhance the international community' s ability to respond more effectively to acute food crises and the food requirements of the developing countries.
The new convention attaches special importance to the following points.
Firstly, more consideration is to be given to local nutritional customs.
Secondly, the donor countries can now express their commitments in tonnage, value or a combination of tonnage and value.
Thirdly, the members of the convention must give priority to the least developed countries and the lowest income countries when allocating their food aid.
Fourthly, stronger provisions are introduced for promoting local agricultural development, including possible triangular transactions and local purchases.
More than half the relevant Commission resources will go to such transactions.
My fifth point is that food aid to the least developed countries will be given purely in the form of grants.
Overall, food aid provided in the form of grants will represent not less than 80% of a member' s contributions and members will strive to raise this percentage even higher.
Next, in determining whether, and to what extent, the food aid provision on long-term concessional credit terms should continue to be covered under the Food Aid Convention, FAC members will take account of the results of the relevant multilateral negotiations.
In this connection, the European Union and some other members reaffirmed their opinion that food aid provided under credit terms should no longer be included in the list of food aid operations.
Our position is as follows: food aid must be clearly separated from commercial transactions.
My seventh point is that the new Food Aid Convention is intended to improve the monitoring of the effectiveness and impact of food aid transactions and cooperation between food aid donors, recipients and others concerned.
Eight, the provision of food aid under this convention will not be tied in any way to commercial exports of goods or services.
In conclusion, since several speakers raised this question during the debate, let me tell you how much aid we are currently providing for Ethiopia.
The Commission and the Community are in a position to mobilise 542 526 tonnes of cereals between April 2000 and March 2001, i.e. immediately, this year.
Let me also point out that during the negotiations we kept in constant contact with the food aid recipient countries so that we were always aware of their position.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0065/2000) by Mr Deva, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation (EC) extending Regulation (EC) No 443/97 on operations to aid uprooted people in Asian and Latin American developing countries [COM(1999) 443 - C5-0146/1999 - 1999/0194 (COD)]
Mr President, I am indeed privileged today to present this report to Parliament.
It is one of the first reports from the Development Committee under the codecision procedure.
I am particularly grateful to all my colleagues who have turned up in force to hear me speak and present my first report to Parliament and the heaving public galleries.
All are waiting with bated breadth to hear my speech.
This is a very urgent matter.
It is my hope that we can pass this report without any substantial amendment other than procedural ones because the report is an extension for one year of an existing regulation which supports four million refugees in the most war-torn and ravaged part of the world.
If we delay or fail to pass this report in plenary as soon as possible, all further assistance, food supply, housing, shelter, water, sanitation and education, to the most vulnerable people in the world, will be severely affected as there will be no legal base in the European Union to support them and to fund them.
What we are doing today is to consider a Commission proposal to extend the regulation on aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America, which expired on 31 December 1999.
The extension we propose is for one year until 31 December 2000.
The extension of the regulation will enable a further EUR 40 million to be spent until the end of this year.
Between 1997 and 1999, Parliament sanctioned EUR 240 million.
This regulation came to an end on 31 December 1999.
By extending this regulation today for a further period of one year, we are also giving the Commission time to prepare a new regulation which I hope will be a multiannual one to replace the existing regulation.
This new regulation, to be brought in at a later date, should build on, and take into account, the existing regulation as well the annual report and the evaluation which the Commission has undertaken to present to Parliament and Council in the very near future, and no later than September.
The European Parliament' s original report on the current regulation, the Howitt report, was exemplary in how it was constructed by Parliament.
It had considerable success in improving the existing draft and thus played an important part in supporting and improving the text which was finally adopted.
Notably, the Parliament contributed to a strengthening of the regulation in its reference to environmental concerns, complementary support and cooperation and assisting local host populations, a strong approach for targeting support programmes towards women refugees, particularly those who have been the victims of rape, and a clear provision for the upholding of the "non-refoulement" principle, i.e. protection against forced return.
Mr Howitt engaged then in a very positive dialogue with the Irish presidency as well as with the Commission in order to improve on the existing draft.
In addition, and more importantly, more than fifty NGOs were consulted.
Therefore the Parliament played a major role in producing this regulation with its report.
Support to uprooted people, refugees, returnees and internally displaced people in Latin America and Asian developing countries has been a feature of the Community budget since 1984.
The UNHCR estimates that there are 4.8 million in Asia and some 88 000 in Latin America.
Of these, the current regulation and the one year extension that our report today is calling for, will continue to help 2.9 million Afghani refugees of whom about 40% are in Pakistan and Iran and the 60% balance in Afghanistan itself.
A total of EUR 24.3 million was given to Afghani refugees with a further EUR 960 000 to Thailand, EUR 6 million to Sri Lanka, EUR 11.8 million to Burma and EUR 1.8 million to Nepal.
In Afghanistan, about 2 million people were assisted by the mine-clearance programme which is crucial in returning that country back to normality.
Therefore, in a sense, an immediate approval of the proposal would postpone the need for a long-term solution.
In doing so it would nevertheless allow the institutions to engage in a more thorough dialogue in this area and hopefully allow us to find a more permanent solution by 2001.
This is also a very timely report in the context of asylum-seekers.
We are now presented with a solution by this Parliament, by our institutions in Europe, where we want to and can help people where the problem is.
We can stop people needing or wanting to come across if we can help them at the place where the problem has arisen.
The central thrust of my report is to help the people in war-torn areas, in ravaged parts of the world, to settle back to normality, to have proper foundations and sanitation, proper infrastructure, and to stop them needing to travel as asylum seekers and refugees.
Mr President, may I begin by stating how bizarre it is that we are debating the extension of a regulation tonight in May 2000 that already expired last December and which, under the Commission' s proposal, would again expire in seven months' time.
As the rapporteur for this Parliament on the original resolution four years ago, I cannot but comment that this represents a failure of political commitment in Europe to aiding five million refugees, some of the poorest of the poor, in Asia and in Latin America.
Nevertheless we are here now, and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur' s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments, already agreed in principle with the Council, in order to allow a fast-track, one-reading approval of the extension, and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled.
The need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago.
It is no good us debating conflict resolution in the Parliament and then finding that the sole support to assist people when the guns are put down or when the period of immediate humanitarian assistance is at an end is then forgotten altogether.
This regulation has enabled us to intervene in countries where there is deep conflict with serious abuses of human rights.
For example in Afghanistan, which has today broken all world records for refugees with six million people having left the country since 1992, leaving the single largest and longest staying refugee population in the world.
Or like the protection of the terrorised indigenous peoples fleeing from Burma.
As one conflict ends another begins, as the half a million returnees expected in Timor by December this year go to demonstrate.
On this regulation, we know that the Council has some divided thinking.
I have to say, Mr Patten, I regret that the Commission does too.
Whilst it has supported projects in Asia to a great degree it has failed to address properly and with sufficient vigour the problems of refugees and internally displaced people in Latin America.
You know that I have spent much time visiting and studying the problems of violent, armed conflict in Colombia.
In that country alone there have been 800 000 internally displaced people since 1996; 123 000 new internally displaced people between January and June last year.
It is a disgrace that with this regulation the European Commission in the past has failed to address this problem.
The sort of forced displacement that we have seen in Colombia I have seen too in Chiapas in southern Mexico where the presence of international aid workers is essential for the protection of human rights.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on his report, thank him for his kind words in his speech and endorse what he says.
I know he will be listening carefully to the Commissioner when he sums up to see if he will put on record that promise to ensure that a future proposal for a multiannual regulation comes forward and that the annual reports will be provided.
With Mr Deva we ask those questions of you, Mr Patten, and if we do not get satisfactory answers the Socialists on this side of the House will be supporting Mr Deva in taking a very different stance on this report altogether.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Deva for a very good report, of which it might be said that it is as long as the Commission' s text is short.
It no doubt says something about the relationship between Parliament and the Commission at the moment that the text presented to us has been produced very urgently and is therefore very brief and very simple.And, as Mr Howitt also mentioned, is it, of course, not particularly satisfactory to receive it four or five months after the regulation has in fact expired, but this is actually the usual way, although I do not suspect Mr Patten of being up to no good.
It is the usual way things are debated in parliaments.
A report is submitted which says that we must now extend the regulation.
It is four months since it expired.
Parliament is thus, in actual fact, compelled to say: all right, then, we really have to accept the extension for, otherwise, there will be even more people dying of hunger and destitution.
It is not a fair way of doing things, and I shall therefore, like Mr Deva and others, also listen to what Mr Patten has to say.
That said, however, I would also say that we need to implement this proposal as quickly as possible, for we must try to help as best we can and just hope that we can find a more satisfactory way of doing things in future.
One simple little matter, which Mr Deva also emphasises, and which I too think we ought to discuss in the future, is the situation of women and children, which is, of course, extremely difficult and always will be in these situations.
We therefore need to concentrate very heavily on this area and find some methodical ways of doing so, partly by involving NGOs and others who can make a contribution.
Mr President, I would like to join in the heavy criticism which has been levelled by the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Development and Cooperation and which has been outlined in the otherwise very constructive report of Mr Deva.
These committees complained about the fact that the annual reports have not been issued by the Commission, and what is worse, the independent evaluations have failed to materialise, although these are, of course, vital in order to establish that the validity period of the regulations definitely needs to be extended.
But how can we do this without the necessary reports at our disposal?
As has already been expressed in other criticism, this is probably once again a case of outstanding payments, unnecessarily complicated procedures for financial control and a fragmentation of efforts.
Also the fact that the amounts spent are disproportionate to the number of displaced persons raises questions.
Commissioner, of the EUR 240 million, 40% has been allocated to Latin America which has less than 1% of refugees in the world, while 60% has been granted to Asia which has 40% of the displaced persons.
Were it not for the fact that a sudden discontinuation of the programmes would cause undesired effects and result in innocent victims, we would follow the advice of the Committee on Budgetary Control, but instead we will now follow Mr Deva' s recommendation.
He has called for an extension of that programme by one year, although Mr Howitt has already pointed out that, in actual fact, we are already halfway through that year.
We hope that the report and in-depth evaluation will as yet be forthcoming.
Mr President, we are not talking about humanitarian aid but about viable projects aimed at self-sufficiency and the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons, ex-soldiers, etc. Surely we should be able to come up with the goods and establish that there is indeed reduced dependency on aid.
Mr President, we are prepared to give the Commission some respite because we know that so many people are making huge efforts and because Parliament too is not exactly whiter than white as far as the Council is concerned, which you are under-staffing, but I think that, in any case, we will need to get the Commission to keep its promise to us, because otherwise this cooperation will be futile.
Mr President, it seems simple. All we need to do is to change the year 1999 to 2000 and the European Union can support campaigns for another year for the benefit of uprooted people in Latin America and Asia.
There is, however, more to it than that, as evidenced by the opinions of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
With regard to the implementation and evaluation of this programme, the Commission has not exactly come up smelling of roses.
Little consideration has so far been given to the operation of this programme.
Sound annual evaluation reports are lacking.
Moreover, we are still waiting for a long-term vision for this programme.
I would, therefore, make the approval of the extension of this programme dependent on the availability of reports.
Parliament must use this as a way of forcing the Commission to account for the spending of the development funds.
None of this detracts from the fact that the recipient countries sometimes have dire situations to contend with.
The European Union must help where it can.
The role of the national Member States, however, is at least as important.
Indeed, at European level, we are always running the risk of making pledges that we cannot keep due to budgetary restraints.
The most important prerequisite to a long-term solution for the problems outlined is sound coordination of Member State efforts.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Mr President, it is not only a political responsibility but a moral responsibility that the European Union has to help those in straits outside its boundaries as equally as they can.
This being the purpose of this report, I congratulate its rapporteur, Mr Deva.
To help those in need when it is in our hands to do so, at the end of the day, results in our really helping ourselves.
The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish.
The other side of the coin is also true.
Hoarding does impoverish.
Countries that have serious internal hostilities and all the terrible reaping of that where the innocent go to the wall and countries encouraging displaced persons to return home ought to be helped.
The fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children.
This makes it even more imperative that action should be taken.
Food supplies, water and sanitation, housing and shelter, education are, of course, the top priorities.
I welcome the recognition of this.
I believe that the four amendments submitted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation must be accepted by the Commission and I hope that the Commissioner, Mr Patten, who did not very often give me happy replies on other things when he was in another office, perhaps today will give me some little encouragement that Christmas is really coming.
It is essential that annual reports are submitted by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council, as is specified.
If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal.
I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do.
The financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to.
These provisions must be strictly adhered to and this change is absolutely necessary.
The new text on comitology is necessary and when the long-term future of this regulation is assessed, this Parliament must have before it independent valuation reports, so where improvements can be made they can press upon the Commission to make those improvements.
Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations, then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good, healthy and proper debate.
Mr President, the Commission proposes that the existing regulation be extended.
According to the regulation, the Commission is obliged to prepare an annual evaluation for Parliament and the Council, something it has not done.
However, the programme must not be halted under any circumstances; that would be quite wrong.
It is important that the programme should be extended, but not before we have seen the evaluations.
The Commission promised that we would have the evaluations in March, then in April and then in May. So where have they got to?
An independent evaluation is needed for otherwise we have no guarantees that the money has been spent properly.
The purpose of the evaluation is, of course, to improve the future programmes.
Everything concerning development aid, including the rehabilitation of refugees, ought to fall within the remit of the Directorate-General for Development.
It is this Directorate-General which has the expertise and it should therefore also have the responsibility.
The Court of Auditors has also criticised the lack of clarity in the way the different initiatives are related to one other.
It is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence.
I am glad that there is support, especially in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for my amendment to the effect that the programme should only be extended once the Commission has fulfilled its part of the agreement and submitted annual reports and evaluations.
Without this amendment, the Commission could get away with not having submitted a single evaluation report since the regulation came into force in 1997.
I have also noted that my dear friend, Mr Dell'Alba, has had his grumbles printed as an appendix to my opinion.
However, he is only speaking for himself.
At any rate, he had no backing in the Committee, since he was the only one to vote against the conclusions.
Mr President, let me first of all thank my honourable friend for his extremely thoughtful report and for the care and attention that he has devoted to the issue of uprooted people in Asia and Latin America.
It is common to all the speakers in the Chamber and to others outside that it is an excellent report but, speaking for myself, I would not have expected any less from my honourable friend.
Regulation 443/97 on aid to uprooted people is an important instrument clearly, an instrument to deliver aid that is not covered by humanitarian assistance and the honourable Member Ms Maes made this distinction extremely clearly.
It supports projects implemented by international organisations like the UN and the UNHCR and NGOs and these measures are designed to improve living conditions, not only for returnees but also for the communities into which they will integrate.
In that context particular importance is attached to clearing the land of mines, a point which my honourable friend referred to, rebuilding farming systems, supporting secure livelihoods and embracing key health and education challenges.
A number of honourable Members have made clear the good and practical work done as a result of this regulation.
I noted in particular what the honourable gentleman, Mr Howitt, said about geographical balance and one or two other honourable Members referred to that as well.
I also noted what the honourable gentleman Dr Paisley said about our moral duties to those who are uprooted.
Dr Paisley and I have not always seen eye to eye on every subject but I hope that this is a subject on which we can see eye to eye and even share quotations from both the Old and the New Testament.
The Commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in Spring 1999.
However, these discussions were delayed by the former Commission' s resignation last year.
It was decided as an interim step to propose an extension of the current regulation up to the end of the year 2000.
A Commission activity report covering the three years of implementation of the regulation from 1997 to 1999 was presented in its preliminary version to Mr Miranda, the President of the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament, and, of course, to the rapporteur.
In parallel, preliminary findings of an on-going external evaluation on the implementation of the regulation were also transmitted.
The final evaluation report will be submitted to the Parliament by September of this year.
Now to the amendments: the Commission broadly agrees with the four amendments which have been tabled by the Parliament.
However, concerning the first amendment I would like to stress again that the draft of the activity report has already been made available to the Committee on Development and Cooperation and that official submission will take place next June at the latest.
The Commission agrees with amendments two and three since they reflect the existing framework of interinstitutional cooperation with regard to budgetary discipline and comitology.
Now let me come to the fourth amendment.
I recognise that the Parliament would like to see the independent evaluation report extremely soon.
A number of honourable Members have argued that you should see that by July.
We believe however, that given the late contracting of the 1999 programme, which means that some activities are only now getting under way, it would be better to finalise the report, which must be a thorough and comprehensive document, a month or two later, say by September.
That will give us a reasonable period to evaluate 1999' s activities.
However, as you know, the evaluation is already under way and I will make any interim reports available as soon as they are produced.
I want to make that commitment unequivocally.
I hope that Parliament would be willing to agree this approach.
There have been references to the new regulation.
I can confirm that the new regulation is under preparation.
It will need to take into consideration the findings of the evaluation exercise and, of course, before presenting it to the legislative authority, we in the Commission will have to ensure that we are able to mobilise the necessary human resources for its effective implementation.
Too often, in my experience of just seven months, we undertake to do things without having first made sure that we have got the resources to carry them through and it is important for us to be honest about what we want to do and how we can achieve it.
Before closing let me once again thank Parliament for its support in extending the validity of this important instrument.
I can assure honourable Members that I have taken account of the criticisms and of the aspirations that have been expressed during the course of this debate.
I am old enough and experienced enough in political life to recognise the difference between a standing ovation and a raspberry, or a bronx cheer as the Americans would call it, and I do not wish to sit through another debate about a subject as important as this and hear it dominated by well-meant criticisms.
So I hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject.
We are dealing with important technical details but, above all, we are dealing, as honourable Members have pointed out, with human tragedies that lie behind the need for all these measures and that is why we have to ensure that our own response is as rapid and as effective as possible.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11a.m.
EC-Switzerland agreements
The next item is the report (A5-0118/2000) drawn up by Mr Carraro, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreements between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part (7260/2000 - COM(1999) 229 - C5Â­0204/2000): 1. on the free movement of persons (9748/1999 - C5Â­0197/2000Â­1999/0103(AVC)); 2. on air transport (9749/1999 - C5Â­0198/2000 - 1999/0104(AVC)); 3. on the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road (9750/1999 - C5Â­0199/2000 - 1999/0105(AVC)); 4. on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part (9751/1999 - C5Â­0200/2000 - 1999/0106(AVC)); 5. on certain aspects relating to public procurement (9752/1999 - C5Â­0201/2000 - 1999/0107(AVC)); 6. on trade in agricultural products (9753/1999 - C5Â­0202/2000 - 1999/0108(AVC)); 7. on mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation (9755/1999 - C5Â­0203/2000 - 1999/0109(AVC))
Mr President, this draft recommendation marks the end of a political and institutional process which began 10 or so years ago under the auspices of the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, who, as far back as the early 1990s, predicted the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the then common economic area.
As you are aware, this project was blocked by the Swiss referendum in December 1992, when, albeit by a very narrow majority, the Swiss citizens decided to block the entry of the Swiss Confederation into the European Community.
That was the beginning of a period of uncertainty, of widely sectoral agreements, which is being brought to an end by this package of seven agreements, which are closely related to the economy but which are also wide-reaching and of general interest.
The seven agreements govern the free movement of persons, air transport, the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road, scientific and technological cooperation, public procurement, agricultural products and, in relation to these, mutual recognition in the area of conformity assessment.
They are also characterised by a specific simultaneous enforcement clause to the effect that the agreements will enter into force only insofar as they are approved or rejected en masse.
For this reason, although the draft legislative resolutions are separate documents, they have to be tabled and approved en bloc because, and I stress this, they have to be enforced en bloc.
The agreements were signed as early as June 1999, ratified by the Swiss Parliament on 8 October 1999, and tomorrow they will have reached the stage of ratification by the European Parliament.
However, I would also like to point out to the House that the citizens of Switzerland will, once again, be called upon to pronounce judgement on this package of agreements, and, therefore, also on relations with the European Union, in the referendum on 21 May next.
Nevertheless, it is as well to remember that this declaration will certainly be different from the 1992 decision in form and substance.
In 1992, the people of Switzerland were called upon to pronounce judgement on Switzerland' s accession, whereas on 21 May they will be asked to approve or reject a package of strictly economic agreements which do not have the political implications of the 1992 agreements.
However, I feel it is highly significant that Parliament is voting on and approving the texts - if that is the decision of the House, as it was the largely unanimous decision of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and as it is the desire of all the parliamentary committees which have expressed their opinion - and giving its assent before the Swiss referendum on 21 May.
Not, of course, in order to undermine the sovereignty of the Swiss people' s vote in any way, but, on the contrary, to give a further sign of confidence and conviction that the development of a common European economic area and growing integration of the markets and economies of this Europe - of which Switzerland is, clearly, at the heart owing to its central geographical position - are a concern which we share and which we consider more important than disputes over procedures.
In my opinion, it is politically significant - and, for this, all thanks go to the Chairman of the Committee on Industry and the staff which have made it possible - that Parliament is going to vote before 21 May, for this will present the Swiss citizens with a sure, well-defined legal framework on which to pronounce judgement.
The opinion of the Committee on Industry is wholly favourable and I recommend that the House votes unanimously for the motions during tomorrow' s sitting.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the committee responsible. He has produced a very coherent opinion.
I also want to thank the Commission for its good work in connection with the negotiations.
With regard to my committee' s area of responsibility, that of citizens' freedoms and rights, this agreement is welcome.
I also want to emphasise that it is important to view the agreement in its entirety.
In the course of my work on the opinion, I in fact became aware of quite a number of problems and difficulties for EU citizens who live and work in Switzerland. In certain cases, it has been a matter of discrimination pure and simple.
There is no doubt that the agreement we now have provides great opportunities to solve those problems which exist and to prevent new problems from arising.
In this connection, I would just mention, for example, the right of entry, the right of establishment, the opportunity to enter the labour market, the coordination of social security systems, the right of establishment for non-gainfully employed people and students, together with new opportunities for cross-border workers.
I want to emphasise, as the rapporteur for the committee responsible pointed out, that it is important for our opinion to be made available before the referendum in Switzerland - not because it is for the Swiss to say 'yes' or 'no' to the opinion, but to show our desire for cooperation, that is to say further cooperation, with Switzerland.
Our committee has pointed out possible future areas of cooperation, for example operations to combat trafficking in women and to combat organised crime and economic crime.
We view these agreements, especially the agreement concerning the free movement of persons, as being very important in the context of cooperation between the EU and Switzerland.
Mr President, I too want to thank the rapporteur for his report and congratulate him.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole is pleased about this agreement because it was well known how very difficult it was to reach a transport agreement which established a fair balance between competition and the environment and which would also produce a satisfactory solution for both sides.
The two agreements that directly concerned us, and that we have analysed, concern air transport and road and rail transport.
Here we must note, with regard to air transport, that Switzerland is, of course, already a member of numerous international conferences and organisations and has therefore incorporated in its legislation quite a few aspects of what we in the EU regard as the acquis communautaire.
Its adoption of the regulation on the liberalisation packages is the most practically significant measure.
The Transport Committee regards it as a small weakness that the duty-free agreement is not applicable to Switzerland in this case.
The road-rail discussion is a more difficult and also a more interesting one. We think the experiment being proposed here is most interesting.
On the one hand, Switzerland will gradually forego reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles.
It will allow vehicles of 34 to 40 tonnes up to the year 2004; on the other hand, it will abolish the quotas accordingly.
Eventually it will replace this system with a road tax, of approximately EUR 200 on average.
So you can understand why the transport operators are rather critical of that.
And in my view their criticism is fair because we believe these road taxes do not take sufficient account of the fact that the transport operator may invest in environment-friendly lorries.
But what the Transport Committee considered even more important was that this agreement points the way to a transport policy entirely in line with that of the EU: reducing the burden on the roads while supporting transport by rail.
We believe the proposed agreement between the EU and Switzerland is a pilot agreement; the same applies to the analysis of the means by which what we regard as a theoretical transport policy may subsequently be put into practice.
Mr President, the Social Democrats Group and I myself most emphatically welcome this agreement between the European Community, on the one hand, and the Swiss Confederation, on the other.
It is a step in the right direction.
After all, Switzerland is located at the heart of Europe but is not yet a member of the Union.
The conclusion of the bilateral negotiations with Switzerland will put the Union' s relations with Switzerland on a new footing, and we all hope that, in a few weeks' time, the Swiss people will give their assent to these agreements.
But there are a few aspects that still need clarification.
I am not referring to what I usually refer to in this connection, namely closer cooperation to combat tax evasion at the cost of the European taxpayers.
Tonight I will confine myself solely to the question of freedom of movement and will specifically address the subject of cross-border workers.
In all, there are 140 000 cross-border workers in Switzerland who come from Germany, France, Italy and Austria.
These cross-border workers are very seriously affected by the most recent deteriorations in Swiss pension schemes.
Prior to the tenth review of old-age and surviving dependants' insurance there was a so-called spouse' s pension, which was paid without regard to the place of residence of either spouse.
Under the tenth review, which recently came into force, this rule was removed.
It was replaced by educational credits, which were, however, tied to residence in Switzerland.
As a result, cross-border workers from the European Union had to pay the same contributions as Swiss residents, but received a 30% lower pension.
The forthcoming eleventh review even provides that only widows resident in Switzerland are entitled to a widow' s pension, which, of course, once again makes the situation worse for cross-border workers from the EU.
Unfortunately, European Union governments have paid too little attention to this issue until now.
I hope all this will change in the near future.
The current rules on old-age and surviving dependants' insurance conflict with the principle of equal treatment and equal status.
Cross-border workers pay in just as much pension insurance as their Swiss counterparts but receive considerably lower pensions.
I hope that this unilateral discrimination by the Swiss Government will be remedied in the wake of this bilateral agreement.
I am extremely grateful to the rapporteur for touching on and bringing up this question in his explanatory statement.
A glance at the map shows that these are probably not the last negotiations and agreements we will see between the Union and Switzerland.
That makes it all the more important to abide not just by the letter but also by the spirit of the agreements we are deciding tomorrow.
For that can only be to the benefit of future negotiations and future agreements which we will be negotiating and deciding bilaterally.
Mr President, the bilateral agreements between the European Union and Switzerland are analogous to the multilateral agreement arrangements that have come into effect within the framework of the European Economic Area.
It is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the European Parliament for its own part should support their adoption.
Switzerland' s position illustrates the curious nature of Europe' s present arrangements for integration, and the need to aim to change them, especially now that the EU is expanding throughout the whole of Europe.
The merging Europe has organised itself into a series of concentric rings, at the core of which has been the founder members of the European Union.
First there was the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, which divided in two when France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux Countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community.
The attempt to form a political and defence community came to nothing, but the European Community was created.
The Outer Seven, as opposed to the Six, formed the European Free Trade Association, EFTA.
The expansion of the Six into a Community of, in the first instance, eight, and then twelve, went relatively smoothly.
Since these instances of enlargement, a debate has begun on differentiated integration.
At the end of the 1980s, a plan was drafted in the European Commission whereby the then European Community would consolidate as a federation and the other countries of Europe would join the Single Market via the European Economic Area arrangements.
The first Agreement on the European Economic Area was offered to the EFTA countries.
It was then that concentric circles were being spoken of for the first time.
The EEA Agreement was established, although for Austria, Sweden and Finland it turned out to be a short-lived arrangement.
EEA membership was rejected in a Swiss referendum.
So the only countries remaining in the EEA were Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
Bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for Switzerland.
Negotiations are now under way regarding the future accession of twelve countries to the European Union.
It is strange that neither Switzerland nor any of the EEA countries are among them, although they would be the best suited of all to join. There is a simple reason for this, however.
They do not want to join the present Union, nor that of the foreseeable future.
Now that the Union is growing fast, it is reasonable that it should be subject to internal differentiation.
Just as Jacques Delors, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt, among others, recently proposed, the core countries of Europe should go further along the road towards integration than the others, while the rest of the Union could develop as a confederation of independent states and differentiate.
In this way, we could ease and speed up accession for the countries of Eastern Europe and this would also make membership possible for Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and even Switzerland.
Mr President, Mr VÃ€yrynen' s comments just now about concentric circles remind me a little of a hole with circles drawn round it, looking at Switzerland and Europe.
I hope this hole will be filled sometime in the next few years with the accession of Switzerland to the European Union.
For then we would not have to negotiate and decide seven different agreements but all this would be a matter of course.
I very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years.
But perhaps these seven agreements are a preparation for that debate and I very much hope that just as Parliament will be approving these seven agreements by a large majority tomorrow - or so I assume - the Swiss people will also approve them by a large majority on 21 May in order to make it clear that Switzerland is part of Europe.
I would like to say a few words about the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation because I myself have been repeatedly involved in that area of cooperation with Switzerland over the past few years.
I warmly welcome that agreement because basically it means that Switzerland will take part in the European Union' s framework research programme on an equal footing.
To that end, it will pay a contribution in line with its GDP yet participate fully in the programme.
That is a major advantage for both sides.
Yet there is one drawback: it is the European Parliament and the Council that decide the content of this programme, not Switzerland.
That means that Switzerland, like Israel, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, which also take part in this framework research programme, can only participate in something that is decided over their heads.
They have no say as regards its content.
So I would propose that we take our time preparing the sixth framework research programme and that we at least hold informal talks with the Swiss parliamentarians - just as we do with Israel, Norway and so on, i.e. states which do not belong to the EU but which do take part in the framework research programme.
That is something the European Parliament could organise.
Parliament could take the initiative and invite parliamentarians from these countries, so that we can know in advance what input the Swiss can contribute, what problems they may have, what proposals they may have.
In fact, this would also be a step towards bringing Switzerland and the European Union closer together.
I would very much hope we could do that.
Aside from that, let me thank Mr Carraro again for this excellent report.
Anyone who wants to learn will find a great deal of information in his report.
Once again, many thanks and I hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow.
Mr President, the attendance in this Chamber shows that there is no dispute about this agreement, that Members want it, and I am sure we will vote for Switzerland and for this agreement by a great majority tomorrow.
We want closer cooperation in Europe.
We want more dialogue.
We want to analyse problems pragmatically, find compromises, although on the basis of democracy and the rule of law, and we want, at the end of the day, to vote in the proper manner.
We often see the Swiss people voting on issues and as a democrat I am constantly delighted by the democratic attitude of Switzerland.
The peaceful settlement of conflict - i.e. democracy - versus the declaration of war.
In fact, war never has been a solution for the people of Europe.
We need ground rules for democracy, and in the end we must also abide by them.
After over 50 years of a policy of peace, the German Foreign Minister acting as President of the Council has called on the military to take a decision.
That should set us thinking.
I believe it is important that we use democratic methods to safeguard peace.
Now he, as President of the Council, and the 12 prime ministers have taken an arbitrary decision without any legal basis against a Member State. It has no legal basis and in particular it goes against the European institutions.
The decision with regard to Austria was taken without any de facto participation by the Commission, without the participation of the Council and, of course, without the participation of Parliament.
In my view, that raises a number of problems, especially for Switzerland. And I regard the signs of weakness the euro is currently showing as a judgement by the international community of this conflict within the European Union.
The crux of the matter is that this is a conflict between the prime ministers and the European institutions, a conflict that is putting a spanner in the European works and creating insecurity.
In fact, Austria was always seen as the blue-eyed boy in matters of human rights and democracy.
I think Austria has fared very well with its neutrality over the past decades, a neutral position between east and west.
In joining the European Union we clearly committed ourselves to the west, with the aim of preventing any future military conflicts.
But that means talking to each other, meeting each other, analysing things pragmatically, finding compromises.
I must say that in Austria, too, it is now time to review the situation for, when it comes to their referendum, the Swiss people will be looking very carefully at how the 14 prime ministers decide.
In Austria, Mr Haider resigned on 1 May.
He no longer plays an active role in Austrian politics.
I think it is high time the sanctions against Austria were lifted and I believe the prime ministers should also apologise to the people of Europe for choosing to go down a road that is unacceptable to Europe.
I demand the immediate suspension of the sanctions against Austria and I believe this decision with regard to Austria will be of the utmost importance to future plebiscites and referenda in Europe.
We very much welcome the report by Mr Carraro and his colleagues.
I totally agree with the remarks of the honourable Member, Mr Linkohr, about the quality of the report.
I am also grateful for the authoritative comments made by the honourable Member, Mr Carraro, and by representatives of other relevant committees during this debate and the other contributions we have had as well.
One or two honourable Members have been able to bring in subjects about which they care passionately like the honourable Member, Mr RÃŒbig, and I commend them on their inventiveness.
But it has been a useful debate which has reflected the importance of the subject.
We are extremely satisfied that Parliament has given this verbal approval to the seven agreements with Switzerland.
They are the result of four years of extremely difficult and tough negotiations.
The outcome of those negotiations has been excellent and I am delighted that Parliament has reacted in the way that it has.
The agreements are very important.
They are very important politically and they are very important from a technical point of view as well.
They unblock the stalemate in the relations with one of our closest neighbours and our second biggest trading partner.
They open the way to closer relations and, I hope, to further integration.
Through these agreements the biggest problems in our bilateral relations will be resolved in a number of key sectors: technical barriers to trade, public procurement, research and development about which the honourable Member knows so much, agriculture and air transport.
Equally important, a viable solution has now been found for alpine transit.
The European standard of free movement of persons will also be introduced in relations with Switzerland.
I am glad that Parliament has found the result of the negotiations to be in general so positive but we have also taken note of some more critical remarks, especially regarding cooperation in the fight against transit fraud, cigarette smuggling and other fiscal crimes, where you want to see our Swiss friends doing much more.
Parliament has repeatedly called for better cooperation and the problem will be further investigated I know by a special delegation of the Budget Control Committee.
I want to make it absolutely plain that the Commission shares these concerns.
Losses of several billion euros are caused to the Community budget every year because Switzerland does not apply the relevant Council of Europe protocols on judicial cooperation.
