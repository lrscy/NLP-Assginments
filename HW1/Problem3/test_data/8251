The Commission sees this as being essential.
The Union should not let itself be forced into a constitutional corset that could become too tight for it in just a few years' time.
I believe that the Italian Presidency's proposals point in the right direction.
Finally, I would like to make one more comment about the political difficulties we will face if the Intergovernmental Conference reaches a successful conclusion, something we all hope for and support.
We will then find ourselves in a situation in which a very far-reaching, very complicated and very fundamental treaty will have to be ratified in 25 Member States, and will have to overcome the hurdle of a referendum in a good many Member States.
No one would be surprised if it proved quite difficult to clear this hurdle, particularly in the new Member States.
We need to be aware of that.
I would also like to ask honourable Members to have some sympathy for the position of the new Member States in the Intergovernmental Conference, a position that sometimes attracts criticism.
I hope you will understand that it has not been all that easy for the governments and parliaments of the new Member States, just a few weeks after successful referenda on membership of the European Union, with referendum campaigns based on the Treaty of Nice, to have to explain to their electorate now that the basic principles of their accession to the European Union are about to change again.
In saying that, I have the interests of my Polish friends in particular at heart, as they are adopting a very robust position on majority voting.
It seems to me that there has been a misunderstanding during the public debate in Poland, to the effect that what is at stake is the relative importance of the individual Member States.
That is not the case.
The new arrangements are based on the principle that all the Member States are equal in status.
A decision is only valid if it is supported by a majority of the Member States, which means that each and every Member State has the same rights, and that Poland has the same rights as all the others.
The second factor â the concept that this majority must also represent a majority of the population of the Union â provides the democratic legitimacy needed for such a process.
The larger we become, the greater our responsibility will be, and the more important the substance of the decisions we have to take, the more necessary democratic legitimacy will be.
That is the heart of the matter here.
I hope that in the time remaining this point will influence the debate in Poland.
Finally, I would like to say that in reaching a compromise it will ultimately have to be taken into account that this draft Constitutional Treaty has to be ratified in 25 countries.
I am mentioning that with particular reference to the debate about the size and composition of the Commission.
I would like to reassure this House that the Commission backs Parliament when it comes to translating the essential architecture and balance of the draft Constitutional Treaty into reality, and to achieving the correct relationship between the Community method and the sovereignty of the Member States, and between action at national level and the democratic legitimacy of the Community institutions.
The Convention's draft points in the right direction.
The Commission will do everything in its power to make sure that this process is pursued to its conclusion.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe we are all happy with the quality of this Parliamentâs delegation to the Conventionâs contribution.
Today, our only points of contact are our two representatives within the Intergovernmental Conference.
I would like to ask you the following question, Mr President: do you believe that the little arrangements behind closed doors within one of our groups contribute to consolidating the authority which our two representatives require within this Conference?
Why, Mr President, has the group you belong to not represented the candidature of Mr Duff, which would have had a certain legitimacy, I believe, in terms of representing us in this Conference?
Â Â  Mrs BerÃšs, I shall make some comments in respect of the point of order you raised, but first I turn to our colleague Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
I thank him for the leadership he has shown on behalf of the European Parliament through the work of the Convention and as our representative on the IGC.
We deeply appreciate that work.
Second, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo recently tendered his resignation as Parliament's representative on the IGC.
I was informed of that and I believe I did my duty correctly.
I took that information to the Conference of Presidents.
There, we exchanged views on what the response should be, and the Conference of Presidents â with an accord short of unanimity but nonetheless an accord â decided to appoint Mr Brok as Parliament's representative.
This was done transparently, in accordance with the procedures.
Views not far removed from those you raised in your point of order, Mrs BerÃšs, were expressed; there was a plurality of views at that Conference, and a plurality of positions as regards the different group leaders.
Nonetheless, there was sufficient momentum to confirm the appointment of our colleague, Mr Brok, to that position on behalf of Parliament.
I underline 'on behalf of Parliament'.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that yesterday's meeting made it clear that agreement by December is achievable.
I say that because ultimately there are only a few issues that are really controversial, and they are unlikely to be resolved next year either.
We should therefore encourage the Italian Presidency to maintain its present course and to stick as closely as possible to the text produced by the Convention, because that text represents a balance that would be hard to replicate.
The same also very much applies to the document to be presented in the ministerial conclave next week.
I believe that subject to that condition there is a chance of bringing the IGC to a successful conclusion.
Nevertheless, we need to recognise that opposing forces are still at work attempting to prevent this.
That is something that we have already discussed here in connection with the Legislative Council.
However, this House, too, has quite rightly taken a number of decisions this week about European budgetary rights, as you have pointed out, MrÂ President.
In both cases â as regards the Legislative Council, which is to prevent any transparency and allow the national bureaucrats to carry on working as before, and as regards undermining Parliament's rights in relation to the budget â I am reminded of a series of films, the second of which is called "The Empire Strikes Back".
The empire I am thinking of is the empire of national ministerial bureaucracies.
In the third film in the series, good triumphs over evil, so there is a good chance that we can avert this danger.
At the last but one meeting the Italian Presidency took the appropriate steps to safeguard our budgetary rights, and I hope that position will survive through to the end.
Nevertheless, one thing needs to be made very clear: both legislative bodies must meet in public; we owe that to Europe's citizens in the name of transparency.
And it also has to be accepted that budgetary rights are the key rights of any parliament, and war will undoubtedly be declared if changes are made to those budgetary rights that are unacceptable to Parliament.
I am sure that will also be borne in mind.
Then there are the so-called questions of power: voting rights in the Council, the composition of, and voting rights in, the Commission, and associated issues around the composition of the European Parliament.
I am very conscious that this is probably something that the Heads of State and Government will be unable to sort out until the last night.
However, there are a few issues we need to keep in mind, such as whether the threshold should be raised from 60 to 66, and other issues relating to the Commission.
When it comes to overall willingness to compromise, there is one thing that should not be overlooked, and that is efficiency.
It must be evident that the Council's ability to reach decisions in an enlarged Union must be guaranteed, and that is why the Convention proposed what it did, a fact that we must not lose sight of.
We criticised the Treaty of Nice because we considered that the voting procedure in the Council was not adequate for an enlarged Union, and that must have been clear to our Polish friends from the outset, MrÂ Verheugen.
People in the accession countries cannot now say that the details and mechanisms of the Treaty of Nice were presented in their referenda, and cite those as a source of legitimacy in the context of the discussions in the Intergovernmental Conference.
If this is to succeed, efficiency must always be a priority, combined, of course, at all times with the required degree of democratic legitimacy.
I sometimes worry deeply that many governments do not think, "How can the European Union achieve a majority for a required decision?" but rather "How easily can I block a decision?"
That kind of thinking is a cause for concern, and we should try to resolve this.
With regard to the office of Foreign Minister, which was mentioned at our last sitting, I would like to point out that we are talking about a triple role, and not just a double one.
The Foreign Minister would wear three hats: Member of the Commission, High Representative of the Council and President of the Council.
All three need to be combined if this is to work.
This House would not be happy about an arrangement whereby he was not a full Member of the Commission.
It is extraordinarily important for him to be a full Member of the Commission, because only in that way is it possible to achieve true democratic control and a democratic appointment procedure, and the legitimacy which this House confers.
Nor do we wish to see the Commission losing any of its foreign policy influence, if full responsibility is not given here for the area for which it is currently responsible, which would also mean Parliament indirectly losing responsibility in this area.
For that reason we shall be lobbying hard for these three aspects to be interlinked.
The Foreign Minister must also preside over the Council of Foreign Ministers, because only in that way can we simultaneously achieve coherence and continuity, and because only then will it really make sense to create this position in this way.
Lastly, I would like to make a comment about the review clause.
I would like to remind you that the proposal put forward in the letter from MrÂ Amato, MrÂ Duff and myself should in fact be addressed again.
There should be an opening, with the exception of the "Changes in Competence" and "Charter of Fundamental Rights" areas, which must, of course, continue to be covered by the existing procedure.
However, we should remember something that was considered in the Convention: a review clause with opening and at the same time a secession clause.
The only thing now outstanding is the secession clause, and I think that something is amiss here, and that we still need to consider that.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken good note of the complicated statement of the President-in-Office of the Council.
To put it clearly, what you want is for the text not to be touched.
Amongst other things, it cannot be touched: if 80% are in agreement and then there are 150 amendments which are not supported by a sufficient majority, your duty is to maintain it.
Furthermore, we must remember the governments that were present and participated in the Convention.
The problem is that they have now locked the doors and left Parliament and the Commission outside.
The members of the Convention from the Socialist family met last week and we reached the conclusion that we do not want any backtracking in relation to the Convention.
We expect there to be progress and improvements â we agree on that â and our priorities are: firstly, that the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be called into question; that the secular nature of European integration is a founding principle, and, in this regard, we believe that the text of the Constitution is absolutely correct and must not be modified.
We also believe that the legislative powers, not only of Parliament but also of the Council, must not be weakened in the legislative field or in the budgetary field, and we believe that the legislative Council must be maintained.
We also believe that the economic and social governance of the Union should be turned into a reality, which means that the progress made in the first part of the Constitution should be reflected in the third part, dedicated to the Unionâs policies, and furthermore that the legal basis for the protection and development of public services must be maintained, and then it will be able to be enshrined in a framework law.
With regard to the issues which you have pointed out and which were dealt with yesterday, the Foreign Minister must be a member and Vice-President of the Commission.
With regard to the review, you yourself have said that the Danish Government â and Denmark was the home of Hamlet â after opting-out, wants to opt-in.
We must not close doors; we must provide the possibility of review.
With regard to an issue which was raised yesterday by President Prodi, which is highly topical, we believe, specifically with regard to the budgetary powers â and we address this to Ecofin â that it is time for Ecofin to have a Community culture.
Perhaps we should give the Finance and Economics Ministers a copy of the Treaties.
We cannot systematically act on an intergovernmental basis.
Furthermore I would like to stress that Parliament, with regard to the budget, is as responsible, or even more so, as the Council, and we have demonstrated this repeatedly.
It is unacceptable to try to modify the Treaties by this means.
I believe we should protest and demonstrate our indignation very clearly to Ecofin, which has taken ten years to accept the Delors plan for infrastructures.
Why has this been paralysed for ten years?
Why does Ecofin have power over the European Council?
I believe that this issue is absolutely fundamental for all of us.
Mr President, I will end by mentioning a topical issue, the issue of enlargement.
I would agree with the comments of Commissioner Verheugen: I would say to our current members, because they are already here, that we voted for the Treaty of Nice in Parliament because we wanted enlargement, not because we liked the Treaty.
We never liked the Treaty of Nice.
But what we cannot now say is that France and Germany understand each other, after centuries of concern for Europeans because France and Germany were enemies.
I believe that we should show the minimum of coherence.
I would ask the Commission to maintain its approach in order to demonstrate that nobody is privileged with regard to pacts, and I am referring to the Stability and Growth Pact.
I believe, Mr President, that that message should be made absolutely clear to the Conference.
Maintain your position so that we may have a Constitution for all Europeans.
Â Â  I shall add one remark on the issue of the budget.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo is correct to point out that since 1988 â when we signed an interinstitutional agreement with the Council on financial perspectives â in terms of discretionary expenditure adjustments, the Council has outspent Parliament by a ratio of three to two.
This Parliament has acted with responsibility when given responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for stealing one of the points I was just about to make.
I thank you for your fight to save parliamentary prerogatives in the matter of the financial system.
On a personal note, I am most grateful for Mrs BerÃšs' moral support.
However, the Conference of Presidents has made a decision, which I accept, and I offer my full support to Mr Brok, whose work and qualities we know.
The Council presidency has confirmed its intention of presenting a global compromise before the 'conclave' meeting in Naples.
One hopes that this is a wise decision.
Experience would suggest that it is not at the level of foreign ministers, still less officials, that the final deal will be cut.
The great patriotic questions that so obsess some of our Member States, such as a percentage point here or there on their voting weights in the Council, can only be resolved at 4 a.m. on Sunday, 14Â December, by the top guys.
What the foreign ministers appear to be clever at is unpicking the essential ingredients of the Convention's proposals.
Yesterday several of them challenged the famous clause, which permits the steady development of the Constitution and of a decrease in the number of exceptional, non-normal decision-making procedures.
But there have been many previous examples of this approach in previous and existing Treaties.
Therefore, their consolidation into a single general clause is clear, simple and straightforward.
The presidency is quite right in standing firm on this issue and the issue of the Foreign Minister and defending the proposals from the Convention.
It knows that the European Parliament is right behind it.
We also support the efforts of the presidency to open up the issue of the future revision clause.
However, there can be no trade-off between the two, the clause and the softer revision procedures needed for a Constitution to work well and fluently in practice.
Â Â  Apologies for stealing your lines in advance, Mr Duff!
Â Â  Mr President, we are approaching the term initially set for the work of the IGC.
The Presidency-in-Office of the Council has just reminded us of the main sticking points still remaining: the membership of the Commission, the duties of the Foreign Minister, the definition of the qualified majority in the Council, the role of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure and the procedure for reviewing the Constitution.
These are not minor issues.
Some of them involve the distribution of powers between institutions and Member States, others involve the highly sensitive issue of national identities and others are aimed at not locking ourselves within almost unchangeable institutional structures.
Anybody who imagined that this type of friction would not arise in my opinion was guilty of a lack of realism.
For my part, I am in no way surprised nor disturbed by these conflicts.
If they were the only obstacles to be overcome in order to be able to celebrate the success of the Conference, then I would say, as the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, has done in other places, that today we have a solution to 95% of the problems.
Alas, that is not the case.
Because there is clearly a dimension of this draft Constitution which appears to be as taboo for the Heads of State and Government as it was for the President of the Convention.
They are the Unionâs policies and, in particular, what I called on 3 September, on talking with MrÂ GiscardÂ d'Estaing, the constitutionalisation of the liberal model or, to use another register, the establishment, in a fundamental law for the future Europe, of a genuine act of allegiance with NATO.
The Union only has significance for the citizens by means of the implementation of its policies.
It is not me who says this; it is the Commission, in its communication of 17 September on the Constitution.
However there is never any questioning of the Unionâs policies, which represent three quarters of the draft Treaty.
Do you believe therefore that there is unanimity on this point within public opinion?
That would clearly be foolish.
I will perhaps make some of you laugh by referring, to this end, to the European social forum which has just taken place in the region of Paris.
It would be a great mistake, therefore, to take an ironic or indifferent view of the appeal that has just been addressed to the Union.
Hundreds of debates involving 50 000 young people from every part of Europe has demonstrated their thirst for knowledge, for understanding, for change and for concrete action, expressing, at the same time as totally rejecting the liberal model, a profound desire for Europe.
How should we respond to this?
In view of the continuation of all the Community acquis on the single market and of the Treaty of Maastricht, they will not be satisfied with a subparagraph 2 of Article 3 which promises paradise on earth.
They call for genuine changes, and it is on this basis that large numbers of the public demonstrate their sympathy.
In certain countries, such as France, the debate, which did not exist until 3 September, when we raised right here the problem of the hidden face of the draft Constitution âÂ which you have mentioned, Mr President â has continued to spread and deepen ever since.
To the extent that there are numerous observers in these countries who do not rule out the possibility of a victory for the ânoâ in the event of the ratification of the Treaty by means of a referendum.
As a general rule, you will tell me, we have not reached that point.
For the moment calm still reigns within public opinion in numerous countries.
Well!
Should we rejoice at this?
We should not trust still waters.
The silent unease of today risks creating landslides in the elections of tomorrow.
I much prefer a rather disordered response, though showing generosity and solidarity, and without any chance of things become worse.
This is why I would like, on behalf of my group, to appeal to those of you who shared this approach.
Europe has for too long been built from the top.
That is no longer the case today.
We must demand vigorously that the calls from our societies be heard and taken seriously.
We have little time left to react and give sense to the European project in the eyes of our citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Convention was set up because the Heads of State and Government themselves had failed to make the European Union more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.
National governments took part in the Conventionâs public discussions and have rubberstamped the end result.
Now, however, safely behind the IGCâs closed doors, they feel free again to modify the outcome.
For example, there is an amendment that aims to change the annual budget procedure so that the lowest amount will automatically apply in respect of budget items on which the Council and Parliament have failed to reach agreement.
The Dutch Government is justifying this by stating that in so doing, the Council and Parliament become equal, for indeed, whoever suggests the lowest amount, then that amount is final.
At the same time, the Dutch Government claims, with a straight face, that it is fighting for Parliamentâs full budgetary rights.
One of two things could be at work here.
Either the ministers do not understand the implications of their proposal and are therefore not that intelligent, or else they are trying to fog this issue to such an extent that they need not give public account for destroying Parliamentâs democratic right to reject the budget, a right that has obtained for almost thirty years.
In which case they are leading everybody up the garden path.
Another painful area is the financial perspectives for the multiannual budget.
They have been in place since 1988, but in the form of interinstitutional agreements.
Parliament can breach such an agreement at any time, and thus has an important means of power at its disposal.
The financial perspectives will now be included in the Treaty.
As a consequence, this means of power will be taken away.
What is worse is that some governments, in imitation of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, would like Parliament, from now on, to have only an advisory right when the multiannual budget is laid down, even though we are now equal partners.
Not only Parliament, but also our own ministers competent in all the different fields are at risk of falling victim to the undisguised takeover attempt on the part of the Finance Ministers.
I find it bizarre that these national ministers still have not caught on to this.
Let me give you an example.
If the European Parliament and the Culture Ministers have an agreement on a European multiannual cultural programme, then the Finance Ministers can ultimately wipe this off the table simply by suggesting a lower amount and demanding that legislation be adapted to the budget instead of the other way round.
Who exactly is calling the tune in Europe?
The legislative authority that Parliament has acquired could become an empty shell when it has little power to ensure that sufficient funds are available to implement legislation.
The Heads of State and Government are threatening to replace thirty years of budgetary right by the omnipotence of the Finance Ministers behind closed doors, and this shows little evidence of democracy or transparency.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express my support for the Italian Government in its efforts to conclude the EU Treaty negotiations by the Council meeting on 13Â December.
We all recognise that this is an ambitious timeframe, but it is one that can be met.
The draft Treaty by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention lays the groundwork for the enactment of the new European Union Treaty.
Needless to say the EU governments negotiating this new Treaty have individual concerns and reservations relating to certain aspects of that Treaty.
The negotiations focus on two central elements.
The first relates to institutional reform and the second to policy matters.
From an institutional viewpoint, it is important that there is equality for smaller Member States with regard to representation on the European Commission.
There is broad agreement on extending qualified-majority voting and codecision powers to a range of different policy matters in the domain of both the European Council and the European Parliament.
However, the European Union must be sensitive to the needs of individual Member States when it comes to foreign policy matters.
The European Union should not have overriding power in the area of dictating taxation policy across the territories of the European Union.
Decisions on taxation policy are best left to individual Member States.
That is a view shared by many in this House and also one shared by many European Union governments.
There are serious challenges facing the European Union in the field of justice and home affairs.
We need to cooperate more closely to combat organised crime and international terrorism.
We need to work more closely together to combat the scourge of human trafficking.
However, I do not believe it correct for all decisions concerning justice and home affairs matters to be taken by qualified majority voting. This is because of the sensitive issue of differences between legal systems within the European Union at this particular time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, to return briefly to the speech by Mrs BerÃšs just now, I believe it is particularly clumsy â to put it mildly â that the European Parliament is represented in the Intergovernmental Conference by two Members of the same nationality, that is of German nationality, which demonstrates a point which had often been raised during the Convention, the overrepresentation of Germany within the European Parliament, which is undoubtedly one of the most dangerous consequences of the Treaty of Nice.
I confess that I do not know how the Conference of Presidents takes its decisions, but the fact that this point, which does not seem to be secondary, had not been mentioned, seems to me to be regrettable in terms of the image of Parliament and of Europe in the years to come.
While it is difficult at this stage to pass judgment on the IGC, I nevertheless believe that we should share the Commission's concern, since it seems to me that we are moving from Charybdis to Scylla.
The Convention tried hard initially to study the content of European policies â economic, social, monetary, foreign â and then finally settled, it is true, for a modest institutional compromise.
Having said that, I believe that in comparison, the Intergovernmental Conference is moving even further away from the concerns of the European citizens and becoming a kind of free-for-all on quotas of votes and seats, at the very same time that the European citizens are in the process â and this has not escaped you, MrÂ Wurtz mentioned it â of turning more directly against Europe and contesting the very foundations of European integration, as we have seen with this European social forum which I would personally have re-named âEuropean Sovereigntist Forumâ, given the debates which took place there.
Finally, we talk a lot about the , which are in fact dark tunnels, in which the last prerogatives of the national democracies are going to get lost.
I would, though, like to return to an incident which took place yesterday in order to demonstrate a little to this Parliament the extent to which it can appear schizophrenic from time to time.
One group, the largest in our institution, has reprimanded Mr Prodi for his involvement in Italian politics, despite the fact that all the representatives of this Parliament have argued, during the Convention, for the President of the Commission to be elected by Parliament and that consequently it should be possible to campaign.
I remember that this issue was mentioned several times.
In fact, it would be interesting to be able to campaign for Prodi or for Aznar during the European elections.
Yesterday, MrÂ Prodi simply anticipated a decision which I believe to be regrettable, which consists of politicising the role of President of the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the IGC, held on 18 November, has in particular dealt with a very important problem which the Convention had never really discussed: the revision clauses of the draft European Constitution.
Some people have proposed a move towards reducing the obligation for unanimity in the case of certain revisions, in particular that relating to the third part of the draft, which relates to the Unionâs policies.
Those revisions are unacceptable to the majority because they would impose changes to the constitutional act on minority peoples.
Unanimity must be conserved and differentiated cooperation must respond to any possible situations of deadlock.
I would stress also that this third part contains essential provisions; that it has hardly been looked at by the Convention and that the Intergovernmental Conference looks likely to take the same route.
All of this demonstrates well that this huge ambition to rewrite all the Treaties in one go risks leading to the endorsement of contested policies without real democratic debate.
The meeting of Foreign Ministers has also examined the numerous clauses, specific or general, of which there are many in the draft.
We reject these clauses that seek to bypass the official review procedure, which will rule the national parliaments out of the procedure and will make it even less transparent in the eyes of the citizens.
Clearly, things would be different if each national parliament considered separately, or each population by means of a referendum, had the formal right to opposition.
Mr President, this new revision of the Treaties should have been aimed at resolving the democratic deficit, at bringing Europe closer to the citizens and re-evaluating the role of the national parliaments.
The Intergovernmental Conference is taking this approach, since it is likely to accept the Conventionâs draft in its entirety, which does not deal with the real problem of democracy and which moves Europe further away from its people.
We would appeal to it to put this right: there is still time before the compromise of 28 November.
Â Â  Mr Antonione, the Presidencyâs position seems to be quite clear and is essentially in line with Parliamentâs position; that is precisely why the brokerage endeavour seeking to bring about a high-minded, noble compromise that is in harmony with the text adopted by the Convention must be supported; the overall balance of the text cannot and must not be altered.
Mr Frattiniâs statements on the speech you made in this House give us great hopes, as stressed by Mr Brok, of the final outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference: I remain, therefore, one of those who are passionately optimistic.
I am sure that we will achieve the goal towards which we are all working; I am absolutely convinced that no one will have the courage, no-one will want to risk being held politically accountable for giving Europe a heart attack and shattering a long-held dream.
Mr Antonione, I believe, however, that it is right to bring to the Presidencyâs attention a number of issues, which really do require some thought.
Firstly, the role of the European Parliament.
It would be a serious mistake to limit the role of the House which represents the peoples of the Union; I believe that the provisions of the text adopted by the Convention are appropriate and should not be altered.
Secondly, the composition of the Commission: the accession countries âÂ representatives of which are in this Chamber âÂ have great hopes of the Europe of the tomorrow.
We must not let them down by keeping them out of the Executive.
That is why it is right for there to be a Commissioner with full rights for each country, at least during the initial phase of tomorrowâs Europe.
Now, Mr Antonione, for a matter which has been the subject of much debate, and I feel that its importance must not be underestimated by the House.
I feelÂ âÂ I am absolutely convinced of this, and not because I am a strong supporter of the ChurchÂ âÂ that the preamble to the Constitution should include an explicit reference to Europeâs Judeao-Christian roots.
We must not deny a fundamental part of our history, we must not deny our deepest roots, we must not renounce the Europe of principles, we must not renounce this explicit reference, precisely because we wantÂ âÂ and many countries understand thisÂ âÂ secular institutions.
This has been taken on board, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, by the German Chancellor, the Social Democrat, Mr SchrÃ¶der, who has decided not to block a proposal which seeks to make the individual, the central importance of the individual, the central importance of the citizen, the focus of tomorrowâs Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen said that some of what we are hearing about the discussions gives us cause for concern.
I can certainly confirm that my own group feels that way, particularly as regards the impact on one of the fundamental rights of a parliament in a democracy.
Discussions are taking place on budgetary rights, the essential right of any parliament, which represent the origins and the starting point of any process of democratisation: the right of Parliament, the directly elected representatives of the people, to make decisions on financial resources.
The very foundations of this right are being attacked.
I admit that we were not all happy about the outcome of the Convention, because we had, of course, expected more.
We had hoped for more democratisation, so as to provide greater transparency for Europe's citizens about who is responsible for what, where the money comes from and how it is spent.
More transparency is needed here, and the public have a right to expect it.
In accordance with the outcome of the Convention, we have a financial framework that sets an upper limit and therefore puts a cap on expenditure.
This framework will in future be set by the Council, subject to the approval of Parliament.
That means that there is a predetermined planning procedure.
When it comes to income, the Council has the last word.
Nothing has changed there.
We have criticised that, but that is how it is.
As regards expenditure, and this is the small step forward that we have identified, in accordance with the Convention's draft the final decision is to be taken by Parliament.
This is now being attacked by some Member States and also by the Finance Ministers.
What is this all about?
The message that gives is that this House is not able to make objective decisions on behalf of the public.
What impression do these governments' representatives expect to create in six months' time at the next European elections, if they do not trust their own candidates to vote responsibly on expenditure at European level?
We have already heard the criticism that parliaments do not know how to deal with money.
That has always been the case down the centuries.
But we have never heard it before from a democratically elected government referring to a democratically elected parliament.
This is something new, and it really is intolerable if you take a look at the facts.
The rate of budgetary increases approved in some areas â well over 8% in one area decided by the Council, agricultural expenditure, compared with the maximum increase of 2.5% envisaged for the overall budget â do not suggest that the Council, which up to now has been able to decide on its own, is particularly thrifty.
Just look at the Council's administrative budget for next year.
The Council is claiming an increase of 20.8% for itself, more than any other institution, in order to build up and enlarge its administration.
We, on the other hand, have always kept within our upper limits.
We do not need any coaching on how to manage the funds that Europe's citizens entrusted to us properly.
We will hold our ground across the board if anyone tries to undermine Parliament's fundamental democratic right to set the budget.
They will soon find out that no parliamentarian who takes his job seriously will go along with that.
As MrÂ Brok put it, that really would be a declaration of war on this House.
I would like to thank the presidency for saying that it wishes to respect the outcome of the Convention and to fight for its implementation.
I would like to thank all those national governments that are supporting that.
But I warn all those who are toying with the idea of attacking this right that they are opening themselves up to accusations that they do not want to use the Constitution to extend democracy in Europe, that they do not want to strengthen or further democracy, but that they want to bypass it and undermine it, by depriving Parliament of one of its central rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Antonione, Commissioner, the democratic deficit in the EU is, in fact, often talked about.
Decisions are taken behind closed doors by a circle of ministers, without ourselves, as citizens, being guaranteed political influence via an open debate and without ministers being held directly responsible to the voters for the decisions they make.
That is the deficit that we in Parliament must make up, and Parliamentâs influence on the budget and budget control are crucial in this area.
It is, of course, not the governments that we see taking the lead in demanding reforms and better management of EU finances. It is Parliament that does this.
The proposal by the finance ministers, whatever status it may have, involving a desire to uncouple Parliament from the budget process, is therefore a very embarrassing attack on democracy, and I hope that the EU Heads of State and Government will acknowledge this and reject the proposals.
I hope that they accept the Conventionâs proposal concerning the budget procedure, for it is balanced in a way with which they can be satisfied.
At present, Parliament has, of course, real influence, both upon the annual budget and the financial estimates.
Under the Conventionâs proposal, we should be surrendering a little of the latter form of influence, for we can, at present, say at any time that we do not accept the multiannual budget framework but are returning to annual budgeting, for that is what is specified in the Treaty.
Parliament has voluntarily entered into multiannual agreements, and we can accept these agreements in future becoming law, but on condition that we are given influence over the financial estimates and, of course, on condition too that we are given influence over the agricultural budget.
That is the balance in the Conventionâs proposal.
Parliament gives something and receives something in return.
I also look forward to the Danish Governmentâs denying press reports that it would support one of the finance ministersâ proposals, namely the proposal to introduce unanimity in the European Council when the financial estimates are adopted, for that cannot be right.
We are in danger of deadlock in which the work of reform, including the reform of agricultural policy, is blocked.
Denmarkâs point of departure is that the European Parliament must have greater, not less, influence over the budget.
This is something on which we must stand firm.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, before enlargement was on the cards, the debate was already being held in Europe of whether or not this issue would stand in the way of deepening.
That debate has now faded and we have, in fact, all become enthusiastic about this enlargement.
However, if the IGC debates go the same way, and if people really want to undermine the power of the European Parliament, which is very limited as it is, the question will once again be raised of whether Europe is not being hindered by this enlargement.
In the past, the IGC has not managed to establish efficient, transparent and democratic structures, and at this rate, if the results of the Convention are now being brushed aside, we are at risk of ending up in a debate that is altogether different.
It is a disgrace that people should want to undermine the power of the European Parliament in the budgetary field.
A number of questions remain.
Mr Verheugen, the protection of minorities was a condition for accession, but how will we protect the minorities once they form part of the European Union?
This question remains unanswered because this issue has not been solved for current EU Member States either.
How will the European Union deal with the regions that have legislative powers but cannot intervene in matters that are regulated at European level and are nonetheless of vital importance to them?
Scotland and the fisheries issue spring to mind.
How can this be referred to the Committee of the Regions, given that that Committee is totally inadequate in terms of composition, power and functioning?
Consider, too, the activities of Parliamentâs Committee on Budgetary Control.
The Committee of the Regions is not the answer to the regionsâ laments.
It should be reformed or else abolished.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Antonione, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these debates of ours, of course, follow the emotional cycle of the ICG itself and what we are experiencing now, therefore, is basically a feeling of expectation, and our attention is fully focused on the ministerial meeting that will take place in Naples on 28 and 29Â November, where a proposal to overcome the difficulties and the points of difference and controversy with which we are all familiar will be presented.
In this context, I am also extremely curious to see how difficulties in guaranteeing the principle that all Member States are equal will be overcome, especially as regards the composition and workings of the Commission, how the primacy of national constitutional law will be ensured and, to be specific, the fact that no Community law must provide a derogation from the constitutional law of the Member States.
I would furthermore be curious to see how we would overcome the understandable obstacle that raised its head recently in the clauses, as I had predicted it would and which comes as a breath of fresh air in terms of a general clause and, above all, when it also affects essential core issues of sovereignty.
I hope that this conceptualising is productive and above all that, ultimately, we do not stray from the agenda that has been announced.
There are now areas of considerable concern, for example, it has been said that the aim of this reform is to bring Europe closer to the peoples and the citizens but the outcome that has been announced means the end of the rotating presidencies, without providing any satisfactory alternative.
It has also been said that the purpose of the reform is to enhance democracy, transparency and awareness of the legislative process â aims with which I agree â and yet what we now have before us is the ârequiemâ announced by the legislative Council, which would represent a return to a totally secretive legislative process, hampering public and parliamentary control. as well as constituting a regrettable further attack on the budgetary process.
We fervently hope that a reform of the Treaties will only take place if it is a sound and potentially sustainable reform.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, it may be that we have the promise of clearer positions.
This morning, both the Council Presidency and the Commissionâs speeches were more specific and took a harder line: could it be that they are indicative of what will happen in Naples?
A Europe with clam sauce or a more-or-less Neapolitan pizza which will be served up to the European public for next year?
At this juncture, taking into account the hourly developments like the finance ministersâ initiative, maybe the Council Presidency should review things in Italy with some urgency, if these are MrÂ Tremontiâs contributions, and also, moreoverÂ âÂ and nobody has mentioned this, not even the general affairs ministersÂ âÂ the Italian and European shift of position on Israel just a few hours ago.
I suppose we will take note of it but only in a few hoursâ time, I fear.
At this point, we would like to give two pieces of advice or express two hopes.
For the forthcoming European elections, why should we not devise a political âÂ I repeat, political âÂ initiative and hold a European consultative referendum?
You will win it and you will also be able to raise awareness about the subsequent institutional referenda that will be held.
On the other hand, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, are you, maybe, looking into the possibility of doing something new before 15 December?
Are you trying to resolve the most serious problem which you seem to have, giving more powerÂ âÂ with a US or UK flavourÂ âÂ to the Commission President?
It is not a question of having 15 or 20 or 25; quite the opposite, it is a question of focusing less on ethnic representation and more on issues of programmatic, cultural and political representation.
Have a little more confidence in yourselves rather than continuing to try and produce more rules, extensions and derogations, a strategy which is typical of canon law, not of secular law or the kind of law which creates rules which all can follow, including in the customs of society in general.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Commissioner Verheugen for his address.
He very helpfully reminded us that we had the Convention because of the shock of Nice.
I recall that earlier this week, Mr President, you and I were addressing a meeting of the CBI in the United Kingdom and I made the same point then.
This whole process is one that goes back to the Nice Treaty and the shock of the outcome of the referendum in Ireland â I do not ask you to comment on that, Mr President.
What we talked about at Laeken was engaging with European citizens and explaining what Europe is about to citizens who are feeling remote from Europe.
Yet the headline in the last week was: 'Campaign launched to save Constitution'.
MEPs are reported to be so concerned about the activities of national governments in the IGC that they felt it necessary to take to the streets in defence of the Convention's plans.
We have heard in the debate today that the Convention must be defended against something wicked that is called national self-interest.
Those who have launched this campaign will find it rather difficult to rally the electorate to their cause; according to a recent opinion poll, 61% of the European electorate have never heard of the Convention at all and in the UK 83% of people have never heard of it.
What people in my country and the rest of Europe want is a referendum on the Constitution.
In a Eurobarometer poll published last week of the people polled in the 15 Member States and 10 accession countries wanted a referendum.
In the UK that number is 86%.
Mr Duff is amongst them: his party also wants a referendum.
He and I might differ significantly about the implications of this Constitution, but as democrats we should be in a position to argue our case with the people and to see what the outcome of that debate should be.
What message is being sent in my own country by the continued refusal to listen to the people whose interests we are elected to serve?
I should like to clarify a couple of points relating to the Convention.
I would be grateful for clarification from the Council on the position outlined by the Maltese Prime Minster, who said recently that there had been some agreement from those countries that do not have to hold referenda that they will not allow referenda.
That is not a democratic situation.
I am very grateful to President Prodi, who has accepted that the Constitution amounts to a big change from the basic concept of nation states, a position confirmed by the German, Spanish and French Governments but denied by my own government.
Finally, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Mr President, you and I heard a UK minister putting forward the view that there was nothing to worry about.
A former UK minister said that in the United Kingdom the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have as much legal force as the . The is a comic for children in the United Kingdom.
I rather think that this Constitution proposes something different.
That is why I believe that the people should have a say in it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would specifically like to thank the Italian Presidency for all its efforts to ensure that the result of the Intergovernmental Conference closely reflects the draft Constitutional Treaty.
It will have our support, and it will also have the support of some governments, but far too few up to now.
We would like to see this group growing larger.
Nevertheless I share the concern expressed here by Commissioner Verheugen and also by you yourself, MrÂ President-in-Office.
I share your concern but I do not want to go into individual proposals.
I am concerned about something more fundamental that is amiss in the Intergovernmental Conference.
The majority of ministers have not so far proved equal to the task before them.
That is the simple truth.
There is no will to shape things in the Intergovernmental Conference, but rather a blocking mentality, and that cannot continue if we are to achieve a good result in December.
Almost without exception, the proposals being made represent steps backward as compared with the Convention's draft.
Every time, during every discussion, the IGC does not build on the result of the Convention, it goes back on the Convention.
The ministers are in the process of making things that have been dealt with simply in the draft Constitutional Treaty complicated again and detracting from their clarity and simplicity.
The rejection of the Legislative Council is just one example of this.
They are refusing to give the Constitution the flexibility it needs.
In fact they are going even further, by dismantling the small number of modest links that we incorporated and blocking them, so that unanimous agreement is to be required again for the medium-term financial perspective, and the European Parliament is being deprived of budgetary rights.
In this way they are not just going back on the Convention's draft, they are even going back on the European Parliament's present rights.
That is unacceptable.
The majority of governments do not understand that a Union with over 25 Member States needs to have a new basis.
They are not taking the result of the Convention seriously as a compromise that really is already a compromise and strikes a balance between North and South, large and small, and East and West in the European Union.
We hope that the governments will abandon their blocking mentality and remember that they should be a force for shaping the future of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress two points.
On the one hand, that Ecofinâs proposals represent a step backwards with regard to the current situation in accordance with the Treaty of Nice.
And on the other, that the financial perspectives must be accepted by the European Parliament and that Ecofin's proposals simply establish a consultation with Parliament.
Democracy is also a way to manage disagreements and today the European Parliament has the final word on more than 60% of the annual budget in the event that no agreement is reached with the Council.
In Ecofinâs proposals a kind of automatic mechanism according to which the lowest quantity proposed is accepted replaces the political will of the institutions.
Ecofinâs proposals destroy the balance achieved in the Convention, and the European Parliament, knowing this, accepted a formalisation of the financial perspectives in the Constitution, restricting its own budgetary powers, because its power to reject the multiannual framework and to be able to decide against the Council's position by a very high majority of its Members, in the event of a disagreement in relation to the annual budgetary procedure, was recognised.
Ecofin's proposal to adopt the lowest quantity proposed in the event of there being no agreement removes any incentive to reach agreement.
Whoever proposes the lowest quantity is bound to win.
It is not that this limits the budgetary powers of Parliament, but that it turns the whole procedure into a mere Dutch auction.
My political group had great difficulties and held many discussions in relation to accepting the Convention's final proposal in the field of finances.
All the eloquence of MrÂ MÃ©ndez de Vigo was required to convince us that this proposal represented a fair distribution of powers.
It would not be advisable today to have to begin the whole process again.
This would jeopardise the trust between institutions and would strip Parliament of its capacity to have a say in the drawing up of the Unionâs budgetary policies.
My political group calls for the whole of the finance chapter of the draft Constitution to be taken as an indivisible and non-negotiable whole.
Â Â  Mr President, I am addressing the representative of the Presidency, Mr Antonione.
Mr Antonione, I do not doubt the sincerity of your intentions but some of the expressions you usedÂ âÂ I might almost way which slipped outÂ âÂ concerned me greatly.
You said that some Member States, or government representatives, are standing firm on their requests for change for reasons of negotiating tactics.
There is a fundamental misunderstanding here: the Intergovernmental Conference was not supposed to be a negotiating forum, governments should not have been allowed to adopt positions already presented in the ConventionÂ âÂ as Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr Brok pointed outÂ âÂ positions already rejected by the Convention because more convincing solutions with wider backing had been found.
I am not saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should just have blindly approved the Conventionâs draft, as, moreover, the Heads of State and Government were wise to do in the case of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights; I am saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should purely have checked for shortcomings and contradictions in the Conventionâs draft, as it should be doing now, and discussed how to overcome them.
You also said that the Italian Presidencyâs position is clear: it advocates a text which departs from the Conventionâs draft as little as possible.
However, that concept of âas little as possibleâ is entirely open to interpretation and discretion.
We need to be clear: woe betide the IGC if it meddles with the Conventionâs most important innovations: the powers of the European Parliament, particularly in budgetary matters; the double majority system; the Legislative Council; the appointment of the Foreign Minister.
Do not put the European Parliament in a position where it has to reject the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and call upon the national parliaments not to ratify the Treaty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of these weeks we are shaping the future Constitution of the European Union, and I would like to add that never before has the public had such an opportunity to participate in and influence the creation of a constitution as during the Convention, and we made that possible by means of a European Parliament initiative.
What is at stake here is not only effectiveness and transparency, but also greater parliamentarianism, accountability and accessibility for the public.
In other words, not only the Union's future sustainability but also its ability to cope with enlargement is at issue.
At this point I would particularly like to emphasise once again that the overall outcome of the Convention was, from Parliament's viewpoint, of course painful in many respects, but ultimately it was a balanced compromise that we are willing to accept in the greater interest.
MrÂ President-in-Office, if there is talk about doing away with the Legislative Council, then let me make a perfectly serious observation: if the accession countries had a legislative body that functions as the Council does at present, then those countries would have been refused membership of the EU, because they would quite simply have failed to meet the basic requirements for legislative process, transparency and parliamentarianism.
That is why we are insisting on the Legislative Council.
A great deal has already been said about budgetary rights.
On this issue, I also believe that the agreements whereby the final decision on own resources is taken by the Member States, whereby the Council decides on the multiannual budget framework after consulting and gaining the approval of Parliament, and this House has the final say on the annual budget plan, all that is ultimately a compromise.
It is not acceptable for the informal Ecofin summit at Stresa to attempt to undermine long-standing parliamentary rights, to torpedo them in fact.
Any attempt to restrict Parliament's rights in this area will come up against the combined and energetic resistance of a large majority of this House.
That is why I am counting at this point on the presidency adopting a pro-European position, and to take on the faint hearts and the backward-looking members of the Council in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.
Â Â  Mr President, since I am in agreement with the comments made by Members from my group and several other groups, I wished to use my one minute of this interesting debate to draw attention, like Commissioners Vitorino and Barnier, to a specific issue: the risk of returning to unanimity on such a sensitive issue as judicial and police cooperation on criminal matters.
I have been in this House for almost ten years and remember perfectly well the problems we had before the Treaty of Amsterdam and the total deadlock which intergovernmentality subjected us to in this field.
Today, a degree of progress has been made in terms of effectiveness, but unanimity is still a very significant burden.
It is also logical that the lack of parliamentary control â because in this regard we have lost out, the national Parliaments exercise no control over this field and nor do we â creates fear, because we are dealing with a very sensitive area, but the solution is to make decisive progress towards codecision.
The Constitution makes it clear where and how we must intervene.
We must show courage in order to offer the citizens an area of security which is also an area that defends freedom.
Â Â  MrPresident, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps it is a happy coincidence that the final word from Parliament today will be heard on the content of the Constitution for social Europe.
One of the major steps taken in the draft constitution drafted by the Convention on the future of Europe were the provisions on the social face of Europe, for social Europe.
The Convention's preoccupation with this issue is particularly important because it emerged not from the Laeken agenda but from the initiative of the members of the Convention themselves, and rightly so.
Because the peoples of Europe are much more interested, I believe, in the announcement of the objective of full employment, in strengthening social dialogue and in reinforcing the legal basis for public utility companies or for public health, than in whether there will be 13 or 23 Commissioners or if Europe will have 1 or 2 ministers for foreign affairs.
The Intergovernmental Conference will need to respect the Convention's text. It will need to intervene to improve one thing.
To harmonise the wording between the first and third part of the draft, because we cannot talk of full employment in article 3 and of a high level of employment in part three. '' [nothing really changes] must not become the slogan of this Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking you for the requests that you have made in the context of this debate and to say, as I have done on other occasions, that we consider them precious contributions to the work that the Presidency is doing in order to reach an objective that I think could be considered âÂ judging by what has been said in the overwhelming majority of speeches by the Members of the European Parliament âÂ of common interest.
As regards the specific issues, quite frankly, I believe that today's speeches have retraced our debate of last week, so there have been no new developments and I can only reiterate in exactly the same way some points upon which I have already given my response.
The Italian Presidency does not accept any intervention from Ecofin âÂ to be quite clear and specific on an issue that you have raised âÂ since it believes that no Council, not even Ecofin, is entitled to present amendments.
If a representative of the Intergovernmental Conference wishes to table proposals which might also emerge from the Ecofin debate, it will do so on behalf of the government that it represents but not on behalf of Ecofin.
I believe, therefore, that, from this point of view, my answer must be the same as that I gave in the past meeting.
As regards our commitment to safeguarding the fundamental role of the European Parliament, and of parliaments in general, I continue to stress that we believe this to be an essential point.
On a more general note, as regards the issue of whether proposals made by governments can be discussed, I have to say that it is difficult to imagine the Presidency totally and absolutely refusing to consider proposals that governments may wish to present.
Frankly, I do not believe that is possible.
Moreover, it is not as if your representatives âÂ the representatives of the European Parliament to the Intergovernmental ConferenceÂ âÂ acted any differently from the Presidency; it is not as if the two representatives had got up and walked out because some governments wanted to reopen the debate on issues already discussed in the Convention.
This is a phase of negotiation âÂ I reiterate to Mr Napolitano âÂ that I frankly believe to be normal and natural.
I cannot see how else we could proceed.
Rather, I want to stress that the work you are doing in support of our undertaking not to depart from the spirit and from the recommendations that emerged from the work of the Convention is fundamental.
Surely, however, it cannot be imagined that the Intergovernmental Conference is meeting simply to ratify work that has already been completed, valuable and important though that work is, which some governments clearly feel could be improved upon.
The IGC is proceeding in this direction and I genuinely hope that, with everyone's efforts, we will be able to achieve that important, valuable result which, I repeat, is a legacy we all share.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment briefly on two contributions that I thought were particularly important.
First, I would like to respond to MrsÂ Maes.
I believe that she made a very important point during the debate when she said that it is now also necessary to demonstrate that enlargement is not a problem for deepening.
This is a very old issue and it has certainly not yet been resolved yet, and I would like to take this opportunity to say once again to our future Member States that it is now up to them to demonstrate that these fears are unfounded, and to show that enlargement and deepening can perfectly well go hand in hand.
I must say, however, MrsÂ Maes, that the example you chose was not a particularly apt one.
The new Member States were not involved in the attempt by the Ecofin Council to limit Parliament's budgetary rights.
They really did not play any part in that attack, but that does not affect the fundamental problem.
The second person I would like to respond to is Klaus HÃ€nsch.
I think he is quite right in his analysis that what we are presently dealing with is a question of political will.
It is not as if the problems are insurmountable.
It is not as if any major new issues have emerged in the debate over the last few months.
Everything that we are now considering was discussed thoroughly and in detail by the Convention, and after an in-depth discussion a decision was taken which we are convinced everyone can live with.
I would like to leave you with one final thought: we need to become aware what the alternative is.
You always need to consider what would happen if we cannot achieve anything and the Constitutional Treaty fails.
That would imply more than the failure of any other legislative project.
It would mean the failure of something absolutely central to the integration project, and the consequences would not just be legal ones.
It would be a fatal mistake to imagine that we could then just continue on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
If the Constitutional Treaty failed, it would create whole new political scenarios in the European Union, which could even have a disintegrating effect within the Union.
That is why we bear such enormous responsibility, and that is why it is so important to bring this project to a conclusion.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen.
The vote on the motion for a resolution will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The representatives of the European Council and of the European Commission have not concealed their concern about the disagreements which have emerged at the Intergovernmental Conference within the framework of the discussion about the new 'Constitutional Treaty' of the ÎU.
However, the disagreements are about completely secondary issues which do not change the reactionary nature of the text.
They are concerned about the role of the foreign minister, without any of them contesting the militarisation of the ÎU and its cohesion with ÎÎÎ€Î.
No-one is concerned about the further cession of national sovereignty, but they are concerned about exactly how the power is to be redistributed.
Not a word against the deification of the 'market economy' or against the strengthening of repressive mechanisms, while the European Parliament is only worried about the role reserved for it.
In other words, everyone is fighting their own corner.
In all events, some concern is being expressed about the outcome of the referenda (where they are being held), which shows they are worried about increased grass-roots dissatisfaction, despite the misleading propaganda and the results of the referenda so far.
The peoples do not need a 'Euro-Constitution'; they hardly even need a European Union.
They must step up their fight to defend and broaden their rights and demolish the structure being constructed by the exploiters in order to finally change society.
Â Â  The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Euromed.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to illustrate to this House the results we expect from the sixth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will be taking place in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003.
Even before taking over the six monthsâ presidency of the Council of the European Union, Italy had a clear understanding of how big a part the outcome of the Naples Conference would play in the overall assessment of its Presidency.
Indeed, within the overall external relations framework of the new enlarged Union, relations with the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean continue to occupy a significant place and act as a firm point of reference.
From the outset, the Barcelona Process has provided a means of measuring the state of health of these relations, often serving as a metronome regulating the pace of the dialogue between the two shores of our common sea and acting, therefore, as a force regulating âÂ and, above all, driving forward âÂ the dialogue itself, insofar as this has been possible in view of the events in the Middle East over the years.
In the run-up to the Naples Conference, Italy has been able at all times to count on the fruitful cooperation of all the partners, who, without exception, have demonstrated in recent months that they share our deep expectations that Barcelona VI should genuinely be a time of unmistakable reinvigoration of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
This need for reinvigoration is rooted conceptually in the Valencia Action Plan approved under the Spanish Presidency in April 2002. It was confirmed by the ministerial conference in Crete last May under the Greek Presidency and has been taken by us as a clear indication of the mandate to give shape to the common undertaking to place the Barcelona Process on a more solid footing.
This seems even more necessary today, when the Union enlargement process on the one hand and the situation in the Middle East on the other are giving rise to a strong demand for Europe on the part of the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
The European Union has, in the meantime, already given an initial vigorous and cohesive response by launching the new neighbourhood policy, in which it sets out a new unified concept for its external relations with neighbouring areas.
It has also launched a more incisive policy on respect for human rights and democracy which, thanks, not least, to the substantial contribution made by the Commission, is already being implemented.
It is in this new and promising context that the Italian Presidency intends to discharge its great responsibility fully by putting every possible effort, and all the energies that such an event requires, into the Naples Conference.
This reinvigoration that we have in mind will only, however, be worthy of this name âÂ it will, in other words, be qualitative âÂ if it is able to restore to us a vital, dynamic Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. This exercise must not just involve officials and policy-makers but must ultimately be addressed to public opinion in our countries.
It is worth specifying at this point that âa solid footingâ means something very simple in this context: giving the Barcelona Process the instruments, structures and mechanisms that will bring the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership into contact with public opinion, giving it the ability to have a positive impact on everyday life and to support and respect the various different viewpoints.
It is only in this way that a genuine, strong partnership between the two shores of the Mediterranean can be consolidated.
In this perspective, the outcome that we, the 35 Euro-Mediterranean Partners, hope to see emerge from the Naples Conference is an enhancement of the Barcelona Process through three new instruments designed to bring the Partnership into closer contact with the keenest aspirations of civil societies in the region.
I am referring, firstly âÂ and I am particularly pleased to be able to do so here today âÂ to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which will be given a place with consultative functions in the Barcelona Process; secondly, to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations; and, lastly, to the new institutional and operational structure that the Partners will be deciding on for the future of the Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Fund, which was set up within the EIB just over a year ago to promote investment in the private sector âÂ in particular small and medium-sized enterprises âÂ in the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
We are certain that these measures would give the Partnership a powerful boost, allowing it to forge ahead independently and giving it a capacity for action generated by the demands of civil society as conveyed through the parliamentary channel, by virtuous circles nourished by the mutual respect that synergistic interaction between cultures can instil, and, lastly, by a financial institution that is increasingly in tune with the specific needs of beneficiary countries and endowed with a wider and better organised range of instruments through which to act.
These are the underlying reasons and concerns to which the three key priorities set for the Ministerial Conference in early December correspond, priorities which we have interpreted in the light of the building of a reinvigorated partnership between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The events of recent months have shown this to be increasingly essential if conditions of peace and political, economic and social stability are to prevail in the region.
In this respect, the formal inclusion, with consultative functions, of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in the Partnership framework is vitally important, since it is the Assembly, first and foremost, that will be entrusted with the task of bringing the Barcelona Process closer to public opinion and thus making good the participation deficit and, even more importantly, the communication deficit that the Barcelona Process has undoubtedly been labouring under thus far.
We see the Foundation for Intercultural Dialogue as a structure that âÂ combining pragmatism with a sense of perspective âÂ can act as a catalyst on all the initiatives seeking to develop dialogue and mutual understanding on the basis of the âGuiding Principles for the Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisationsâ approved by the Crete Conference.
The Naples Conference itself will have the task of sanctioning the creation of the Foundation and, we hope,Â makingthe choice of location official at the same time.
Finally, we consider it to be fundamentally important to improve the operation of the FEMIP by tailoring its instruments more closely to the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses and the private sector.
Naples will be focusing mainly on these issues, but there is more: the Conference will have the added objective of confirming the undertaking to develop the Partnership in political and security matters as well, introducing fuller cooperation on the ESDP and more in-depth dialogue on the particularly thorny issue of terrorism.
As regards the economic dimension, Naples will âÂ amongst other things âÂ provide an opportunity for convergence and evaluation of the results of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Trade held in Palermo in July 2003. It will also give us the chance to consider the outcome of the first Euro-Mediterranean Conference of the Ministers for Agriculture which will be held in Venice on 27 November, and the Conference on Investment, Infrastructure and Energy which will be taking place immediately before Barcelona 6, on 1 and 2 December 2003.
The social and cultural agenda will, inevitably, largely be taken up by the debate on the Foundation but it will certainly provide an opportunity to assess the progress made since the launch of the regional programme on Good Governance and the Strengthening of the Rule of Law, which is a crucial factor for the future of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the fields of justice, policing and immigration policy.
The debate on this last issue, in particular, will underline the importance of adopting a balanced approach to the management of migratory policy, which, if properly oriented, could make a positive contribution to the socio-economic growth of the entire region.
Again with the objective of bringing the Partnership closer to public opinion, the Naples Conference will welcome the launch of cooperation between the regional authorities in the countries on the two shores of the Mediterranean, a process in which the forthcoming interregional conference in Palermo will be an important landmark.
Moreover, Naples should also take note of a mechanism for the involvement of civil society, the special Forum that will be held in that city on the eve of the Conference. The Forum will be open to a wider range of participants and be structured coherently in such a way as to increase the impact and profile of the exercise.
Finally, the Conference will record the conclusions of the meeting of the bodies representing the social forces which has just taken place in Malta under the auspices of the European Social Committee.
All this will be included in the powerful message which, we trust, will be sent out from the Naples Conference.
To achieve these objectives, we are working to ensure that the positions of all the Euro-Mediterranean Partners on these issues converge at this event.
We are doing so in a spirit of pragmatism and following a strategic approach that should make it possible to reconcile diverse interests in order to build and nurture âÂ in the new conceptual framework of the Wider Europe âÂ a more solid relationship between the two shores of the Mediterranean.
On this point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can say that we are on the right road.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is a good opportunity to talk about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, better known as the Barcelona Process â a few days before the Mediterranean conference of foreign ministers in Naples.
Through its opinions and resolutions adopted ahead of foreign ministersâ conferences, Parliament has made important contributions to the development of this Partnership.
It was the driving force in fostering cooperation between the parliaments of the Euro-Mediterranean area.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the working party has now reached agreement on a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Commission looks forward to welcoming it in Naples as an advisory body and as one of the institutions of the Barcelona Process.
What role is it to play?
It is the view of the Commission that the Assembly will effectively promote respect for human rights and democratisation in the region.
The communication which the Commission published on this subject in May was welcomed by Parliament and the Council.
We will now be discussing with our Mediterranean partners the action plans that will be implemented with MEDA Programme funding to bring about concrete improvements in human rights and democracy in all partner countries.
The Euro-Mediterranean area is one of the regions of the world that are probably the most seriously affected by the risks of the twenty-first century, be it terrorism, trafficking in human beings, drugs, the problems of globalisation or environmental hazards.
It is important for Europe to show solidarity with its neighbouring region in this situation.
Solidarity by helping our partners to face these challenges in a way that is compatible with respect for human rights and democratic principles.
But we cannot achieve more than our partners themselves want.
That is why political reforms must be an essential part of the plan.
The new new neighbourhood strategy that will be debated in this House this afternoon sets out very precisely what we can do to get greater progress in political and economic reform in the region.
I do not want to say anything about that now, as there will be ample opportunity this afternoon.
I would like to point out that we have made progress on a number of fronts, which will be evaluated in Naples, and on which further progress will have to be built.
I would also like to point out that North-South integration alone is not enough.
We must also continue to support integration between our partners.
Here, too, there has been progress in some areas but I am sure we should encourage them to further efforts.
Let me say in conclusion that intercultural dialogue must play a special part in our entire concept.
The importance of intercultural dialogue was recognised very early in the Barcelona Process and it has found expression in joint programmes to assist the development of cultural heritage, audio-visual co-productions and youth exchanges.
In the run-up to the Valencia conference of foreign ministers, the Commission put forward the proposal, which was finally approved, to complement these programmes with an independent Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations.
I am very pleased that we are close to agreement and I hope that agreement can also be reached at the Naples conference on the location of the Foundation.
All the candidates, Rome, Valetta and Alexandria, have points in their favour and I do not want to express an opinion on them here, only to point out that it is important that the Foundation should be able to begin work by the middle of next year.
It will make an important contribution to raising the profile of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and increasing its visibility and importance for the population.
Â Â  Mr President, the transformation of the Parliamentary Forum on the agenda for the Naples Summit on 2 and 3 December into a Parliamentary Assembly will be an extremely significant political development, as the House has seen from the ACP experience.
The Parliamentary Assembly is an instrument for political cooperation which both reminds the Member States of their responsibilities precisely through parliamentary measures and gathers strength for new measures.
The next step in Naples must be swift action on the part of the Council to implement the decisions already taken during the Valencia Ministerial Conference, especially the initiatives based on culture and dialogue between societiesÂ âÂ both bilateral and multilateral initiativesÂ âÂ in order to reinvigorate the neighbourhood policy which is the key to the balance and development of the Mediterranean area.
The transformed institution will, moreover, have to adopt a working model for which we can all see the need.
Our decisions must be put into practice for, in this area, we must admit that we have failed somewhat.
If we consider the Barcelona process, Meda, Meda II and the Valencia Conference, and the past and present expectations raised by these developments, it may be that we have failed somewhat in implementing all the decisions taken.
A great deal of work has been accomplished but, without a doubt, there is still some to be completed, and the Assembly is clearly the right body to verify whether we have observed and achieved the objectives we set ourselves, particularly as regards the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, for a genuine, coherent, effective Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must fully incorporate not just the social and economic dimensions but respect for and promotion of human rights as well.
Point by point, we would like to mention a number of developments that must be included on the agenda and seen as priorities.
Firstly, a programme for supportive cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean in the fight against terrorism and international organised crime.
We need to introduce specific measures to stem this flow ofÂ âÂ often forced âÂ migration, which is a tragedy for mankind.
Secondly, we need to verify the forms of development of the section provided by the EIB for the Mediterranean and the Middle East as an instrument for supporting the goals set by the new strategy, with the financial participation of other Mediterranean countries; I would point out that this Assembly expected a bank to be an active operator in the area.
Thirdly, we need to insist on the development of south-south relations.
In my opinion, the Agadir agreementis an important means of creating a genuine free trade area.
Fourthly, the procedures of the MEDA regulation need to be streamlined in order to increase the effectiveness of the project.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Antonione has already pointed out that the Assembly which is to take place in Naples is extremely important in terms of the decision to turn the Parliamentary Forum into a genuine Assembly, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures.
I believe that, alongside our work on these goals, we must reassess the Euro-Mediterranean policy in the context of the more general neighbourhood policy, which, at last, places the eastern dimension on the same level as the southern dimension.
This is the signal we must send to our consultative partners and we want the regional dimension of the Barcelona Process to be strengthened in the action plans to address cultural and human relations, economic and trade aspects, social aspects, rights and security.
I believe that we should preserve the complex nature of the Partnership, which has become very condensed and one-dimensional, focusing purely on free trade.
As regards human rights and democracy, I feel we must stress that these are not just options; these dimensions must be integrated into the strategy and, above all, incorporated into our approach to combating terrorism, for, in order to combat terrorism, we have to break not just the vicious circle of terrorism and war but the vicious circle of terrorism and consolidation of authoritarian regimes as well.
In doing this, I believe it is possible to launch democratisation processes with due regard for human rights in these countries too, as called for by the fundamental United Nations development agency report, which we should take as our guide in relations with these countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly welcome the policy of good neighbourly relations proposed by the European Commission and the report which will be discussed this afternoon, as a basic instrument for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
I would also welcome the initiative to turn the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a parliamentary assembly.
Please allow me, Mr President, to refer specifically to the relations which should be established or improved with a State of the southern Mediterranean.
I am referring to Libya, where I recently had the opportunity to chair a delegation from my parliamentary group.
The United Nations Security Council's sanctions on Libya were lifted in September and work is ongoing on resolving the issues relating to the compensation for the UTA aircraft and the attack on the discotheque in Berlin in 1989.
Libya is present as an observer in the Barcelona Mediterranean process and has not been integrated into it.
As the Prime Minister, Mohamed Ghanem, said, Libya is taking the route of progressive privatisation of its economy and putting an end to state control.
It is also prepared to increase its fight against illegal immigration, which is taking place throughout the length of its 2Â 000-km Mediterranean coast.
In any event, it will be difficult for the fight against illegal immigration to be carried out if there is no effective cooperation with the States of the European Union and in this regard, we believe that the European Union must reconsider its relations with Libya.
This cannot naturally take place without demanding, furthermore, respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty and also the abolition of amputations, which are practices which still exist in that country, at least in a legal sense.
Â Â  Mr President, it is first of all impossible to ignore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, since it is dramatic for their populations, and also prevents any development of the Euromed partnership.
Only a fair and lasting solution can allow peace to be established in the region.
Only an end to the Israeli military occupation, the destruction of the wall of shame and the creation of the Palestinian State beside the Israeli State, will lead to peace and put an end to the unbearable and murderous chain of events suffered by the occupied Palestinian population as well as the Israeli citizens.
A glimmer of hope has been offered by the so-called Geneva accords, negotiated over more than two years by the delegations led by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo.
It would be appropriate for the Foreign Ministers meeting in Naples to offer their support for this plan which demonstrates that there are interlocutors on both sides seeking a fair peace, in contrast to what the politicians, in particular the Sharon Government, ceaselessly demonstrate.
The Euro-Mediterranean framework may be a valuable asset in terms of contributing to the establishment of a climate of trust allowing genuine dialogue.
A first signal would consist of high-level delegations from both the Union and from the Arab countries in particular attending the official signing of these agreements on 1 December in Geneva, on the very eve of the ministerial conference.
Another undeniable sign would be for the Union to apply all its efforts to persuading the Quartet to support this initiative as well.
With regard to the conferenceâs tasks in general, the fact that Europe is concerning itself with its future neighbours, particularly in the south, is a good thing, as is the announcement of a Foundation for dialogue between cultures, the creation of which still depends on the allocation of financial resources.
Nevertheless, the orientations proposed by the Commission in its preparatory communication are still worrying.
It is not certain that the new neighbourhood policy is sufficient to instil âa new dynamism into the Barcelona processâ, since the approach of simply integrating these countries into the great European market means imposing liberal formulae on them, without taking account of their specific characteristics or the serious economic and social problems they are facing.
Since this model is being increasingly criticised, and since even the French proposals for a relaunch of the partnership mention âconsequences which could have a serious destabilising effectâ, the Commission is not challenged at any point.
Without taking account of the impact study of the free trade area which it itself has launched, it is moving in the opposite direction by enhancing the reciprocal liberalisation of agricultural and service exchanges.
As for the call to turn to the private sector, it still falls far short of the needs of the Mediterranean countries.
This short-term thinking is extremely dangerous.
All of this means that we need joint construction in the Mediterranean, otherwise the almost constant stigmatisation and humiliation which the Arab-Muslim world, in particular, is subjected to, in addition to inequalities, can only feed religious fundamentalism or the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups.
I will end with two further challenges: we must put an end to the obsession with security and establish freedom of movement.
With regard to human rights, we should establish genuine specific mechanisms.
I would like to express my solidarity with Radhia Nasraoui, the Tunisian lawyer, who has just begun a new hunger strike.
Â Â  Mr President, it was in Barcelona, the capital of my country, that the process of bringing the peoples of the two sides of the Mediterranean closer together began, eight years ago now.
At that time, let us remember, the declaration at the origin of this process gave us great hope.
Today, unfortunately, things are very different.
The international context has seriously deteriorated and one of the theatres of crisis, one of the most important, is located precisely on one of the coasts of this sea across which we propose building bridges.
What in Catalan we call , that is, disenchantment, is today the general dynamic.
The living conditions of the peoples of North Africa have not improved in any respect.
The Andalusian coasts regularly wash up the bodies of unfortunate North Africans who have fled misery in their notorious rafts.
This human tragedy will only come to an end if we deploy all the necessary means to help these people to establish their own social, cultural and economic development.
Here, excessive liberalism is quite simply murderous, and I am not sure that the creation of a free trade area will be the solution to these evils.
Neither have we seen any real progress towards democracy and the promotion of civil society.
Our individualist societies are constantly refining individual rights.
That is all very well!
But we must not forget collective rights.
Please allow me to mention here the issue of the Western Sahara.
I have the feeling that the market here could affect the legitimate rights of these people to self-determination, despite the promises of the United Nations.
The legitimate representatives of the Saharan people now accept the new draft solution advocated by Kofi Annanâs special envoy.
Morocco, the occupying power opposes it.
We must demand that Morocco accept this plan before anything else.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe we can say with satisfaction that the European Parliament has worked to ensure that Euro-Mediterranean relations are a priority with the European Unionâs foreign policy.
This very afternoon we are going to deal with the strategy for a broader Europe â the Napoletano report â in which we point out the strategic importance of a more solid and global relationship with our Mediterranean partners and neighbours.
Within this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Naples is going to conclude an objective which has long been pursued by this Parliament, which is the transformation of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a genuine assembly.
I believe that this represents a clear message in favour of strengthening this relationship in all areas and it must have a fundamental objective, which is to guarantee that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation functions correctly, because this new assembly will allow for the monitoring of the correct application of the European Union's association agreements with each and every one of our Mediterranean partners and that monitoring has been widely requested by the European Parliament.
Given the broad content of each of these agreements, which includes clauses of a political nature, which go beyond the purely economic elements, the task of the assembly in practice would be the political control of relationships between each side of the Mediterranean.
From now on, I believe we must make progress in four areas.
Firstly, facilitating freedom of exchanges.
The closer we get to establishing an area of free trade, the more we will contribute to economic and social development, facilitating the emergence of positive synergies.
Secondly, on the definitive implementation of a Euro-Mediterranean cultural foundation, and I hope that this conference will adopt specific decisions in this area.
Thirdly, we must combat human-trafficking mafias more decisively, and this involves more active participation in the fight against illegal immigration.
Finally, Mr President, I believe we must not forget countries which are not part of the Barcelona process â I am referring to Libya and Mauritania.
Parliamentâs delegation for relations with the Maghreb is going to make them a priority in its efforts over the coming weeks and months.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that I believe there are reasons for us to be happy with this impulse, which will be given institutional shape in Naples, and which will allow us to work on new initiatives.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that this debate must be seen in relation to the one we are going to hold this afternoon on relations with the new neighbouring countries.
I believe we are at a key moment to relaunch those aspects which have made least progress in relation to the Barcelona agenda.
And of these I am concerned in particular with the cultural and human fields.
I believe we must make a great effort here.
There is a field in which we could make this effort, if we are able to work on it in all its complexity: movement of people and immigration.
We should try to make immigration a factor which strengthens relations and the stability between countries of origin and destination.
We should create positive dynamics which could have an effect in economic terms, introducing concepts such as âmobilityâ, which is more suited to our times than the rigid and bureaucratic rules with which we intend to manage immigration.
We should reintroduce onto our agenda the concept of âco-developmentâ.
We will be able to do a lot of work in this field, creating European Erasmuses or supporting local cooperation in many fields.
On the basis of this global perspective, we could effectively combat illegal immigration and its most horrendous aspect, which has brought us horrifying images, such as the arrival of bodies, one after the other, on our coasts.
We could combat illegal immigration organised by human traffickers.
A new agenda, based on the proposals of the Commission and the Greek and Italian Presidencies before Thessaloniki, in relation to immigration and the countries in which it originates, could strengthen the human and cultural pillar of the Conference.
Furthermore, so that the people who live amongst us can be a factor in stability and the promotion of our values, we must also work on our integration policy.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to place the emphasis on an important aspect of the preparation of the Naples meeting and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Italian Presidency on having paid particular attention, as is very logical, to the Mediterranean dimension of the European Unionâs policy.
It is a question of enhancing and applying the Euro-Mediterranean investment and association fund, based on credits from the European investment bank, in order to facilitate private investment and private enterprise.
As chairman of the Mediterranean Committee of the European League for Economic Cooperation, for years I have been analysing the economic causes of the backwardness of the third countries of the Mediterranean in order to eliminate the imbalances with the European Union.
This is a key aspect, that is, ensuring growth based on entrepreneurial spirit and taking advantage of the potential in those societies is fundamental in order to eliminate the existing imbalances.
We believe that the fight against imbalances, against economic and social backwardness is largely based on economic development founded on entrepreneurial and private initiative and I therefore propose that particular attention be paid to this and that we follow recommendation no.Â 7.
Â Â  Mr President, from the Barcelona process until today, the whole of the Mediterranean basin has been convulsed by a series of problems, which are not only unresolved, but which in some cases are getting worse in an alarming manner.
From the Middle East conflict to the insoluble situation in the Sahara, from the total lack of control of immigration, with the almost daily tragedies on the coasts of Andalusia and the Canary Islands, to which we can add human trafficking, drug trafficking and fanatical terrorism, which is not only being endured by some of our neighbouring countries, but which is using all its resources to also transfer itself to our European territory, these are some of the serious issues which we should be concerned about, very concerned about, at the Naples conference.
We have common problems and also mutual responsibilities and each party must take on those responsibilities.
Immigration, for example, can only be resolved if, as called for in the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, the countries of origin and receiving countries take on joint responsibility for controlling migratory flows and combating the organised mafias which promote illegal immigration.
Border control is the task of both sides, not of just one.
Development cooperation?
Whatever is needed and more.
But the political and administrative structures of the Mediterranean third countries must behave transparently, and must respect human rights in order to promote easy and productive parliamentary and political dialogue such as that which must take place in the new assembly we are discussing today, so that this cooperation is effective, something which is unfortunately not the case in some of those countries, and I will not mention them by name, Mr President.

Â Â  Mr President, since the reunification of Europe is about to become a reality, even though, as we know, there is still much to do, we are witnessing a page of history being written.
Now we have the Mediterranean on the next page.
To turn the Mediterranean into an integrated whole containing almost 900 million men and women is our challenge for the next 30 years.
In order to respond to this new challenge we need genuine ambition and instruments for dialogue.
This instrument for political dialogue, which we need, is the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the Naples Conference must enshrine its birth, because only political dialogue can forge a genuine balanced, in-depth and lasting partnership.
It is for that reason that the Euro-Parliamentary Forum has been in place since 1998.
But with its informal configuration, it has remained a passive witness, overly dependent on the ups and downs of international events, and hostage to the conflagration in the Middle East.
In Naples, this forum must become a genuine parliamentary assembly in order to acquire a new democratic legitimacy, in order to fulfil its role completely as an instrument of dialogue for peace, stability and regional development.
I am convinced that it will be more than that, because it will also be a new departure point for all Euro-Mediterranean relations.
This is the opportunity to create a new ambition for the South.
The Union appears to have finally realised this, today, by trying to give form to what is known as the concept of neighbourhood.
We must not, however, be mistaken in our objective.
To distinguish and honour these good neighbours may mean that they will never be part of the family.
It is no longer the time for a foolâs bargain for the South.
The free trade area and the credo âEverything but institutionsâ, which prevailed until now within the context of Euro-Mediterranean relations, have been left behind.
At political level, we must implement the future framework for Euro-Mediterranean relations, a free Union inspired by the Council of Europe, founded upon common objectives and shared values: common security, secularity, the rule of law and democracy.
At economic level, we must launch a genuine Marshall plan for the Mediterranean with a view to genuinely establishing this shared prosperity, which was already included in the Barcelona declaration.
Â Â  With an eye on the clock, Commissioner Verheugen has declined to speak again.
We regret that and thank him for it at the same time.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions.(1)
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party and European Democrats, I should like to ask for the vote on Mrs Smetâs report to be moved to the first part-session in December.
The reason is that the translations into various languages of paragraph 13, which will be incorporated into the report, arrived very late and the political groups wish to have the possibility of tabling amendments or calling for a separate vote.
This proposal could not be made in the time available to us, because we followed the procedure under Rule 110a, which is why we are asking for the vote to be moved to the first part-session in December so that we would have the facility for various groups to request a separate vote on this paragraph.
Â Â  â Pursuant to the rules of procedure I will ask if anyone wishes to speak in favour of this request for a report and if anyone wishes to speak against.
Â Â  Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I think that the procedure followed was absolutely right and that todayâs vote should not be postponed.
In other words, we should proceed to vote on the report.
We therefore do not accept Mrs Kratsa's proposed postponement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to inform the House of the problem that I came across yesterday.
I had requested the use of the press briefing room from 3.30Â p.m. to 4Â p.m. to talk about the case of the Catalan separatists who were on trial in the morning before the European Court of Human Rights on the subject of allegations of torture by the StateâŠ
Â Â  â I am sorry, MrÂ Mayol i Raynal, but the rules of procedure are very strict: your request should be made to the College of Quaestors and not to the House.
If you have information to present to the House then you have time slots for that at the beginning of the sitting.
I cannot interrupt the vote for an explanation of this kind.
I hope that you will forgive me.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would just like to inform the House that, in order to avoid confusion between chemical formulae and abbreviations, the English version of Annex I, part I is the correct text.
Â Â  â Do not worry, Mr Lisi. The language services will be informed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would clarify that some amendments voted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have been withdrawn, as shown on the list.
I refer to Amendments Nos 11 and 12.
Â Â  â Indeed, it is, in principle, indicated on the lists.
A significant part of AmendmentsÂ Nos 11 and 12 has been withdrawn and does not form part of the so-called compromise package.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of Parliament's views on this issue and takes them very seriously indeed.
The institution is carrying out a thorough examination of the matter and of the appropriate internal procedures.
On that basis my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, will be making a recommendation to the college of Commissioners in the near future.
She wants me to assure you that we will fully respect our commitments under the framework agreement.
You will be informed promptly of the Commission's decision.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Its aim is to improve traceability in the event of an outbreak of disease, such as the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
The committee believes that batch control systems should be allowed as well as the individual control system proposed by the Commission.
This is the main point of difference with the Commission.
The committee's proposal means that Member States will be able to adopt systems that are in keeping with their own sheep farming methods.
During the debate last night, Commissioner Byrne did not move any closer to the committee's viewpoint.
We agree on the need to improve traceability, but the issue dividing us is that harmonisation of the objective does not necessarily mean harmonisation of the method.
By contrast, the Italian presidency has been extremely helpful, and the Council is now very close to the committee's position.
For these reasons, after intensive procedural discussions this morning, involving the political groups and especially Mr Parish, the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur, we agreed that we should now conclude this matter during the Italian presidency.
The strongest political signal we can give is that we should follow the unanimous vote in committee by a unanimous vote for the report this morning.
Â Â  â Very well, I infer from your statement MrÂ Adam, that this cancels any request for referral back to committee.
We shall therefore proceed to the vote, as you requested.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that, in the context of inter-parliamentary relations, the Knesset Delegation for relations with the European Parliament, lead by its chairperson, MrsÂ Blumenthal, is visiting the European Parliament.
In wishing MrsÂ Blumenthal and the members of her delegation a warm welcome, I would like to stress the importance that we attach to such a visit, in particular, given the current situation.
The tragic events with which the Israeli and Palestinian people are faced on a daily basis, make the resumption of dialogue between these two parties â a dialogue that the European Parliament has always encouraged â more necessary than ever.
This is why, and without wanting to go into detail about the conflict that has been affecting your region for too long, I hope that the meetings that you will have with Members of the European Parliament will be fruitful and that they will be able to contribute to better reciprocal information, so as to better bring about conditions, in which just and sustainable peace will finally be able to put an end to this interminable conflict that affects your region and which, day after day, causes the deaths of too many innocent victims amongst the Israeli and Palestinian populations.
MrÂ Cappato, we are now voting and I would prefer to continue if that is acceptable.
Especially after the announcement I have just made, I do not want to reopen the debates.
Â Â  âGiven the time, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that we postpone the votes.
They will resume immediately after the formal sitting.
I give the floor to MrÂ Chichester.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a little confusion as to why we have been asked to vote twice on this particular Karlsson report for rejection.
Could you clarify the situation?
Â Â  â Very well, you will have all the explanations you require.
For the moment I shall suspend the sitting for a few minutes pending the formal sitting.
(1)
Â Â  . Mr President, we now come to the vote on Amendment 24, the famous NisticÃ² compromise.
There are some translation problems here.
I would like to point out that the English version is the correct one.
Â Â  â We have taken note of your comment, even though I am not sure that the language of the sitting is English.
Â Â  . Mr President, unfortunately I have to report that my efforts to reach a compromise that might also have met with agreement in the Council have failed.
I must therefore unfortunately distance myself from the outcome of the vote and ask my fellow Members to vote against the report.
Â Â  â Very good, we will take note of your declaration, MrÂ Liese.
Â Â  The Moderate Partyâs delegation to the European Parliament has today voted in favour of the report on women's rights and EU international relations.
For us, it is obvious that men and women have the same rights.
The best way of achieving prosperity in the world is through free trade.
It is good that the EU sign trade and development agreements with other countries.
We also think it good that these agreements include clauses concerning democracy and human rights so that the agreements can help improve the situation for the people of these countries.
We do not wish this report to be interpreted in terms of the European Parliament being in favour of trade boycotts against those countries that do not fully comply with the agreementsâ clauses concerning democracy and human rights.
Trade boycotts generally harm vulnerable people in poor countries.
Â Â  The report basically focuses on the ACP countries, as a result of the Cotonou Agreement and on the countries of the Mediterranean, as a follow-up to the Barcelona Agreement.
In particular, it addresses physical violence in Muslim countries, such as genital mutilation, mutilation with acid, public castigation, stoning, so-called 'crimes of honour', forced marriage and burnings.
The other regions of the world are ignored.
The proposal that calls on the Member States, when considering applications for refugee status, to take into account persecution and/or the fear of persecution which may be suffered by women on account of their gender is to be welcomed and fully deserves our support.
We support the report's call to Member States to adopt specific legislation that bans genital mutilation, but we would draw attention to the need for an active policy for the social inclusion of these communities, particularly in the fields of housing, health, education and training.
Discussions with the relevant institutions and NGOs working in third countries with the aim of gathering information on violence against women must be backed up by greater assistance and by better development aid programmes, specifically to ensure women's emancipation.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Lisiâs report concerns the control of major-accident hazards involving the circulation of dangerous substances, particularly where the mining and transport of these products is concerned.
I certainly could not vote against the report and so I voted for it, but I wonder and I put it to Mr Lisi: might not the euro be a dangerous substance which ought also to be classed as a dangerous substance against which we need to be protected when it is circulated?
Without wishing to shock you, Mr President, I am afraid that, in Italy, the circulation of the euro has brought an increase in the expenditure of all the workers and pensioners because its cost is significantly higher.
Â Â  I support this report by MrÂ Lisi recommending the adoption of a joint text agreed on in the Conciliation Committee and updating the Council directive on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances.
We are particularly pleased that the following amendments by Parliament have been accepted, seeking:
- to extend the scope of the directive to cover hazardous substances such as potassium nitrate, which was the substance that caused the explosion at a factory in Toulouse in 2001, the death of thirty people and the injuries of around two thousand;
- to improve the training of all staff working in a potentially dangerous establishment, including all subcontractors, with priority to be given to initial emergency measures to be adopted in the event of accidents;
- to improve the information given to the public, with particular emphasis on establishing a database for land-use planning that will enable the compatibility of dangerous sites with sensitive areas to be assessed;
- to ensure that operators of dangerous plants draft publicly accessible safety reports, containing maps, images and equivalent descriptions;
Given the introduction of considerable improvements in the common position, which led to much greater progress than could have been predicted at second reading, I support...
Â Â  Mr President, last night, I dreamt once again about Mr Fatuzzo the sailor who worked on a cruise ship sailing between New York and the Bahamas from 1963 to 1965.
Since I had to express a view on Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramosâ report on enhancing ship and port facility security, no one better than myself as a sailor in 1963 was qualified to give good advice.
The advice I received, however, is that there needs to be another amendment: in other words, why does Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos not call next time for pensioners drawing their pension for the first time to be given a free cruise?
Â Â  The objective of this Regulation is to transpose into Community law amendments adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and integrated into a new chapter of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), as a consequence of 11Â September 2001 and of the need to protect vessels and to improve maritime security against possible attacks.
This will ensure that the international measures adopted in the IMO for national maritime transport are implemented in a standard manner throughout the European Community.
These amendments to the SOLAS Convention and to part A of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) contains mandatory provisions that are open to differing interpretation and adaptation by the Member States.
Part B of this Code consists of recommendations, but the Commission proposes that some be made mandatory provisions.
Member States will only be able to adopt specific provisions on ports that only occasionally serve international traffic, although provision is made for a possible exemption from the obligation of security checks prior to entry into a port for ships engaged on a scheduled service within a Member State or between two or more Member States, and these must adopt a national plan to implement the provisions of the regulation.
The report furthermore establishes a single national authority responsible for the safety of vessels and of port facilities, it makes the Commission responsible for checks and assessments and entrusts the European Safe Seas Agency with the task of assisting the Commission in performing these duties.
Â Â  The Commission presented the proposal now before us in order to incorporate into Community law the provisions adopted by the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organisation, the definitive version of which was adopted in London (December 2002) by the International Diplomatic Conference of the Governments that are signatories to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS Convention of 1974).
This is an extremely important convention.
In practice, the principles applied to air transport are transferred to maritime transport, with the Member States having to draw up national maritime security plans that lay down security standards and appoint a competent national authority, which will be the sole authority responsible in this field and will have the specific task of guaranteeing the security of vessels, by issuing certificates.
I am aware of the enormous vulnerability of this sector and taking account of the security measures advocated by the report for vessels and port facilities, as constituted by the vessel/port interface, but not for ports themselves properly speaking, I urge the Commission to persevere with its desire to present a legislative initiative to regulate protection of Community ports.
I share the rapporteur's concern about the financial implications of these safety measures and I support her call to the Commission to present a study of this matter.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  â Where security is concerned, there can be neither exemptions nor lax tolerance.
Maritime transport needs to be dissociated from the laws of maximum profit and another International Maritime Organisation created capable of respecting social needs, workers and the environment.
There need to be more regulations and more coercive international laws, and a ban placed on the system of ports of convenience.
The loss of the oil tanker scarcely a year ago, together with its human, social and environmental consequences, remind us each day, from La CoruÃ±ato Calais, of these necessities.
My priority in this area is not the fight against terrorism but that against the maritime hooligans.
I have supported all the amendments aimed at including in the regulation the strengthening of security measures in Community ports, at covering all the personnel concerned, not only seafarers but also all professionals working on a casual basis in port areas, and at extending the scope of the regulation to include ships transporting containers, petroleum products and dangerous materials.
For these reasons, I have voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  Mr Paasilinnaâs report calls for a European information network security agency to be established, clearly and, in particular, combating information, computer and electronic communication line piracy.
However, I believe, Mr President, that Mr Paasilinna would have produced a better report if there had also been an amendment providing more security against pirates who take money from workers, money which the workers should have been able to keep for themselves for their pensions.
It would therefore be better if there were measures to combat the piracy of information networks and to combat theft of pensionersâ money.
Â Â  â The agency that the Council is preparing to put in place is charged with ânetwork and information securityâ.
Its founders are mainly preoccupied with what they call âthe business communityâ and by protecting this little world against âcyber crimeâ.
Certain elements of the aforesaid âbusiness communityâ will probably enjoy financial spin-offs from this matter, for the agency will call upon their services to deliver information security.
We obviously have nothing against better information security.
Since, however, the protection of business secrets in relations between private companies is not among our preoccupations, we have abstained from voting.
Â Â  I voted in favour of this proposal.
Improving the security of networks at Community level, be they public or private, is becoming increasingly necessary, primarily because of the concerns of citizens, businesses and economic operators in general as a result of the genuine 'explosion' that the Internet has experienced.
The almost infinite amount of information available on the Internet, and its amazing capacity for transmitting data, have given users easy and frequent access which, as we know, makes fertile ground for criminal activities, often designed to damage the system, calling into question its reliability and security.
The Commission proposal states, in particular, that âthe Agency shall facilitate the application of Community measures relating to network and information security. The assistance it provides shall help ensure interoperability of security functions in networks and information systems, thereby contributing to the functioning of the Internal Marketâ.
I fully agree.
I also believe that this Agency must be designed to actively seek solutions to the problems arising from cyber crime, which means, of course, looking very closely at the particular situation of risk and greater exposure with which our children are confronted.
Â Â  . âTheproposal for a Council recommendation on cancer screening is particularly important for informing and educating the public, raising awareness about premonitory symptoms, timely diagnosis and more effective treatment.
Alongside proposals for mammography screening for women aged 50-69, for faecal occult blood testing of people aged 50-74 and for cervical smears for women aged 20-30, other urgent actions are needed.
One of these is special programmes in selected workplaces in which, because of the environment, there is a serious risk of cancer.
Another action is special programmes and diagnostic tests in universities and higher education in general, so that watching out for cancer becomes a forced 'routine' from a young age.
Â Â  â Cancer is a terrible disease that affects millions of Europeans and other human beings on the planet.
I have always said, and I repeat, that, in terms of research funds and of methods of treating patients and supporting the terminally ill, society makes insufficient efforts to combat this disease, given its scale and seriousness.
Screening is part of what is required, and I therefore support this, but it does not solve all the problems.
Once the disease has been diagnosed, it has to be treated so as to cure the patient.
Â Â  Around one in every four Europeans (totalling approximately oneÂ million per year) will fall victim to cancer.
This is an enormous burden, both in human terms, for cancer sufferers and their families, and in terms of the resources used in the diagnosis, treatment and care of this disease.
Consequently, the fight against cancer through the programme 'Europe against Cancer', set up in 1985, has been a long-standing European priority.
In the opinion of the rapporteur, my friend and colleague, Mr Mussa, who in the debates received the enthusiastic support of the shadow rapporteurs of all groups, âit is consequently crucial to develop the action undertaken by the Union through the following means:
(a) information and health education for European citizens
(b) carrying out forms of screening which have already proven their worth
(c) periodic checks on the quality of screening
(d) research into the applicability of new screening methods.
The Commission's document will allow Europe to take unified action against what is a widespread, cruel and socially destructive disease.
The urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at European level is demonstrated by the alarming epidemiological dataâ.
In this context, my vote was not only favourable but also enthusiastic, hoping that this recommendation will be adopted because, although it is not legally binding, it is a real political priority.
Â Â  I roundly congratulate MrÂ Mussa on his excellent report on an issue that is a matter of grave concern to us â cancer and its early detection.
This is a terrible disease, which is one of the main causes of death, directly affects many citizens, and consequently also affects their families.
We also know, in particular through studies that have been published, that around one in four Europeans will fall victim to cancer.
Although this is a recommendation that is not legally binding, this proposal must be seen as a political priority.
An indication of this is the overwhelming vote in plenary: 528 in favour and only 6 against.
I also wish to express my satisfaction at all the support obtained in the specialised Parliamentary committee for this proposal, specifically through the proposals for secondary prevention measures that facilitate early diagnosis and which, consequently, involve therapies that are less aggressive and more bearable.
I also welcome the very clear commitment to promoting an aware and unafraid attitude to screening programmes, and also the commitment to the information campaign designed to teach people how to diagnose themselves.
Â Â  Mr Adamâs report, Mr President, deals with the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals.
I voted for the motion: it is certainly good to register the development of sheep and goats too, but the wish expressed to me by a pensioner citizen is that Europe would also concern itselfÂ âÂ and I hope Mr Adam will do so soonÂ âÂ with the registration and preservation of pension contributions paid in by workers, contributions which often, frequentlyÂ âÂ as least, this happens in Italy and, I fear, in other European States tooÂ âÂ get lost somewhere in the process, disappear, resulting in the workers receiving lower pensions than they are entitled to.
We must therefore ensure that years of work are registered and monitored throughout a personâs life.
Â Â  This proposal for a regulation seeks to provide a response, in the current framework, to the need to record and trace the movements of sheep and goats in order to improve identification of affected animals in the event of an epidemic.
This is the system that the European Parliament itself recommended, in its resolution of 17Â December 2000, on the basis of the report by the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease, specifically the priority nature of identification.
Although important, these measures do not resolve the problems facing our agricultural model.
What is needed, in particular, is to reduce the transport and specifically the export of living animals to the absolute minimum, to combat the disappearance of local slaughterhouses, to encourage local production and short distribution channels, to combat the policy of under-investment in veterinary inspection services and to take account of the problems arising from abolishing internal borders.
This regulation raises three important issues for producers, particularly small producers: the proportionality of the administrative and bureaucratic burden, the feasibility of meeting the deadlines set and payment of the costs.
The report proposes some simplification of the system, such as extending deadlines, Community involvement in the future electronic identification system and Community funding of the total set-up costs for individualised identification systems.
Only in this way can we avoid seeing the number of producers leaving the sector increase.
Â Â  The proposal for a regulation sets out a system of individual and batch identification and for the species in question, providing an opportunity for using electronic identification.
The intention is to improve the system of identification and to create a computerised system for recording the movements of sheep and goats so as to allow rapid and precise traceability, which is crucial to monitoring diseases and potential problems or incidents affecting public health.
Since the effectiveness of this technology has not been properly tested in all the Member States, and since it is not practical or economical to apply it in all situations, I believe it is important that the Commission produces a report on the experience gained in this field, which would analyse the economic repercussions of the electronic identification system before it is introduced on a universal and mandatory basis.
I share the rapporteurâs concern at the adequacy and feasibility of the proposal that has been made, I agree with the amendments he has tabled and I can vouch for the concern he has demonstrated for with the large specialised workforce, which is rapidly ageing and has a very low level of income.
These farmers face having to leave the profession because of the increased costs borne by producers, and this is reason enough for the Union to cover the costs of introducing the individualised identification system.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  The report demonstrates the need for a common registration system for sheep and goats, using a database and similar to the systems that exist for cattle farming and pig farming.
A majority of the European Parliament wishes, however, to make an important distinction where this system is concerned, namely in the way it is funded.
The existing systems are funded from fees, whereas the desire is to fund the new system concerning sheep and goats from Community funds.
For this reason, I have voted against the report as a whole.
At a stage when the EU faces the demand for reform of the common agricultural policy, it is unfortunate that Parliament wishes to impose further costs upon the common EU budget.
Recitals 5b and 17a, in particular, make it clear that the costs should be met by the EU.
Recital 5b reads: âThe entire cost of introducing the new electronic identification system should be met from the Community budget since this is a food safety and control measure affecting the whole production chain and since it is the producers who will have to put into operation and manage the systemâ.
Â Â  Mr President, with this report, Mr Blokland calls for freedom of movement in Europe for wasteÂ âÂ urban waste, industrial wasteÂ âÂ and I voted for the motion.
However, I would be pleased if European pensioner citizens were to be considered worthy of at least as much freedom of movement as is given to urban and industrial waste.
As you know, those who receive a welfare allowance, such as hearing- or visually-impaired people or citizens who need constant assistance, lose the right to draw their disability allowance if they travel in Europe outside their own national state.
I would therefore prefer the directive in question to address the movement of pensioner citizens as well as waste.
Â Â  â The shipment of waste is fundamental to the fight in which we, the developed countries, are engaged to maintain economic development and protect the environment.
I therefore subscribe to the line taken by the Blokland report.
I nonetheless rebel against the obstacles that impede the recovery of waste, which â supported by the Court of Justiceâs judgement in case C-228/00 â will penalise my countryâs cement manufacturers.
Thirty-six per cent of the alternative sources of energy used for the manufacture of cement comes from waste, which basically comes from neighbouring countries.
If such shipment of waste were jeopardised, there would be dual emission of pollutants from Belgian cement works; that is to say, pollutants from waste and those originating from the fuel used in the cement works.
This dual emission would be costly and harmful to the environment.
Moreover, cement works would be vulnerable to job losses in regions already badly affected (Objective 1).
That is why I am against the amendments opposing recovery.
To make use of the precautionary principle when the answers are known is an admission of powerlessness to control pollution.
That is certainly the case when it comes to intermediate waste sorting centres, banned because they are unable to monitor the precise destination and traceability of the waste in question.
Â Â  Although progress has been made since the last report, all the Member States were late in responding to the questionnaire (Portugal and Ireland by more than a year).
Progress has been made on drawing up waste management plans, although some countries do not have such plans or are not implementing them, and consequently various legal proceedings have been opened as a result of failure to comply with the directive.
The aim of stabilising waste production to 1985 levels is not affected, because reduction measures have not been defined by the Member States and/or by the Commission, which is urging the Member States to step up the separate collection of recyclable materials and to have sufficient recycling and recovery capacity as well as waste incineration capacity with energy recovery without better processing alternatives.
We broadly support the positions put forward in the report and the measures proposed, particularly those that would lead to countries being self-sufficient in waste processing and to the directive being complied with and revised, in particular as regards conditions for the recovery, disposal, control and use of waste based on minimum criteria that take account of the environmental impact of these operations; regulations on gaseous or other emissions must be equal for all processes.
Â Â  . I fully support the European Commission in its very strict approach to regulating the shipment of waste on EU territory and in EU waters.
Likewise, I commend the rapporteur for his excellent work on the matter.
Many of his amendments go towards tightening up even further the rules and controls.
We are all aware of the devastating consequences on our environment â as well as on animal and sometimes human life â that can result when adequate controls are not in place for the transport of waste products.
In recent weeks we witnessed the attempt to bring a flotilla of decrepit decommissioned US warships through EU waters.
I hope that appropriate legal measures will prevent the remaining 'rust buckets' laden with hazardous waste from crossing the Atlantic to be dismantled in the UK.
Indeed, unless we prevent this deadly cargo from setting out on its journey, it will pass within a very short distance of the south-east coast of Ireland and my constituency of Leinster, Ireland.
I agree that there will be a certain administrative cost associated with implementing the new controls proposed by the Commission.
Â Â  I welcome this Commission proposal, which I believe meets the expectations of the citizens of the European Union both in terms of increasing levels of environmental protection, and as regards efforts for the treatment, recycling, recovery and transport of waste.
The belief that environmentally responsible waste management is crucial is fortunately now widely accepted.
Solid proof of this is the impact on the media that the transport of waste (and pollutants), in particular by sea and inland waterway, has had recently.
Waste operators today â whether they are simply transporters or responsible for treatment, recycling or recovery â must be required to meet the highest possible safety and protection standards and procedures.
To this end, regulations for control must also be established, depending on the type of waste transported and on the way in which it will be processed at its destination.
I also agree with the proposals for a Red List (more dangerous substances) and a Green List (less dangerous substances).
Lastly, I wish to emphasise the importance, in these matters, of constantly sharing information and best practice because of the frequent doubts, of a scientific and technical nature, about the fate that should be reserved for certain types of waste.
Â Â  Mr President, we all believe in supporting measures that help to cure diseases in our society.
It is also clear that medical scientists are very divided on this issue.
I myself believe that there are alternatives to embryonic stem cell research.
There are numerous examples of this and it is not fair to say that those of us who are against this research are against finding cures for these diseases.
The Commission's proposals for funding for research activities, which are illegal in some Member States, are flying in the face of the subsidiarity principle, and that should not happen.
This is clearly a very sensitive issue.
I have tabled amendments to state that we do not support EU funds being made available for embryonic stem cell research in Europe.
The European Parliament having expressed its views, this matter now moves into the domain of the Council of Ministers and the national governments.
Â Â  Mr President, I also voted against the Liese report.
We have to be very careful.
Whether we like it or not, we live in Huxley's Brave New World.
We need to be very careful about the kind of power and leeway we give to scientists.
I find the kind of lobbying that went on grossly offensive, using illnesses such as Alzheimer's â which my father died from â as an excuse to go ahead with embryo stem cell research.
Many scientists have said that in the case of Alzheimer's adult stem cells are more reliable.
It is completely unacceptable that European taxpayers' money should be used to fund something that is not allowed in some Member States.
If Member States want to do it, let them use their own taxpayers' money, not funds that are for the whole of the European Union.
If Mr Ã Neachtain feels so strongly about this, let him resign from his party if his government will not vote against this in the Council of Ministers.
The Irish Government must vote against this!
There is no point in making a lot of loud statements here if the government will not follow through on what it is supposed to do and support Germany and the other countries that are opposed.
That is the only logical and honest approach.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted today to reject restrictions on embryo stem cell research.
I am very pleased that the House has decided likewise.
Unlike the previous speaker, I believe we should congratulate those organisations such as the Parkinson's Disease Society, the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Society and other organisations who worked hard to bring to Members' attention the real benefits that people suffering from those conditions have gained from stem cell research and hope to gain in the future.
This topic keeps coming up in this House and many Members are trying to use the European Parliament to fight a different battle â a battle about banning embryo research and a battle about abortion.
I hope that today's vote means they will leave that aside and recognise that this is a proper matter for national competence in the first place, and that it is quite proper that we should use European funding to finance research which can help tackle very serious conditions.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also voted against todayâs proposal because I cannot support the use of common resources for purposes of research that is expressly prohibited in some Member States.
Precisely because the Member Statesâ individual laws differ greatly on the matter of human embryo research, more restrictive positions on embryo research should not be ignored.
It must therefore be left to each Member State to take its own decision, in accordance with its own laws, about the kind of research on which it will spend money and about the research purposes for which no funding will be made available.
Finally, in view of the fact that, unlike adult stem cell research, there have still not been any unquestionably promising results in embryo research, I cannot understand why funding should be provided from the Sixth Framework Programme.
Â Â  Mr President, my voters do not want their tax money to be used to kill unborn human beings, even if, unlike in Germany, it is permitted for research purposes in many Member States.
For this reason I came out quite clearly against this report as it now stands and have from the outset supported the clear line taken by Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and by Mr Gargani.
We were, however, prepared to go a long way in a compromise motion in order to prevent something worse.
I would like to thank Mr NisticÃ² and Mr Liese for giving this House the opportunity for a compromise that is so far-reaching but which sets limits.
Unfortunately, this was turned down by a tiny liberal left majority of this House and I must make it perfectly clear that that is probably the end of compromises in this matter.
This House is divided on this important issue and I imagine there is the same division in the Council of Ministers.
I do not believe that we should use our in any case meagre research funding to finance such highly controversial research on so divisive an issue; we ought to concentrate on things that are not controversial in the EU and leave this question, to which the principle of subsidiarity should apply, to the Member States.
Â Â  . I voted for the Liese report because it is a moderately pro-science position, as voted.
My mother died of Parkinson's disease and I watched the long-term degeneration of her life.
I hope that future research will help to combat this dreadful condition.
My vote is for my mother, and my colleague Nicholas Bethel.
Â Â  . We welcome the result of today's vote on the Liese report on the 6th Framework Programme.
The issue of funds for collaborative research projects using human embryonic stem cells and stem cell lines was discussed in depth in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who reached a consensus view, reproduced today in Parliament.
This will allow us to continue with this vital research which has the potential to bring relief to millions of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes sufferers.
Several colleagues tabled amendments to the report seeking to express their own, or nationally based views on the matter, which would impose restrictive conditions on deadlines for use of stem cells or stem cell lines.
This would discourage or simply prevent innovative research in this area confining scientists and researchers to using ageing supernumerary embryos which are not in the best condition and could even result in an increasing number of stem cells being consumed for this purpose.
There is no ethical consensus on this issue in Europe.
Â Â  . I support the Liese report because I believe that stem cell research may hold the key to restoring and regenerating many vital bodily functions lost in various devastating illnesses and injuries.
This proposal may offer the possibility of treating Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injuries, strokes, burns, heart diseases, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
The proposal is to fund research only in Member States where such funding is requested.
Research would only involve embryos created before June 2002 for medically assisted IVF treatment but now 'supernumerary' and which would otherwise be destroyed.
Embryos would have to be voluntarily donated with informed consent and without payment.
Researchers would have to fully comply with comprehensive ethical and legal rules.
Research would only be funded where it meets agreed objectives and where there is no adequate alternative.
Furthermore the results would be made public.
In these circumstances, I believe the European Parliament should adopt this proposal and all Member States should support the European Parliament's position in Council on 27th November.
Â Â  Although I must statethat the debate on defining the priorities and funding of scientific research at Community level in the context of the Sixth Framework Programme is not simply about the important issue of funding for research into stem cells, I agree with the position advocated by my group, which is to:
- reject attempts to prevent Community funding for research based on stem cells, in particular embryonic stem cells, taking place in EU Member States that allow this practice;
- respect the national legislation of the EU Member States that reject this possibility;
- confirm the aim of pursuing, in a regulated way, research in this field in an attempt to alleviate or cure diseases, in particular those caused by the degeneration of specific cells, such as Parkinsonâs disease, Alzheimerâs and diabetes.
This being the case, I reject direct or indirect attempts to limit or even to more or less totally prevent the Community funding of research in this field.
Â Â  â The Commission proposes funding embryonic stem cell research despite the opposition of certain Member States which prohibit this and in contempt, too, of the principle of subsidiarity.
Embryonic stem cell research, which automatically entails the destruction of the embryo, is completely contrary to the principle of human dignity recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 2).
This research also presents technical problems. We are not yet at the stage of research for therapeutic purposes.
Even if we are concerned here with fundamental research, nothing justifies using new embryosÂ : that is MrÂ Lieseâs compromise.
Very few of us have talked about the suffering of those who are ill and of the need to find treatments as a matter of urgency.
Now, that is in fact the question posed by stem cell research.
In the present state of research, only the use of adult stem cells offers hope.
It presents no ethical and technical problems, but does not unfortunately have enough financial resources at its disposal.
That is why the bulk of European funds should be used to finance this type of research which, alone, will be able to meet the urgent requirements of those who are ill.
For all these reasons, I shall support the Gargani amendments, which I have co-signed.
Â Â  On matters involving the use of Community funds, but which affect areas that, in terms of their respective legality or illegality, fall within the sphere of national legislation and on which the Member States adopt differing responses, the European Union must refrain totally from providing funding.
Otherwise, it will be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity.
This is not a question of the European Unionâs banning or authorising something that does not fall within its sphere of competence; it is a question of not interfering indirectly, by financial means, in exclusive national competences and of preventing taxpayersâ money from being used to fund programmes and activities which, in their own Member States, are banned or constitute illegal acts.
By not respecting this guideline, the Commission proposal clearly breaches the principle of subsidiarity and I therefore voted against it.
As regards stem cells and the hopes for this research, I suggest that, without prejudice to what each Member State does with its own financial resources, all European funding for research must be channelled towards adult stem cells.
This does not raise ethical or legal problems and experiments on this type of cell have brought tangible results that are extremely encouraging, which is not the case with embryonic stem cells.
I congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Liese, on his efforts to reach a compromise limit, and on the clarity of his final statement of rejection the proposal on seeing that a majority would once again make it impossible.
Â Â  â I am very pleased that, against the advice of the rapporteur, MrÂ Liese, the European Parliament has today opened the door to the funding of research into embryonic stem cells.
Through this vote, the European Parliament is delivering a genuine message of hope to all patients (diabetics, those suffering from Parkinsonâs and Alzheimerâs diseases and people with chronic heart failure and other diseases).
It gives researchers the means of finding, and perhaps soon, remedies for incurable diseases.
There are three reasons why I voted as I did.
Firstly, my vote was perfectly consistent with the position adopted by the Strasbourg plenary on 15Â May 2002 on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development.
The creation of embryos from gametes donated for the purpose of obtaining stem cells is therefore prohibited.
Secondly, the five Member States opposed to any funding of embryonic stem cell research will not be able to prevent Europe from advancing, since such funding is in the interests of Europeans awaiting treatment.
Thirdly, the opponents of this form of regenerative medicine find their position to be self-contradictory. They are people who consider that the embryo is an entirely independent living being from the first day but who are in favour, however, of the destruction of supernumerary embryos cultivated for the purposes of fertilisation.
Â Â  I have supported the rapporteur, MrÂ Liese, from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in his ambition to introduce stricter ethical guidelines for the EUâs funding and monitoring of research.
In the same spirit, I have voted in favour of Amendments 37 to 44, which were signed by myself and many other MEPs and which have been rejected.
In the final vote, I voted against the report as a whole.
It was, however, adopted by 298 votes in favour, 214 votes against and 21 abstentions.
Research into embryonic stem cells is incompatible with the Irish Constitution and banned by law in Germany, Austria and Portugal.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and in view of the big differences in the Member Statesâ legislation on research involving the use of human embryos, it should be up to each Member State to decide for itself whether it is to fund such research using national funds.
It is therefore unfair to those states that ban research into embryonic stem cells to compel their citizens to contribute to the EUâs common research budget for an activity that is illegal in their countries.
Such coercion is also contrary to the spirit of European cooperation.
My hope is therefore that the Council will reject the European Parliamentâs majority view.
We believe that priority should be given to the ethically and legislatively uncontroversial research using adult stem cells.
Â Â  . As parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the democratic will of the citizens we represent, in keeping with the laws and constitutions of our sovereign Member States.
We must also ensure that in the European Union human dignity is protected and the weakest and most vulnerable are defended.
It is unacceptable for human life, whatever its age, to be treated as a commercial product, without regard to that life or the price paid by women in supplying the embryos.
It is deeply disturbing that the European Commission, supported by Members of this Parliament and certain Member State governments, including Ireland, have succeeded in imposing public funding of controversial and unethical research without proper public debate and without the opportunity for national parliaments to respond.
There has certainly been no debate in DÃ¡il Ãireann.
This proposal is against not only laws and constitutions, but also the conscience of millions of citizens.
It also pressures applicant and Third World countries to become part of an EU market-place for human embryo research.
This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and, as our rapporteur has pointed out, is high-risk.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, a Spaniard, calls with this report for soil protectionÂ through a range of different maps and legislationÂ âÂ so that we preserve our ability to produce top-quality agricultural produce.
I welcome this but, reading about soil protection, I had the sudden desire to ask the rapporteur, to ask Europe, whether we ought not to be endeavouring to ensure that, in connection with soil, our governors too, rather than having their heads in the clouds, keep their feet on the ground, that they walk safely with their feet on the ground.
All too often, indeed, they think about the stars and the sky rather than the everyday needs of all the citizens.
Mr President, I will conclude, if I may, by saying that we need more presidents like you, for all the states of Europe need presidents called âOnestaâÂ âÂ if you will forgive the play on wordsÂ âÂ not just France.
Â Â  â My surname thanks you for that remark, MrÂ Fatuzzo.
Â Â  The report addresses basic aspects of the important issue of soil protection, which should be taken into consideration in future resolutions, but it will be hard to comply with the timetable that has been proposed.
Some targets, especially for Portugal, will be difficult to achieve, bearing in mind on the one hand, the reality of the Portuguese situation and, on the other, various scientific and technical issues, specifically the presentation by the Commission, before JulyÂ 2004, of a thematic strategy for soil protection that should define problems, qualitative and quantitativeobjectives and the means by which they can be achieved, timetables and general principles for evaluation and monitoring.
Presenting a strategy of this nature will require the cooperation of the Member States and, given the current state of actions being undertaken by the working groups set up for this purpose, it will be hard to achieve all the stated objectives in time.
By the same token, although there is a need to produce what is being called a âscientific soil catalogueâ â a need that has been felt by the various researchers and specialists in this area for a long time â and this must be supported, the proposed timetable nevertheless appears to be very limited.
The attempt to harmonise methods of soil analysis in order to obtain comparable data would be even more difficult.
Lastly, the implications of these âconcernsâ in agri-environmental policies must be evaluated, particularly in social and economic terms, so as to not render the farming sector unviable.
Â Â  Erosion, the decline in organic matter, contamination, sealing (caused by the construction of houses, roads and other infrastructures), compaction (caused by mechanical pressure resulting from the use of heavy plant, overgrazing, sporting activities), the decline in biodiversity and salinisation (the excessive accumulation of soluble sodium, magnesium and calcium salts), and floods and landslides constitute worrying threats to soil in the Member States.
In this regard, despite the fact that there is no specific European policy on this matter, actions undertaken in the context of other policies, such as environmental, agricultural, regional, transport or research policies, clearly have an effect on soil protection, which is so necessary.
I am voting in favour of this report, although I feel that the Commission has ridden roughshod over the principle of subsidiarity by proposing legislation on this matter.
Despite the fact that this strategy is only being announced, we would be entitled to ask what would be the added value of European action beyond exchanging information, knowledge and best practice, and what is the need to look at the of urbanisation and regional planning, given that the issue of soil varies enormously from one Member State to the next, and even within each Member State.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Bloklandâs report concerns the movement of waste in Europe, waste from towns and from outside towns.
I voted for the motion because this certainly represents progress for Europe, but I would like Mr Blokland and Europe to concern themselves more with the free movement of citizens too, particularly pensioners and particularly pensioners with disabilities because, at the moment, I am afraid, under Regulation 1408, people in receipt of social benefits and healthcare allowances âÂ such as hearing- and visually-impaired people and those requiring assistance âÂ lose the right to draw their disability allowance if they travel in Europe.
There must be as much freedom of movement for European citizens as there is provided for in this directive for urban and industrial waste.
Â Â  I voted in favour of this report, because I agree with the principle that when it comes to environmental matters, we must always try to raise stringency levels.
The environment recognises no borders and concerns everyone.
Data submitted by the Member States on the processing, recovery or recycling of waste must be more reliable and provided more promptly.
I agree in particular that the Member States should be instructed to draw up plans for waste management or for improving existing plans, primarily to promote measures designed to encourage the prevention or reduction of waste production.
I must, however, express my unhappiness at the general tone of the report when it recommends giving the Commission greater powers to punish and to levy taxes in environmental matters, calling for infringement proceedings to be initiated depending on the higher or lower quantity/quality of the data provided by the Member States.
It is crucial that such action, which should focus more on monitoring, vigilance and prevention and less on punishment, is based on reliable data, particularly as regards the nature of the waste treated.
As the rapporteur himself points out, however, the first harmonised statistics will only be available in 2006.
We will not, therefore, have all the elements we need objectively to evaluate the ârelativeâ dimension of waste treatment in the European Union.
Â Â  â That concludes this morningâs agenda.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the EU-Russia Summit.(1)
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russian Federation Summit has been one of the most important events to be held during the Italian Presidency in the field of the Unionâs relations with third countries because of the strategic significance of relations between the European Union and Russia.
Russia, too, attaches great importance to the Summit.
Initially created as a forum for political dialogue, over the course of the years the Summit has become an occasion for both parties to review and revitalise at the highest level the entire spectrum of their cooperation.
The Villa Madama Summit gave the go-ahead for the practical implementation of the St Petersburg Declaration, where it lays down that European Union-Russia relations must be built around common spaces, to be created in the medium to long term within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement currently in force.
The main aim was to make further progress in respect of all the common spaces by making the best use of existing structures and tools with a view to enhancing strategic relations and driving forward the process of integrating the Russian Federation into Europe.
For the European Union, the Summit provided an opportunity to remind Moscow of our common commitment to tackling the current challenges and to discharging in a coordinated manner our shared responsibility for the environmental protection of the continent, and of the need to share information and work together to resolve the problems caused by climate change.
The meeting allowed the European Union and the Russian Federation to look at current global issues, including crisis situations and what are known as the frozen conflicts in the region.
The Italian Presidency, however, was concerned with keeping the main emphasis on the creation of the four common spaces and on the positive aspects of EU-Russia cooperation, and therefore focused on the major tangible achievements of the Summit, in particular a Joint Declaration on the CFSP and on cooperation in crisis management, the signing of the Agreement between Europol and the Russian Federation, the start of talks on the visa-free regime and the renewal of the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation.
The Russians endorsed the approach and the emphasis given to the creation of the four spaces.
The Summit, which took place at a sensitive moment in Russian domestic politics âÂ parliamentary elections will be held next December and presidential elections in March 2004 âÂ also afforded President Putin an opportunity to strengthen the ties drawing the European Union and the Russian Federation increasingly close together.
To this end, President Putin reiterated the need to activate the Permanent Partnership Council, within which and within whose various formats representatives of key areas of EU-Russia cooperation will be able to exchange views and work together.
Addressing himself to strategic considerations, President Putin expressed Moscowâs concerns at the short- and medium-term consequences of enlargement on both economic and trade relations and political relations between the Russian Federation and former Soviet Bloc countriesÂ âÂ with particular reference to the Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltic statesÂ âÂ in view of the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States.
In reply to President Putin, we made it quite clear that the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is an obligation with which the Russian Federation must comply within the timeframe laid down and is an essential condition for strengthening its relations with the 25-Member State Europe.
The Summit also looked at the state of progress of the talks for the Russian Federationâs future membership of the WTO which, despite significant unresolved issues, both sides hope will be achieved before the end of 2004.
Both the European and the Russian sides looked forward to the ending of current visa regulations, and noted with satisfaction that talks on the preliminaries for a visa-free system had begun and that the current visa regulations were to be relaxed immediately on a bilateral and, of course, reciprocal basis.
One of the key moments in the Summit was the ceremony of the signing of two agreements: the renewed Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation and the Europol-Russia Agreement on the exchange of strategic analyses and cooperation in police training, which is a tangible sign of the willingness of the Russian Federation to work alongside the European Union in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
In constant association with the Commission and the Secretariat, the Italian Presidency put a great deal of effort into the preparations for this event. It was discussed on 28 October at the meeting of the European Union Troika with the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, as well as at a number of meetings of senior officials of the Italian Presidency and the Russian Federation.
It was necessary, in particular, to overcome a twofold difficulty. This consisted, on the one hand, of the Russiansâ high expectations of a leap forward in their relations with the European Union, and, on the other, of the more rigid position adopted by the majority of Member States with regard to what they see as Moscowâs inadequate commitment to giving practical effect to the political pledges it has made.
Precisely because of its joint nature, being the result of a compromise, the Joint Declaration issued at the end of the Summit was achieved only after long, hard negotiations between the Russian Federation, on the one hand, and the Presidency, the Commission and the Secretariat on the other.
It thus represents the reconciliation of conflicting demands and is a sensitive compromise between the demands of many of the Member States, which had wanted explicit reference to be made to all the controversial issues, and the desire of the Russians for a very pared-down Declaration limited to highlighting the positive aspects of EU-Russia cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before examining the individual elements of the Summit, I should like to make it clear that all the issues on the agenda were dealt with fully in our talks with President Putin. They included the situation in Chechnya, the failure to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the issue of Moldova and Transnistria and the implications of the judicial proceedings involving the group.
As regards Chechnya, in particular, I should like to point out that not only was the issue raised at the initiative of the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, but ample debating time was dedicated to the subject during the plenary session.
If there is no mention of this issue in the final Summit Declaration, this is owing to the considerations that I mentioned a short while ago to the effect that this was a proposal on which agreement had to be reached, and thus the fruit of a brokerage exercise.
The Commission, the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Presidency all agreed that the reference made to the joint declaration was acceptable as an outcome.
These, therefore, are the reasons.
In respect of domestic developments in Russia, President Putin described the internal political and economic situation with reference also to the parliamentary elections next December and the presidential elections the following March, and in the light of the events connected with the affair.
He reiterated Russiaâs clear intention to carry on with its privatisation programme and continue with the process of creating an independent judicial system and strengthening the public institutions.
We replied that, although we had absolutely no intention of interfering in Russian domestic affairs, we would continue to follow the affair very closely, and that we were confident that the Russian judiciary would act with complete transparency and in accordance with the law and would give the international community and the business community its full assurance that the ongoing reforms would not be obstructed, and that Russia would continue to follow the principles of the market economy.
In response to a specific request from the Presidency, President Putin illustrated the efforts that Moscow is making to begin political and institutional reconstruction in Chechnya by means of a referendum, amnesty and elections, and invited European representatives to visit the region.
For our part, we expressed our solidarity with Russia in the fight against Chechen terrorism as well as our support for a constitutional reform that encompasses ever-wider sections of the Chechen population that are not compromised by terrorism.
We renewed our appeal for all possible efforts to be made to speed up the release of Arjan Erkel, the representative who was abducted in the Caucasus in August 2002, and expressed the hope that an ECHO office would be opened in the area.
President Putin suggested that one could be opened in Chechnya itself, and that he would personally guarantee its security.
As regards the common economic space, the Summit sanctioned an agreed strategy that, we hope, will increase the level of interdependence between our economies in the coming years.
We now have to decide upon the appropriate institutional forum for the operational follow-up, perhaps extending the mandate of the relevant High Level Group.
The Summit was supportive of Russian aspirations for WTO membership by the end of 2004, but remains well aware of known difficulties in areas such as energy, air transport issues and insurance, which remain outstanding items on the EU-Russia agenda.
Dialogue on energy will continue, with the EU continuing to encourage progress in the Russian process of reforming the sector, in spite of the difficulties that Russia has in meeting the demands of Europe and the WTO, especially in relation to domestic prices and the privatisation of the energy sector.
