But the completely new and most attention-grabbing thing in the amendment of the directive is, for me, the list of allergenic substances based on the Codex Alimentarius.
This report proposes for the first time that the presence of allergenic substances must always, and without exception, be indicated.
This list of allergenic substances must, though, be constantly monitored so that current scientific knowledge can be incorporated.
Parliament must act together with the European Food Safety Authority and the Commission to find a way to keep this list constantly up to date.
As I see it, this means that it must be possible to add new substances, but it must also be possible, in the light of new knowledge, to delete others.
I therefore strongly urge support for my amendment on the continuous monitoring of the list.
The interpretation of this list, to be found in Annex III, requires detailed guidelines.
What, for example, is meant when nuts are mentioned?
What products are meant by the reference to crustaceans?
Does that include snails?
Having dropped the 25% rule, the Commission proposes minor derogations to the requirement for labelling, these being in the order of 5% and 2%.
These apply, on the one hand, to foodstuffs on which there are already Community regulations, such as chocolate, sauce and mustard preparations and to foodstuffs such as milk, that do not require a list of ingredients.
An exception is made for mixtures of spices or herbs constituting less than 2% of the finished product.
Seasonal variations in supply make it particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises to be enabled to react speedily to changes in market conditions by means of the use of the clause with the phrase 'contains ....... and/or .............'.
Contrary to what some critics have said, all the concessions I have referred to do not mean that consumer protection is being weakened, but constitute a sensible arrangement and an alternative to the 25% rule, which has been dropped.
This does not affect the fundamental requirement that the presence of all allergenic substances be indicated on the label.
I have gone into labelling in great depth and also got to grips with its practical implementation.
In all this, we must not forget that labelling must not disorient the consumer, but must be clear, distinct, and, in the final analysis, legible.
Taken as a whole, the Commission proposal improves consumer protection in the European Union and offers consumers greater transparency and more information.
Current difficulties, in particular, mean that it sends an important signal to the people of Europe.
Let me conclude by thanking most warmly all those who have helped and supported me.
I would be delighted if the amendments I have put forward were to meet with the approval of a large majority of Members of this House.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are again, with farmers demonstrating because we are dealing with food issues.
I believe it to be important that we should keep fighting to win consumers' trust, and it is particularly with regard to foodstuffs that more precise labelling is vitally necessary.
In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like first to thank our rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, for her fine cooperation.
Even though, when discussions started, we approached issues of detail from slightly different angles, as a whole we took the same line, so that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy complemented each other very well, something which I do think should be mentioned and appreciated at this time.
As a whole, the Commission proposal amounted to a welcome advance in the labelling of foodstuffs, but no doubt there is nothing so good that it cannot be improved.
That was a task for us here in Parliament.
The existing rule that all food ingredients - including constituent parts of compound foodstuffs - must be enumerated in the so-called list of ingredients on the label did indeed provide for derogations.
Mrs KlaÃ has addressed the question of the so-called 25% rule.
We often hear it said by way of justification for this that labels were made too all-inclusive by the large number of constituents listed on them, thereby ending up being unreadable, which was no doubt a bit extreme.
The Commission itself made reference to the absence of uncertainty in Member States where this rule did not apply.
No doubt the 25% rule was problematic mainly in that consumers could not know, when buying processed foods, whether they contained substances that might trigger allergies, in that even very small proportions of these were significant to the consumer.
I do think that this context makes it clear that an even closer look needs to be taken at the difference in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, and consideration given either before or after the adoption of the directive as to whether this scientific basis for the inclusion of allergenic substances is the right one.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the identification of food ingredients issue is one that recurs in Parliament on a regular basis.
When a major amendment to the labelling directive was decided on in 1995, there were similar discussions on the same issues as are on the agenda today.
In my view, though, today's discussions are necessary simply because there has been an increase in people's allergic reactions to certain component foods, some of which have been a threat to life itself.
This alone makes amendment of the directive and other measures necessary.
In my estimation, the production processes have remained unchanged since 1995.
What has changed is Parliament's attitude, as, at that time, we were already debating the rights and wrongs of the 25% rule.
That is no longer an issue today, so we are - I think - going back to 5%, which ensures that consumers can be certain of spotting allergenic substances that are a danger to them, and that is the whole point of this amendment.
That is why we should carry on along this road.
Today, though, we are back to walking the tightrope between clarity and the need for information, by which I mean firstly the clarity of the label and secondly that of the directive.
The consolidated version 2013/EC was a superfluous piece of legislation, and, in my view, so complex that anyone starting to apply this directive needs the help of someone learned in the law in order to accomplish it properly.
Please do not misunderstand me: I know of no amendment that we should be making other than this one.
I would like, however, to sharpen our awareness so that we can consider, in view of the next amendment to the labelling directive being imminent, whether there are not essential things that we could leave off the label because the public now know a good deal more than once they did.
When the public enter a hostelry, restaurant or bar, where mixed drinks and many varieties of food are prepared, we work on the assumption that they know what is in them and can also find out by asking.
That is an approach that we might perhaps take to what lies ahead when the next amendment comes round; I believe it is nearly upon us.
I am thinking of such things as alcoholic drinks.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent example of where a substantial and sensible proposal from the Commission has been further improved in our committee.
In my remarks, I want to follow Mr Schnellhardt.
I believe that it was right for our committee to go further than the Commission, after the abolition of the 25% rule, by also taking an axe to some of the exceptions and exemptions which had been suggested by the Commission.
I wish to say something about the many people who correspond with us about allergies.
For anyone suffering from an allergy, it is no good saying that it is only an insignificant percentage of people who have it.
If you have an allergy, it is 100% for you and we need to be certain that the labelling concerned gives due warning.
There is one area where we are not for the first time facing sustained opposition.
Mr Schnellhardt just mentioned alcoholic products.
Amendment No 1 which I moved in the committee and which was carried, would indeed make certain that there could be a single committee responsible for the labelling of products for alcoholic beverages.
I believe that is important and something which has been strenuously resisted over the years by the wine lobby.
We are not saying that the specialist committees should not be involved in this, nor that there should not be a dialogue.
Sooner or later, we have to tackle, within this general issue of allergies and labelling, the issue of a special interest which has always stood in the way of accurate labelling of some products and of applying the same provisions to all products.
I do not believe that we can go on with that and my personal view is that now is the time.
I would recommend - although there is a free vote in my group - that we vote in favour of Amendment No 1 and that we start to label wine in the same way as we label other products.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, and the members of the committee for all their hard work on this particular dossier.
The question of food labelling is of great importance, as many people have said this morning.
Our legislation must satisfy the legitimate demands of consumers.
After all, what could be more reasonable than wanting to know what foods are made up of, in order to make informed decisions in the face of an increasingly wide range of foods from which to choose.
But even more important for a sadly ever-growing number of consumers, those who suffer from food allergies or intolerances, is information about the presence of certain ingredients for health reasons.
It is therefore essential that labelling legislation not only ensures that all consumers receive comprehensive information, but also addresses the very real problem of adverse reactions to food.
These are the objectives of the proposal we are discussing here today and I am pleased to note that in general it has attracted a broad consensus of support.
In view of this, our discussions can focus mainly on the most appropriate means of achieving the objectives.
Labelling issues are often more complex than they at first appear.
For example, some flavourings are spice mixtures containing dozens of ingredients.
Is it necessary, or even desirable, to list them all?
I believe not, except in the case of substances derived from ingredients which can cause allergies or intolerances.
To encapsulate the problem, just how precise does food labelling need to be?
It is absolutely essential to avoid an excessive amount of information which would be difficult for consumers to take on board.
Quantity cannot be allowed to cloud quality and clarity.
Our proposal aims, therefore, to provide information that is sufficiently complete whilst guarding against the omission of any ingredients which might cause allergies or intolerances.
At the same time, the obligation to provide detailed labelling must be accompanied by procedures enabling manufacturers to satisfy this obligation without excessive technical difficulties.
It was with these considerations in mind that we examined the proposed amendments before us today.
As the list is relatively short, I will comment on them all.
Amendment No 1 would abolish the possibility of having technical implementing rules adopted for the special case of alcoholic drinks under the sectoral management committee procedure.
However, specific labelling provisions are in force for certain alcoholic drinks - wines, for example.
This amendment would create inconsistency with existing legislation and therefore I cannot accept it.
Amendment No 2 would add mixtures of mushrooms to other mixtures, fruit and vegetables, which can be labelled without having to satisfy the rule of descending order of weight and specifies that this option would only apply in the case of mixtures whose proportions may vary.
I accept that this point is valid and I therefore accept this amendment.
Amendment No 3 would abolish the possibility of flexibility in the labelling of ingredients used in small quantities - under 5% of the finished product.
Thus it would remove, firstly, the possibility of not strictly respecting the descending order of weight in the list of ingredients and, secondly, the possibility of using the expression "and/or" in the case of ingredients which are interchangeable according to availability.
Amendment No 13 would abolish only the first possibility.
However, these provisions which allow for some flexibility of labelling presentation are technically justified, given the obligation to list all ingredients, including those used in very small quantities.
I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.
Amendment No 4 would abolish a requirement for an explanation as regards repetition where ingredients are used several times in the preparation of a product.
This amendment provides for simplification and can be accepted.
Therefore Amendment No 14, which would abolish the whole provision, cannot be accepted.
Amendment No 5 aims to remove the provision of not requiring the indication of the composition of compound ingredients used in small quantities - under 5% of the finished product - where the composition in question is covered by current Community legislation which gives the composition corresponding to the trade name.
This derogation would not, however, apply in either additives or allergens.
The aim of this derogation is to avoid making a list of ingredients unnecessarily long, while remaining consistent with the objectives of the proposal.
I cannot accept its removal and must therefore reject the amendment.
Amendment No 6 aims chiefly to abolish the derogation from labelling provided for in the proposal for ingredients which make up preparations of sauces and mustards constituting less than 5% of the foodstuffs.
This derogation is also designed to avoid making the list of ingredients excessively long.
The amendment would remove the advantage of keeping lists shorter.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 6.
Amendment No 7 comprises two distinct elements.
First, it would exempt processing aids derived from allergenic ingredients from the requirement to be indicated on the label, on the grounds that these substances are eliminated during the manufacturing process.
However, residues may be present in the finished product and may cause allergic reactions, even where mere residues or traces of allergens are present.
This part of Amendment No 7 is therefore not acceptable.
Second, it would make the European Food Safety Authority responsible for establishing criteria for updating the annex and for revising it every two years.
There is an ambiguity here, because amendment of the annex - which will be necessary - has to be done by the legislator, having consulted the authority on the scientific aspects.
We can accept the principle of regular revision of the list annexed to the proposal but the amendment as it is currently worded is not acceptable. Neither is Amendment No 12 on the same issue.
The purpose of Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10 is to add ingredients to the list in the annex.
However, the list proposed by the Commission remains valid and should only be supplemented later on the basis of objective scientific criteria.
With a view to subsequent updating of the list the Commission is consulting the Scientific Committee for Food and has made provisions for a rapid procedure to update the list.
These amendments are therefore not acceptable.
Finally, I can agree on the principle that, as requested in Amendment No 11, an interpretative guideline for Annex III(a) would have to be laid down, but only if this is necessary.
My view is that this annex should be drawn up in such a way that no further interpretation guideline would be needed.
I cannot, therefore, accept the current wording of this amendment.
That concludes the summary of the Commission view of the proposed amendments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr President, just very quickly, can you confirm that the French football team has contracted Legionella?
You are more familiar with the Rules than I am, Mr Corbett.
I am not sure under which Rule you rose to make your point.
I cannot confirm that but I can confirm they will be taking an early return trip to France.
The next item is the vote.
Recommendation for second reading, in the form of a letter on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community (6241/1/2002 - C5-0181/2002 - 2001/0127(COD)) (null)
(The President declared the common position adopted)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0194/2002) by Emmanouil Bakopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending for the nineteenth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants) (15079/1/01 - C5-0071/2002 - 1999/0269(COD))
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my thanks to Members for their interest in this proposal and especially to Mr Bakopoulos, the rapporteur for his constructive work.
This is an important directive as it would introduce a ban on certain colourants for textiles and leather articles as there are colourants that have been shown to pose risks to human health.
It is a far-reaching proposal as it covers the marketing and use of a large number of textiles and leather articles.
The proposed directive will also encourage the marketing and use of alternative colourants.
I can understand that Members have concerns going beyond the proposed directive with regard to material other than textiles or leather and I would like to address those concerns.
The Commission's approach is to identify articles containing the dangerous substances that have clearly been shown on the basis of sufficient data to pose risks.
Currently the Commission has no information that these colourants are present in toys made of materials other than textiles or leather.
However, toys containing dangerous substances or preparations are already banned by the toys directive.
Furthermore, within this framework the Commission is actively considering the risks posed by such substances in toys.
Against this background, the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 1 to 4.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I request that a vote now be taken on the legislative proposal as well, as it would make no sense to return it to the committee.
Mr President, I have been presented with a table that sets out the position with regard to the attitude of the Commission and I can present that table to you in due course.
Mr President, I expected nothing else of the Commission.
No doubt it will take a very unambiguous vote in this House to convince them of the need to overcome their lethargy!
Mr President, at the initiative of our rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², there have been informal negotiations with the Council and the Commission on this matter, which is a very sensitive one for many in Parliament and for many of the Member States.
Last week, we reached an understanding and an agreement as to how this matter could be resolved without a protracted and very difficult debate in the Conciliation Committee. During the debate in Parliament this morning, it was that agreement and that understanding - which it had been possible for both the Commission and the Council to accept and which had been reached on this issue specifically relating to unpaid blood donation - that our rapporteur ran away from.
I would therefore ask that we postpone the vote and see if we cannot solve this matter and so avoid a host of more or less ill thought-out oral amendments.
You have made a formal proposal.
I will follow the due procedure.
Mr President, I am in favour of an amendment to Amendment No 19, an oral amendment - in this way, all the positions would be respected - ending with the words: 'this should be taken into account by Member States'.
In this case, I would be in favour of the amendment and it would therefore be a good compromise agreement.
Mr Lund, does this compromise allow you to withdraw your request, or do you wish to maintain your request for postponement?
Mr President, I should like to stand by my request to postpone the vote.
This matter has proceeded in a quite unsatisfactory way, and I am pleased that, as late as this morning, Commissioner Byrne confirmed my reading of the matter and the agreement which Mr NisticÃ² ran away from this morning.
We must have time to discover how we are to resolve this matter.
I should still like us to solve it in such a way that we avoid a protracted debate in the Conciliation Committee of an extremely difficult matter.
A framework decision is legally binding upon the Member States. It is not, however, covered by the codecision procedure, and democratic control by the European Parliament is limited.
Legislation of this kind must be covered by a democratic decision-making process.
Serious organised crime must be fought by means that are effective but in ways that accord with the rule of law.
For a country like Sweden, which has no constitutional court, the rule of law aspect is especially sensitive.
The absence of a constitutional court means that people obviously have little opportunity to check up on what is, or is not, constitutional.
Such control by the courts is also missing at European level.
The Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of the Marinho report.
To succeed in the fight against crime, simplification of the legal cooperation between the Member States is required if matters are to be dealt with more quickly.
It is therefore important to be able promptly and efficiently to implement a decision to freeze property or evidence prior to an impending court case, even if such assets or evidence are to be found in a Member State other than that in which the decision is made.
At the same time, it is necessary fully to guarantee the legal rights of everyone involved and not to be in too much of a hurry to make such an important change to the legal system.
We consequently believe that it is wisest initially to have a limited area of application for the framework decision.
Only once it has been possible to evaluate experience of this cooperation will it be appropriate to discuss whether legal cooperation can be taken further and intensified and, if so, to what extent.
The framework decision nonetheless has scope for the Council to add other types of crime at a later stage, which is why I voted against Amendments Nos 11, 12 and 18.
- (FR) The new Rule 6a(13) of the Rules of Procedure, as adopted following the Duff report, states: 'The [competent] committee [of the European Parliament], after consulting the Member States, may draw up an indicative list of the authorities of the Member States which are competent to present a request for waiving the immunity of a Member'.
As I said yesterday, this convoluted wording has but one objective: to avoid clearly recognising a national competence which is a hindrance to the European Parliament.
To avoid admitting this, the text begins by saying that the European Parliament has the right to draw up a list.
As this right is pure fabrication, it is quickly added that the list is 'indicative'.
Thirdly, as this cramping of the European Parliament's style is still not appreciated, it is specified that the Member States are to be 'consulted', which appears to mean that they do not decide.
What is more, we do not know what they are consulted on either: whether it is the principle of the list or its content.
This is one of the methods traditionally used by the European institutions to take over national competences: they begin by completely confusing the issue, then they say that the situation is too complicated and that, in order to simplify it, competence must be transferred to Brussels.
.
(NL) Parliamentary immunity appears to be very important to many MEPs, for it is constantly being discussed in this Parliament.
MEPs are subject to the national rules of their Member States, and these differ considerably.
In one country, this means that during their mandate, MEPs cannot be prosecuted without their own cooperation or without the decision to lift their immunity for punishable offences, and that they are therefore put at an advantage compared to other citizens.
This benefits criminals who want to protect themselves.
In other countries, like the Netherlands, this merely means that an MEP cannot be prosecuted on the grounds of statements made in the parliamentary debate or in questions as an MEP.
For the time being, I am in favour of this restricted definition of immunity, for it ensures that MEPs and their electorate are, and remain, on an equal footing, without the MEPs being hindered in their work.
I can understand that there is more need for immunity in states where attempts have often been made to seriously hamper MEPs, who are considered political enemies, in their work by constantly instituting legal proceedings against them.
But let us keep this to a minimum and not extend it to separate European law.
Mr President, each year in Europe alone 38,000 animals are routinely killed after being used to test the development of new cosmetic products.
For nearly ten years the EU has had a ban on the sale of products tested on animals but we have yet to implement this.
There is no reason why we should not do so, especially in cases where scientifically validated alternatives to animal testing are available.
The Commission proposal to now replace this sales ban with a mere test ban is totally unacceptable and of great concern in view of massive public demand to end the use of animal testing for cosmetics.
The test ban alone only serves to export the problem as cosmetics tested on animals in countries outside the EU will continue to be sold in the EU.
Only a sales and test ban will remove such products from our shelves. This will not compromise the safety of cosmetics, as products sold in the EU must fulfil legal safety requirements.
We need to speed up the development of alternative testing.
Mr President, in common with the majority of European Union citizens, I believe that the use of live animals in cosmetic testing is an unnecessary and unacceptable practice and must be banned.
Over 8,000 ingredients have already been cleared for use in cosmetics.
How many more new products do we need?
What is going to provide the incentive for commercial companies to develop alternative testing methods?
The answer is, firstly, a marketing ban on new animal-tested cosmetics five years after adoption of the legislation, as the report that we adopted in the Environment Committee states. This is clearly not now against WTO rules.
Secondly, a complete test ban, with a definite date by which it will come into force.
I believe anything less than this to be insufficient and unsatisfactory and I know my constituents share that view.
Banning cosmetic testing will not mean that consumers will be sold unsafe products, but will mean an end to a great deal of animal suffering.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we have today shown such unanimity with regard to the Roth-Berendt Report.
I hope that our great strength of conviction will also turn out to have had an effect on the Commission.
I am in favour both of banning testing on animals and the marketing of the products tested.
I believe that the transitional periods have been extended too far.
It is for this reason that I would have preferred even shorter transitional periods.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that this sort of trade in animals is going on, and only a couple of days ago, in the South Tyrol, the part of Upper Italy that I come from, a transaction of this kind was thwarted.
We were able to block the convoy and rescue the animals.
We know that that is not the solution.
The solution is regulation by the law.
I hope that we will put such legislation into effect as soon as possible.
Our contribution to it has now been made.
. (NL) Unfortunately, tests using certain substances to establish how animals become ill, suffer and die formed a normal part of scientific and industrial progress, but luckily these are increasingly less common these days.
The discussion now merely revolves around whether animal tests can be avoided altogether when they concern purely medical matters.
It is disgraceful that tests of this kind should still be used for luxury purposes, such as the production of cosmetics.
It is these days generally acknowledged that this should be stamped out as a matter of urgency.
Despite this, this development has been hampered by the fear that companies that carry out animal tests will move outside the EU territory and that their products will subsequently be imported, because cross-border trade is currently uncontrolled.
Mrs Roth-Berendt proved very resourceful in finding solutions to the fact that the Council continues to denounce an import ban.
She now refers to the public opinion and demands labelling, allowing the consumer to establish whether animal tests have preceded the marketing of the product.
In addition, she is trying to reduce the number of animal tests faster and more drastically and avoid the addition of substances that smell pleasantly but make people ill.
Given the opposition by the Council to date, this is the best solution.
- (FR) Today we have voted on a important issue.
Eight thousand ingredients have already been tested and are available for use in industry, and I believe it was essential to reject cosmetic testing on animals.
Some have put forward the public health argument in opposition to the amendments prohibiting these tests, but it must be reiterated that on no account can the results of tests carried out on animals automatically be considered valid for human beings.
This is a genetic and scientific fact which would have serious consequences in just ten or twenty years.
I am saying this not just as an animal lover but out of respect for living creatures.
The fundamental question is, in fact, how much we are capable of sacrificing to the myths of eternal life, eternal beauty and eternal youth.
This is essentially a philosophical and humanistic question which is currently one of a number of concerns our people want politicians to address.
The debates on globalisation, large corporations and their profits and the respect for and dignity of all human beings reflect similar concerns.
. (PT) The amendments that have been tabled consolidate amendments to the Regulation currently in force that clarify ideas, establish criteria for allocating slots and their legal nature and the possibility of slot transfers, they adopt international concepts of facilitated and coordinated airports, replacing previous designations of coordinated and entirely coordinated airports.
Nevertheless, I must point out that, by replacing these with the titles of facilitator and coordinator, the first appears to have a consultative rather than a regulatory role, and so we could ask whether the operation of these facilitated airports will be effective, specifically in terms of the distribution of slots.
Since this proposal would lead to only really congested or 'coordinated' airports having clear legal regulation, the laws will only apply in a small number of situations, which could be a step backwards in the slot allocation system.
Given the successive food crises we have experienced, the 25% rule on the labelling of foodstuffs should be abolished and consumers suffering from allergies should be given full information on the foodstuffs they buy.
Similarly, I believe the derogations on preparations of sauces and mustards constituting less than 5% of the finished product should be discontinued.
Certain exceptions, however, should be retained, such as the role of the expert committees responsible for the various drinks.
These committees must continue to lay down the rules on labelling. Certain alcoholic drinks, such as wine, must obey specific rules on labelling.
Additives and technological adjuvants whose presence cannot be proved in the finished product should not be labelled.
I welcome the fact that the scientific criteria for inclusion in the list of ingredients in Annex III are fully taken into consideration and that this list is revised and updated biennially.
We consider the implementation of the directive to be important.
That is why we are excluding prior assessment by the Food Authority of the scientific criteria that determine the inclusion of the ingredients in the Annex.
- (EL) ?he text of the decision on social inclusion following the vote on the amendments is a far cry from the original text of the Figueiredo report approved by the Committee on Employment.
Not only have references to the disastrous results of liberalisation, competition policy, agricultural and fisheries policy, the stability pact and the need for welfare benefits, social protection and redistribution of resources and opportunities been removed, it now states that employment is a right and opportunity for those who want to work, with temporary work seen as the only opportunity for many of those who are unwilling to look for or unable to find permanent employment.
In other words, the unemployed who do not want to work are responsible for unemployment!
The way the vote went again shows the European Parliament in its true colours, unable to ditch its role as the bastion of big business and the policy of the ruling classes.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report, even though it retained a few positive points, including those I referred to in my intervention yesterday (free, compulsory education for 12 years).
. (PT) The amendments tabled during the vote on my report on social inclusion weakened its substance on significant points.
In fact, of the 19 amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, 12 of those that were approved sought to remove important aspects of the real strategy that needs to be developed to effectively promote social inclusion and to include the negative approach of defending temporary work, which runs counter to the promise and the idea of full employment.
The removal of the points dealing with the following issues is particularly significant:
the importance of social transfers, notably old-age pensions, without which 41% of the European Union's population would be at risk of living in poverty; and other social transfers without which, even if old-age pensions were maintained, the percentage would still be 26% of the population as opposed to the 18% currently in that position;
an assessment of the impact of monetary policies, including the Stability Pact, on social matters such as employment, poverty and social exclusion, equal rights and opportunities, and so on.
Finally, it should be noted that other PPE-DE amendments were rejected, which has enabled important aspects of the report to be preserved.
Hence my abstention from the final vote.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
As Swedish Liberals, we view European integration as an opportunity to achieve solutions to cross-border problems relating, for example, to the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management. Social integration is an important part of the development of Europe.
Social integration is an important aspect of the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which is why we are of course in favour of it.
Because subsidiarity is something we defend and to which we adhere as one of our most important principles, we see no reason to harmonise the area to which the report relates.
Social integration is an example of an area that is not directly cross-border in nature, and the points dealt with by the report can better be taken into consideration at Member State level.
- (FR) In the next series of National Action Plans for social inclusion, in 2003, it is essential to recommend that the Member States give high priority to those living in persistent poverty.
The report describes the current situation and, I regret to remind you, we have 60 million poor people in the European Union, and this is unacceptable.
At the Lisbon Summit, the fifteen Member States undertook to eradicate poverty by 2010.
The Treaty of Nice confirmed this commitment.
This report acts as a springboard to reinforce the policies and programmes of the European Union and confirms that the fight against poverty is still a major issue.
We have succeeded in adopting the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Now we need to bring it to life.
Article 1 of the Charter, which emphasises the dignity of every human being, is key.
The dignity of all those living in poverty is injured and, to us, that is unacceptable.
We must establish a proactive policy for schooling, for public services, for housing and for employment.
Most importantly, we must anticipate the risks of exclusion and do something to protect the most vulnerable groups: the structural changes within our Union could create further risks of discrimination and spark off a fresh wave of racism and xenophobia.
- (FR) The aim of the report by Mr Morillon and Mr Cohn-Bendit is to bear witness to a firm commitment by Parliament to an active, effective Euro-Mediterranean policy.
In this respect, it outlines ideas worthy of study.
First, the desire to enter into discussions with our partners in the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) is, at last, translated into an approach that goes beyond the purely trade level to which the relationship between the two shores of the Mediterranean has thus far been limited.
We should be glad that the emphasis has, at last, been placed on entering into political and cultural rather than just economic exchange.
In the same vein, the involvement of our southern partners in the definition of a common immigration policy is long overdue.
This policy, which is often referred to but never established, is becoming urgent.
Although the willingness that the report seems to express is overdue, it nonetheless represents a positive development in attitudes within the European Union.
I would also like to commend the co-rapporteurs' intention not to set themselves up as role models: we all have as much to give as we have to receive, and there are few areas in which this humility is as necessary as in North-South cooperation.
This intention, however laudable, is, unfortunately, contradicted in the text of the report itself.

(NL) Europe has often interfered with North West Africa in a negative way.
Up until 50 years or so ago, those countries formed the colonial property of France, Spain and Italy, and particularly in Algeria, independence was preceded by a lengthy and devastating war.
This past has contributed to the fact that violence and poverty in those countries still play an important role.
In Tunisia, an authoritarian state emerges without any right to opposition; in Algeria, the army plays an important role and the large Berber population feel like second-rate citizens; in Morocco, the situation is politically speaking slightly better but many try to join their families who have been in the EU for a long time, and in the Western Sahara, the agreed referendum on independence has still not been held.
Much like the USA is separated from a much poorer Mexico by the Rio Grande and a fence, Europe is kept separate from northern Africa by the Mediterranean.
Many inhabitants of the Maghreb countries look for Europe's higher standard of living or have reason to flee an oppressive regime.
I concur with the view of the Green-Conservative coalition of rapporteurs that it would be preferable to make an economic migration superfluous by providing incomes and employment in their own countries, but that need not lead to support for the leaders of a unified Maghreb.
I see Mr Fatuzzo is present.
Would he like to give an explanation as to why he gives no explanation today?
Mr President, I am preparing myself in case, on Wednesday, the House should adopt Amendment No 74 to the Rules of Procedure, which radically reduces Mr Fatuzzo's opportunities for delivering explanations of vote.
I am in training in case the House, in its wisdom, decides that it would be better for me to speak less.
Mr Fatuzzo, it would have been a pity to let the opportunity pass.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.51 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is a recommendation (A5-0212/2002) by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the draft Council decision amending the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament, annexed to Council decision 76/787/ECSC, EEC, Euratom of 20 September 1976 [8964/2002 - C5-0225/2002 - 2002/0807(AVC)].
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Council Decision which is before the House today marks the culmination of a long process.
A moment ago we were arguing about whether it was 25 years or 30 years.
Either way it has been a long process.
Since 1960, when the draft convention on election to Parliament by universal suffrage was adopted, our House has produced five reports which have ended up deadlocked within the Council.
At last the Spanish Presidency has achieved a laborious agreement within the Council.
We must celebrate this and congratulate the presidency on this delicate manoeuvring.
This text includes the majority of the proposals the European Parliament had made in the Anastasopoulos report.
Specifically, it introduces the principle of proportional representation with each Member State having a choice about the type of preferential list it wishes, the incompatibility of the status of a Member of a national parliament with that of a Member of the European Parliament, with exceptions for the United Kingdom and Ireland until the 2009 elections, the power of each Member State to set the ceiling for the electoral expenses of candidates and the power of each Member State to create territorial constituencies which do not affect in a general sense the proportional nature of the elections.
It also brings the 1976 Act into line with the changes introduced by the successive Treaties in the institutions and bodies of the Union and an intelligent solution is found for compliance with the 'Matthews' judgment on the vote of the electorate of Gibraltar.
It is true that Parliament's other proposals have not been included, such as the single constituency for the whole of the European Union, the movement of elections to the month of May and the objective of parity between men and women on electoral lists.
Some people will therefore say that this is a minimal agreement, but the rapporteur believes that it is better to take a step forward towards a more homogenous electoral system, than to remain in the blind alley we were trapped in.
This is how the European Union has acted, moving forward prudently, sometimes excessively so, but moving forward nonetheless, like tortoises, slowly but surely.
Of course the assent does not mean renouncing Parliament's positions.
The rapporteur has opted to re-state them in the recitals, improved by the contributions of the members of the committee, whom I would like to warmly and expressly thank for their cooperation.
These are not purely rhetorical demands.
The draft Decision lays down that the Act would be subject to a new review before 2009, by which time Parliament's demands could be incorporated.
For all these reasons, I would ask you to support the assent in favour of the draft Decision.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by mentioning a proposal by President Delors, which could be a shot in the arm for the European elections: it simply consists of doing at Union level what is done in the Member States, that is, that the head of the electoral cartel should be proposed by the President of the Commission.
The vote would therefore leave behind the realms of abstract notions and purely national references and give the Union a public face.
I have included this proposal in the recitals, with the support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because I strongly believe that it is time that the citizens understood who they are voting for and why.
Madam President, this is a truly historic event: the first modification of the 1976 Act.
President Gil Robles, whom I would like to congratulate as rapporteur for this parliamentary assent, has said that many drafts have become deadlocked.
I remember how a distinguished British Conservative, Edmund Burk, said that Spain was like a whale washed up on the shores of Europe (or something like that, I am quoting from memory).
Therefore, I am very pleased that it is the Spanish Presidency that has managed to break the deadlock on this issue and that in 2002, under the Spanish Presidency, we will have the first reform of the Electoral Act.
I believe this is one of the few cases in which the European Parliament is called upon to issue an assent, that is to say, to vote yes or no, and, furthermore, so that this assent may have legal results, there must be an absolute majority in the House.
This was the conflict the European Parliament was faced with: what to do.
As the rapporteur said, it is true that not all of the aspirations of the European Parliament contained in its previous report, drawn up by our friend and former colleague, Mr Georgios Anastasopoulos, have been taken into account.
It is also true that it was necessary to adapt this Electoral Act to the various and successive modifications of the Treaties.
And it is also the case that we had to comply with a mandate and resolve an issue which stemmed from a judgment of a Court - in this case the Strasbourg Court - and therefore adapt our electoral system to the judgment in the Matthews case.
That is what is being done.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that most of the considerations expressed by the European Parliament on these issues, in its previous report, since the Treaty of Amsterdam modified the uniform electoral system in accordance with the general principles of electoral law, appear in the spirit and the letter of the text before us today.
The Group of the European Peoples' Party is therefore going to vote in favour, and it is true that there will be time to accommodate other requests from the European Parliament in the future.
The historic nature of this moment, however, does not end there, because the Group of the European Peoples' Party is going to support an amendment presented by Mr Bonde - a very unusual thing in this Parliament - because we think it is a good amendment, an amendment in which Mr Bonde says and maintains that those Members of Parliament elected in the territory of a State represent the whole of the electorate, something which, by the way - and this brings me back to what I said at the beginning - was also advocated by Edmund Burk in his comments to the voters of Bristol in 1794.
Madam President, I would therefore like to say that my group will vote in favour of this assent which Mr Gil Robles has drawn up with such skill and dexterity.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work.
He is wise to recommend that Parliament gives its assent to the position that the Council has adopted.
This is one of the only areas under the Treaty where it is the Parliament and not the Commission which has the right of initiative.
We took this initiative some years ago, the Council has acted on our text, and indeed incorporated most of the essential elements that we wished to see incorporated into the uniform electoral system, or at least the common principles for the system.
Our argument that proportional representation should be obligatory in every Member State is accepted.
I come from the last Member State to have introduced proportional representation for European elections and am glad that this will now be recognised as a principle to be applied across all Member States.
It also recognises that so that not everything is done at the level of highly centralised national lists, regional constituencies, which are closer to the people, should be possible, especially in the larger Member States.
The report also recommends that we bring to an end, although this will be phased in, the dual mandate whereby Members sit both in the European Parliament and in their national parliament.
That is an attempt to do two full-time jobs at once: it is no longer feasible, it is no longer tenable and it is right to phase it out.
All in all, we can approve this text although it is not fully satisfactory in every respect, but that is part of the give and take of the European Union, part of the process of accommodation that we go through and we can accept it. My group will therefore be voting for the report by Mr Gil-Robles.
We have a problem, however, with recital D. This recital begins by stating that we regret that the single European constituency, which Parliament proposed, will not be introduced.
The problem here is that Parliament did not propose that, Parliament said that it was something that could be examined for the future, as of the 2009 elections.
The text even says that we regret that it is not to be introduced in time for the next European elections, when we did not even envisage it as a possibility for the next European elections.
If we are serious as a parliament, even those amongst us who support the idea of 10% of the seats being elected in this way, we should take this particular recital out of the text because it actually contradicts the facts and our proposals.
We will be doing ourselves no good by regretting that the Council did not approve something which we did not even propose.
With that small reservation, I can support the text and my group will be voting in favour of the rest of it.
Madam President, as previous speakers have said, it has proved to be an extraordinarily controversial process to get this far, especially for the British who have only now agreed to bring in a fair voting system, without which, it must be said, I would unlikely to be speaking here this afternoon.
The British also accept that they have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of Gibraltar can be represented in this place.
I trust that the participation of Gibraltar within the European political system will soften some of the nationalistic tensions we have seen in that part of the Union.
Several States have quite properly conceded the end of the dual mandate.
This practice is contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and impairs Parliament's efficiency.
So I congratulate the rapporteur and the Belgian and Spanish presidencies for brokering the agreement.
I look forward to a further review of the uniform electoral procedure, by which time I trust that the Convention will have established the argument for regional seats in the larger States as well as for some element of a transnational list.
Madam President, in the opinion of my group, although the rapporteur's resolution is indisputably satisfactory, the Council text is mediocre.
It is true that we have made progress with regard to Gibraltar, and I am pleased for our British and Spanish friends, as well as for the people of Gibraltar.
That said, however, how can the citizens understand that we have European political families when some Members of this Parliament are not elected transnationally?
What is more, how can we explain that a very flexible mandate incompatibility system will preserve overlaps between the offices of members of a national parliament and Members of the European Parliament for a long time to come?
Lastly, how can we explain to the female half of the human race that European electoral law says nothing about gender equality?
I am glad to say that these points are included in the rapporteur's resolution, but we are quite aware that these are only recitals and that the Council and the Member States can do with them as they will.
I would like to draw the attention of the Council to one point: territorial division.
It is said, in French at least, that this will not affect the essentially proportional nature of the voting system.
The word 'essentially' is interesting, firstly because it was not translated into all languages; some Council versions even omitted the adverb.
Moreover, what is meant by 'essentially'?
This concept means that in effect, by chopping up the electoral territory, we may well end up with lists of two or three MEPs in a constituency, meaning that the electoral threshold will become 20 or 30%.
This will certainly simplify debates in this Chamber tremendously, but to the detriment of representativeness.
There is no point to proportionality unless it guarantees that citizens are properly represented.
That is why we are trying to combat this threshold effect in the recitals that have been adopted, and I would like to thank officially our rapporteur and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs while hoping that the Council will come round to this position.
That is why my group has not yet decided whether to vote to endorse this mediocre text.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my group there are different views about how the system for elections to the European Parliament should be developed, and so the group's members will certainly cast their votes in different ways on the report.
My personal view is that the compromise achieved in Council is, as a whole, acceptable, representing as it does a move towards a more homogeneous European electoral system.
The ruling on the incompatibility of membership of the European Parliament and of a national parliament simultaneously was long overdue.
What is particularly heartening is that Gibraltarian citizens can at last take part in European elections.
I very much hope that the citizens of the candidate countries will be able to vote in the 2004 elections and that the accession negotiations will not be delayed.
I am concerned, though, about my government's present activities and I call upon it not to jeopardise the timetable for enlargement.
I wish to address four issues on which my group takes the view that there is an urgent need to change electoral law.
Firstly, we reject minimum thresholds as being undemocratic, putting smaller parties at a disadvantage and hampering political pluralism.
Secondly, it is high time that the right to vote in European elections at last ceased to be restricted to EU citizens.
It is incomprehensible that people from third countries who have been living and working in our Member States for many years, are still denied the right to vote and stand for election.
Why do we not, at last, make an advance towards integration here, especially in view of the menacing increase in hostility towards foreigners in our Member States?
Thirdly, the voting age needs to be reduced.
At the end of April, the Council of the European Youth Forum addressed itself to the Convention, calling for the age for voting and standing for office to be reduced to 16.
I support this demand by young people and hope that the Youth Convention in July will also put all its weight behind it.
Fourthly, the recitals refer to the equality of men and women as being a problem, and rightly so.
I believe it is not acceptable that women make up only some 30% of the Members of this House.
It is for the political parties to put men and women on an equal footing by revising their own rules for drawing up the list of candidates.
Madam President, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, ladies and gentlemen, this report does not seem to me to be very appropriate as, although, strictly speaking, there is no uniform electoral procedure, the European elections have nonetheless been organised on very widely accepted common principles since 1999.
Why, therefore, produce yet another report on a matter that has been discussed numerous times, except to try to re-launch an integration process that seems even more doomed than ever.
We could talk at length about the grounds for a move that arbitrarily imposes proportional representation and, even more controversially, the territorialisation of constituencies in the more populous Member States, by means of Community law.
I would like to emphasise that there is nothing, except reasoning that is as simplistic as it is erroneous, to suggest that this measure would bring the elected closer to the electorate or this being one of the desired objectives, that it would increase participation in European elections.
Single or regionalised constituencies, proportional or majority voting: since 1979, every permutation has been tried, to no avail.
We must therefore accept that tinkering with the electoral laws will not create an artificial feeling of belonging to the European Union or reduce the colossal abstention that affects the legitimacy of Parliament.
Having said that, I would more specifically like to highlight two aspects that I consider unacceptable.
First, the unlikely idea of a single European constituency for the election of 10% of the seats in Parliament, which I am glad to say was rejected by the Council but which is nonetheless referred to by the rapporteur.
Not only does this proposal run entirely counter to the objective of territorialisation - the single European constituency would distance its Members from their voters, whereas territorialisation aims, on the contrary, to bring them closer - but it also ignores Article 189 of the Treaty on the European Communities.
In effect, while the latter stipulates that Parliament must be composed of representatives of the people of the Member States of the Community, it is being proposed that we elect stateless Members.
The second point with which I thoroughly disagree concerns the reflections on the role of the European political parties, which the rapporteur invites to announce a candidate for the Commission Presidency in future election campaigns.
I note that this initiative constitutes a further violation of the Treaty, which gives the governments of the Member States the power to choose the person they wish to appoint as president of the Commission.
What is more, I believe that this ridiculous idea is dangerous, not to say perverse, as, by usurping a responsibility reserved for the Member States, it introduces a party system, and its inevitable corollary, an Assembly Government, at European level.
The participation of the European parties in voting is something that could possibly be considered, but their involvement in the workings of the Community institutions must be firmly opposed.
That is why, with regret, I cannot echo the compliments addressed to our rapporteur - although my criticism is by no means personal - and I therefore conclude that this report must be rejected.
Madam President, as is frequently the case in Parliament, the more we talk about the citizens the more we are thinking only of our own interests.
This draft decision of the Council and the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado make a good impression: utopia, the need for proximity, the idea that we could move towards a European democracy, that we could have someone at the top of the list who would be president of the Commission; all these ideas are as far from reality as utopia was from the ideas of the contemporaries of Thomas More.
Behind this utopia, there is reality, a raw, pragmatic reality; it is quite simply the desire of the large European parties to gain a stranglehold over the European Parliament, the desire of the Party of European Socialists and the European People's Party to appropriate democracy in Europe through territorialisation which, by raising the thresholds, will, in effect, give them a duopoly over European democracy, with the rather spiteful complicity of the Greens, who are hoping to close the gap between themselves and the leading parties in a European constituency.
That is the reality, ladies and gentlemen: the confiscation of European democracy by European political parties which are entirely removed from the political reality of European citizens. This appropriation would be complemented by the funding system which would enable political funds to be reserved for these parties.
What we are witnessing here is a hold-up.
Madam President, the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado proposes that our Assembly endorse the draft decision of the Council on the procedure for European elections and, on this particular point, we agree with the rapporteur.
In effect, this draft, in its current wording, seems to be flexible enough to respect the sovereignty of each country.
On the other hand, assent would go hand in hand with a number of controversial recitals, for example the recital lamenting the fact that the Council draft does not stipulate the possibility of transnational European lists.
On the contrary, we think that these lists would only increase the isolation of the European Parliament from voters in the Member States.
If we have one regret, it is that the Council has forgotten to note that, pursuant to Articles 189 and 190 EC, even in cases where a country creates regional constituencies for the European elections, these Members represent their whole country and not just their constituency, as Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo pointed out earlier.
In any case, this rule is there, since it is enshrined in the Treaty, but we have still submitted an amendment to recall its presence to make sure it is not overlooked.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is all too true that the procedure for direct elections to the European Parliament has been an almost interminable business since the seventies.
Sensible solutions keep getting tangled up in the institutional undergrowth.
Parliament may well have the right of initiative under the European Treaties, but it is the Council that must come to a decision - a unanimous one.
As long as four years ago, we discharged our obligations with the Anastassopulos report, but the Council of Ministers has taken a very, very long time to do something about its own.
Now it has managed to come up with something, we are glad that we at last have a uniform electoral system in time for the 2004 elections, but I must warmly thank Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado for having raised the matters that Parliament has so long called for, but which have unfortunately not been taken up.
Thus, there is nothing left to us other than to accept or reject the Council proposals; in other words, it is a case of 'sink or swim'.
Even though we have to admit that a number of points have been taken on board, matters are as unsatisfactory as ever they were.
This report adds Parliament to the roll of those who have called on the Convention to revise the provisions on EU election law in the Treaty establishing the European Communities.
According to the treaties, Parliament has the right of initiating electoral legislation, and it is not acceptable that it no longer has a part in reaching final decisions.
Matters of such fundamental importance to Parliament require that Parliament be given the full right of codecision.
I can hardly resist saying that the proposed wording concerning the introduction of territorial constituencies, with the protocol on the subject, brings the thorny issue of Great Britain and Gibraltar nearer to a solution.
It is indeed sad that a country like Great Britain, with centuries of experience of Empire and a centuries-old tradition of democracy needs a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights to remind it of its greater responsibilities beyond the bounds of its own territory.
This solution means that the citizens of Gibraltar will at last be able to participate in elections to the European Parliament.
This is certainly a success for democracy in Europe.
Madam President, in the Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado report on the European elections procedure, attention is drawn to a large number of points that are important for an effective, decisive and controllable Europe.
Unfortunately, the actual Council proposal which we need to agree on still contains a number of items that leave room for improvement.
Parliament has in any case expressed its thoughts on the matter.
The European elections have in recent years consistently been typified by a low turn-out.
In my own country, the Netherlands, the turn-out in 1999 was only 30%.
In other countries, the situation was similarly disappointing.
In order to boost the numbers in 2004, the elections must in any case become a great deal more exciting and more political.
The citizen must have the sense that by casting their vote, they can leave their mark on European policy and on the solution to the problems that are crying out for European cooperation, including asylum, food safety and the environment.
This should, firstly, be done by allowing Parliament to appoint the President of the European Commission on the basis of the results of the elections.
This is why in the report, all European political parties are urged to make their candidates known for this position well beforehand.
This gives the candidates a human face, makes them known and ultimately, brings the Commission closer to the people.
The day on which the elections are held is also extremely important in connection with identifying with the European project.
Only when we all vote on the same day will the people have the sense that they are voting for one and the same political body.
Most countries already vote on the same day, namely Sunday.
It is regretful that a limited number of countries, including Ireland, the UK and my own country, the Netherlands, do not go to the ballot boxes on the same day as other European Member States - namely Sunday - and that the sense of excitement is thus lost.
The reason is that apparently, we do want to open the supermarkets for commerce on Sundays, but if respect for democracy is at stake, the Netherlands is not interested.
I would therefore make an appeal to put respect for democracy before commercial interests in the Netherlands and go to the ballot box on Sunday.
Finally, I mooted the idea in the Netherlands last week to have the national Commissioner of the European Commission directly elected by referendum.
It is, in my view, an outmoded notion that such an important, politically recognisable figure should be appointed behind closed doors by government representatives.
This is why I call for a referendum that coincides with the Parliament elections in 2004, where direct votes can be cast for a candidate.
This idea is naturally not only for Dutch purposes, but also for other European countries.
I hope that my fellow MEPs are willing to think this through very carefully, as I believe this to be an interesting idea.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the ten elected Members of the European Free Alliance, the sum total of the regionalist and nationalist Members within the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have a problem with recital C. It does state that it is possible to establish regional constituencies for elections, whereby, however - and I quote - 'the proportional representation of political families at Member State level must not be undermined?.
Could I point out that in the Belgian system, Member State level for European elections is totally irrelevant?
Dutch-speakers and French-speakers go to the ballot boxes in two separate constituencies for elections which are totally unrelated to each other.
In my opinion, recital C is a liberal interpretation of Article 2 of the Council's draft decision.
Moreover, the different language versions - just read the French, Dutch and English versions - are not identical.
The European Free Alliance is also struggling with the reference to transnational lists in recital D. In our opinion, this practice will lead to an even greater erosion of political diversity in this hemisphere.
Indeed, it is making it even more difficult for smaller political formations to obtain seats at transnational, national and regional level, certainly when this is combined with the 5% electoral threshold.
This is why the ten MEPs of the European Fee Alliance will not be endorsing the present recommendation by Mr Gil Robles.
Madam President, this report is a technical stage in the Eurocrats' protracted efforts to develop a political, parliamentary division of the European Union.
These efforts were based on the provisions of the Treaty of Maastricht through which an attempt was made, albeit unsuccessfully in Denmark, to make the electorate and the world around us believe that developing European political parties was an important integration factor.
Through these manoeuvres, aimed at developing a political and parliamentary division, the intention is to create a European political identity.
This political architecture is back to front.
It is like a builder starting with the top floor and building downwards, rather than beginning at ground level.
These efforts are doomed to fail.
They are succeeded by a long list of initiatives regarding European political parties, but politics is not founded on the basis of preconceived resolutions concerning a European construction whose top floor presumably belongs in the stratosphere.
The most recent historical precedent for this form of back-to-front political architecture is the Tower of Babel which, as is well known, did not work out very well, with the construction's never being finished.
Madam President, Mr Gil-Robles and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, sitting side by side, are a physical expression of a profound contradiction, because the spirit of this recommendation thoroughly contradicts the philosophy behind the European Convention.
The Convention is working on the idea of a politically united Europe without internal borders.
Mr Gil-Robles' recommendation, on the contrary, keeps to the path of the past, that of a European Parliament made up of representatives of the Member States instead of the whole European Community.
This is regrettable because different peoples of Europe, such as my own, that have been divided by the action of the current Member States, will remain separated in the future.
For how long will the French, the Spanish and other such separatists persist in this, may I ask?
Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Gil Robles for his report on the organisation of the European elections.
Many renowned rapporteurs have already gone before him, including Edgard Faure, Schelto Patijn, Karel De Gucht and also Mr Anastassopoulos.
All these reports have always resulted in some improvement in the organisation of the European elections.
Once again, the Council's most recent draft decision includes a number of recommendations by our former fellow MEP, Mr Anastassopoulos and Mr Gil Robles.
I would like to mention the principle of proportionate representation, the incompatibility of the membership of national parliaments with that of the European Parliament, a cut in the expenses for campaigns, probably to avoid hold-ups involving multimillionaires from our Parliament.
A number of points have also been missed out.
I should like to mention the requirement of gender equality, I should also like to mention the moving of the election date to avoid it coinciding with holidays.
And something that is unfortunate - and which is the most important point here - is the drafting of one European list.
This is particularly unfortunate, because this was a very sound point and would also have given us the opportunity, for example, to have a new President of the European Commission directly elected via the political parties and via a European list.
It appears that the Council wants to hold on to this power and continue the undemocratic manner in which the President, and also many members of the Commission are appointed.
This is unfortunate.
I specifically say 'many' members, for I also know that a number of the members of the Commission, like Mrs De Palacio, have been directly elected on the European lists.
They are therefore not all there without a mandate.
It is unfortunate nevertheless, and maybe the only way to correct this is to ask the Convention to look into this matter.
In my view, it is very important that the members of the European Commission should be democratically legitimised, like the MEPs.
This could enhance public support for the Commission's work and can also help the members of the Commission take more account of public opinion, as this is done by MEPs.
The idea mooted by Mr van den Berg to solve this by holding a referendum is an interesting one in itself, but I should like to say straight away: you were in government for eight years with your party.
You could have organised it all, but you did not.
It is interesting that you should now ask the former opposition to organise this, and I will certainly pass on the message.
Madam President, when I welcome parties of visitors to Strasbourg, I discover that the majority of these members of the public assume that MEPs are all elected under the same procedure and that we are all paid the same for the work that we do here.
They are all the more surprised to learn that these things are laid down on a national rather than European basis.
Elections to Europe's Parliament are conducted nationally with 15 different procedures which will be 25 once enlargement has taken place, and although we are doing the same work here, the way we are treated varies widely.
This makes it high time for us to get a European statute on MEPs and their work and, of course, for the procedure for European Parliamentary elections to be standardised to make it representative of Europe as a whole.
I also thank Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, who has made an important contribution to our next step towards a uniform election system.
I also want to point out the remaining loopholes that the Council has left.
One of them is the absence of Europe-wide lists in European elections.
We are all aware that the last European elections were almost purely national in character, dealing with internal policy disputes and having very little to do with what we are doing here and with what we are here for.
It is only when we have Europe-wide lists that the European parties will make the effort, and will endeavour to mobilise the public without reference to national borders.
This has not been achieved.
We urgently call on the Council to introduce Europe-wide lists when the electoral system is next revised.
I also agree with Mr van den Berg that it is impossible for us to vote from Thursday to Sunday, with the result being announced only after the votes cast on Thursday have been recorded on Sunday evening.
What has been put before us is a first step, and a good one.
The second step must be taken as a matter of urgency.
Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the fathers of Europe at Laeken - there were probably no mothers there - gave the Convention on the future of Europe something more than a year in which to achieve a big success in the process of making Europe more visible, by drafting the text of a new constitutional treaty.
A quite disproportionately small part of the Convention's work will be devoted to preparing solutions to the issues now raised in the Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado report - a uniform system for elections to Parliament, which will then truly merit the name of 'European', solutions under the heading of 'regionalisation' to the system's proximity - or lack of it - to the citizens, and to the problem of how to make it possible to use the elections to the European Parliament to reach a decision on how to give Europe a face, that is, by the direct election of the President of the Commission.
There is, alas, nothing of any real substance on the subject of European lists.
Work on these few topics has to date taken the Council and Parliament almost thirty years, not always with much by way of results.
Vive la diffÃ©rence is still the watchword for the organising of elections to the European Parliament.
Quite apart from many other aspects, it is precisely this bewildering array of proceedings every fifth June that makes it easy for the European public to regard European elections as unimportant or incomprehensible.
Turnouts of under 50% are their reaction to this deplorable state of affairs.
What is to be done under such circumstances?
Do we put a brave face on a bad job, rejoice in small improvements, thank the rapporteur for his good work and await the miracle that the Convention will bring to pass in fifteen months' time, changing everything and making it better?
I accept the compromise and join in thanking our rapporteur Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, and I call on everyone to wish the Convention and its members success in making the impossible possible, giving Europe a comprehensible and workable structure that the citizen can understand, with electoral laws by which the public will know themselves to be challenged to join in deciding what the future of our shared European home should be.
Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur for his open-mindedness in drawing up this report.
The assent we are going to give on the amendment of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament is part of a strategy of small steps.
A small step is better than nothing but, quite frankly, the text should have been better.
Why are the ideas of mixed voting and of transnational lists combined with proportional lists in a regional context not accepted?
If we want to establish a European public space, we need to bring to life political parties that have a goal, that of electing the representatives of the peoples of Europe to the European Parliament.
If we want to bring to life the concept of European citizenship, this public space needs to be fed with elected representatives, on a basis of transnational constituencies contributing to the appointment of a Commission president.
With regard to equality, I believe the decision could have been bolder and could have proposed a rule of equality for European elections.
On the matter of privileges and immunity, I regret that this amendment of the Act does not make any progress possible when, indeed, we are experiencing difficulties due to the absence of European rules in this field on a daily basis.
Lastly, I would like us to agree on the designation. We should be referred to as 'European Members of Parliament' or 'Members of the European Parliament', not 'representatives' or 'Members'.
All that remains is to hope that this small step will lead to further small steps when the Act is re-examined or within the context of the work of the Convention.
Madam President, the report before the House makes perfect sense if you believe that this Parliament ought to be the legislature of a European Polity.
After all, every other state has a national assembly elected by a uniform method.
But I hope Members will acknowledge that this is not the only legitimate view of the European Union.
Some of us see this Parliament not as a federal assembly, but as a forum wherein the representatives of the peoples of Europe may hold the EU bureaucracy to account.
The role of a Member of the European Parliament is not to be an agent for the European project; it is to represent the interests of his constituents.
I was elected to speak for south east England in Brussels, not to speak for Brussels in south east England.
That is why I believe that it should be up to each Member State to decide how and when to select its MEPs.
I personally favour a majoritarian first-past-the-post voting system.
But even if I did not, I would still object to any method being imposed by the EU.
Nor is it the business of this House to dictate the gender composition of electoral lists.
It is surely up to each party to decide how many men and women it wants to offer as candidates and up to voters to pass judgment on them.
Above all, I object to the reiteration of this Parliament's demand for a pan-European top-up list.
This, it seems to me, elevates the dogma of European integration above any practical considerations of accountability or responsiveness.
There can be no European democracy as long as there is no European demos.
We delude ourselves if we believe that this House commands anything like the affinity and identity which national parliaments have built up over the centuries.
This Parliament could perform a useful role scrutinising the budget and holding the Commission to account. I only wish that the House were more interested in carrying out the functions which it already has, rather than constantly demanding new powers.
Madam President, the Recommendation for which President Gil-Robles is rapporteur is particularly timely given that the European Convention is meeting.
Why?
For a politically very important reason, I believe: if we want to launch any initiative or send any message to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament, we must do so now.
Every day and every week we are hearing all types of messages which argue that the composition of this House leads to democratic deficit.
It is said for example that the democratic deficit must be overcome by strengthening the national parliaments' capacity to act within the processes of European construction.
It is even said openly that the citizens believe that the national Members of Parliament truly represent them rather than European ones, forgetting that they both derive their legitimacy from the same source: universal suffrage and the political will of the citizens as expressed through the ballot box.
I therefore believe it very positive that there should be an improved uniform electoral procedure for the election of Members of the European Parliament.
I would also stress issues which I believe to be essential, such as, for example, the proportional system which directly represents the opinion of the citizens and guarantees plurality; the fact also that parity is asked for - at the moment there are as many female voters as male ones, more even - and the political parties formed on the basis of the will of the citizens, and not only this Parliament, must also show that parity.
Finally - and why not? - we should insist that the person who is elected, when the time comes, by the European Parliament as President of the Commission, should also be put to the people as a candidate to the European Parliament.
So congratulations.
You have my full support.
Madam President, I will speak very briefly.
I am sorry to have arrived late for this debate, but certain presidency obligations in relation to ministerial enlargement conferences have detained me until very recently.
I do not wish to miss this opportunity to express the Spanish Presidency's feelings about this achievement in relation to the European Parliament's electoral procedure.
We have worked hard to achieve it and of course nothing would have been possible without the cooperation and the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Gil Robles, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
I believe we are dealing with an historic agreement.
Let us consider that Parliament is deciding on a text which dates from 1976.
I believe this is a very important step forward.
The Presidency is pleased, because this is a strengthening, a further step - as Mr Carnero said - in the strengthening of the role of the European Parliament as a true representative of the people of Europe.
I believe we should all be pleased and the Spanish Presidency wishes to join in with this important occasion for Parliament and congratulate it and the rapporteur, as well as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Madam President, very briefly, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Gil-Robles, on having completed what he has called this historic report.
While this text originates from 1976, the reality is that the first initiative of this Parliament dates from 1960, and the road has therefore been a long and difficult one. However, it appears that a fruitful conclusion has been reached at last with this text.
I would also like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency and the Council on the efforts they have made to bring together a consensus on what is constitutionally a very important agreement which will be decisive for the elections to the European Parliament scheduled for 2004, which furthermore will be the first elections in which the current candidate countries participate and we hope by then they will be full Members of the Union.
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that this text contains the most important elements of the draft which Parliament adopted in 1998, with the excellent report by the former Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mr Anastasopoulos, and we are therefore delighted that what we have seen in the debate today will be adopted tomorrow by Parliament and - I hope - with the greatest possible majority.
I am sure that the broader political issues mentioned during the debate will be discussed and dealt with by the Convention and perhaps that will be the best place to find a definitive solution to them.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
I believe that today's agreement is an extremely important one in the life of this Parliament and for the future of the construction of Europe.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the preparatory meeting for the Johannesburg Summit, which took place between 27 May and 7 June 2002 in Bali.
Madam President, the Johannesburg Summit constitutes a further step forward in the process begun in Rio de Janeiro aimed at achieving sustainable development at world level.
In Rio, the so-called Agenda 21 was defined, which contains the fundamental objectives to be achieved during this century.
Nevertheless, although important progress has been made, the global environment has continued to deteriorate significantly.
Johannesburg will bring together all the States, all the interested parties, the NGOs, the private sector etc., to draw up new mechanisms for achieving that objective.
This summit is intended to deal jointly with the economic challenges - development in the sense of pure economic growth - the social challenges - the reduction of poverty, achieving the aims of the United Nations Millennium Declaration - and the environmental challenges.
The understanding is that these three challenges are interrelated.
The results of the Johannesburg Summit are expected to include the following elements: a political declaration which represents a renewed commitment by world leaders to achieve the objectives of the Millennium Declaration and the shortcomings in the application of Agenda 21, an action programme with fundamental action commitments, voluntary cooperation initiatives which involve all agents, governments, civil society and the private sector in a series of initiatives to implement the action programme.
The European Union is actively working on the six priorities for Johannesburg in the areas of health, water, energy, trade, global public assets and sustainable models for production and consumption.
I will firstly comment on the preparatory work done during the Spanish Presidency.
During this period there have been two preparatory conferences at world level, held in New York: PREPCON 2 and PREPCON 3, and on 24 May the last preparatory conference began in Bali, PREPCON 4, which includes the ministerial meeting of 4 to 7 June.
Meanwhile, in Brussels the Community positions have been prepared by means of a process made up of the following stages: the conclusions of the Environment Council of 4 March which were endorsed by the Barcelona European Council, the conclusions approved by the Development Council on 30 May and, finally, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 17 June, based on the previous ones and on the results of PREPCON 4, which will be adopted by the Seville European Council as the European Union's global position for Johannesburg.
On the level of the fifteen Member States, the debates have focused on the following issues, which must be resolved at the General Affairs Council of 17 June, immediately prior to Seville: firstly the coherence of Community policies, without prejudice to the adaptation of Community policies to the internal and external objectives of sustainable development.
We must prevent the Johannesburg Summit dictating the nature of the reforms of Community policies.
Secondly, the removal of subsidies prejudicial to the environment.
Although chapter 2, on trade, achieved a formula for compromise, reducing and, where necessary, removing subsidies considered harmful to the environment, there is still no consensus amongst the Member States on the obligatory or automatic nature of the removal of those subsidies.
The Council will also refer to the Swedish initiative of the ombudsman to facilitate exports from the developing countries to the Community market.
A more in-depth study is required before it can be accepted and included at the Johannesburg Summit as a Community initiative.
To this end, the Commission has committed itself to presenting a document in the future to deal with the possible implementation of that initiative.
Financial issues, such as those relating to the possible link between funding and the future initiatives established during the Johannesburg Summit, will also be dealt with, and these financial issues are those which are essential so that the additional official development aid resources, agreed to during the Monterrey Conference, are implemented or allocated to the initiatives established in Johannesburg.
The mobilisation of alternative funding resources, with the intention of combining alternative resources, such as the so-called Tobin tax, with global public assets and the possible extension of the 'Highly-indebted poor countries' initiative.
Secondly, I will comment on the perspectives in the run-up to the Seville European Council.
The Presidency has done much work in preparing for the Johannesburg Summit.
The European Union must make a very significant contribution to this summit and demonstrate a great capacity for leadership, because we are world standard bearers for sustainable development.
I believe that the ratification by the Union of the Kyoto protocol offers proof of this and furthermore because the international preparation of the summit clearly requires European leadership.
At the moment there is disunity at international level and there is a lack of clarity in the intended objectives for the summit.
PREPCON 3 was disappointing and the new proposed action programme must have greater consensus and must be more specific.
The United States wants to minimise political issues as much as possible and would even like to remove the political declaration and the action programme in order to concentrate on implementation.
Furthermore, the United States' focus in relation to implementation is innovative: it wants to create new 'transfunds' which can bring together public and private money, which is rejected by several European partners.
The Presidency believes that the European Union should play a role similar to the one it played in Monterrey: to seek consensus with our main partners.
As soon as possible we must coordinate our efforts with JUSCANZ, the group made up of the USA, Japan and Canada, and with the Group of the 77.
Maximalism and political confrontation get us nowhere.
Monterrey was a success, because the European Union worked throughout for a consensus, and if practical results were achieved to benefit developing countries, then in Johannesburg we must try to do the same.
If we do not achieve this, the ghost of Durban and the problems during that summit will weigh heavily on Johannesburg.
One-thousand-five-hundred non-governmental organisations are going to participate, some of which are very radical.
Some seem more interested in confrontation than in achieving concrete results which benefit the developing countries.
At the PREPCON 4 in Bali, we have tried to reach consensus on a short action programme with a clear focus.
A political declaration must be very short, very clear and prevent confrontation, and must be aimed at implementation and practical issues.
In this respect, it is important that the European Union has a communication strategy with which to confront the Johannesburg Summit.
We must have a clear vision of what we want in Johannesburg and of how we want to communicate that vision to world public opinion, but above all European public opinion, which, as I said before, has led the way on all these issues.
Finally, the presidency believes that the global pact which we intend to create on the basis of the results of Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg, must be founded on the principles of democracy, respect for human rights and good government.
The developing countries must respond to the financial efforts of the developed countries by combating corruption and acquiring firm democratic values.
Mr President, the European Commission's role in the UN Ministerial preparatory conference in Bali, at which I represented the European Commission, was facilitated by the comprehensive reports prepared by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Lannoye and discussed with my colleague, Mr Nielson, at Parliament's part-session last month.
The Commission agreed with Parliament last month that the preparatory process for the world summit is not going as well as we would like.
This remains our assessment after the Bali meeting.
As we have heard, three documents are being prepared for Johannesburg: an action plan on sustainable development, drawn up under the leadership of the UN-appointed chairman, Dr Salim, secondly a political declaration and thirdly criteria for the launching and monitoring of partnerships to implement the actions and political commitments agreed in Johannesburg.
None of these documents was finalised in Bali, but while the Bali meeting to prepare for Johannesburg was not a breakthrough, it was not a breakdown of the process either.
There was intensive EU coordination throughout the meeting in Bali.
Ministers agreed that the key EU objectives to be achieved were, firstly, the setting of clear targets and time-frames, especially for water, sanitation and energy, secondly the establishment of a clear linkage between the political commitments and targets in the proposed action plan, and their implementation through initiatives or partnerships, and thirdly an agreement on the shift to sustainable patterns of consumption and production.
Some progress was made in these areas in Bali, as well as on issues such as health, Africa, small island states and the environment and some of the differences between delegations were reduced.
However, the meeting was dominated by the developing countries' insistence on trade and finance issues.
The G 77 group pressed for the creation of a world solidarity or poverty fund based on voluntary contributions from public and private funds.
Whilst it said that it did not wish to reopen agreements reached in launching the trade round in Doha or at the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterey, the G 77 group was seeking signals from the developed countries which could lead to increased market access for developing in addition to least-developed countries and ways of constraining those that have not yet clearly committed increased resources under the Monterrey Consensus to do so.
Since the developed countries have always made it clear that market access questions would have to be discussed in the World Trade Organisation in the context of the Doha development agenda and that there would be no new public funds for development beyond what had been pledged in Monterrey, the positions taken by the G77 representatives, led by Venezuela, inevitably led to an unfortunate standoff between the developing and developed countries.
This blockage in the means of implementation meant that we were unable to achieve the breakthrough we were looking for in Bali.
Whilst useful progress was made in cleaning up the text of the action plan, large parts - including some key EU objectives - have not been agreed.
All these issues will have to be sorted out either in informal meetings or actually at the Johannesburg Summit.
A successful outcome in Johannesburg now depends on finding ways of bridging the gap between the developed and developing countries over trade and finance issues.
The EU position has a lot of appeal for developing countries, not least because it seeks, inter alia, to promote common commitments on increasing trade-related assistance and capacity building beyond pre-Doha levels, to search for innovative ways to encourage trade in sustainable products and to encourage the emulation of the European "Everything but Arms" initiative.
The European Union therefore can, and must, play a constructive role in bringing the parties together.
However, unless a satisfactory solution is found, there is a risk that the Johannesburg meeting will be dominated by acrimony over the issues of trade and finance and the focus on sustainable development risks being lost.
If that happens, the opportunity to make progress with sustainable development could be missed.
Now is the time for leadership.
The South Africans are now in the driving seat and will need our help and support to pull things together in the coming weeks.
The European Union will need to play its part in overcoming differences in the next few weeks.
Future meetings, such as the Seville European Council and the G8 meeting, as well as bilateral contacts, will provide important opportunities for review and discussion by developed countries on how to respond to G77 concerns without reopening the Doha and Monterrey agreements.
We will need to work closely with G77 to re-establish a climate of trust and partnership and explain our globalisation and sustainable development agenda.
In addition to the political context, we will also continue our technical work to build support for our partnership initiatives, which can bring real benefits to developing countries in terms of poverty reduction, health and educational improvements and environmental protection.
Together we must ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in ensuring that the outcome of Johannesburg is ambitious and action-orientated.
The European Parliament is an advocate of sustainable development.
We must bring a sense of urgency to the preparations for Johannesburg in the short time that lies before us.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr de Miguel, the outcome of the preparatory meeting held in Bali has been a disappointment.
The fact that the various nations proved incapable of overcoming their national self-interest makes us extremely apprehensive about the outcome of the Johannesburg Conference.
There is even a definite feeling in the air, it could be said, that failure is a real possibility.
Given the degradation of the environment and of social conditions that we have been seeing, the Johannesburg Summit is crucial to producing a blueprint for a more harmonious planet.
Failure would not only be unacceptable but also an outrage.
We must build bridges in order to save this Conference, but, and let me state this clearly, in the run-up to Johannesburg many countries are adopting a blocking approach, others a more passive approach and I do not believe I am far off the mark in saying that, objectively, only the European Union is setting off for Johannesburg with the desire to give an ambitious worldwide commitment to sustainable development.
Against this backdrop, and because we cannot waste the kind of opportunity we have not had for ten years and which is unlikely to be repeated in the next ten, the European Union must play a leading role.
This applied to the Kyoto Protocol, and must apply to the Johannesburg Summit.
The EU must demonstrate leadership that results in the definition of concrete policies, timetables and targets in fields such as biodiversity, the 'greening' of the economy, financing for developing countries, energy, water and trade.
This leadership cannot be underpinned, however, by institutional imbalance, with the Commission and the Council on one side and the European Parliament on the other.
We must learn from the mistakes, but also from the successes of the past.
The role of the European Parliament delegations such as, for example, at the decisive conferences for the Kyoto Protocol, in The Hague, Bonn and in Marrakech, a role, as a matter of fact highlighted by the Commission and the Council, leads us to think that we need to give the European Parliament a more fitting role for this Johannesburg Summit.
Consequently, out of respect for the citizens that we represent here, I believe it is crucial that the European Parliament has the right not only to send a delegation of 25 Members of this House, but also and above all the right to have its representatives participate in the daily European Union coordinating meetings.
The European Parliament does not want to negotiate - we are familiar with the Treaties.
It is not the European Parliament's task to negotiate, but we do want Parliament, the Commission and the Council to maintain unity in Johannesburg and in order for this to help make the Conference a success, it is essential that Parliament has the right to participate in these European Union coordinating meetings.
Madam President, Commission and Council, the meeting in Bali was scarcely a source of great delight.
In a way, every meeting prior to Johannesburg is the cause of ever increasing depression.
It would have been better if the political leadership we are now beginning to talk about had been assumed in time.
At five minutes to midnight, it is a little late to begin talking about political leadership.
I do not wish to be wise after the event or to confront either the Commission or the Council but, before the Gothenburg Summit last year, we in the European Parliament said, 'Make sure that external relations are included when we devise a sustainability strategy', 'Make sure that, when we adopt our own sustainability strategy, Johannesburg is a natural part of this' and 'Do not delay'.
Rather than end up in the doldrums we are now experiencing, I should like in a way to have seen the banner kept flying a little higher en route from Gothenburg to Johannesburg.
The Commission has done an excellent job and done as much as it could.
On the other hand, the Council's enthusiasm in the run-up to Johannesburg has been, to say the least, conspicuous by its absence.
The European Parliament may be talked about as the advocate of good causes, but it is no use our standing here in the Chamber and pleading our own cause when we do not obtain the relationship we need, either with the Council or the Commission, on this issue.
It seems a bit pointless simply to tag along to Johannesburg as a kind of icing on the cake.
We must, in any event, have political influence.
Now, more than ever, do we need political direction.
We need clear timetables for the millennium objective, and we need a clear division of responsibilities.
It is not enough to say that the people of the world need water. Instead, we must talk about who is to arrange for the water to be provided.
It is not enough to say that people must have access to food if we do not say who is to ensure that the food reaches their tables.
Obviously, trade and funding must be part of the picture. These are, in a way, the lynchpins.
We know that they are a part of sustainable development.
What, however, I am looking for, especially on the part of the Council, in the run-up to Johannesburg is commitment, conviction and an ability to see things in context.
We must act as a bridge between the poorest countries and the G77 Group.
That much is obvious.
We must strike up a dialogue.
That is not something we shall do in Johannesburg.
It is something we must work on in the short time that remains before Johannesburg.
Madam President, all too many people in the world are starving, and all too many are living in poverty.
All too many people are affected by deadly diseases such as malaria and AIDS, a fact which threatens the growth and development we all desire.
The way forward is more growth and prosperity in the developing countries - growth and prosperity which must be combined with sustainability.
There are two factors crucial to growth and prosperity. There is the ability to trade freely across national frontiers - that is to say, free trade - and there is limited state power, free from corruption, in the form of a constitutional state.
It is tariff barriers, and not free trade, which create poverty.
Secrecy creates both poverty and stagnation, and we must therefore secure an agreement that breaks down tariff barriers and that guarantees free trade, as well as developing countries' free access to the market, and we must begin with ourselves.
We must also require something of the developing countries, however.
We must require, and tighten up our demands for, democracy, sound governance and the observance of human rights.
We must secure international agreements on environmental protection and the fight against deadly diseases.
The developing countries are clear about the fact that, if they are isolated, their opportunities for prosperity will be crushed.
Unfortunately, the rich countries often put obstacles in the way of developing countries' growth, especially by demanding duties, setting up obstacles to trade under cover of environmental regulations and subsidising their own agricultural production.
In that way, the rich countries bear a large share of the responsibility for the problems of the developing countries.
There is a need for a fundamental change of course.
We need to break down all the tariff barriers and phase out all the obstacles to trade.
Our challenge and task are to get all the rich countries to comply with the UN's objective whereby 0.7% of Gross National Product would be granted by way of development aid, but we must go on making demands of the developing countries in terms of economic reforms and better governance.
In Johannesburg, we must take a decisive step in the direction of a global reform programme for freedom and prosperity.
We owe that to the future, and it is something which Parliament and the EU must work for.
Madam President, the meeting in Bali was a failure.
I believe that is a generally-held view.
We must learn from this failure at once.
We have very little time left before Johannesburg.
There is a risk of a concept we do not want, the concept of the privatisation of sustainable development, being imposed at Johannesburg.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has just referred to the voluntary partnership agreements with private companies.
I believe we must avoid lapsing into ideology: we must see the partnership agreements as a potentially useful tool to complement the policies, but they must have a political framework and each party must be fully aware of the context in which they are operating.
This, however, must not replace voluntary government policies, although that is clearly what certain parties involved would like, and I am thinking in particular of the United States.
I believe that the European Union, as Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said, must be ambitious in its goals for Johannesburg.
In order to achieve our goals, however, we need allies.
Perhaps we should prioritise dialogue with the countries that expect a lot from us, that is to say the poor countries; I think, for example, that the G 77 group is one group we must certainly prioritise.
In this respect, I think that two proposals would give very positive political signals to these countries.
The first, as explained by the President-in-Office of the Council, would be to propose that we change the European policies which prevent developing countries and the poorest countries from making progress towards sustainable development or meeting their basic needs.
I am thinking in particular of aid for agricultural exports.
It is unacceptable for us to continue to maintain an aid system for exports which penalises these countries.
We must therefore make a significant gesture in this area.
The second proposal would consist of promoting a legal framework imposing constraints on transnational companies to encourage them to fulfil their environmental, social and economic responsibilities.
It is not acceptable that, while States are constrained by international rules, transnational companies, which are sometimes far wealthier than States, are completely free and unrestricted.
Madam President, I had a speech prepared, but that is not the speech I shall give.
I too was disappointed at what I read and heard of events in Bali.
However, I am also disappointed by what the presidency had to say and I should like to ask a few specific questions:
What are the real problems?
What was the opposition?
Who is responsible for the stalemate, or rather the failure of Bali?
We are talking politics here.
We did not come here to provide a shoulder to cry on.
The Commissioner gave a number of details, but we need far more than that.
Are you going to say anything about the deal between the United States, Canada et al and the petroleum producing countries and how it is stopping renewable sources of energy from taking off?
Are you at long last going to give us a more political opinion on the increasing unreliability of important partners with whom we are perhaps still hoping to broker agreements in Johannesburg?
I agree with what Mr Lannoye said about our policies; they have to change.
Following Bush's policy towards American farmers, who seriously believes that there can be the tiniest change in Europe towards European farmers?
We really do need to find reliable allies.
And they really are to be found among the poorest in the world.
We really do have to say something to persuade them.
Leadership succeeds not by what it says but by how it persuades.
So, first, there is the Kyoto and the Cartagena way.
We can continue along this course, even if unreliable partners pull out.
There are huge efforts which can be made both on the question of trade relations and on the question of funding, without overturning what was agreed in Doha and Monterrey.
And even greater efforts can be made, especially with regard to public assistance.
There is the question of administration, what some refer to as gouvernance.
We demand good governance on the part of developing world countries and we are incapable of good governance of the world per se, with institutions, rules, resources, funding, possibly even taxes, which we are quick to reject.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the World Conference on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg could provide a unique opportunity for creating sustainable development, economically, socially and in environmental terms, for future generations, but it requires the rich world to sacrifice something in the interests of such development.
It is unfortunate and almost embarrassing that the talks in Bali concerning a global agreement on sustainability in actual fact broke down.
It shows the rich world's unwillingness to commit itself when it comes to the key issues of globalisation, trade and development.
The rich countries have still not fulfilled the pledge they made in Rio.
The developing countries are therefore justified in expecting these issues to be dealt with.
The developing countries want, and should be given, guarantees that the industrial countries are beginning to phase out state subsidies for agriculture and that the additional aid for the environment and for sustainable development, promised to them in Rio ten years ago, is in fact on the way.
The rich countries have so far been very dismissive, however.
The United States does not wish to make the necessary concessions, and the EU is hesitating.
The EU has staked a certain amount of prestige on making a success of the world summit but, as is clear from the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, it has quite simply been insufficiently prepared.
The EU must now, at the eleventh hour, go home and prepare itself.
Hopefully, we shall have agreed, in as little as two weeks' time in Seville, to take entirely practical initiatives.
For Denmark, the world summit will be the first big international event of its EU Presidency and also a test of that presidency.
Access to our markets is the key to the developing countries' being able to compete successfully, but it is no use the EU's making unduly strict demands of the developing countries as a condition of free trade, and they must certainly not be used as an excuse for the EU's and the United States's maintaining obstacles to trade.
Determined work must be done on bringing the EU together in guaranteeing the world's poorest countries access to the rich countries' markets.
The developing countries must be given a pledge of free and fair trade.
As part of this, the EU must necessarily phase out export and production subsidies.
As the country holding the presidency of the EU, Denmark should insist on all countries' complying with the UN's objective whereby 0.7% of Gross National Product is to be donated by way of aid to developing countries.
Mr President, we have to concede, and confess before every summit, that the sustainable development situation has got worse since the last one.
We are running the risk of the public, who play a crucial part in all our environmental decisions and projects, slowly becoming resigned to it.
The European Union's credibility in Johannesburg will be dependent on what we achieve here, on our ecological requirements and, not least, on the way we vote here throughout the year.
The industrialised states, above all the fifteen EU states, can very definitely be considered rich in economic terms, and if they are not in the lead by miles, we cannot demand that the developing countries make sacrifices.
I believe that what happens at the so-called environmental summits is not as decisive as what we bring to pass in our practical work between the summits and how we get it across to our citizens.
Mr President, the results in Bali were very meagre.
It is clear to me that the whole of this preparatory process has been poorly organised, with poor leadership and, of course, a lack of political will on the part of the majority of players.
What is most notable, I think, is the United States's lack of interest in common solutions.
This is in extreme contrast to the incredible pressure put on us by the United States precisely to seek common solutions in the fight against terrorism.
I wonder why Washington does not see that these two issues are in some way interrelated.
After Bali, there is every reason to wonder what we are to do now.
Four points strike me as being very important.
I appreciate that the poor countries are looking for more aid, more support and better trade regulations, but I believe it is very important also to realise that more money alone will not lead to sustainable development.
What we have to do - and I believe the EU can adopt a leading role in this area - is to review our own regulations.
We must do away with subsidies that are harmful to the environment, ensure that market prices accurately reflect the full costs, and introduce norms and standards that necessarily make for greater efficiency in the way in which energy and materials are used.
We must also review policy in areas in which we know that we are at present, in actual fact, harming poor countries in particular.
That applies to agricultural, trade and fisheries policies.
Finally, and as Mrs WallstrÃ¶m quite rightly pointed out, we must focus on a number of issues.
If I were to choose just one of these, it would be the energy issue.
We know that several billion people at present have no access to modern energy and, as long as that is the case, there can be no development.
If, however, they were to obtain access to energy under conventional conditions, that would lead to major damage to the environment and climate.
The EU will have to adopt a very radical and active approach in this area and ensure that we can develop forms of aid for solving this specific problem.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want right now to join in the weeping and wailing over the fiasco in Bali, and I also propose to leave out the points that have already been addressed.
I would like to draw attention to the core areas which, notably with the Cotonou Agreement, we have resolved to do something about, first among them being the war on poverty.
That means seeing to basic services and health care, providing clean water for all, giving all children basic education, and, if possible, facilitating the participation of adults in educational programmes.
Now that is not an end in itself, but rather something without which, in the final analysis, it is impossible to gain an understanding of the problems that affect every society and everyone's quality of life.
Those for whom every day is a struggle for survival are not readily going to be won over by lofty objectives.
It is our responsibility to liberate them from the need to spend every day in search of food.
It should be noted in this context that women have a key role to play in all development, and that there must be forceful demands made in Johannesburg for us to help put women in a position to take an active part in the process of development and actively contribute to the improvement of living conditions.
All over the world, it is women who support development processes that lead to changes in civil society.
I would also like to mention the need to facilitate access to global communications in order to make social benefits possible.
In conclusion, I will not conceal my concern at the conduct of the Spanish Presidency, which is evidently aiming to abolish the Development Council.
That would send all the wrong signals to Johannesburg.
The fight against poverty can only be won if we use natural resources in a responsible manner.
More than two billion people are deprived of modern forms of energy and more than one billion people have no clean drinking water.
Agricultural production is on the decline while the number of mouths to be fed is increasing.
Bio-diversity would have been a thousand times greater if man had not interfered with nature, and the link between a polluted environment and health is evident.
Rio's political framework was sound, but its execution poor.
Over the past ten years, official development aid for nature and the environment even took a serious blow and there is hardly any evidence of good governance.
At the start of this century, the world leaders are given another chance, but Johannesburg can only succeed if specific implementing programmes are drafted with concrete pledges to match.
Whoever declares war on poverty must make peace with nature.
Mr President, many things have been said.
For my part, I am going to concentrate on the energy issues that are really vital.
Today there are two billion people in the world who do not have access to energy.
My question is to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m: I know that the European Union was quite ambitious with regard to a specific objective concerning renewable energy.
Perhaps you could tell us who is opposed to this and how we can make progress in this area.
The European Commission's lack of consistency over energy as well as farming subsidies is also regrettable.
EUR 300 billion have now been allocated world-wide to nuclear and fossil fuels.
If these subsidies were to be reduced, we would have substantial sums available to support investment in renewable energy and help the two billion people who do not have access to energy.
I wonder if the position adopted by the European Union at Gothenburg to phase out energy subsidies still applies now.
In conclusion, a word to the Spanish Presidency.
If you put as much effort into helping countries that need help to develop enough to support their population as you are into building a wall around Europe, if you channelled this energy into becoming involved once again in the Johannesburg process, then I think your Presidency would be seen in a better light.
Mr President, in the last part-session I stated that Monterrey did not augur well for the Johannesburg Summit.
Now, the Bali preparatory meeting has not only confirmed this but seems to have actually consolidated this sad observation.
Johannesburg, therefore, is at risk of being a total failure, with extremely damaging consequences for the environment, for the poor countries and for the planet as a whole.
We need only bear in mind that around one hundred items on the agenda have still not been agreed on, notably as a result of the intransigent and inflexible position of the United States.
Given this scenario, which we must counter, the issue we need to address today is what the position of the European Union and all the Member States will be; what position they will be adopting in the preparatory phase of the summit itself.
And, crucially, whether they will fall in line with the unacceptable position of the United States, which is provocatively intransigent, if we consider the recent measures of agricultural protectionism they have adopted; or whether, instead, they will be prepared to follow on from the Rio Summit, both in the field of practical aid for development and for fighting poverty, and in terms of effectively protecting the environment.
The profound contradictions that became evident in Bali, and which must be overcome, require determination and clear and judicious proposals that do not link trade with development, which seems to be a consequence of the intention to end our own Development Council.
Incidentally, I must say that Johannesburg cannot be seen simply as an extension of Doha and that these measures cannot, of course, consider the environment simply to be a business, as the United States claim.
We must bear in mind that failure in Johannesburg will threaten the reasonable expectations raised in Rio.
The European Union, therefore, has an obligation to commit itself wholeheartedly to adopting a constructive position and strategy, which are already long overdue, given that we only have a few weeks before the summit is to start.
Mr President, Commissioner, regrettably, when we talk about sustainable development, we find it hard to be specific.
The Bali meeting was disappointing and we do indeed have everything to fear for Johannesburg.
A summit like this every ten years should enable us to achieve results, whether with regard to energy, water, economic development, or developing countries.We know what our mistakes are and yet we are not making any progress.
The enthusiasm present at Kyoto has evaporated amid much disappointment.
The rich countries are virtually at a standstill while the developing countries are floundering in their problems, their poverty, their lack of resources.
My impression is that we are appeasing our consciences by talking about sustainable development, but that this is yet another hollow promise.
We all have a responsibility to future generations, and this responsibility is incumbent upon all the States; it is incumbent upon the Member States of the European Union, which, however, only too often delay the implementation of their decisions indefinitely, for no real reason.
Lastly, I also regret the attitude of the United States with regard to international commitments to safeguarding our planet.
In the context of the fight against terrorism, the United States is asking for increased international cooperation.
We are all in favour of developing this special relationship, and of this cooperation being included in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol too.
American industry has declared itself to be in favour of this agreement.
It knows that it would be a disadvantage in the long term to remain outside the system.
I would like the United States, under the influence of this cooperation, to be able to take an active role in this fight against poverty, resource protection, energy development and climate change, following the example of Europe and, soon, I hope, Russia and Japan.
Of course, it is up to the European Union to set ambitious objectives, but these must be attainable so that all the parties involved can find the necessary resources.
Local communities should be given the right and the wherewithal to exercise power at their own level, and it would also be beneficial to encourage private initiatives and place more trust in civil society.
Mr President, clearly, after Bali, there is a great danger that the Johannesburg Summit will be nothing but a great media event which calls forth grand declarations of principle but which does not update or practically advance the Rio process.
With regard to this event, it has already been said that the Union will have a delicate, difficult task.
It is being called upon once again to show the leadership that it displayed in reinvigorating the Kyoto Protocol.
In any case, the fight against climate change is indeed the first of the four priorities on which I believe we must focus at Johannesburg, working towards the conclusion of a binding political agreement involving more countries than have already ratified the Protocol.
The second priority is the right to water.
In this area too we must work towards a binding agreement regulating bilateral and multilateral relations and establishing time frames and procedures for providing the billion people who are still without access to water with a minimum level of access to this resource too.
The third priority item is biodiversity and, in particular, the minimum goal of stabilising the existing situation through an agreement ensuring that the world's genetic heritage is shared by all.
The fourth and last priority, however, is political and institutional in nature: how to establish a United Nations body which has the power to intervene in, monitor and control international environmental undertakings.
I know that there are other major issues on which decisive progress needs to be made, but the real success of Johannesburg will be measured according to the progress made in the four areas I have mentioned.
Mr President, one of the reasons that Bali was so disappointing is that people need incentives to become involved in achieving the goal of sustainable development.
Every failure to reach agreement, such as this, sends out very negative signals.
Action plans should focus on people because development can only be truly sustainable in its widest possible sense if it looks at people's needs but has respect for different languages and cultures as well as cultural values.
There has to be partnership with developing countries and structures that respect democracy, human rights and good governance - new structures for global governance such as the World Environment Agency.
As we have heard from the other speakers, there is general pessimism about the prospects of success at Johannesburg, so I would like to ask the Commission what the EU strategy in pursuit of sustainable development will be if Johannesburg does not deliver.
Mr President, our hope is that the European Union, through the Council, the Commission and Parliament, will play a leading role at the Johannesburg World Summit, which is to assess the progress made in implementing Agenda 21, considering that sustainable development and combating poverty are indisputably two priority objectives.
As the leading donor of aid, the European Community must take this opportunity to play its rightful guiding role on the international stage - in the absence of the United States - contributing along with the other international institutions to the success of this event.
However, its success will depend largely on achievable objectives being set.
The recent undertaking to increase development aid will certainly be an important signal for the summit, but it is essential to establish a precise calendar and achievable deadlines without delay, together with an action plan which is realistic as well as ambitious.
It will be crucial, for instance, to proceed along the path of debt cancellation, with due regard for human rights and the principles of good government, encouraging actions such as the adoption by the poor countries of a digitalised computerised complimentary accounting model which will make their accounts transparent and reassure the European taxpayer.
The FAO Summit which opened in Rome yesterday in witness to the renewed commitment towards and interest in the problems affecting the southern hemisphere paints a discouraging picture, an on-going holocaust: someone dies every four seconds.
In 2030, when there will be 8 billion people, it will make a difference whether we have turned words into actions.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council, and I think we can rely on the Commissioner to take a very strong stand on these important issues.
As she acknowledges, the European Union has a particular and important role to play: as a major donor of aid, as the biggest donor of humanitarian aid in the world and as the biggest trading block in the world.
We have clout and we need to punch our weight in Johannesburg, but I acknowledge that it will be difficult.
Market access is a key issue.
President Museveni, after the Bali meeting, said that talk about sustainability is all very well but that market access is the most important issue.
Ghana also challenged the European Union last week, saying that the Union talks about opening borders and about bringing down barriers, but is clearly protectionist and unfair.
Ghana, of course, is talking about the high tariffs that have to be paid when an attempt is made to introduce processed coffee into the European Union.
Nor can we preach about free trade when we continue to hand out subsidies to our farmers which artificially depress the prices of commodities such as cotton.
We need coherence, we need consistency, we need to have an understanding of what self-reliance actually means, providing a ladder out of poverty, and we also need to understand about creating real global partnerships.
Commissioner, you need alliances in Johannesburg.
The United States is blocking plans to halve the number of people who lack sanitation - two fifths of the population of the planet - while 2.4 billion do not have any sanitation, not even a bucket to use, in a world where that is one of the main causes of disease.
Twenty five per cent of urban Africans have no piped water whatsoever.
The US position is always a very negative one, as it was when I was at the UN Children's Conference.
The world's superpower is not prepared to address these imperatives, and I hope that we will make a clear case that we will not meet the millennium development goals unless we take strong action.
Mr President, I am glad to hear that the Spanish Presidency assures us that the Council will play a leadership role at Johannesburg.
However, if it is going to, then it will have to get its act together very fast.
The Commissioner complains that the G-77 is insisting on the Global Solidarity Pact.
But what they wanted was essentially the money that was promised to them ten years ago, which was supposed to pay for the implementation of the Rio agreements agreed then.
No wonder they have no faith in the North, which has not produced that money yet.
On trade, the Commissioner says that if Johannesburg focuses on trade issues we will lose the focus on sustainable development.
The point is that you cannot separate trade and sustainable development.
If people are to have secure access to water, we cannot pressure them into privatising their water supplies under the GATS agreement.
If people are to have secure access to food, we cannot keep dumping agricultural products on their markets.
It seems that it was agricultural subsidies in the EU that yet again broke one of the deals on the table.
There is extraordinary hypocrisy in demanding subsidy reduction and neo-liberal economic policies in the South while practising old-fashioned northern protectionism in the North.
Mr President, the preliminary meeting in Bali does not bode well for the UN Summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg this summer.
I think that Bali was the last opportunity to lay down a number of priorities, as well as a concrete and binding action plan.
But traditional contradictions, such as the gap between North and South and the transatlantic tensions, have quashed these goals.
Yet it all started so promisingly.
Ten years ago in Rio, the environment and development were combined for the first time.
In addition, the need for sustainable development was recognised by all countries.
But since then, little has happened with the results of Rio.
The Kyoto Protocol took forever to be established and even now, it depends on Russia whether it will actually enter into force.
The US, the largest polluter, has rejected the Kyoto Protocol because it would harm the American economy, upon which Canada and Australia pulled out as well.
Washington adopted the same attitude in Bali.
It appears that the Bush administration does not want any binding agreements, but favours voluntary, noncommittal agreements from the private sector.
However, global warming and the future of our planet are problems that are too serious to be left to the goodwill of industry.
By the way, what gives the US the right to make demands from developing countries if the US itself flouts all international agreements?
It is clear that the transatlantic gap is becoming wider.
Kyoto has illustrated that, based on short-sighted political considerations, the Bush administration deems America's short-term interests more important than the well-being of future generations.
The European Union, on the other hand, has assumed its responsibility in Kyoto and with it, has confirmed its moral leadership.
I hope it will adopt the same consistent and decisive approach in Johannesburg.
Mr President, I would like to start with some good news from the Bali meeting: it was decided there to start a ten-year programme of work relating to sustainable patterns of production and consumption.
Quarrels over diminishing but vital natural resources and decent living space may well be the cause of future conflicts or even wars.
For this reason, natural resources must be brought under sustainable control and growth must be achieved without overexploitation of natural resources.
Unfortunately, as has been said here, the Bali meeting was otherwise a disappointment in many ways.
We are still looking for sufficient levels of commitment to respond to the challenges of the future.
The European Union must also demand full commitment on the part of the Rio+ partners to take further steps forward.
The United States of America and the other industrialised countries are obviously primarily responsible, but the European Union must build a bridge to the less developed countries too.
It is the European Union that ultimately has to serve as the motor that will keep development running and help us achieve these much needed steps forward at the forthcoming meeting.
For the European Union to be adequately effective, however, it must be strong internally.
Consequently, all the institutions must speak with one voice. In two weeks' time in Seville we shall have the chance to do just this and make the European voice heard.
By the same token, we have to make sure that the European Parliament is effectively involved in the preparation process and coordination.
Mr President, one billion people do not have access to drinking water and three million die every year from diseases caused by poor water quality or lack of water.
There are 800 million starving people in the world and 24 000 people die of hunger every day.
Twenty-eight million people are living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, of whom 2.3 million died of AIDS last year.
These figures are telling and are all too well-known.
The Heads of State and Government, however, are absent from the World Food Summit in Rome this week.
These same ministers were incapable of making specific commitments in Bali.
The World Health Fund is sorely lacking in financial resources.
Worse still, most of the conventions concluded since Rio, ten years ago, are still not being applied.
This, of course, is due to the attitude of the United States Government and the multinationals.
The worst polluters of the planet deny their culpability and refuse to take action with regard to the victims, the countries of the southern hemisphere.
What are we Europeans doing, apart from pontificating as we did at Monterrey?
How do we think dismissing our development advisers, as was proposed at Seville, will contribute to sustainable development?
If the Johannesburg Summit fails, the European Union will have to shoulder its responsibility.
Mr President, the results of the preparation of the Johannesburg Conference would not perhaps have been so poor - and the outlook for the Conference so pessimistic - if the parties had been more willing, and above all able, to see beyond their own partial short-term interests and to realise that we are at an extremely important turning point, not only in terms of achieving sustainable development - although this alone would deserve all our efforts - but also of achieving security and governability on a world scale.
In the ten years between Rio and Johannesburg, there has been a fundamental change towards a globalised society in which social and economic inequalities seem closely linked to environmental problems and governability in all countries.
The eradication of poverty is becoming a priority objective in the world because it is the only way we can guarantee security, governance and equality in a globalised world.
After almost thirty years of policies aimed at reconciling economic development, the environment and social well-being, I believe that we have a pretty good knowledge of the range of instruments and measures to be applied in order to achieved balanced growth in a globalised world: transparency and openness of the markets, management of knowledge and innovation, transfer of technologies, the efficiency of our processes and products, the acceptance and application of social and environmental responsibility in all sectors; these are some of the most important measures.
We need to approach Johannesburg by strengthening the coalition between government, civil society and the production sector, in order to jointly deal with the main challenges of global sustainability and equality.
The European Union has offered clear signs of its desire to lead this process.
I hope that in Johannesburg we will be able - and I include the delegation from the European Parliament here - to defend brave, generous and worthy positions which will show us to be what we aspire to be: leaders in the new world order.
Mr President, I welcome this afternoon's debate, because if ever a process needed fresh political impetus and initiative this one does.
What Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m correctly called a stand-off in her speech this afternoon will not be solved unless the European Union visibly shifts its position towards that of developing countries.
Compromise, yes, but not a compromise which demands increasing environmental goals from the developing countries without offering them trade and economic gains at the same time.
Sustainable development includes development and where is the commitment to that in the EU's position?
I welcome the limited promises made by the Commissioner this afternoon as regards seeking the extension of the "Everything but Arms" initiative worldwide, and also by the Spanish Presidency on the Tobin tax and other potential new sources of public finance for development.
But I share colleagues' view that there is no point in agreeing a commitment to eliminate child labour and then relying on exclusively voluntary agreements with business to achieve this and other legitimate development goals.
I remind the Council and Commission that two weeks ago this Parliament voted for mandatory social and environmental reporting by European enterprises on their global supply chain, as a first step towards establishing a binding framework for corporate accountability.
I ask you to lead that argument in Johannesburg too.
Finally, compromise with the US is one thing.
Allowing the US to exercise a veto on agreement is another.
Today we are left with an implementation plan with no less than 200 sets of brackets representing unresolved issues.
Without stronger leadership from the EU, there can and will be no final agreement.
Mr President, the EU has good reason to be satisfied with progress on sustainable development.
However, resistance to it is now becoming a reality and national and commercial interests are clearly coming into view.
It is more important than ever for the EU to be able to strengthen its partnerships with third countries and other blocs.
To its credit, the Union has especially dedicated itself to slowing down and preventing climate change.
The information necessary for this is still limited, though sufficient to state that there no longer exists any scientific uncertainty that human beings are causing the earth's climate to become warmer.
Our prominent role, however, means the data we have needs to be coordinated and explored more fully.
For that reason I want, prior to the meeting at Johannesburg, to propose that the EU should establish a special European Climate Change Agency, whose job it would be to support the Community in policy concerning climatic change.
Right now this would be an important signal politically.
The EU must acquire firm scientific support for its work, for example, in matters to do with trade, as our major competitor, the United States of America, is not intending to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
It would be the task of the European Climate Change Agency to compile data on climatic change and its impact on the environment, the economy and society.
The Agency would have to produce and commission studies and evaluate existing data, and thus act as the much-needed link between scientific research and the political decision-makers. All this is necessary for the EU's policy of sustainable development to gain strength and for the EU to hone its role as international leader.
By acting on the best available information the EU can build international partnerships in which selfish national and financial ambitions can be constructively thwarted.
Climatic change is the most serious problem in our history and its most serious threat.
It would be only reasonable to see it also taken seriously in connection with the use of EU resources.
Council. (ES) Mr President, I think that this debate has been extraordinarily informative because many things have been said, but they are all things that both the Council and the Commission have fully accepted, because we totally share the widespread disappointment felt by everyone at the outcome of the Bali conference and the concern at the almost insurmountable difficulties facing preparations for the Johannesburg conference.
Nevertheless, I should not like to end this debate on a negative note, having mentioned all the injustices inherent in the distribution of poverty in the world and the enormous problems of world trade and environmental problems and not state that Europe has the capacity for leadership.
I believe the fact that the European Parliament shares this concern inspires the Commission and the Council, who are responsible for representing the position of Europe and its leadership in all these issues that are so close to us and, naturally, so close to our hearts, because they have a major impact on the conscience of European public opinion.
I should like to say that, despite the fact that the outcome of the Bali conference was not very positive, some very important goals and agreements have been achieved during these months of the Spanish Presidency, which have confirmed that the European Union is moving in the right direction.
Let us remember that the European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol at the beginning of March. Let us also remember that we achieved a compromise in Monterrey, against all predictions, committing ourselves to providing development aid; let us also remember that the European Union has, throughout recent years, maintained its leadership in development aid and in defending courageous policies on trade with developing countries such as the 'Everything but arms' directive.
We do, therefore, have experience and we are fighting for the right idea which, of course, I believe we all share - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - and which is that we have to make an effort to make the world in which we live a better place. This is a very complex world, however, in which, as all honourable Members who have spoken know because you have, of course, considerable knowledge of the dialectic at stake at the moment with regard to Johannesburg, there are great interests and enormous amounts of national self-interest, not only in the developed world, but also in other blocs of countries that have adopted radical positions and which often prevent consensus being reached.
Our thesis has to date consisted of considering that it is better to have a global agreement, even if it is relatively ambitious, than to have no agreement at all.
This is the very reason we were not able to achieve anything positive in Bali but, nevertheless, our desire to conclude an agreement remains intact.
This week the Committee of Permanent Representatives is debating a set of initiatives that the General Affairs Council will consider on Monday 17 June, and which will become guidelines with which the Seville European Council will continue negotiations.
Furthermore, for his part, the President of the Council intends to take this issue to the highest level at the G8 Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, which will take place at the end of June.
The Spanish Presidency will keep up the pressure to the end and the Danish Presidency is also already prepared to take over on 1 July.
Frankly, I believe that we should not be discouraged by the fact that Bali has been a disappointment for us all; all is not lost and much can still be achieved.
I also genuinely believe that the Council, together with the Commission, is capable of maintaining its position of leadership; that the Seville European Council will send a clear message to the world about our position and our commitment to the Johannesburg objectives. Similarly, we will also be working with our partners, particularly within the G8; we still have almost three months before Johannesburg opens and we hope we have sufficient experience to be able to impose, with our strength and our leadership, a solution that is acceptable to everyone in that South African city at the beginning of September.
We do not want Johannesburg, as I have said, to be a further disappointment of the type we saw in Durban and we are, therefore, willing to work on this and are doing so with the satisfaction and the relief that we enjoy the political support of this Parliament that has been expressed so forcefully in today's sitting.
Mr President, honourable Members, I wish first of all to express my thanks for an important debate and for constructive contributions which we shall of course bear in mind in our assessment of Bali and in our preparations for Johannesburg.
Let us remind ourselves of the difficult position from which we are in actual fact starting, with, first of all, a quite different political climate than that which prevailed when the Rio Summit took place.
Now, we are living in a much more polarised world.
The fight against terrorism and the Axis of Evil has meant that the mood in the G77 Group naturally feels completely different.
Expectations of the Bali Summit were incredibly high.
There was a very long wish-list covering every political area imaginable, and a poorly focused political agenda.
Against that background, it is important not to ignore what has been achieved.
We had a whole range of colleagues working very hard to ensure, in fact, that we could 'clear the decks' and agree on as much as possible in the action plan.
There is also a great deal which has been achieved and on which we have reached decisions.
Nor must we forget the negotiations on climate change, which also collapsed at a certain phase but which could be resumed and made to yield a satisfactory result.
It is hardly surprising that the poor countries are complaining and demanding more of us now, for the experiences in Rio were alarming.
The money needed to pay for the thousands of recommendations decided upon in Rio was never forthcoming.
That is why there has been such poor implementation of all these recommendations.
It is therefore very important that we now prepare ourselves for our role as bridge builders.
I can imagine our having to play that role very actively in Johannesburg.
We need to take more practical measures in precisely those areas mentioned here in the debate.
In spite of everything, none of this is news to the Commission or the Council.
These are areas which we have already discussed and in which we have already done some preparation, but we need to see what progress we can make when it comes to grants, trade, access to our markets and development aid.
We need to describe still more clearly the practical objectives we have put forward with regard, for example, to water and energy issues.
Perhaps we need to supplement our descriptions with calculations of costs and to demonstrate how we are to achieve our objectives successfully.
There is naturally opposition from those who do not wish to go beyond the objectives of the millennium declaration and who do not want to draw up practical timetables, deadlines and practical objectives expressed, for example, in terms of years.
We need to ensure that we can preserve the status of environmental issues in the debate.
We need to rescue the whole concept of 'sustainable development'.
I naturally appreciate how important it is to link it to trade and development issues and issues of funding, but it is also important to safeguard the whole idea of our being concerned here with a single whole.
It is a question of seeing the whole picture, in which environmental, as well as economic and social, issues have their place.
What, finally, will happen if Johannesburg fails?
These are not, of course, issues under which it will be possible to draw a line in Johannesburg.
The objectives we draw up for the European Union are ones which, after Johannesburg too, we shall of course have to comply with and continue to work on.
Possible failure there should not prevent us from finalising and implementing the plans we have jointly decided on.
I want to thank you again for this important debate.
In our preparations, we shall bear in mind everything that was said.
I hope that we can count on the support of the European Parliament and that we shall also, hopefully, be able in as active a way as possible to employ the European Parliament's delegation in the preparations.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the report (A5-0207/2002) by Heidi Anneli Hautala, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (PE-CONS 3624/2002 - C5-0185/2002 - 2000/0142(COD))
Mr President, for the first time now, the European Parliament has participated in reforming Community legislation on equality by virtue of the codecision procedure.
I am pleased to inform you all that the European Parliament has genuinely left its mark on this directive, whose purpose it is to prevent any kind of discrimination at work on grounds of sex.
I believe that many will have noticed that it is the European Parliament that has made the most innovative proposals of all, which are now incorporated in this key directive on equality at work.
In response to our demands, employers in the European Union will for the first time now be obliged to take committed action to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.
The very fact that employers will be obliged to take action is very important as the problem has to be addressed through action and not just by issuing various declarations.
This means that employers that fail in their obligation to create working conditions that pre-empt sexual harassment may also become liable for prosecution by the courts as a result.
In practice this means that structures must be created at the workplace where an employee is guaranteed to receive help when harassment has occurred, and where any such action also has a preventative effect.
