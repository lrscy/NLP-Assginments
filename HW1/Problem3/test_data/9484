I take up the Council's suggestion.
We shall try to take a delegation to Skopje before the summer.
Mr President, as the President-in-Office and the Commissioner said, we are still in a very difficult, delicate situation when it comes to Macedonia/FYROM.
I still cannot see that there is the will to find a compromise and for understanding on both sides.
But we must be clear on one thing: the KLA should not dictate events, developments and the pace of solutions in Macedonia.
Nothing would please the KLA more than to parade the Albanian parties and dictate their demands and nothing would please the KLA more than overreaction on the part of the Slav-Macedonian parties.
With all due respect for what Mrs Pack said - and I nearly always agree with her - I do not see the connection with Kosovo in the same light.
Because the badly needed elections in Kosovo are elections for democracy, not for terrorist organisations like the KLA.
So what is to be done?
First there are thoughts of changing the constitution and there is much to be said in favour of that.
It is just that I think it should be determined with as few ethnic considerations as possible and geared to the rights of each and everyone under the rule of law.
Secondly, the Albanian minority definitely needs more judges, more policemen and more officials in the administration.
Here again the primary concern must be qualification, with the ethnic principle coming second.
Thirdly, more certainly needs to be done in the area of education and training.
In the medium to long term, we must assume that Tetovo University which, most importantly, has been substantially funded by the international community - with almost nothing from the Albanian diaspora, it must be said - will, at long last, become a public university.
I think this is the right step to take.
I should like to address one more fundamental point: both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner mentioned the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
In fact, just such an agreement has also been initialled with Croatia.
However, we must think one step ahead.
I think that the region as a whole needs to be able to feel at home in Europe.
Perhaps we should consider whether, as a matter of principle, we could check every two years after a Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed, if the country is willing and able to acquire candidate status for the European Union.
Because when I look at Bulgaria and Romania on the one side and at Turkey on the other, there is a certain restrained - one might almost say unfair treatment of the Balkans.
What was done in Zagreb was a good thing.
But I think we should go one stage further and say to the region loud and clear: if you are willing to resolve all your economic, social and political problems, then you have a real chance of obtaining candidate status for the European Union.
We in the European Union are prepared to check this with the countries with which we have already concluded agreements at regular intervals.
Only the road to Europe, the vision, the realistic vision of belonging to Europe can bring about stability in this region.
Not in the short term, but in the medium and long term. And this vision, this Utopia must be very a specific vision.
Mr President, I support what Mr Swoboda said about Macedonia and at the same time, wish to contradict him slightly.
I think that we must definitely view Macedonia as a potential member of the European Union.
But we cannot of course say that it is in fact already a candidate, for the simple reason that the Copenhagen criteria are just not being met in Macedonia.
Therefore those political criteria must be fulfilled.
For that reason, I think - and I should like to make a minor correction to what Mr Swoboda says - we should offer the prospect of possible membership, but only if, for example, that dreadful concept of a state-constituting nation disappears from the constitution and statutes of Macedonia.
It is a huge obstacle, often in other countries too, to reaching a reasonable ethnic understanding between citizens.
Surely we must be able to make Macedonia into an ordinary secular state and there are enough indications that the president of the country with his American experience understands that.
Secondly, we as the European Union can do something ourselves.
I remember very well from a previous period that a departing Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Elleman-Jensen, surprised the House by exclaiming that the whole Council was sick of Greece' s behaviour towards Macedonia.
That caused a row.
But I believe it was an extremely salutary expression of feeling, particularly since the Council could after all exert some pressure on Greece as a fellow-member and say : conclude those negotiations, ensure that there is a reasonable solution, do not persist with measures that are in fact humiliating for Macedonia.
We can also ensure from outside that destabilising effects which were in fact at issue in those negotiations, are removed.
Mr President, I would urge the Council to look into its own heart and say to its own members: friends, what can we do?
Stop going on endlessly about that name, that flag, etc. We can also ask the Macedonians to achieve a European approach to their own constitutional structure.
Otherwise it will be impossible for them to become normal members of the European Union in the future.
Mr President, I do not wish to hold up the debate, but Mr Oostlander must have misunderstood me.
I do not assume that Macedonia can now be seen as a candidate.
It should merely be given a chance to attain this status through regular monitoring.
The Representative of the Council is quite right to say that we may well face a civil war or perhaps a more widespread Balkan war unless developments are contained.
As regards the name and Greece's responsibility, which Mr Oostlander touched on, the only thing I have to say, yet again, is that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia only exists thanks to continuous material and moral support from Greece.
Leaving aside the name, without this support, you can be sure that Milosevic's Yugoslavia would have broken it up long ago.
As far as the present situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, we have a clash of two political philosophies: the political philosophy expounded by the Representative of the Council, whereby two different nations live within the same borders, cooperate and live in friendship, and the philosophy which says that the rights of the Albanian nation can only be secured by armed struggle and bloodshed.
May I say to the Council representative that this is a philosophy - and I know because I come from these parts and I have lived through a civil war - which is deep rooted in the psyche of a nation which still has various atavistic responses.
If we want to avoid civil war, someone has to gainsay this philosophy of armed struggle, but not, of course, the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, because if it undertakes to disarm the KLA, there will definitely be civil war.
It is our duty to disarm the KLA, it is our duty to prohibit the KLA from using the security zone, it is our duty to tell the leadership in Kosovo not to incite the KLA to do these things, especially as we hold their purse strings - by the way, you could say the same to Turkey, that we shall stop all payments until they do something about the disgraceful state of their prisons - and, finally, we must use policing measures to prevent money from being collected in western Europe and sent to the KLA.
Unless we do these things, the whole civilised approach argued by the Council representative - which of course we want - will be a waste of time.
It is not just the responsibility of the Macedonians.
Unless we do these things, we too shall be responsible for what happens.
Thank you very much, Mr Katiforis.
The debate is closed.
Statute and financing of European political parties
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0167/2001) by Mrs Schleicher, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties [COM(2000) 898 - C5-0081/2001 - 2001/0011(CNS)].
We will adjourn the sitting for five minutes as neither the rapporteur nor the speakers who need to take the floor on this item are present.
(The sitting was adjourned for five minutes)
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
Pursuant to Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure, one speaker may speak for Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion and one against. The rapporteur may have the floor too.
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion?
Mr Dupuis has the floor.
Mr President, I fully agree with the motion tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
I think that Parliament has already, on several occasions, put itself in difficult and ridiculous situations in terms of respect for the law.
I think that this motion is extremely timely and I ask all Members to allow Parliament to take another look at this matter, to go into it in greater depth and, therefore, to vote in favour of this motion.
Mr President, the motion before us will sink our work without trace.
Thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Schleicher, we had a full debate in committee and now we want to report on it to the European Parliament.
My group is holding a special meeting right now but I feel this debate is so important that I wished to attend in person.
We need this debate now so that the Swedish Presidency can bring this matter to a close.
Because if we do not debate it now, this party statute, this regulation will not come to fruition under the Swedish Presidency.
That is why I ask all the honourable Members to show willing and debate this today so that we can vote on it accordingly tomorrow, when the time comes.
So I am most decidedly against this motion.
I am also sorry to have to say as much to my friend and colleague Mr Dupuis.
May I ask you in a spirit of friendship, Mr Dupuis, perhaps to reconsider.
Mr President, we debated this matter in committee.
It has been discussed.
The legal basis is such that we can take the article which the Commission used as a basis.
Whether we want to or not is a political decision.
The committee decided by a large majority that it would take this article as a basis.
Mr President, I would like to request that we check we have a quorum before proceeding to the vote.
We have been asked to check that we have a quorum.
This request by Mr BarÃ³n requires the support of thirty-two Members.
Ladies and gentlemen, as the request does not have sufficient support, we cannot verify a quorum.
We must therefore proceed to the vote on Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion.
Mr Poettering has the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would imagine that certain honourable members are delighted.
It is a most interesting coalition which we have here.
I hope that you will always feel at home in this alliance.
But I must say on behalf of the large majority of my group that we shall not allow ourselves to be discouraged by the result of this vote, which is of course in keeping with the Rules of Procedure.
I shall apply on behalf of my group to the President - and I say this here openly - for this matter to be discussed at the next mini session in Brussels, in the hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the Swedish Presidency.
For the rest, I would point out that we were notified internally earlier that the debate on this subject would not start until 4.45, which is why we were surprised that things got off to such a fast start.
As a good democrat, I do of course respect this result and I trust that those who snatched such a chance victory will be equally good democrats in the future.
I should like to make perfectly clear on behalf of my group that we shall do everything we can to obtain a party statute because it is both good and necessary to the unification of and democracy in Europe.
I merely think that there is another interesting coalition to which attention must be called, namely the coalition between the European parties which, over the heads of the people of Europe, are deciding to enrich themselves through this project.
Mr President, the Commission and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs considered the question of the legal basis extremely carefully.
This regulation is drafted as a temporary measure before the Treaty of Nice comes into force and I find it absolutely shameful that the nationalists in this Parliament are seeking to suppress the growth of proper, credible and legitimate transnational political parties.
Mr President, as group coordinator in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I just wanted to point out that there are differing views on this subject in our group, something which I intended to point out in my speech today.
I personally take the view that, given the criticism of the Court of Auditors, it is in fact fitting that we find a solution to the problem before us and this matter should also have been dealt with politically on this basis today.
Mr President, I simply wish to make a point of order.
I do not wish to comment on the matter in detail, or on the nonsense I have been subjected to today.
I call on you, as President and pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure, to put a proposal to the House, namely that the agenda be amended to allow this item to be reintroduced. If it is not possible to do so today, then it should be done tomorrow.
Mr BarÃ³n, as you are aware, this cannot be done at present. However, we have taken note of your suggestion.
Mr Dupuis has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, perhaps it should be pointed out to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that he often confuses his visions with reality.
I would, however, like to warn Mr Duff about the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
As all honourable Members know, this committee has, on various occasions, produced in-depth studies on the legal basis of our reports, which have not been considered to be such by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
I think and fear that this is the case with the study we are looking at today.
Mr President, I regret the fact that some groups in this Parliament obviously prefer that party financing should remain in the twilight zone where it is at present.
My view is that we should remove party financing as soon as possible from that twilight zone.
That is also in the interest of European citizens.
I consequently hope that the time remaining will be used to approve this proposal with as large as possible a majority and to see what amendments might contribute to its further improvement.
Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to deny most vehemently what Mr Poettering has just said, announcing quite prematurely that this report could appear on the agenda of the forthcoming Brussels mini-session.
I should like to remind my fellow Members that we have just voted to refer the report back to committee.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will, therefore, have to meet and discuss the matter again.
Mr President, we can only accept what has happened here, albeit through sleight of hand.
That too is a democratic right enjoyed by parliamentarians here.
At the same time I should like to support emphatically what Mr Poettering and Mrs Maes have just said.
We cannot continue making ourselves ridiculous as a Parliament by spending funds in a way that is patently not above board.
We do not wish to do this.
We cannot collaborate in this.
This item must be put on the agenda as soon as possible and as spokesman of the liberal group I should also like to warmly support what Mr Poettering has said.
We must discuss this matter again as soon as possible and then adopt a motion.
Mr President, I would like to inform you that a very detailed debate took place on Mr Schleicher's report in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Mr Dupuis is, of course, free to think that the matter was not analysed sufficiently: that is his personal opinion and the opinion of other colleagues who represent a minority of the committee.
When Mr Dupuis requested that the vote be referred to committee because the translations of the amendments were not available in all the languages, we granted his request.
We have therefore acted totally conscientiously.
If Mr Dupuis wishes to consider himself to be the self-appointed representative of the Court of Auditors to our committee, with a strange mixture of institutional responsibilities, then that is up to him.
In any case, in view of the vote, which was obtained by majority despite the presence of only a small minority of the Members of this House, I will convene an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs without delay, so that a well-researched, clear decision can then be taken in plenary.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall limit myself to making a point of order.
I believe that any decision taken by a parliament can be interpreted according to the motives that have been expressed.
Some of you may not believe this, but I only discovered the motion tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro as I was coming into the Chamber.
Our fellow Member has, to be precise, tabled a motion of inadmissibility based on the absence of a legal basis, pending the ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
It therefore seems quite clear to me that Parliament, through its vote, has decided to postpone the discussion until the Treaty of Nice has indeed been ratified.
That is my first point.
My second and final point, which I shall discuss much more briefly, is that this is a question of democracy. I must say that democracy does not consist of those parties that have a majority gaining material advantages over the opposition and, furthermore, of assuming the right to deny the opposition these advantages for ideological reasons of their own.
Mr President, it is unacceptable to give the impression that minority parliamentary groups and the smallest groups in this Parliament, which have taken the initiative of proposing that we reject this report, have done so in order to conceal the funding of European political parties, or those that claim to be such.
This is simply an attempt, by the large groups in this Parliament, to cover up a decision by the European Court of Justice, which enabled them to benefit from funds to finance 'European political parties' , which are not 'parties' since they do not use universal suffrage, which are 'political' in name only, since they are only concerned about financing the activities of parliamentary groups, and finally, which are only 'European' because they are not African or Asian.
We would be creating a monster.
Until my view can be disproved, the funding of European political parties can only be justified, even after the Treaty of Nice, once it accepts the practice of universal suffrage, which is the only acceptable definition of a political party.
Mr President, I make no judgment either of the procedure for or the outcome of this decision.
However, I protest because, when the vote was taken, we and numerous other members were meeting in the Committee on Budgets.
I just happened to hear the bell and I came unprepared and, to be honest, I did not know what was going on.
How can you hold this sort of vote while committees are in session and hence, ipse facto, those present, i.e. those who are able to vote, are unable to determine the final outcome?
It is in this sense that I protest because my democratic rights have been undermined.
Mr President, I think that we have to make the best of a bad job, because we are fortunate enough to have quite a full House, which is quite rare for a Wednesday afternoon.
We can see that the trick worked and that it is perhaps for the best.
In fact, my group was intending to vote for the Schleicher report, as long as some slight improvements were made to the rehash produced by the committee, which, it must be said, was not particularly impressive.
We are now being asked to allow a short delay, in order to improve it further.
There is certainly room for improvement and I think that some good can come out of this.
My only regret is that Mr Pasqua did not come in person to tell us how he intends to proceed in the future to ensure that the funding of political parties is carried out with the utmost transparency.
Thank you, Mr President, for not having overlooked me this time.
I am very grateful for that, since this is the eighth time I have asked to take the floor.
I should like to say three things.
First of all, our fellow MEP, Mr Duff, pointed out a moment ago that the committee and committees had given thorough consideration to the issue of the legal basis.
It is interesting to note that not a single instance can be found of consideration being given to the fundamental issue, namely that of whether Article 308 can be used to implement a real change in the Treaty.
It is, of course, only with the Treaty of Nice which, it will be recalled, has not yet come into force, that a legal basis has been furnished.
That is what the issue is about and, when Mr Napolitano now tells us that he is immediately to call an extraordinary meeting of the committee, he might perhaps be requested to see to it that this fundamental issue of legality and the legal basis is examined, at least in such a way that some indications of the legal issue emerge.
I can refer to a long list of pronouncements by the EC Court of Justice, clearly showing that we really are concerned with a Treaty change here.
Finally, I just want to add my congratulations to that majority which, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, prevented the matter from coming up for debate. Moreover, I would take the liberty of drawing the President' s attention to Article 143, Paragraph 2 which states that, once such a proposal has been adopted, Parliament should immediately - I repeat the word 'immediately' - move on to the next item on the agenda.
Mr President, in this debate on a point of order the term 'nationalists' has been used, which does no justice to the arguments of the aggrieved parties.
My impression is that a number of other matters are involved, the question whether it is legitimate to distribute taxpayers' money to parties and through government impose rules on parties that strengthen the distrust of citizens of what they see as a political elite.
That is a problem.
Parties should be bottom-up and not top-down organisations.
Real parties do not emerge because the structures of a state require the organisation of a competitive struggle at election time but because there are people with common ideas, interests and activities.
That is why it is rather artificial, at a moment when there is no European public opinion, to create parties from above in a forced way.
I therefore ask for understanding of the objections which are something other than nationalism and I think that it mainly revolves around the question whether the European Union has the power to do such a thing, or whether it does not have the power, which is why Mr Krarup has already indicated that in that respect we are now on thin ice.
I think that if such a measure were ever to be passed, we should all have to be certain that it does not conflict with previously agreed European rules.
Mr President, I should like to support the motion by committee chairman Mr Napolitano and therefore request that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs be convened immediately as a matter of urgency.
Combating social exclusion
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for a second reading (A5-0155/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion. [13740/1/2000 - C5-0046/2001 - 2000/0157(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Figueiredo)
Ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the European Union continues to be of grave concern, with new groups, such as immigrants, falling into this category and new threats of exclusion, amongst which I would highlight 'info-exclusion' resulting from ongoing inequalities in access to the new technologies. This affects tens of millions of people, particularly women, children and the elderly, but also, increasingly, workers in precarious or atypical employment or workers with low salaries.
Against this background, it is particularly important to place definition of a global strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion on the agenda, on the basis of Article 137 of the EU Treaty.
Although all specific measures, both local and national, are important, it is crucial that we put in place a European Union strategy designed to coordinate policies and concentrate on the fight, which must be a priority, against this genuine scandal of living at a time when wealth is being created and increasing and yet, even today, more than 50 million EU citizens do not have access to fundamental rights enshrined in the Social Charters and the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself, recently proclaimed by the Community institutions.
Nevertheless, as we all know, at the Nice Council, common objectives were adopted for combating poverty and social exclusion, which must be set out in a coordinated and integrated way, in a multidimensional approach, in the national action plans that the Member States have undertaken to draw up by 1 June.
As we all know, the common objectives that must be set out in the national action plans are:
to facilitate participation in employment and access to all resources, rights and services;
to prevent risks of exclusion;
to work on behalf of the most vulnerable members of society;
to rally all the parties involved.
Furthermore, at the European Council of December this year, at the end of the Belgian Presidency, we are to adopt common indicators for poverty and social exclusion in order to be able to compare the results expected by the Member States from implementing national action plans on social inclusion.
Given this context, it is particularly important that we adopt and implement the Community action programme as urgently as possible to encourage cooperation between Member States in the fight against exclusion.
Until this programme comes into force, we will not have the necessary mechanisms for Community-level coordination and monitoring of the actions that are undertaken. These are fundamental aspects of the global strategy which the Council undertook to adopt.
It is, therefore, hard to understand the Council' s refusal to accept proposals made by the European Parliament, particularly those which the Commission has already accepted.
We can see that the Council common position of 12 February 2001 fully or partially incorporates 25 of the 47 amendments adopted by Parliament on 16 November last year, whereas the Commission had accepted 31. In the proposals that are now being put forward again at second reading, which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted unanimously on 25 April, the positions which the Commission accepted but which the Council, regrettably, rejected are being adopted once again.
Amongst these are the establishment of comparable parameters for national action plans and the 90% funding of activities undertaken by the main European networks participating in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. This percentage of funding has already been accepted, in the programme for combating discrimination, for example, and has been rejected here for goodness knows what reason.
Furthermore, we are reconsidering the key issue of allocating the programme EUR 100 million of funding, rather than EUR 70 Million, as the Council and the Commission are insisting, although it is true that the Council has already accepted proposals that will require increased expenditure such as the networking of national monitoring centres and similar organisations for combating poverty. Spending will also be increased for exchanges of experience, preparatory meetings for the Annual EU Round Table Conference on social exclusion, with the participation of all speakers, and field visits to ensure that the excluded can participate.
There are also issues of commitology, specifically concerning the Committee, including the Commission' s initial proposal, an assessment of the potential effects of macro-economic policies on poverty and social exclusion and the funding of innovative projects.
I must also make a reference to some small technical amendments that were introduced, after the services of the President of the sitting pointed out the need for them, to improve the legal quality and the visibility of the text adopted by the Committee on Employment and, at the same time, to enable us to bring our text into line with other texts adopted by Parliament, such as the minor technical amendments to Amendments Nos 10 and 2, and the new Amendment No 18.
I do not feel that Amendment No 3, tabled by our Committee, is necessary, bearing in mind the technical amendments I have just mentioned, but I shall, of course, leave the matter up to the House.
With regard to the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party, I feel that these are merely procedural issues and that adopting them would make adopting the programme more difficult.
Lastly, Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have contributed to producing this report and to express my hope that the programme will be adopted as soon as possible.
Mr President, the programme to combat social exclusion is extremely important if we are to achieve the objectives set in Lisbon.
It is even more important if we consider that there are Member States with no history of combating social exclusion using global policies based on scientific studies and reliable statistics and which do not understand the important of combating social exclusion, not on moral grounds, but for reasons of social cohesion and economic progress.
I refer here in particular to my own country, Greece.
That is why we are calling on the European Commission to make a fundamental assessment of the national action plans which it receives, using the agreed quantitative and qualitative indicators, and not to make do with lists of political measures which are neither complementary nor global in nature and which do not get to the root of the problem.
We are also calling for help for the agencies involved in combating this phenomenon, not just in the form of coordination from Brussels, but at national level, close to the root of the problem, which is why we, as a political group, enthusiastically support any new innovative plans with European added value to combat social exclusion. In order to facilitate this, we support funding to the tune of 90%.
We also call for the European Parliament, the social partners and other agencies in the civil society to be given an opportunity to help prepare the annual conference on social exclusion.
My political group maintains that the European Commission should not take recourse to extraordinary technical assistance or make use of external experts and, similarly, that the proposals financed should be selected on the basis of invitations for expressions of interest.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo most warmly on her good work in preparing this report.
I am also very glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has put forward these amendments.
What the Commission has tried to do in bridging the opposition between ourselves as Parliament and the Council is also gratifying.
But I really must say that the Council has taken precious little notice of us.
Only a few formal matters have been adopted.
The Social Council and the Swedish Presidency, the Swedish socialist presidency I would almost say, are not aware that there is also such a thing as codecision, they what to keep control of everything themselves.
They think: there is open coordination and you as a Parliament must simply pay for our stunts from the Community budget.
That is, I believe, unacceptable.
That will undoubtedly lead, Madam Commissioner, not only in this case, but also in a number of others to great problems with the Council if the Council does not manage to clarify its position somewhat.
We have had one discussion with the Council in which obviously the way was pointed to compromises between this Parliament and the Council, Mrs Figueiredo did that splendidly, but the Council did not listen at all and simply made a kind of blueprint, a kind of stamp of what it previously intended and that is a kind of circuit for civil servants, by civil servants and for civil servants, so to speak.
Our amendments are an attempt to change that just a little.
I believe that we must adhere to them, since only then can the fight against poverty and the combating of social exclusion be tackled in a truly European way, namely if everyone has a hand in it, and not just a bunch of highly-paid civil servants gathering cosily together in Brussels.
Mr President, first I would like to assure Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou that all the national action plans on exclusion and poverty submitted to the Commission will be examined in the framework of the indicators and concrete goals agreed in the Stockholm Council.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on the excellent work she has done, which is both helpful and useful.
I believe that since we all agree how important this programme is, we can agree as soon as possible to start implementing it.
As you will recall, in its amended proposal the Commission accepted in full or in part 31 of the 47 amendments that were tabled by the European Parliament.
The common position that we have been examining incorporates 25 of these amendments.
With regard to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept six of them in full or in part.
I refer to Amendments Nos 2, reference to the Social Charter; 4, reference to the compatibility of the proposed budget with the current financial framework; 6, strengthening the comparability of indicators; 7, as it refers to the involvement of the local and regional level, 11, reinforcing the monitoring of coherence between this programme and other policies; and, most importantly, Amendment No 14, referring to raising funding to NGOs under exceptional circumstances to 90%.
The following amendments cannot be accepted.
Amendment No 1 proposes adding solidarity among Member States to the list of relevant Community tasks.
The fight against poverty and social exclusion in each Member State is a national effort and should be placed in the context of promoting national action plans underpinned by Community-level objectives and policy-oriented cooperation.
So it is obvious that these are national efforts and national targets.
Amendment No 5, in which the European Parliament is proposing to be involved in the agreement of targets, is not in line with the decisions of the European Councils of Lisbon and Nice.
As regards commitology, referred to in Amendments Nos 3 and 10, despite the fact that our proposal referred to the creation of an advisory committee, I believe that the mixed committee is a fair solution.
This is the option that is applied in two other programmes: the equal opportunities and the anti-discrimination programmes.
The Commission is assisted by a management committee for horizontal issues concerning implementation, and by an advisory committee when dealing with individual funding decisions.
Amendments Nos 8 and 12 refer to the role of the European Parliament in the open method of coordination in the social exclusion field.
I am ready to explore with you all the appropriate means of making sure that the European Parliament can play its full role within this framework in this context.
For example, I have already accepted the setting up of a round table, which will bring together the relevant actors.
Amendments Nos 7 and 13 propose to open funding under the programme to innovative projects with a European added value in combating social exclusion.
As I have already stressed, the aim of the programme is to encourage close national policy cooperation and mutual learning, and not to fund actions on the ground.
Moreover, innovative projects on the ground can be funded by the European Social Fund and by the new EQUAL initiative.
My next comment relates to your proposal in Amendment No 14 to name the actors to be consulted in the preparation of the annual Round Table Conference.
I feel that such a list risks being more restrictive, incomplete and less flexible than the admittedly more general term "all the actors concerned".
As regards Amendment No 9, as I said at first reading, the Commission has carefully examined all the questions concerning the budget and is of the opinion that the original proposal for EUR 70 million is an appropriate one.
I cannot accept at this stage an increase in the budget.
Amendment No 18 seeking to delete Article 7 is not acceptable to the Commission because it will make the execution of the programme very difficult.
Amendment No 15 attempts to restrict the implementation of measures, under Strand 1 of the programme, to tenders only, in fact excluding the possibility of promoters of the innovative projects participating in the call for proposals.
Amendments Nos 16 and 17 seek to curb the role of the Commission by preventing it from using external expertise as well as technical and administrative assistance.
To summarise, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6 and 11.
It can accept parts of Amendments Nos 7 and 14. It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18.
I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner.
If I have understood correctly, she rejects any mention of the European Parliament in the programme.
Is that correct?
Secondly, she also rejects increasing the programme, even though the Commission proposes to diminish the amount for other social actions in the next year by 17.5%.
Is that also correct?
The role of the European Parliament is a very important one but, of course, this role is defined by the decisions of the Council.
According to the Lisbon and Nice Councils, there is a role for Parliament and cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, but nothing more than that - if you mean the commitology issue.
Of course, we can find other ways of cooperation.
I have already said that we can organise a round table.
There can be cooperation between the Commissioners and the high-level Social Protection Committee, which deals with exclusion issues.
Of course, the European Parliament has a very important role to play in the joint employment report, which will evaluate all the programmes.
As far as the budget is concerned, I insist on the original proposal of EUR 70m.
It is very difficult to change it.
We have to be realistic about what the Council will accept and how this programme can be implemented with the human resources at our disposal.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon.
Safe and sustainable pensions
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0147/2001) by Mr Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on The Future Evolution of Social Protection from a Long-Term Point of View: Safe and Sustainable Pensions [COM(2000) 622 - C5-0011/2001 - 2001/2003(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, this House will tomorrow put forward its position, ideas, hopes and also its concerns regarding the future evolution of pensions from a long-term point of view on our continent.
The Commission communication on the future development of social protection, pursuant to the mandate granted by the Lisbon European Council, has provided us with the opportunity of doing so.
I should therefore like to begin by welcoming that communication. It has brought the problem out into the open, provided Parliament with an opportunity to discuss it and presented a broadly-based study of the phenomenon of ageing in Europe.
The debate has been taken beyond mere financial considerations.
It is only right to congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou on having involved Members of the European Parliament as representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a debate of this nature, crucial to the future of the Union. I would like to take this opportunity to do so.
At the outset, I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
This is not just a form of words, I am genuinely grateful to them. Not only have they been kind enough to adopt this report by an overwhelming majority, but they have also many useful contributions in the course of discussions.
In addition, they tabled a broad range of amendments.
For the most part, I was able to incorporate these into my report, because they embodied useful approaches.
I have no wish to appear boastful but it does seem to me that in the Committee on Employment we have revived a broad consensus across all groups in this House.
Clearly, this has proved possible because instead of each group seeking to impose every last detail of its own plan on this issue, we have sought consensus on its most important aspects. We are all aware that the ultimate responsibility rests with our States.
Nonetheless we realise that in the Europe we hope to build, there is scope for establishing criteria, objectives, values and principles which will be common to all Europeans. We are also conscious that it is our right and our duty not to remain silent in the face of this major problem.
I should also like to state, in this initial overview, that I am firmly convinced this is a problem which demands a broad debate and social and political consensus.
When it was created, the European social model was founded on broad social and political consensus. It will not be possible to reform this European social model under the auspices of new forms of enlightened despotism as advocated by those who believe that select groups of experts, high-ranking bureaucrats or certain Finance Ministers should rule the world.
The social and political consequences of modernising the European social model are such that the matter cannot be entrusted to those who only appreciate the financial perspective and neglect the social dimension of the problem.
It would be irresponsible of us to ignore the data on economic requirements.
However, we would be making an even greater mistake if we focused entirely on the economic consequences, and failed to take the impact on human beings into account.
Europe is ageing.
Unless there is a dramatic upswing in the birth rate, this will have serious repercussions. It will impact on the financial capacity of the system, on the balancing of public accounts and also on individuals.
If we fail to resolve the problem or do so in an unsympathetic manner, we run the risk of unleashing a wave of poverty and social fragmentation across our continent.
Consequently, the first message I should like to send out, or rather that I feel Parliament should send out, as our committee has already done, is that all the challenges posed by ageing must be taken into account in a balanced way. I could mention in particular the challenge to public finances and also the challenge to the methods adopted by previous generations for the building Europe.
In our committee we noted that the demographic dependence ratio is a very important factor, but not the only one involved.
There is another even more significant factor, namely the economic dependence ratio. This means that our main problem will not be the number of pensioners we are confronted with, but the rate of employment.
The crux of the issue is that if Europe grows, it will create employment, it will create firms capable of ensuring that that rate of economic dependence does not deteriorate. Europe has a long way to go, because our rates of employment are inadequate.
They could become adequate however, if we achieved economic growth and if that growth were directed at creating the jobs needed on our continent. The figures are far below those of our main competitors, the United States and Japan.
In fact, if we attained the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit, the objective could be perceived as far less daunting that the data available indicates.
Furthermore, this data, although certainly significant, amounts to long-term predictions and is therefore subject to revision.
No Biblical curse is about to befall us.
We could yet find a way out of our predicament because there is still time to deal with a number of factors currently causing concern.
Constant monitoring of that data will be called for, and increasingly rigorous criteria must be applied, to ensure that it does not become grist to the mill for those who are intent of benefiting from the situation.
Mr President, I should like to make one final point. If we are to create the jobs Europe needs, the jobs the social protection system needs, we need to include women and older workers.
They are the reserves we have to mobilise.
We must activate all the Union' s social and economic potential. In the Committee on Employment we believe that is the best way of tackling the problem of ageing on our continent.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for a well-balanced report.
Ideally there would be no need for the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities to make any particular comments from a gender perspective on the design of pension systems - if only we were living in an ideal world where equal opportunities were guaranteed.
That is not how things stand, however.
The injustices which women suffer throughout their lives continue when they get older.
I am pleased to say that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has taken on board the majority of the comments made by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Someone once said that if it had been men who consistently fell foul of the pension systems, the basic principles would have been fundamentally overhauled long ago.
The committee recalls the goals of the Lisbon Process, as does Mr Cercas.
Women' s right to their own income and so to financial independence is extremely important.
Today the employment rate for women ranges from 38 to 71 percent in Europe.
Generally speaking, women must have the opportunity to take on paid employment.
Women and men should also be able to choose freely between paid employment and a career break to take care of family members.
Joint taxation in many Member States and a lack of childcare and care for the elderly are a couple of reasons why many women are unable to enter or stay in the labour market.
One important principle is that care of children and dependants should be compensated for in the pension system.
A more equal Europe is a fairer Europe, a Europe which manages both employment and future pensions.
Better equality can only be achieved through a change in fundamental attitudes and in partnership between men and women.
A more even division of responsibility for the home and family could lay the foundation for more equality in the workplace and a labour market of equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work.
In the end this will also produce a fairer pension system.
Mr President, for years the European Parliament has been arguing for Community initiatives on pensions and consequently we are pleased with the principles agreed in the Council and the work prepared by the Commission.
The task now is to use the texts in front of us in order to promote the convergence of the systems through cooperation and coordination between Member States.
There are two ways of approaching this.
On the one hand, there are a series of common challenges, the ageing of the population and the dearth of younger people or the relation between younger and older people, the changing degree of dependence or the ratio of active to inactive people, etc., limited budgetary resources, technical potential in health care, and so on. On the other hand, there are number of cross-border complications: the mobility of individuals or the option of working in another Member State and drawing a pension, the mobility of capital or the option of saving in another Member State and drawing a pension, the supplementary pension funds, which unlike the compulsory pension schemes appeal to people in various Member States and even in other countries.
For all those reasons, the systems must be made sustainable so that they can withstand common challenges and cross-border complications.
The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs indicates current thinking in the European Parliament and also in the European People' s Party on the convergence of pension systems.
It is not for the European Union to prescribe to Member States how pensions should be organised and financed.
The Member States themselves choose the appropriate ratio of compulsory scheme to supplementary schemes, between an apportionment method and capitalisation, between contributions and payments or between social security or index-linked prosperity.
But, on the one hand, solutions must be found for difficulties that hamper the free movement of pensions and pensioners and on the other efforts must be made to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of systems with budgetary resources in the service of social aims and not the other way round.
For the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and for the PPE-DE Group too the combination of cooperation between Member States and coordination between the systems seems the appropriate way of safeguarding pensions and reassuring pensioners and consequently this point must be clarified at the European Council in Gothenburg.
I think that years ago the Luxembourg Summit on employment, where the open coordination method was effectively introduced, showed us an excellent way but of course a link must be made between pensions and employment.
For as long as Europe and the various Member States do not succeed in solving the difficulties surrounding the employment of the over-55s and for as long as the case is not pressed more urgently, more opportunities are not created and more things are not made virtually compulsory, the pensions problem will not be solved.
It is essential to link the two.
This should be one of the guidelines in the framework of the coordination and indicators which is about to be drawn up.
Mr President, may I first of all thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou warmly on behalf of my group for her solid work in this communication, which gives us the opportunity to discuss pensions in a different way and allow me also to congratulate Mr Cercas Alonso on his excellent report.
I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that our recommendation, on which we shall vote tomorrow, can prove an inspiration to the Gothenburg Summit and particularly will move the Council to involve the European Parliament in a more structural way in future in the discussion on the open coordination method on pensions.
For that matter I am also grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the work that already been carried out in this field.
I hope with all my heart that Gothenburg will be able to give a clear mandate to the Belgian Presidency to formulate common social goals in the context of European cooperation on pensions.
As Mr Smet said just now it is, of course, the Member States who decide what pension system they want, how they organise it, and how they underwrite its financial robustness.
However, the fundamental aim, namely to maintain and improve the quality of pension systems in Europe, is surely an aim that we must all share.
It is, of course, clear that because of the dynamics of economic and monetary union, the pension dossier is already on the European agenda, although very one-sidedly, as part of the debate on the financeability of pension schemes.
We believe that in the discussion we must never lose sight of the essential component, namely modernisation of pension systems so that we can guarantee today' s and future generations of pensioners a reasonable pension and a participation in social life.
That debate is also about solidarity and also the equality of men and women.
For us a number of principles are essential in this.
I should like to mention four.
Firstly, pension systems must be able combat poverty in an efficient way.
It is unacceptable that in the European Union there should still be pensions, especially those of women, that fall below the poverty line.
I should therefore like to be so bold as to ask the Commission, on the basis of the recommendation of 1992 to retable this pensions dossier on minimum payments.
Secondly, reasonable pensions are of course more than the minimum necessary for survival.
It is a matter of guaranteeing a certain standard of living. It is therefore important to retain the link between the general rise in prosperity and pensions.
Thirdly, the second pillar of pensions must never replace the first because it is the first that gives the fundamental guarantee that everyone has access to an adequate pension.
For my group it has long since ceased to be a question whether one is for or against the second pension pillar.
Rather, it is a question of how we are to ensure that, even in that second pension pillar, solidarity is organised so that supplementary pensions do not remain the privilege of a small group.
Naturally, Mr President, I could also continue the discussion on the necessary raising of the pensionable age, but I shall not do so.
One thing should be clear: for my group, this does not mean a general compulsory rise in pensionable age, does mean measures to encourage people to continue working longer and to prevent companies from jettisoning older staff.
I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Gothenburg will be able to translate these principles into common objectives.
Mr President, on behalf of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would also thank the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, for his work on the Commission' s communication, which I consider to be really sound and very informative.
My group thinks it important that the Member States should organise the pensions systems in such a way that more account is taken of the fact that there will be more elderly people in the future.
Money must be found for pensions, without exhausting Treasury funds and without there being astronomical tax rises.
Economists talk a lot, of course, about the burden of the elderly, and that makes many old people feel they are being held in contempt.
'Why must we be portrayed as a burden,' they say, 'when we have made our contribution to the development of society?'
Others see the whole debate about future pension systems as concealing a real desire to undermine security and solidarity, but the intention is, of course, the very opposite, namely to ensure that there are good pensions in the future, too, and to remedy deficiencies and absurdities in the present systems.
I therefore think it good that the agenda should have been enlarged and that it should not only deal with healthy public finances, the internal market for supplementary pensions and increased growth and employment, but also with security in old age, the need to combat problems of poverty among the elderly and the removal of that discrimination against women which is often built into pensions systems.
I believe and hope that the broader agenda will promote grassroots support for the reforms of the pensions system.
Pensions based on savings must be an important part of pensions systems in the future.
It is only right and proper that we should each of us take responsibility for our own old age.
This cannot, of course, come as some sort of surprise.
A side benefit is that pensions savings through active investments can help secure the prosperity that is the basis for pensions of the future.
Finally, I want to emphasise that systems and problems differ greatly from one country to another and that pensions are - and must be - a matter over which individual nations have jurisdiction.
For that reason, we do not want an unduly restrictive framework to be imposed upon the coordination of countries' reforms, and this will be reflected in the way in which the Liberal Group votes.
Mr President, seeing the great care taken by the Ecofin Council to anticipate the long-term impact that funding pensions has on public finances makes one wish that equivalent care could be demonstrated with regard to sustainability, in order to prevent the deplorable long-term effects, for example, of the lack of fiscal harmonisation or of investments in the nuclear industry.
Do not think, however, that the Group of the Greens is suggesting that we entrust the future of pensions to the Ministers of Finance.
We support those in the Commission, in some Member States and in Parliament, who see the future of pensions and of social protection primarily as social issues, as key elements of the model, which must be strengthened, and which cannot be reduced to its financial dimension.
To hear some people talk, we might wonder if the prospect of living increasingly longer, and by 'living longer' I mean in good health as well, is not the greatest disaster threatening the citizens of the twenty-first century.
The report by Mr Cercas Alonso has the merit of not skirting the crux of the issue and of the debate.
A certain increase in spending on pensions in the GDP is certainly unavoidable because of greater life expectancy, but the rapporteur quite rightly emphasises that changes in the rate of employment is a decisive factor.
In this context, he recommends taking account of the rate of economic dependence and not only of demographic changes.
Given the prospect of full employment, this takes us away from alarmist rates, which clearly seek to legitimise new forms of finance, raised individually and through capitalisation.
The report also emphasises the invaluable role of guaranteed pension systems in combating the insecurity and social exclusion of the elderly, particularly women and workers who have had long periods of atypical work and who should be guaranteed a sufficient level of income to lead a decent life.
Lastly, the report warns against any attempt to undermine public pay-as-you-go pension systems.
These systems guarantee intergenerational solidarity, which is essential to social cohesion and they enable real-time adjustments to be made to contributions, regardless of the fluctuations of the stock market situation.
This is why our group recommends that we adopt this report, without undermining its current balance.
Mr President, I think there are many good points in the Commission' s report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a job well done.
Much has been said about solidarity and security.
This is exactly what should be addressed with regard to pensions.
There is still great anxiety about the discussion on pensions.
My colleagues have expressed unease over certain crucial points.
In my home country, Sweden, we have already started to adapt to this type of change, and a considerable part of our future pension system will be linked to a supplementary pension based on what happens on the financial markets.
In Sweden, most people have started buying and selling shares and in the past few years many of them have experienced just how risky buying shares can be.
Many have lost a great deal of their savings and are now wondering whether the same thing could happen to a pension system which is so heavily dependent on what happens on the financial market.
There is a worry that the system will be unfair. Most of all, perhaps, there is a worry that it will be unreliable.
Our group has tabled an amendment to tomorrow' s vote, in which we ask that the effects of the new system are at least assessed and the impact on solidarity on society studied.
What will happen to security?
How will it affect women?
Several speakers, including Mrs Jensen and Mrs Van Lancker, have pointed out that women are a particularly vulnerable group, and in many countries I believe that women could lose out in the system now being introduced.
I would also like to mention our Amendment No 13 in which we address a general raising of the retirement age as a way of solving future pension problems.
It is tempting to use such a solution to try not only to increase levels and ratios of employment, but also to reduce the pressure on the pension systems.
However, this presupposes that people will manage to keep working up to the raised retirement age.
This may work in certain countries as they currently have a relatively low retirement age, at least for certain categories of pensioner.
However, in my country and other Scandinavian countries, where we already have a relatively high retirement age of 65 - 67, there is currently talk of raising the age threshold to 70.
I believe this is unrealistic.
Most people are worn out from a long working life long before they reach retirement age.
In this situation it is foolish and inhuman to try to force people to remain in the labour market.
Finally, I would like to point out that I believe it is regrettable that neither the Commission nor the report we are now discussing mentions anything about the candidate countries.
It could be said that this is a problem for the future, but when talking about pensions we are talking about the future.
It is clear that there should have been a discussion on what a system of the type we now want to introduce will mean for poor candidate countries.
Mr President, first of all I should like to address my thanks to the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and my heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done.
There is no doubt that a prospective cause for alarm in the field of pensions is the ageing of the population.
But it should be noted above all that some Member States have already undertaken reforms of their systems without trauma, with significant contributions from social actors. These reforms have, over the course of time, also had positive effects on the health of public accounts.
The problem should therefore, perhaps, be split in two: on the one hand, States that may still have some imbalance in public spending but in the context of a stable economy, and on the other, those that have deficient social security systems and an economy in transition.
In the first case a gradual approach is essential.
Almost all public pension schemes, in fact, are still run completely or partly on a pay-as-you-go basis, and without a gradual changeover to a fully funded system, accompanied by harmonious taxation systems and effective family policies, there would be serious social repercussions.
For the second hypothetical scenario, and in the general case, we agree with the rapporteur in hoping that a convergent basis of parameters for maintaining the dignity of pensioners can be put in place at Community level. This will also prevent a widening of social gaps which supplementary schemes, although useful, cannot fully remedy.
In the meantime, in fact, the only path open is to increase the contributor base, while noting that the current rise in the employment rate seems rather insecure.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that what is avoided in all cases is anticipating even for the sake of intergenerational solidarity - paradoxical here - a reduction in the current levels of public protection.
Mr President, this is a very good report.
It has received widespread approbation in the committee and I hope that when it is voted on tomorrow it will receive similarly widespread support throughout the House.
The matter of pensions is a hugely important issue, and I say that not just because I have a vested interest in this matter, being close to pensionable age myself: it is an issue of increasing importance to the people, for example, sitting up at the top in the gallery there.
Today's youngsters will need a pension in the future.
We must remember that these generations deserve the same sort of pension security and safety and sustainability as that which we are talking about for ourselves.
I really just wanted to make a couple of points: there are two amendments that we have put in for the vote tomorrow which very nearly got in through the committee and were only just defeated, and I hope that when they are re-submitted tomorrow in the name of the EPP-ED Group, the whole House will be able to support them.
They are to do with recognising that pay-as-you-go schemes can no longer be exclusively relied upon to keep people's pension expectations fulfilled and also exhort Member States to sort out their tax and spending policies.
It is all very well for us to wish that people should have a safe and secure pension, but for this to happen, pensions have to be sustainable, the funding has to be put in place.
Anything less than that and we would be betraying the generations which are looking to us for support and we must not let them down.
Mr President, the insurance issue divides political opinion in all the Member States and yet, interestingly, it unites the general public.
The rapporteur, Mr Cercas, had to cope with pressure to liberalise and privatise the insurance system, alongside other maximalist positions wanting to undermine a whole series of new data.
He has managed to find the common ground, giving us a report which, it seems, Parliament will adopt by a large majority.
Of course, congratulations also go to the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, who has courageously speeded up the insurance initiative.
There are three messages or conclusions which could come out of this report.
Ãhe first is that we continue to believe that the state insurance system should take priority or, if you like, we believe in the political option of not undermining it.
The second results from the fact that, in the end, the progressive line has prevailed. This means that the cost of funding the insurance system is not seen as a negative factor in the economy and it is accepted that social protection forms part of sustainable economic development and that there will inevitably be a relative increase in the ratio of pension costs to gross national product.
This brings us to a third and particularly useful conclusion, which is that there is no such thing as insurance policy per se or insurance policy as an isolated problem and that, within the framework of a horizontal approach, it is a necessary aspect of other policies, especially tax policy, employment policy and policies to combat discrimination and exclusion.
If these are basic political choices rather than academic declarations, we need to accept that it will not be easy in the future to adopt proposals which may increase inequality, reduce the income of senior citizens and compromise the quality of services provided by the central insurance system.
I would point out that part of the report constitutes an acceptance of the need for immediate support for the care of the ill and elderly at home in the form of fiscal, social and employment measures, the need to safeguard not just any pension, but a pension which can support a dignified life and the need for a package of proposals so that new insurance legislation can properly assess all the special aspects of women's work.
In short, without denying the funding aspect of the problem, we have cut it free so that it no longer depends solely on that aspect.
The people of Europe need to be convinced that we shall pursue our options consistently.
Mr President, Mr Cercas Alonso has drafted a quite excellent report.
As we have seen, this is an issue which we are all itching to get our hands on: safe and sustainable pensions, a truly hot potato which gets hotter rather than cooler the longer we leave it.
That is why both the Member States and the European Union need to act here.
We need a satisfactory pension system, which is why the reference to the 1992 recommendation is, I think, particularly important.
But we also need a flexible pension system which has one eye on social change and the need to adjust to the job market.
The idea of an active old age has, basically, been accepted.
You only have to think of the employment policy guidelines for 2000, i.e. maintaining employability and lifelong learning.
I should also like to mention the contribution by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to the report.
It refers to the numerous women on widow's pensions with no source of income of their own.
We must reverse the trend whereby these widows' pensions are being whittled away.
This is one very important matter addressed in the report.
As far as the future is concerned, the concept of open coordination is on the table.
We must also ensure that this has real meaning as far as pensions are concerned.
We should not simply use it as an open sesame; we have to understand that the employment policy guidelines cannot simply be applied line by line.
On the contrary, we need new forms of coordination and these need to be created.
For the rest, I really do welcome the fact that the second and third pillars are dealt with as well as the first.
I would also mention the idea of capital formation by employees.
We must ensure that capital formation and old-age pensions complement rather than contradict each other.
The decisive step for the future of social protection in Europe was taken at the Lisbon Council and enshrined in the Treaty of Nice.
The issues put to the recently-established committee are extremely wide-ranging and require practical responses under the terms quite rightly laid down by the Commission and by the particularly excellent report that we are now assessing.
I therefore call on the Council to reformulate its mandate for this committee.
It is not enough to calculate the financial contribution needed to meet the requirements of the various systems. This should already have been done under the Stability Pact since, like employment, social protection is conditioned by macroeconomic policy decisions and by the increased dependence of the elderly and the unforeseeable increase in changes in the labour market, with periods of training alternating with periods of activity and inactivity.
It is absolutely crucial that we consider the cost to our societies of failing to transfer our citizens' pension systems, in terms of loss of political confidence in Europe, social upheaval, greater insecurity and poverty, a fall in consumption, economic recession and greater inequalities. This is the key political question to which we must respond and which the Council must soon answer.
Capitalisation must have clearly-defined borders and must be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
It cannot be an obstacle to mobility, because it does not solve demographic problems and does not involve solidarity.
It involves benefits and risks and stimulates the financial markets, factors which must be considered. It is not, however, and cannot be part of the problem, and would contribute to greater risks for social protection.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are social policy as well as financial, economic and employment policy aspects to the pension issue.
All these areas must be addressed together if pensions are to be secured in the long term.
I would also add that we have economic policy guidelines and the stability and growth pact on the question of employment and growth policy.
When it comes to the question of demographic change as one of the causes of the problem of pensions, there are several problems: one is the unfortunate fall in the birth rate, another is early retirement in numerous countries and a third is longer life expectancy, for which we, of course, thank God.
As far as birth rates are concerned, we must help to create a stronger awareness of what mothers and fathers contribute from a social policy point of view and ensure that family and work can be smoothly combined.
As far as early retirement is concerned, we must ensure that the retirement age can be brought up to the statutory retirement age in all countries.
A variety of measures is needed for this.
Without doubt, the question of life expectancy has repercussions on the actual retirement age as well as on the statutory retirement age in many countries.
I trust that we can help to strengthen the second and third pillars as well as the first pillar in Europe.
We have countries today in which 80% of people in employment have a company pension.
In my country it is just 9%, while the European average is 25%.
We are currently debating a directive here in Parliament, and I call on the Council to stop blocking a European regulation on company pensions at long last.
I call on the Commission to set up a European pension forum to discuss the different fiscal and employment and social regulations and to help harmonise these issues throughout Europe.
I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cercas, who worked very closely with the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights, resulting in the impressive consensus in today's debate.
The question of pensions is a key political, economic and social question which every government has to address.
Some reforms are under way, others are being discussed and others were completed a mere year or two ago.
So it is a European problem and the sustainability of pensions is the wager for the next generation.
There is a set of policies which, if they are successful at European level, will support and strengthen the sustainability of pensions.
The aim of these policies is to increase the rate of growth and employment and they include policies to provide efficient support for parents, so that they can combine work and family, and immigration policies.
However, over and above these general policies, every country needs to reform the system itself, which has been inherited from a previous era of industrial development.
This reform is social and economic in nature.
I think that it is particularly important, as numerous speakers have stressed, that pensions are no longer the exclusive preserve of Ecofin and budgetary discipline and have been discussed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as by the ministers.
Pensions are, first and foremost, a social issue, but with huge, serious economic implications.
Of course, under the Treaty, insurance system reforms and policy are national responsibilities.
But do not forget that we are also required, that it is a specific objective of the Treaty to safeguard a high level of social protection and sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth.
It is therefore important, post Lisbon, that the heads of state have agreed for the first time that they need to work together on pension issues.
It is a very important change of direction towards European policies, which illustrates the extent of the problem.
With cooperation between the Member States, the reforms will no doubt be more efficient in all the countries.
An initial Commission communication was ordered following Lisbon and has been issued.
The subject of pensions has been discussed at all the Councils - in Feira, Nice and Stockholm - and the study to be presented in GÃ¶teborg is being prepared by the newly formed Committee on Social Protection.
This study will analyse all the problems Member State by Member State and will table proposals on basic principles for sustainable systems.
I would just point out that one basic guideline given to this committee concerns the gender dimension.
Numerous members mentioned that it is impossible to take a neutral approach to the question of pensions because women face more serious problems and poverty in Europe is closely bound up with the pension system and the economic and social position of women.
What is important is that it was decided post Stockholm to examine the method of open coordination on the question of pensions, taking account, of course, of the question of subsidiarity and the specific problems of each Member States.
We are preparing a Commission communication, which will be presented before the summer, in which we try to approach the question of the open coordination on pensions in a more analytical manner.
I must say that this resolution by the European Parliament, assuming that it is approved tomorrow as it stands today, will provide strong support for this coordinated effort to reform pensions in the European Union.
I think that this new chapter which is being opened at European level, the chapter of collaboration on pensions, will allow for new forms of cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
And may I remind you that the Commission specifically supported the need for the European Parliament to collaborate with the High Level Committee on the subject of social protection and that this collaboration is now under way.
Honourable Members, I think that the fact that we have opened up this chapter and given a European dimension to the question of pensions will give the governments in all the Member States the support and backing they need in order to bring about sustainable reform, taking account of the economic and, more importantly, the social dimension.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0169/2001).
Question No 1 by (H-0323/01):
Subject: Common organisation of the market in the sugar sector On 30 June the current sugar scheme will either have to be extended or changed.
Last year the cost of overproduction in the sugar sector amounted to EUR 800 million, almost as much as the sum made available for dealing with the BSE crisis.
Despite strong criticism of the current scheme by the Court of Auditors and the negative effects on consumers and third-world producers, the Council appears very unwilling to make changes to the sugar scheme as proposed by the Commission.
There is a threat that a number of EU Member States may give in to the short-sighted approach based on selfÂ­interest taken by the sugar industry.
Does the Council intend to back the Commission proposal, given the strong criticism of the current sugar scheme by the Court of Auditors and the negative effects on consumers and third-world producers?
If not, why is the Council advocating maintaining a sugar scheme which has been strongly criticised by the Court of Auditors and which has negative effects on consumers and third-world producers?
Reforming the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector has been discussed by the Council since October last year, during which time the Council has taken on board certain criticism from the Court of Auditors.
As this House is aware, Parliament made its declaration on this matter on 13 March 2001.
In looking at this declaration, I can say that it is generally not along the lines suggested by the honourable Member.
I would also point out that the Commission has stated that it may approve an extension of the current organisation of the sugar markets beyond 1 July 2003 on condition that all the other parts of its reform proposal are approved by the Council.
I also believe that there is disagreement among Member States between those who support reform and those who oppose it.
The Council will continue addressing the issue at its meeting in May and will look at all contributions, including those presented in the question which has just been put to the Council.
In addition, the Council adopted a regulation on 26 February 2001 on the "Everything but Arms" initiative to extend duty and quota free access to all products except arms and ammunition originating in a large number of least-developed countries.
With regard to sugar, full liberalisation of trade will apply from 1 July 2009.
I understand the caution with which the Council must answer, given the fact that there is so little unanimity among the countries of the European Union, but it remains disgraceful.
In effect we are subsidising the sugar industry - last year to the tune of over EUR 800 million - as if there were not enough sugar in the world and as if we were eager for these subsidies to help our farmers survive.
I really think that the policy we are pursuing with regard to the developing countries is and continues to be hypocritical.
A splendid initiative like "Everything but Arms" is actually tainted by the fact that we maintain our hypocritical attitude and prefer to continue doing what suits us, by supporting the sugar producers, who traditionally belong to the castes of our nineteenth-century industrialists.
I note that we have once again made an exception.
I hope that the Council will continue to exert pressure for unanimity for reforms.
The Presidency will do what it can, i.e. ensure that the issue is constantly discussed.
There are differences of opinion among Member States.
This is a sensitive issue for many Member States.
We will be taking the matter up at the Agriculture Council of Ministers in a few weeks and I promise that we will continue to give the issue high priority.
At the same time, it is unfortunately impossible to predict what any future compromise will look like.
Question No 2 by (H-0325/01):
Subject: Euro Council Despite earlier Council decisions that the preparatory talks held prior to Ecofin meetings between ministers from the 12 euro countries would be completely informal and that only euro-related issues would be discussed, the signs are increasing that such talks are becoming formalised to resemble a 'euro Council' and, in practice, by taking preliminary decisions on a range of Ecofin issues, are taking over real power from ECOFIN.
Belgium, in particular, has put forward proposals for 'developing' the informal euro Council.
In view of this situation, what steps will the Council take to put an end to all attempts contrary to the Treaty to formalise a 'euro Council' and gradually transfer Ecofin's powers to such a Council?
The 'Eurogroup' is an informal body set up in 1998 on the basis of a resolution on economic policy coordination in stage 3 of EMU.
The resolution was adopted by the European Council in Luxembourg on 13 December 1997.
The resolution states that the Ministers of the States participating in the euro-area may meet informally among themselves to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency.
The resolution also confirms that decisions will in all cases be taken by the Ecofin Council in accordance with the procedures determined by the Treaty.
The European Council in Nice in December last year welcomed the improvements made to the workings of the Eurogroup and its visibility.
It also welcomed the intention to extend the range of mainly structural matters dealt with in this forum, with due regard for the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council meeting, i.e. that the Eurogroup be informal and without any decision-making powers.
I would like to thank Mr Danielsson for his reply.
In some ways it is positive if it is saying that the Eurogroup does not make any decisions at all.
My first supplementary question is this: is it really the case that no real decisions are made in the Eurogroup, or is it the case that decisions have already been taken by the time the matter reaches Ecofin, which simply goes along with whatever has actually been decided in the Eurogroup?
My second question concerns the future.
The Presidency is aware that proposals have come from a number of sides, not least from Belgium, to develop the informal "Euro Council" and add more functions.
Mr Danielsson confirmed that the Eurogroup has started to take on additional functions and address more issues.
My second question is therefore: can we be absolutely sure that the Eurogroup will not actually take over more and more real power in the future?
It is vital for the countries not in the euro to be able to remain outside the euro area without losing power over matters directly concerning the euro.
I am willing to admit to Mr Gahrton that, on taking over the presidency on 1 January this year, Sweden was quite concerned about how things would work with the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council.
We were worried that we would end up with a situation in which - as Mr Gahrton was suggesting - decisions would be taken in a room to which we had no access.
As such, we would receive a 'fait accompli' which we would just have to process in the Ecofin Council.
However, I can honestly say that things have not turned out that way.
A great deal of respect has been shown for the principles set out in the decision I quoted from Luxembourg, i.e. the European Council Resolution of December 1997.
Of course, there is need for discussion in the circle of ministers of finance who share the single currency, but no real decisions are taken in this circle.
The position of the Ecofin Council has been respected, with great unity shown on the principles of this matter.
Can we be absolutely sure about what will happen in the future?
As someone once said, it is difficult to predict, particularly about the future.
I think there is every reason to believe that the members of the Council will continue to feel solidarity on the principles laid down in the European Council' s previous decisions, i.e. that the Ecofin Council' s position will be preserved.
The fact that some representatives have expressed a personal opinion that the position of the European Council should be expanded is a matter for them.
We are trying to assess how things have worked in practice, and we believe we can say without hesitation that the position of the Ecofin Council has been respected.
Question No 3 by (H-0329/01):
Subject: Western Sahara The UN has decided to extend the presence of MINURSO in Western Sahara by two months in spite of the fact that the settlement plan signed between Morocco and the Polisario Front is not yet fully applicable.
On the contrary, the threat of renewed armed conflict between the two parties is now greater than ever.
For example, several indicators point to the fact that Morocco is seeking to rearm, such as the announcement that it is purchasing American or French fighter planes by investing part of the money obtained under the recent agreement between Vivendi and Maroc Telecom (US $ 3.5 bn).
The British press has also recently revealed that Morocco benefited from trade agreements with the UK, thus enabling it to acquire more arms and renew its military capability: Mirage fighters, and spare parts which may already have permitted the manufacture of 56 field guns.
These weapons are now deployed at the border, along the so-called 'defence wall' .
If confirmed, this transaction would be illegal since Community legislation - the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports - prohibits the sale of arms to countries or areas where there is a conflict situation.
Can the Council confirm this information ?
Does it propose to intervene with the Member State in question?
The Council has not discussed the particular matter brought up in the question.
Contrary to what is suggested in the question, there is no Community legislation on arms export.
Therefore, the question cannot arise of whether or not a particular transaction is legal in accordance with Community Law.
The Code of Conduct to which the honourable Member refers was drawn up on 8 June 1998 and is based on common criteria for conventional weapons transfers.
According to the operative provisions of the Code of Conduct, each EU Member State will assess export licence applications for military equipment made to it on a case-by-case basis against the provisions of the Code of Conduct.
As such, decisions on whether an export licence should be granted are made by each individual Member State, and it is not up to the Council to decide on such individual transactions.
According to the Code, every year Member States must exchange information on their arms exports in the Council, allowing a joint review of how well the Code is operating.
This annual review is presented in an annual report in accordance with Operative Provision No 8.
The general political stance of the Council with regard to the conflict in Western Sahara is to fully support the United Nations and the UN Secretary General' s personal envoy James Baker in their work on finding a solution to the conflict.
The Council is convinced that the UN process constitutes the best framework for a rapid, lasting and mutually agreed solution which would also increase stability in the whole region.
It is clear that every solution must be acceptable to all parties and based on complete respect for fundamental democratic principles and human rights.
In line with this political aim, the Council is willing to contribute to the process and help to create a climate of trust between the parties concerned.
In this respect, at the end of last year the EU submitted a proposal to the parties concerned for a number of humanitarian and trust-building measures.
The EU is maintaining close contact with James Baker and is looking into how best to support the UN' s initiatives.
I would also like to emphasise that the EU is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to the Western Sahara refugees, giving aid of EUR 20 million over the next three years.
Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council, although I should like express my disappointment that we are unable to ensure that the quite important and strict criteria of this code of conduct are respected.
Amongst these criteria I would highlight the idea of banning the sale of arms to countries or regions that are involved in conflict.
This matter is so serious that now, in the United Kingdom, MPs have obtained the right to vet arms sales from their country to anywhere the world. This move has created quite a stir in that country, even though the decision is not retroactive and British MPs cannot take action on this matter of arms sales to the Western Sahara.
I would nevertheless put my question once again: do you not think that there may be 'sanction' -type measures that the European Union could take when this code of conduct is breached?
Furthermore, what concerns me the most is that this affair appears to demonstrate Morocco' s desire to rearm itself.
Deplorably, it also demonstrates the support that the country is receiving within Europe.
This can only heighten the already tense atmosphere in the region.
Although the situation in this 25-year-old conflict is currently deadlocked, largely as a result of Morocco blocking the validation of the electoral lists established by MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), there is a risk of armed hostilities flaring up overnight.
Can I ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Swedish Presidency plans to issue a statement on the matter before the end of June?
I am thinking back to the German Presidency, which made a specific statement on Western Sahara.
Given this background, why does the European Union not officially recognise the Polisario Front as a negotiating partner in this conflict, something that the United Nations did 25 years ago?
The code of conduct concerning arms is not legally binding, so there are no legal grounds for sanctions.
However, the Swedish Presidency is working to achieve greater openness and transparency in this area as in most others.
I believe that we have seen several positive, constructive steps taken on the road to greater transparency, even in the application of the code of conduct for arms export.
We will continue to work with our supporters in the Council to take further steps to increase transparency in the issues surrounding arms export.
As far as the Western Sahara conflict is concerned, it has gone on far too long.
I believe that we all currently feel great frustration over the lack of progress.
However, the Council is of the firm opinion that we can best help the work on finding a peaceful solution by continuing our clear support for the UN and the UN Secretary General' s personal envoy James Baker.
This is the stance the Council will continue to take.
The Presidency has given Mrs Boudjenah very satisfactory answers, not just on the subject of the code of conduct for arms but also regarding the conflict in the Sahara. The President-in-Office of the Council is well aware that Mrs Boudjenah' s question arises out of her concern about the conflict between Morocco and Western Sahara.
In his clear reply, he spoke in support of the United Nations and James Baker.
He outlined the need to reach an agreement acceptable to all. He stated that Europe is in fact the largest donor of humanitarian aid, contributing EUR 20 million.
Given that we are the largest donor of humanitarian aid, ought we not to play a major political role in this conflict? We should prevent the inhabitants of Western Sahara returning to arms and an escalation of the fighting.
Why should we limit ourselves to supporting James Baker and the United Nations?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, an acceptable agreement was reached back in 1992, when the inhabitants of Western Sahara laid down their arms to vote in a referendum which should have been held that same year.
Do you not agree that the best way forward would be for that referendum to take place, with European backing?
The Western Sahara conflict is extremely difficult and has a complicated background.
I believe that the best course of action for the EU, which wants and will have an active role to play in important and difficult international conflicts, is to provide strong support for the UN' s work.
I can see from the report presented by Mr Baker in April this year that progress has actually been made in developing various proposals for self-governance for Western Sahara.
I believe that it would be foolish at this stage for us to choose any other approach than continuing to provide this constructive support for Mr Baker.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I invite you to follow the straightforward train of thought I am about to present.
You stated that the Council has tackled the issue of the conflict in Western Sahara, and that a range of measures have been taken aimed at rebuilding trust between the parties.
Do you believe that a measure of trust between the parties is that a Member State, one as important as the United Kingdom, should be selling arms to one of those parties when a cease-fire is in force?
Secondly, continuing my straightforward train of thought, which code of conduct are we referring to?
My impression is that many individuals and organisations must be referring to a different code of conduct from the one you mentioned.
The code you mentioned might or might not exist.
Thirdly, I hope you will give up that metaphysical position which allows you to state that you support Mr Baker' s efforts without specifying exactly how you propose to do so.
I would be grateful if you could explain how you plan to support Mr Baker.
The Council has not had occasion to discuss any individual Member State' s sale of arms to the region.
I cannot therefore comment on this.
However, I believe that I have been sufficiently clear in trying to underline the Council' s view of how best to achieve progress in the conflict itself.
For example, the Council has stated its regret that the situation is deadlocked on the issue of a referendum.
The UN Secretary General has proposed that the parties discuss alternative solutions to achieve a solution to the conflict, as the issue of a referendum has proved so difficult.
I repeat that I believe it would be most unfortunate if the EU did not wholeheartedly support the collective, international efforts to solve this difficult conflict.
Question No 4 by (H-0330/01):
Subject: Deaths of four African emigrants on the beaches of Tarifa on the coast of Andalusia, Spain On 21 March 2001 another four people, two men and two women, one of whom was pregnant, were found dead after having tragically drowned, like so many others, in an attempt to reach European territory in search of work and a new life.
When will the European Union act, directly and by interceding with the Spanish authorities, to put an end to this appalling situation which is a disgrace for all the European institutions and for those of the Spanish state?
The Council has had the opportunity to answer similar questions from the honourable Member on several occasions.
Therefore, the Council' s stance ought to be well known.
I would refer the honourable Member to the reply to his oral question H-27/2001 of 14 February 2001.
In addition, let me emphasise the hard work which the Council and the Commission have put into carrying out the action plan for Morocco.
Let me also point out that the battle against human trafficking is a priority issue.
I would also like to stress that Spain does not have any authority in Morocco and therefore cannot control when vessels of various kinds leave Morocco.
Mr Minister, since I raised this issue the last time, thousands of immigrants have continued to arrive on Andalusian, that is European, beaches in small boats, risking their very lives.
Women, men, young people, both boys and girls, and children, some of whom have arrived dead, discovered lifeless on the beaches and rocks of the tragic border between Africa and Europe.
Others have been arrested and many have escaped inland to try to find the work that did not exist in their own countries.
Given this unacceptable situation, when will the European institutions understand that this is their problem and one that affects them directly?
When are they going to take action to prevent such occurrences, so that when these people arrive, they enjoy conditions that befit them as our brothers and the human beings that they are?
I have already said here on another occasion that the European Union cannot turn a blind eye from a tragic situation that should shame the European and Spanish institutions and that this should force them to implement the measures necessary to remedy the situation.
The Council is not turning a blind eye.
The Council realises that this is a major problem which represents a large amount of human suffering.
The Council is deeply involved in a dialogue with Morocco to try to change the circumstances in such a way that we do not see these terrible examples of human suffering which the honourable Member has brought up.
I would remind the honourable Member that the decision by the Council referred to in the question is based on a Commission proposal from 26 January 2000, a proposal for a Council Regulation determining the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders, including Colombian citizens, and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
The Council would also like to point out that Parliament confirmed the Commission' s proposal on this issue on two separate occasions, in its declaration of 5 July 2000 and in its second declaration made as recently as 1 March this year.
The Council adopted the ensuing regulation with a qualified majority on 15 March, and it entered into force on 10 April, i.e. just over a month ago.
The Council cannot therefore understand Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez' view that the decision was wrong.
The system as it is set up was devised with full consideration for openness and transparency, as Member States should inform the other Member States and the Commission of what measures they are taking in accordance with this regulation.
For the same reason this information should also be made public in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
I shall rephrase the question, because it is essential for the Council to reply in political terms. I do not need to be reminded of European Union procedures for adopting decisions of this kind.
I think we are all familiar with them.
The Council' s decision to include Colombia in the list of countries whose citizens require visas to enter European Union countries is not simply useless in the fight against the organised crime some Colombian citizens might be involved in. It also forces ordinary citizens to bear the additional cost of obtaining a visa.
Furthermore, this decision clouds relations between the European Union and Colombia unnecessarily. In addition to myself, many Colombian intellectuals, led by none other than Mr GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, have stated how close Colombia is to us.
It has come to my notice, for instance, that Mr GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez did not travel to Spain to take part in the recent celebrations marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the newspaper El PaÃ­s. This was to comply with the undertaking given by those intellectuals who stated that they would not travel to the Union, at least, not to Spain, until this rule is withdrawn.
I would ask you please to reply to my question and I hope the reply will be in the affirmative. Will the Council review this decision in the near future, having first consulted the Colombian authorities and Colombian society?
The reason why I gave what Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez considers to be a bureaucratic and procedural reply was that there was a suggestion in his question that the decision was wrong.
As such, I feel there is reason to point out that all the rules, including two hearings in this House, were followed.
Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez is, of course, free not to sympathise with the content of the regulation adopted, but it was taken recently and all applicable rules were adhered to.
As far as I know, there are no plans to make any changes to the regulation.
Question No 6 by (H-0338/01):
Subject: Report by Christa KlaÃ, MEP, on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine On 24 October 2000, Parliament adopted by a large majority a report (A5-0195/2000, C5-0090/2000) on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine.
What stage has been reached in the further consideration of this document in the Council?
Why has the Council not yet completed its consideration of this directive?
When will the directive be placed on the Council's agenda for final consideration and forwarded to the Member States for implementation?
The Commission's proposal and Parliament's report on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine create greater legal certainty for the economic partners concerned in these areas which are so important for wine-growing in the EU.
Clear rules on cultivation, authorisation, registration and checks should simplify trade and establish a clear legal basis therefor.
It is incomprehensible that, five months later, the Council has still not reached a decision.
Let me start by saying that I entirely agree with the honourable Member on the importance of the legal instrument in question.
Let me also say that the Council appreciates the work of Mrs KlaÃ as rapporteur for this important issue.
The Council has also taken on board Parliament' s declaration to a large extent.
It is therefore quite understandable that Parliament is concerned by the delay in the Council' s final decision on the issue.
The final decision has been delayed because some Member States have asked for more time to consider the provisions on genetically modified organisms, despite the fact that these provisions are no different from Community legislation in force and are equivalent to those recently adopted in accordance with the Community directives on the marketing of seed and forest reproductive material.
Adopting the directive was on the agenda at the Agriculture European Council in November of last year.
It was postponed until December and then until January of this year, as no agreement had been reached on the provisions concerning genetically modified organisms.
However, the Swedish Presidency aims to reach agreement on the Council supporting and adopting the new legislation before the end of the Swedish Presidency, i.e. by June of this year at the latest.
Mr President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office if we can reasonably be expected to wait five months for a decision.
We too have worked on this.
Think about this directive; in the final analysis it is also about having clear provisions on selection, licensing, registration and control so as to create legal security for vine propagators in the European Union.
This part is also very important to economic operators and economic partners in the EU.
On the other hand, according to my information, the plan was to wait until the release directive, i.e. Directive 90/220, had been adopted.
This directive has now been through conciliation, i.e. it has been adopted.
I therefore see no reason to delay this any further.
This directive says nothing about definitive licensing.
That needs to be decided in the release directive.
I would therefore ask you to advance, not to block Parliament's work in the Council.
I totally share the honourable Member' s view.
The Presidency' s firm strategy is to try to get a decision on the issue.
As I said, we have until June to try to achieve this.
Question No 7 by (H-0340/01):
Subject: Swedish exemption from rules restricting public access to EU documents A brochure entitled 'The EU Agreement' published in 1994 by the Foreign Ministry's department of trade ahead of the Swedish referendum on EU membership stated that 'the principle of public access to official documents remains intact and is non-negotiable'.
This promise was given to the Swedish people ahead of EU membership.
Does this reservation imply that Sweden is exempt from any EU rules which may restrict the application of the national principle of public access to official documents?
As President-in-Office of the Council, I can be very brief to start with.
I would point out that national legislation on public access to documents is not covered by harmonisation of the Community' s legislation.
Nor do we foresee any such harmonisation in the future.
Thank you for your answer.
As the President-in-Office of the Council must certainly have suspected, I am thinking of EU documents received by Member States.
The EU has now adopted new rules, a Regulation on the basis of Article 355, which means that there is a more secure legal basis.
The Regulation talks about loyalty to the EU' s rules and also about having to request guidance in cases that are unclear.
If, on the basis of this Regulation, the Commission and the EU' s Court of Justice find that a country cannot make documents available at national level that are classified at EU level, Community legislation may be contrary to Sweden' s principle of public access to official records.
Does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that such a scenario is out of the question and, if so, why?
I believe that a procedure such as Mr SjÃ¶stedt describes is out of the question.
I note first of all that the introduction to the Act that has been agreed upon expressly states that it is neither the aim nor the effect of the Regulation to change national legislation concerning public access to documents.
Secondly, Mr SjÃ¶stedt refers to the loyalty principle.
This is not new.
We have been living the whole time with what is known as the loyalty principle, as described in Article 10 of the EC Treaty.
It has not been changed in relation to the agreement made here and approved by Parliament at the beginning of this month.
I want to emphasise that the consultation procedure being introduced through Article 5 into the new Act is only advisory.
If we talk about the situation in Sweden, the fact that, in order to be able to make a correct assessment of damage, Swedish authorities may need to consult the institutions when applying the rules concerning foreign secrecy is not in itself anything new.
That is a familiar fact of Swedish legislation, and the new Act does not change anything in that regard.
I want to thank the Swedish Presidency, and I want to thank Mr Danielsson for his answer.
I want also, of course, to express my gratitude for the committed work that has been done to give the EU a new approach to the principle of public access to official records, in this case EU documents.
I nonetheless wish to ask a question.
Might we in Sweden see a development in which representatives of Swedish authorities practise self-censorship in situations in which Brussels and European authorities differ from Sweden in the assessments they make as to whether, and to what extent, the secrecy rules are to be applied?
This issue of self-censorship and of being able to adopt a distinctively Swedish view when a different assessment is made in Brussels is a relevant subject for discussion.
The question put by Mr SacrÃ©deus is obviously of relevance.
It is perhaps even more relevant in a Swedish Parliament than in this illustrious European Parliament.
I have a lot of confidence in the Swedish authorities' ability to make independent assessments of such issues.
I think the risk of self-censorship is very slight.
Allow me just to emphasise that, in the Council' s view, the system we have had up until now regarding public access to documents is subordinate to the rules on which this Parliament has adopted a position and which it has actively helped to devise.
We now have an Act covering all documents, and last year' s Solana decision, as it is known, is no longer valid.
We have compulsory registers.
We have a requirement for rapid assessments to be made of whether or not documents can be released.
We have clearly defined provisions governing secrecy etc.
Thanks in large part to this Parliament, the EU' s institutions will therefore acquire much better and clearer rules governing transparency and accessibility.
Just to show that this question is not only of interest to Swedish Members of the European Union but to other nationalities as well, is this new procedure in the Council in operation?
If not, when will it be in operation?
In other words, when can I get my first document out of the Council?
I do not know whether the Member is asking the President-in-Office of the Council to assess a practical matter. I rather think that is impossible.
I presume that, once this Act has come into force, all the European Union' s institutions will apply its provisions in a competent way, which means that it will sooner or later be possible for Mr Newton Dunn and others to obtain access to those documents not covered by the secrecy test which must always be carried out.
Question No 8 by (H-0342/01):
Subject: Council's position on acts of violence by Turkey During his recent visit to Skopje, capital of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Xavier Solana, stated that it would be a mistake for the government of FYROM to negotiate with the terrorists (of the KLA).
He also added that the FYROM leadership had the support of the EU as there was no place in the Union for those who resort to violent means.
In the light of this categorical statement, will the Council say why this position of principle does not also apply to Turkey, which used violent means in 1974, in breach of international law, to seize 40% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, which it has since held under occupation in defiance of UN resolutions?
Is the Council unaware that the country in question, which has recently been declared a candidate for accession to the EU, uses violent means to prevent the Kurdish minority from exercising its personal and civil rights, uses excessive force against prisoners, imprisons journalists and, in general, exercises the power of the State by violent means, violating all human rights charters, a fact which has also been established on numerous occasions by the International Court of Human Rights?
The Council' s position regarding the issue of Cyprus and the human rights situation in Turkey, including the issue of the Kurds, is well known.
It is perhaps most clearly apparent from the Council' s decision, adopted on 8 March 2001, concerning partnership in connection with Turkey' s accession.
A considerable number of the priorities and objectives in the accession partnership have to do precisely with human rights.
Regarding the issue of Cyprus, this Act repeated what was said at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999.
In the light of the accession partnership and of Turkey' s national programme for adopting the rules, the European Union will now concentrate on ensuring that Turkey really implements these priorities.
An Association Council is planned for 26 June 2001, when the issue of implementation will be addressed.
The Commission has given notice that another in the series of reports on Turkey and the other applicant States will be published in November of this year.
Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office for the reply which he has given me which, in principle, I find satisfactory, although he has strayed from the point.
I asked because, in Turkey's case, although it exercises violence against Cyprus, a dialogue is under way, on friendly terms no less, and it is already a candidate country, while in other cases Mr Solana says that we do not engage in dialogue with countries which exercise violence.
I should also like the Council to tell me if it knows about the following new provocation on the part of this country, by which I mean Turkey.
First, the allegedly pacifist, europhile foreign minister, Mr Cem, threatened that if Cyprus was accepted as a full member of the Union, his country's reaction would know no bounds.
In other words, he threatens all and sundry.
Secondly, the Turkish air force has repeatedly and frequently violated Greek air space, forcing the Greek air force into dangerous interceptions.
Thirdly, the International Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg found last week that Turkey was blatantly violating the human rights of Greek Cypriots from the part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish military.
What does the President-in-Office have to say about all this?
I note, as I have done on quite a few occasions before, that the partnership agreement with Turkey gives the European Union the opportunity to follow political developments in Turkey carefully.
It also provides an opportunity to conduct a dialogue with the Turkish authorities and the Turkish Government, when the Council considers that such a dialogue is called for.
According to its usual practice, the Council opts for dialogue as a method of dealing with states of affairs considered to be unacceptable.
I would also point out that the next opportunity for discussion is precisely the forthcoming meeting of the Association Council with Turkey on 26 June 2001.
Mr President, this Chamber was illegally stormed this afternoon during the debate on Turkey.
This is not the first time we have been pestered in this way.
This is also a question of the security of the European institutions.
Does the Council have any plans to strengthen security in the European institutions?
I do not believe it is for the Council to comment on Parliament' s security arrangements.
Mr RÃŒbig, I can assure you that security is a matter of great concern for Parliament. The Bureau is currently working on it and considering the budget implications, given that security measures have proved inadequate.
Clearly, debates must go ahead, regardless of who the protesters may be and of the legitimacy or otherwise of their cause.
The Council is not going to be responsible for security in all three premises used by Parliament.
Rest assured that no effort is being spared in dealing with the matter.
The second supplementary question is by Mr Fatuzzo.
You have the floor.
I have listened to the reply by the President of the Council to the problem that was well illustrated by Mr Marinos: the relationship between Turkey and the Greek Cypriots and the Kurds.
I should like to ask the Council whether it checks, watches, is aware and takes account in this context of the situation of the Armenian population living in Turkey which also has not inconsiderable problems in manifesting its ethnicity.
Last week, I met a bishop of the Armenian Church who told me about this very difficult situation of the Armenian population in Turkey.
Allow me to repeat that one of the advantages of the partnership agreement with Turkey is that it provides the opportunity to carefully monitor the situation in the country.
That applies not only to the situation of the Kurdish minority but also, of course, to that of the Armenian population.
Such monitoring is taking place.
Questions Nos 9 and 10 lapse.
A letter has been sent to their authors explaining that pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, items already on the agenda are not dealt with during Question Time. As the House will be aware, the Commission and the Council have made statements on the serious issue of those Turkish prisoners on hunger strike.
Clearly, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure have been applied correctly in this case. There can be no doubt about that.
In any case, Mr Alyssandrakis has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, it is true that the Council has replied and that the Council and Commission have made statements.
However, we are allowed a supplementary question during Question Time.
The decision not to hold a debate under this procedure deprives us of this right.
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, these questions may not be raised because they have already been dealt with in the statement by the Council and the Commission.
I do not believe that applying the Rules of Procedure to this case constitutes a breach of any fundamental right.
There are many ways in which you may express your views in this House.
Question No 11 by (H-0348/01):
Subject: WEU satellite facilities at Torrejon Following the decisions made at Nice by the European Council, what are the plans and the timetable for transferring these facilities from the WEU to the EU?
The European Union confirmed at the Nice Summit that it intends to take over the WEU' s crisis management responsibilities.
The Council noted the decisions on principle that have been taken to incorporate the appropriate tasks of the Western European Union into the Petersberg tasks.
These included setting up a satellite centre and an institute for security studies in the form of bodies into which suitable parts of the current, parallel WEU structures would be incorporated.
The Swedish Presidency was called upon to join with the Secretary General of the Council in continuing the work on this issue in the Council (General Affairs).
A draft Community measure on the establishment of a satellite centre for the European Union is in the process of being discussed right now by the Council bodies.
The Swedish Presidency aims to have it adopted by the Council before the end of June.
A satellite centre is of the greatest importance for increasing early warning and crisis monitoring capability within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, especially the European security and defence policy.
The centre must have a constitution and structure which will enable it to respond flexibly to the demands of the European Union and its Member States and to carry out its tasks in close cooperation with existing institutions within the Community at national and international levels.
The staff and infrastructure of this centre should come, to begin with, from the WEU' s satellite centre.
The precise arrangements for this have not yet been determined.
The recently established satellite centre, which is to be located in TorrejÃ³n de Ardoz in Spain, will begin its activities on 1 January 2002.
Thank you for that very full reply, Mr President-in-Office.
Since the budget will become European Union operational on 1 January, will the budget for the Satellite Centre be part of the European security and defence budget, which the Council will put forward and which Parliament can debate and amend, as necessary?
Will it be budgetised within the EU's normal financial procedures?
The Satellite Centre' s budget will consist of contributions from the Member States, with these distributed according to what is known as a GNP key. That is to say, it lies outside the traditional budget.
There will be a special system for sharing responsibility for financing the Centre' s activity among the Member States according to their gross national income.
Question No 12 by (H-0352/01):
Subject: Statements by the President of the USA concerning the Kyoto international treaty The President of the USA has made it clear by his statements that the USA will not observe the Kyoto international treaty, which requires the country to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases, on the grounds that the Treaty is not in the economic interests of the USA.
The verbal reactions of European leaders to the statements by Bush do not constitute a policy.
What measures is the Council considering in response to the cynical attitude of the USA which is sabotaging the international treaty?
Is the possibility of economic sanctions under consideration?
The European Union' s measures and positions on this issue are well documented, especially as a result of the extensive monitoring by the media of the most recent comments and the extensive bilateral consultations carried out by the Council.
The Council scarcely needs to remind you that the European Community and its Member States have played, and continue to play, a very active role in the international negotiations on climate change.
In its conclusions, the Council has time after time confirmed it commitment to reaching an agreement at the next and Sixth Conference of the Parties to safeguarding the Kyoto Protocol' s environmental integrity and to creating conditions for its ratification and entry into force by 2002 at the latest.
It certainly does not need to be repeated that the Council sticks by both its policy on climate change and these commitments.
The European Council in Stockholm in March 2001 again confirmed its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol as the basis for the international work on reducing emissions.
The European Council called upon all the negotiating partners to contribute constructively to reaching an agreement on the more specific conditions for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and facilitating a successful result.
The Council still stands by its belief in the Kyoto Protocol and the Kyoto process.
Extensive consultation with other parties has been carried out by the troika, which has met the Canadians, the Iranians - who currently hold the Presidency of the Group of 77 - the Russians, the Chinese and the Japanese in order to garner support for the Kyoto process and for the efforts made by the President of the Conference of the Parties, the Dutch Minister for the Environment, Mr Pronk.
Further bilateral negotiations on the same theme will, of course, take place before the second round of the Sixth Conference of the Parties in Bonn this summer.
The European Union has also made known its commitment to proceeding further with the preparations for ratification by no later than 2002, even if the United States decides not to participate.
The EU' s direct strategy, therefore, involves securing sufficient support for the continued success of the Kyoto process, in spite of the United States' s current position.
Through a number of high-level representatives, including the Swedish Minister for the Environment, Mr Larsson, and the Commissioner for the Environment, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, the European Union has also lost no time in making its attitude clear to the new administration in Washington.
The most important objective right now is to get the United States involved in the Kyoto process again.
The EU emphasises that the climate issue is an important part of the transatlantic relationship and calls upon the United States to make a constructive contribution to this process.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
I am satisfied with your answer and just hope that you will continue with your efforts to persuade the United States to join the Kyoto Protocol.
I just want to add that the issue of the Kyoto Protocol will naturally be an important subject during the discussions between the European Union and the United States which will take place on 14 June 2001 at the European Council' s Summit in Gothenburg.
The President of the Commission and the President of the European Council will then have the opportunity to emphasise directly to the US President the degree of importance we attach to this issue.
Question No 13 by (H-0353/01):
Subject: Remembrance of the Holocaust Following up the Swedish Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson's initiative in arranging the well-received Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust in January 2000, Parliament adopted a written declaration on 7 July 2000 on the remembrance of the Holocaust.
In that declaration, Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to strengthen their efforts to promote education, remembrance and research about the Holocaust, to encourage the study of the Holocaust in all its dimensions, to encourage appropriate forms of Holocaust remembrance, including an annual European Day of Holocaust Remembrance, and to take all the necessary steps to facilitate the opening of archives to ensure that all documents bearing on the Holocaust are available to researchers.
What action has the Council taken in response to Parliament's appeals?
Are there any current plans to introduce a joint European day or national days of Holocaust remembrance?
With regard to the issue of educating people about the Holocaust and raising their awareness of it, I would just remind Mr SacrÃ©deus of the answer which was given to a written question from Mr Colom i Naval in March 2000 and which I know that you too have had the opportunity to study.
On the issue of establishing an annual European Day of Holocaust Remembrance, the Council would simply point out that it has not received any practical proposals in this area.
Those Member States which are involved in the international working party to promote remembrance, education and research in connection with the Holocaust have followed the recommendations of the committee of government representatives and representatives of voluntary organisations, to the effect that annual days of Holocaust remembrance should be established on a unilateral and national basis.
This has happened in, for example, Germany, Sweden, Great Britain and Italy.
As from next year, Finland too will have such a national day.
The Council would emphasise that what history, including the Holocaust, can teach us is that it is necessary here and now actively to combat racism and xenophobia in all its forms.
In this context, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna will have an important role to play, especially when it comes to cross-border efforts.
It may also be noted that, on 28 May, the Council and representatives of Member State governments will adopt a declaration concerning the fight against racism and xenophobia on the Internet.
It is, unfortunately, a sad fact that new technology is exploited by anti-democratic forces.
As part of the further efforts being made to disseminate knowledge concerning the Holocaust so that it will be possible, for example, to draw conclusions about the ways in which contemporary intolerance is to be combated, an international conference was held in January of this year in Stockholm on the very subject of the fight against intolerance.
Representatives from all the EU' s Member States, the Commission and the OSCE, together with the Secretary-General of the UN, met to discuss strategies for combating racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia.
Allow me also to conclude by saying that the Council really appreciates the European Parliament' s commitment in this area.
I would say a special thank-you to Mr SacrÃ©deus himself for his work on the important position adopted by Parliament in July of last year on this subject.
I would thank the Swedish Presidency and Mr Danielsson for their comprehensive answer and for their most generous concluding words.
The European Parliament' s decision following the written declaration in remembrance of the Holocaust - a direct follow-up to Prime Minister Persson' s initiative in arranging a conference in Stockholm on this subject in January 2000 - indicates that we should like to see the Member States establish national days of remembrance or, better still, a European Day of Remembrance.
I would point out that - as current President of the EU and, at the same time, the person who took the initiative to arrange this conference - Prime Minister Persson has a unique opportunity and a special authority for getting even more countries than those which Mr Danielsson has just mentioned to establish annual days of remembrance and perhaps to agree upon a common day of remembrance.
I welcome the work that is being done on combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
My practical follow-up question is this: is the Prime Minister prepared, during the time that remains of the Swedish Presidency, to bring to life - if only on an informal basis - the possibility of an annual day of remembrance of the Holocaust in different countries?
It is a very pressing issue that Mr SacrÃ©deus is addressing.
It has also been discussed in detail in the Council.
One conclusion drawn is that there are unfortunately many historical events of the 20th century in which atrocities have been carried out.
That applies, unfortunately, not only to the Holocaust which we have just been talking about but also to other events which there will be a desire to remember and use as a point of departure in the fight against intolerance and xenophobia.
We have therefore arrived at the view that it is probably most appropriate to let the issue of a national day of remembrance be purely a national issue and to inspire national authorities to take decisions to establish such days.
It might perhaps be better to refrain from recommending a specific day, for example 27 January, as a European day of remembrance.
There are so many other dates.
For example, there is Crystal Night, which is important to remember in many countries, and we have the days around the end of the war in 1945, which can also be important days to remember.
We therefore believe that the best course is to inspire national decisions rather than try to put forward proposals to be decided upon at European level.
Question No 14 by (H-0356/01):
Subject: Hake fishery: significant discrimination due to the greater reductions in sub-area VIII (Bay of Biscay) In December 2000, the EU Council of Ministers for Fisheries set the TACs and quotas for Northern hake for 2001 providing for a greater reduction in the allowable catch (45%) in sub-area VIII (Bay of Biscay) than in the more northern sub-areas (58.9%) without any justification based on scientific management advice, given that for the purposes of monitoring and scientific assessment, this resource has since the late 70s been considered to form a single stock which is not divided into regional components.
What criteria did the Council use to justify this distinction?
Given that there is no scientific evidence to show that the stock consists of different components rather than constituting a single fish population occupying a vast area of the sea, is the Council aware that the subjective political criteria used have resulted in significant discrimination against some fleets in the Community ?
Does it not consider that it should take this into account so that it can remedy the situation when setting the TACs for 2002?
I would first of all refer to the answer to Question No 280, given by the Council to the honourable Member during the part-session in April of this year, and also add the following.
In the light of scientific opinions from the ICES, recommending that lowest possible catches be adhered to and that a recovery plan be implemented for the stock in question, the Council has laid down the Total Allowable Catch for hake at 22 623 tonnes, compared with 42 090 tonnes during 2000.
The Commission had proposed a TAC of only 11 000 tonnes for 2001.
The Total Allowable Catch for hake is divided up into four administrative areas.
According to the scientific information to which the Commission had access, the situation regarding hake in Divisions VII a, b, d and e was worse than in the three more northerly areas, which is why a proportionately greater reduction in the TAC was made there.
Measures for 2002 must be taken in the light of the current discussion concerning a recovery plan for hake.
I cannot understand your reply. According to the information at my disposal, scientific studies consider northern hake to be a single stock.
I therefore have no idea as to the source of the data differentiating between the Bay of Biscay and elsewhere with regard to the situation or the reduction in stock.
Secondly, I should like to suggest to the President-in-Office of the Council that the Council should have taken socio-economic and commercial factors into account. As far as possible, it should have safeguarded the viability of hake fishing, insisting on strict compliance with the technical measures for fisheries management which the common fisheries policy has been unable to implement in recent years, despite the constant warnings issued by the bodies from which the scientific management council is drawn.
The distribution of quotas is based upon biological and scientific advice and not, therefore, upon socio-economic advice.
According to the scientifically based advice, the serious situation of the hake stock requires drastic measures to be taken.
Because there is clear scientific evidence that the hake stock is at present considerably over-fished, a number of measures have been proposed by the scientific advisers in this area.
These will, of course, have short-term socio-economic effects but, hopefully, also positive, long-term effects when it comes to the stock.
Question No 15 by (H-0357/01):
Subject: Chairman of the EU Military Committee The post of chairman of the Military Committee has been created within the structures of the Council of the EU.
Which institution will pay this official' s salary, how will it be determined, and is it intended to seek the European Parliament' s approval for the post and the appropriations necessary to pay for it?
The chairman of the European Union' s Military Committee is a part of the despatching Member State' s delegation, in the same way as the chairman of a committee or working party within the Council.
That also applies to chairmanships that do not go with the Presidency, such as the chairmanships of the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee for Economic Policy.
It is therefore up to the despatching Member State to determine and pay out the chairman' s salary.
The procedure for appointing the chairman of the European Union' s Military Committee does not require the European Parliament' s approval.
Thank you for your answer.
The matter is clear.
Have you forgotten, however, that you promised to send out information concerning the so-called wise men' s salaries in the Austria case?
That was something you promised last time.
Do you intend to send out that information?
I can assure the honourable Member that I have in any case signed the answer.
I hope that it is on its way.
Sometimes, it is an awfully long way between Stockholm and Strasbourg, but I can promise that the answer is on its way.
Let us hope that the problem will have been resolved by the next sitting, and that the Community letter will have arrived.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 16 and 17 will be taken together.
Question No 16 by (H-0359/01):
Subject: Association Agreement with Algeria and the situation of women Will the forthcoming Association Agreement between the EU and Algeria provide for any commitment to defend the human rights of women (including the right to education in rural areas) and to improve the status of women within the family?
What improvements are planned?
What assistance will the EU provide to ensure that the process of democratisation also reaches women?
Question No 17 by (H-0377/01):
Subject: Algeria It is now estimated that 200 000 people have been killed over the past ten years in Algeria.
These killings are continuing at a rate of about 200 a month.
Will the Swedish Presidency indicate what measures it has taken during its Presidency in support of an international independent inquiry into these killings and what initiatives it intends to pursue at UN level with a view to stopping the killings and the reported widespread use of torture?
Allow me first of all to point out that the negotiations for an Association Agreement between the European Union and Algeria are going according to plan but that a number of important issues remain to be resolved.
The negotiators meet almost every month with a view to concluding the negotiations this year.
Much has been achieved.
Algeria has already given its preliminary approval to the following human rights wording: 'Respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires the domestic and external policies of Algeria and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.'
This broad reference covers human rights for all human beings, irrespective of gender, as well as all areas of civil and political, as well as social, economic and cultural rights.
Another provision in the draft gives each of the contracting parties the right to take suitable measures if it considers that the other party has omitted to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement.
In the ongoing negotiations, agreement has also been reached concerning two important matters affecting the situation of women. Special emphasis is to be placed on giving the female section of the population access to education, including technical education, higher education and vocational education; and - within the framework of social cooperation - priority is to be given, through education and the media, to promoting women' s role in the process of economic and social development, concurrently with Algerian policy on the issue.
Concluding an Association Agreement will facilitate and institutionalise the political dialogue with Algeria, including on issues affecting human rights.
With regard to Mr Andrews' s question, the Council shares his concern about the murders which have taken place in Algeria over the last ten years.
Through the Swedish Foreign Minister, the Presidency addressed the issue at the meeting for political dialogue between the European Union and Algeria which took place in Algeria on 24 April.
We expressed our concern about disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture.
Moreover, a list of such cases was passed to the Algerian authorities, and we requested information about these cases.
The European Union has also expressed its concern along the same lines at the annual meeting with the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
Within the framework of MEDA' s technical and financial aid to Algeria, the EU supports a project for modernising the police force.
The programme includes training in respect for human rights in the course of police interventions. EUR 8.2 million have been set aside for this purpose.
The European Union is also providing aid to selected institutions with a view to strengthening civil society.
Once the Association Agreement with Algeria that I have just mentioned has been concluded, the political dialogue with Algeria will be institutionalised. We shall then have a framework within which we can express our concern about, and criticisms of, Algeria.
I am grateful for the reply given by the President-in-Office of the Council. However, his role is to some extent that of a messenger and he must know as well as I do that women' s rights will be disregarded unless there is an explicit reference to their recognition in the association agreement.
We are discussing a country where Algerian Berbers were killed as a result of police charges on 29 April of this year.
We are actually talking about an association agreement with that country.
I do not think that an explicit reference to the rights of women and Berbers is too much to ask. This association agreement should also provide for the respect of the civil, cultural and linguistic rights of Algerian Berbers.
Is the President-in-Office of the Council prepared to pass on this request?
As I stated in my answer, the general wording on human rights is included in the draft Association Agreement which is now on the table.
It is important that the General Declaration of Human Rights in the Association Agreement should cover not only women but also minorities.
You yourself mentioned the Berbers.
There are many other groups which also need to be mentioned.
As an example, I can assure you that, with this general wording as a basis, the Swedish Foreign Minister, who is a woman, made clear references to precisely this need to draw attention to the position of women in Algeria.
That is repeated the whole time in the dialogue with Algeria, and we shall be able to repeat it still more powerfully once we obtain an Association Agreement.
The Agreement will give us a framework which will make it possible to address all the problems related to human rights.
I believe we have precisely the same view of the necessity for improving the position of women in Algeria.
I also believe that we have precisely the same view on the need to ensure that Algeria does not only respect women' s rights, but all human rights.
Let us therefore work together in order to achieve this.
Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for a very comprehensive reply, and it seems to me that everything is going to be perfect after this Association Agreement is concluded.
I want to ask him: Does the Council intend to approve this Association Agreement if the appalling human rights abuses continue in Algeria?
It is all very well to have human rights agreements signed, but the reality is that no matter what efforts have been made in Algeria over the years by the Council and by the European Union, the situation, like in Turkey, has got worse instead of better.
I want to ask him: Is it the intention of the Council to agree to the final statement on the association agreement when it arises in October or November?
My own feeling is that every possible sanction should be imposed on the Algerian Government to ensure that human rights are respected for everyone: men, women and children.
I do not want to anticipate the Council' s final position on the Association Agreement, but I nonetheless think it is important to ask the question. Why does the European Union have such an instrument as an Association Agreement?
It is not, in any case, because an Association Agreement would give a government or a country some kind of carte blanche to do whatever it likes.
An Association Agreement exists because the European Union desires a framework, a form within which, for example, a political dialogue can be conducted - also concerning matters about which there is no agreement.
That is why we want Association Agreements.
The Council believes that this is a more effective instrument than just letting things happen.
As the case of Turkey shows, the Association Agreement is an effective instrument enabling the European Union to highlight and criticise states of affairs it does not accept.
Matters proceed slowly sometimes, and we can all feel frustrated but, in these contexts, dialogue is always more effective than isolation.
Question No 18 by (H-0366/01):
Subject: "Everything but arms" agreement What are the consequences for Community banana producers and traditional ACP suppliers of the recent "everything but arms" agreement to eliminate tariffs for the least developed countries?
This is an important issue that the honourable Member has addressed.
I shall therefore give a relatively long answer, in spite of the lateness of the hour.
As the honourable Member is aware, what is known as the 'Everything but arms' Regulation was adopted by the Council on 26 February 2001, when freedom from duty, without any quantitative restrictions, was extended to include all products, except for weapons and ammunition, originating in the world' s 49 least developed countries.
The Regulation came into force on 5 May 2001.
We think that this measure forms a significant contribution to the economic development of the least developed countries and that it is also concrete proof of the European Union' s political goodwill towards the developing countries in connection with the preparations for the next round of the WTO negotiations.
The Regulation was the result of intensive discussions in the Council, where full account was taken of the consequence analysis prepared by the Commission and of the Member States' need for assurances concerning the more detailed provisions for implementing the proposed system.
These assurances related not only to the Member States' interests, but also to the consequences of the proposal for those ACP states that are not among the least developed countries, as well as to the desire to guarantee that the least developed countries themselves, rather than third parties, benefit from the new system.
The doubts related mainly to three particularly sensitive products: bananas, rice and sugar.
The final text took account of these doubts, while the main principle, according to which the EU should adopt meaningful measures to improve the economic situation in the least developed countries, was maintained.
When it came to bananas, rice and sugar, implementation was therefore deferred until such time as agreement had been reached on the principle of access without duties and quotas.
Where bananas were concerned, complete liberalisation was postponed until 2006.
In the meantime, annual 20 per cent reductions in duty would be introduced as from January 2002.
In the light of the problems of infrastructure that would-be banana exporters in the least developed countries at present encounter, it is difficult at this stage to assess with certainty what direct effect the Regulation will have on the banana market.
As has been mentioned previously, adjustments have been made to the Regulation so that account might be taken of the misgivings experienced in this regard in the European Union and the banana-producing ACP countries that do not belong to the group of least developed countries.
Moreover, the Commission has undertaken to monitor the application of the Regulation in order to discover and deal with all the difficulties as soon as possible.
The Commission will investigate to what extent the least developed countries are benefiting from the Regulation, whether the available tools are sufficient for tackling - where justified - more serious disturbances in Community markets and when it is a question of bringing the adjustment mechanisms into play, especially for rice, sugar and bananas.
In the light of this investigation, the Commission will present a report in 2005 and table the necessary proposals.
As the honourable Member certainly knows, the Council is fully aware of its ACP partners' problems when it comes to the operation of the banana market and is doing its utmost to take account of these misgivings in all relevant initiatives.
In connection with the Cotonou Agreement, the EU acknowledged the overwhelming economic importance of exports to the EU for banana suppliers in the ACP countries and agreed, if need be, to take measures to guarantee the continued profitability of banana-exporting companies in the ACP countries and continued opportunities to sell their bananas in the EU market.
When the Council acts in order to meet the need to alter the organisation of the banana market so that it complies fully with the WTO' s rules, the attempt will therefore also be made to introduce guarantees to prevent ACP bananas from being excluded from the market.
On this point, I also want to mention the agreement in principle reached immediately before Easter between the Commission and the United States regarding the protracted dispute between the EU and the United States concerning the trade discipline for bananas.
In very general terms, those parts of the agreement concerning ACP suppliers are designed to protect the latter' s position by guaranteeing more reliable and more favourable conditions for the ACP states' access to the EU market.
Of special importance in this regard is the proposed introduction of a quota, exclusively reserved for ACP suppliers, and of an historic licence system which is seen to benefit the ACP suppliers more than the previous 'first come, first served' proposal.
In this connection, I would also remind you that, when, in 2006, the EC' s organisation of the market in bananas becomes a duties-only system, a reduced duty will, in any case, give the ACP states a relative advantage.
According to the Commission' s proposal, the Council will have to submit formal points of view regarding certain details of the agreement in principle with the United States.
Parliament' s views will, of course, be sought regarding each possible change to the Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas.
Finally, I would remind you of the Council Regulation establishing, from 1 January 1999, a special aid scheme for ACP states that are traditional banana suppliers.
This system offers technical and financial aid to help ACP suppliers adjust to new market conditions and increase their competitiveness, at the same time as encouraging environmentally more friendly production and marketing methods.
The financial and technical aid supplied in accordance with this Regulation amounted to almost EUR 45 million in 2000.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his detailed reply. However, I would like to ask him whether as from 1 January 2006, pursuant to the new banana regime, the only protection offered to Community banana producers and ACP countries which are also included will be the tariff.
The Community has just given up the tariff.
Consequently, no protection of this sort will be available after 1 January 2006.
I anticipate that the beneficiaries of this measure will be the large multinationals.
If I were in charge of a multinational company, I would relocate the plantations from Central America, Ecuador or any other country to one of those least developed countries. The reason would be that thanks to this agreement I would be assured that as from 1 January 2006 there would be no restriction on the import of bananas.
My question to the President-in-Office of the Council concerns whether consideration has been given to the implications of all this both for Community producers, some of whom live in very underdeveloped areas of the Community, and for producers in other ACP countries who do not enjoy a particularly high standard of living either.
As I mentioned, the Commission has carried out a consequence analysis of the effects on the Community' s own banana production.
The Commission' s assessment is that there will be minimal consequences in the medium term.
The honourable Member also indicates other possible measures that multinational companies can take on the basis of these changed rules.
It is precisely in order to be able to counter such measures that the Commission will be reporting - next time in 2005.
I assume that there will subsequently be continuous monitoring by the Commission so that this new organisation of the market in bananas is not abused.
I am convinced that, with its usual diligence and promptness, the Commission will see to it that this new scheme, whose main aim is to benefit the least developed countries, is not abused.
Thank you for being so very helpful this afternoon, Mr Danielsson.
We shall now invoke the Rules of Procedure.
Questions Nos 19 and 20 lapse because the Middle East has already been referred to in the statement made this morning by the Commission and the Council.
Questions Nos 21 and 22 have been withdrawn.
As the time allocated to Question Time to the Council has now elapsed, Questions Nos 23 to 44 will receive written replies.
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Aid scheme for olive oil
The next item is the combined debate on the following reports:
(A5-0137/2001) by Mr JovÃ© Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulations No 136/66/EEC and (EC) No 1638/98 as regards the extension of the period of validity of the aid scheme and the quality strategy for olive oil [COM(2000) 855 - C5-0026/2001 - 2000/0358(CNS)];
(A5-0114/2001) by Mr Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the European Court of Auditors' Special Report 11/2000 on the support scheme for olive oil, accompanied by the Commission' s replies [C5-0009/2001 - 2001/2001(COS)].
Mr President, it is now two years since the COM in olive oil was last reviewed.
Hoping to receive more and better information on the actual situation in the sector, the Commission has postponed the final review for two years. It has presented a proposal with a bearing on quality aspects and market actions.
Although the proposal' s aim is commendable, it does have a number of shortcomings concerning three issues: the market situation, checks, and the marketing of blended oil.
Public intervention purchases were done away with in the 1998 reform, against Parliament' s wishes.
This decision was taken even though their average cost was the lowest in existence.
As a result, market prices have fallen dramatically and the producers' income has dropped.
This matter is not part of the Commission' s proposal, but that does not justify turning a blind eye to the consequences of the last revision.
